dr monsey sir understanding that you have been a singular friend to mr tailor junr in recommending him to several patients and in particular that you are acquainted with his having had the honor to attend his grace the duke of ancaster and also of his having performed a remarkable cure on one of his graces family i am induced to take the freedom of begging your confirmation thereof i have been also informed that you saw the boy of ightham of whom there will be a short treatise speedily published and if you made any remarks upon him which you think may be serviceable to the public i should be very proud of such communication thereof as may illustrate and also confirm the same which will be looked upon as a great honor conferred upon  sir your obedient humble servant wm oldys sept  0    0  to mr oldys sir that i have been a friend to mr tailor jun i am very ready to own and wish my friendship could have been of more service than i fear it has been because i think he deserves it and i shall be glad to give him all the assistance in my power for the future  i can attest the truth not only of his having performed a very remarkable cure on one of his grace the duke of ancasters family but that he also had the honor of being twice sent for from town by the duke himself to his graces seat at grimesthorpe in lincolnshire where he attended his grace under a violent inflammation in his eyes which mr tailor treated with all due care and judgment till he effected a complete recovery  the principal observation i made upon the ightham boy was his confirming the phoenomenon in vision of objects being painted inverted upon the retina for when a pin was held upright before him he constantly directed his finger to the head instead of the point and so vice versa how the mind turns it afterward is a question of another kind and very hard to be resolved  i have been a witness to several other very deplorable cases in which he has given surprising relief and if it were proper i could name some other persons of the highest rank and quality to whom he has given the fullest satisfaction  i have but one thing more to add which is that my worthy friend mr chiselden in his lifetime gave this man all the encouragement in his power and for this good reason because as he told me he very well deserved it which i think too or else i had saved you and myself the trouble of this answer  i am sir your obliged though unknown humble servant m monsey chelsea hospital sept  0       to dr monsey physician to the royal hospital at chelsea sir as great weights may hang upon small lines we know not to what extensive benefit the within proposed foundation of an hospital for the blind may arrive since the constitution of such a necessary and desirable charity has already been so generously patronized by his grace the duke of ancaster and the right honorable the earl of godolphin besides other noble and publickspirited persons of rank and distinction who have also signified their favorable disposition as well to establish and maintain the same as to appropriate some reasonable salary for the encouragement of his deserts who first offered this laudable scheme thereof and his attendance upon the patients to be admitted therein  indeed merit is a plant not always of such a hardy and independent nature as will rise to any eminent head of its own strength and spread itself forth or flourish to the notice and fructify to the advantage of mankind without some assistance on the contrary we see virtue often like the vine apt to droop with the weight of its own vigorous fertility and even to trail or creep only along the ground till it withers and consumes away or is trampled on and crushed under foot without some friendly and fostering hand to rear conduct and display it to the cherishing beams of the sun then will it produce its fruits to maturity in abundance and adorn its supporters with many a generous cluster  upon these considerations it is with the greatest satisfaction that i perceive in your courteous answer to my letter annexed how cordially you have by your benevolent recommendations promoted the practice and interest of mr tailor who first proposed the foundation of the hospital aforesaid and among the many other distempers of the eyes by him relieved performed the remarkable cure that is the subject of the following discourse which i beg leave to offer the public under the shelter and protection of your name had you been in town i would have personally entreated the favor of this liberty as a further proof of your friendship to the performer of that cure and of its great influence if it should extenuate the imperfections in this representation of it but as the impression is so nearly finished i hope you will pardon the presumption of this address as also that of publishing my letter to you with your answer since others may be confirmed thereby in the contents of it no less than  sir your obliged humble servant wm oldys   observations on the cure of william tailor the blind boy of ightham since our merciful creator has condescended to render himself more visible in his operations than his essence what an invaluable blessing ought we to esteem it that he has assisted our reason with such an admirable sense as that of sight through such curious organs as the eyes whereby we may every moment confirm ourselves in the omnipotence and eternity of his being by the continual wonders of his works whereby all those who rationally behold the miracles of his creation must be illuminated in their souls with those attributes of their creator though these luminaries of the body  and as it is a satisfaction unexpressible in minds divinely exalted to enjoy those ocular confirmations what miserable darkness must it be to be deprived of them but to what strait what narrow limits must their knowledge and ideas be contracted who have been led about in this state of obscurity from the time of their birth for the whole night of their lives what a comfortless condition to think that all places and things are to them alike dismal and the whole universe itself but a dungeon but on the other hand to consider what a feast of felicities must be spread before them in having such loss repaired such want supplied and that inestimable benefit of sight from which the eyes of the blind had been by natural defects diseases or accidents so long debarred suddenly by the skilful hand of their fellow creature bestowed upon them when he draws the curtain of darkness from before them and opens at once as it were a new creation of images and objects in moving and still life at once a most spacious and opulent prospect of all varieties on every side in this lower world and innumerable worlds themselves glittering in the vast expance above for all which serviceable delightful glorious and mavelous scenes to be made partaker what reward what recompense can be adequate and yet of so much happiness how long will some remain unpossessd because their penurious and enthralled souls cannot give them liberty to make any reasonable return of gratitude but will rather constrain them to continue moping on in perpetual pain or darkness than let them bestow any thing for the enjoyment of their sight some again are deterred from seeking any redress through a prejudice raised by ignorance against it under the distasteful notion of trying practices and dabbling or tampering with their eyes so through their diffident obstinate or indolent delay in admitting timely and proper applications to disperse or assuage their disorder at the beginning of its first and unsettled invasion or encroachment upon them submit to as what could not be prevented the daily depravation of their sight or perhaps at last permit themselves to be quite blinded even by those very ignorant people who dissuaded them from attempting to be restored by such as have the greatest skill and are best qualified to relieve them and lastly how long will others refrain from applying for such relief through the fear of some little short or sudden smart which the diseased organ may endure in the recovery so let their maladies grow stronger and more stubborn as the organ itself its spirits humors or muscles grow weaker and more decayed or corrupted till by inflammations and other dangerous consequencies they become incureable when the lightest brushing over the eye with the corner of an handkerchief a little dust a pinch of snuff blown into it or the bare washing it with any strong liquor no less than the more violent wounds blows and distempers which blind it shall often be more painful than the operations by which the gentle and careful hand of an experienced oculist restores it to sight  when we read among the many volumes which have been written upon the eyes that there are above two hundred and forty diseases with their complications to which they and their relative parts are incident we cannot but perceive there are room and business enough for several ingenious men to make this beautiful orb minute as it is with the preservation or restoration of its most precious sense their sole study and practice and as it may be employment enough to devote their whole time to it so there ought to be encouragement enough in these as in france and other countries to engage them assiduously in the attainment of a successful proficiency therein if many from the meanest excrescences by keeping our hair our corns and nails in due and convenient retrenchment have established very comfortable ocupations and cut themselves out very decent livelyhoods independent of physic surgery anatomy or pharmacy for the ease chiefly of our feet how much more deserve they who besides the merit of being acquainted with the nobler more considerable and important objects of their practice can by the knowledge and aid also of those sciences joined with their own experience preserve or recover our sight by which those very feet are guided and we are assisted to exercise them if many hospitals and infirmaries have been charitably erected and endowed for the lame why none for the blind since the blind may be as well lame as they incapable as they are of using their arms or legs to any effect or as unable to walk without a leader as a cripple without a crutch and since the cure of the blind requires longer experience deeper penetration into the nature of its object and more delicate operations than the lame  it is less difficult to attain a superficial knowledge of the disorders that affect the body of man in general than a profound knowledge of those which distress some parts in particular whereof the eye is the chief complicated as it is of such fine solid as well as subtle and spiritous matter consisting of such various compositions such different substances teguments films fluids muscles nerves veins and fibers such an elementary labyrinth of concordant parts mutually reflecting all images to the organ of sight and all in such close compact and circular confines yet is it also of such a refined frame and texture of such a tender and sensible nature that it is subject to numerous defects distempers and disasters which often lie so intricately involved or internally concealed as to be even undiscernable to ordinary inspection and sometimes almost inaccessible to proper applications for its relief without creating disorders greater than are attempted to be cured upon the mature consideration hereof we may well agree with that learned and ingenious gentleman who has observed that those defects and diseases so numerous are more than sufficient to employ the whole study and attention of any one person be his abilities ever so great or his knowledge ever so extensive hence it is that patients commonly meet with such bad success from their application to gentlemen whose judgment and skill in other parts of the human body may indeed be unexceptionable but whose practice is too general to permit them to make any considerable improvement in the knowledge of this one organ the structure of which is so delicate and its parts so exquisitely fine and minute that it will hardly bear any mistakes in the treatment of its diseases since the first false step in these cases is always of dangerous and very often of fatal consequence  but there are other difficulties and disadvantages which are apt to divert or deter a student from practicing with success upon this most necessary comprehensive and elegant organ for besides that the transition of studies and experiments from one ailing part of the body to another external and internal as well for healing as restoring of health is more engaging to the curiosity of a practitioner through the diversity of objects and operations than a constant and confined attachment to any one organ of sense that contains a greater variety in a more contracted compass and requires methods of treatment more nice and curious dexterous and difficult there is this further discouragement attending the said more particular attachment to the relief of this or any other sense that as there are fewer patients and more indigent objects there is less prospect of profit from professing to restore only one little part how useful or important soever of the human frame than those usually meet with who promise and undertake to cure all diseases in every part of every body  these among other reasons render our obligations the greater to those few who have so circumscribed their experience and so confined themselves to this distinct and more unbeaten path as to acquire the most acurate skill and expertness in the said more difficult and less advantageous branch of the practice which therefore so much more deserves the encouragement of the public as the patients are more unfrequent and dispersed less acquainted where they may repair for assistance and less able to recompense in any proportion of their own single substance or abilities the whole application time and attendance of an expert oculist in his more private situation that this is a very seasonable and promising juncture to solicit such a needful benefaction may be presumed in that there have been so many others of late years established which flourish with success and however laudable are not more necessary therefore it is to be hoped that charity will remain no longer liable to the suspicion of being any ways defective in her own eyes by overlooking the most effectual means of relief to those which are blind those whose most wretched lives are lingering on in the most helpless destitute and deplorable condition of darkness beggary and want but that she will also stretch her hands no less extensively forth as to many others so to these most unhappy objects of compassion who have hitherto so much escaped the bountiful and unanimous contributions of her gracious and generous votaries the imperfections however of whose good designs in the foundations they have encouraged are not as a judicious author has lately observed more glaring in any instance than in that great number we continually meet with of poor people who are either totally blind or else labor under such diseases in the eyes as for want of proper assistance from such whose whole study and practice are confined to this one organ do notwithstanding general application still continue in a state of misery and must ever remain unless relieved by those who are willing to encourage and promote their recovery by commending them to such particular practitioners who are most likely to effect it wherefore we are assured as the same author continues it is with this consideration that several persons of quality and distinction have agreed to contribute to the relief of such unhappy sufferers by a generous subscription whereby they who labor under any ocular disorder may without the least expense have the assistance of mr john tailor jun oculist in hatton garden and be supplied with every thing needful to their cure though their cases require ever so much time and attendance and their circumstances are too narrow to support the expense that would otherwise necessarily attend cures of this nature  under this gentleman then and such other cooperators as shall be appointed with competent salaries we may hence hope to see the beneficent foundation here proposed effectually pursued and brought to an honorable conclusion by a number of such noble and generous subscribers as in consequence of the worthy examples begun will procure a patent for the same and elect such governors to form the plan proportion the expense and provide such commodious habitation or settled place of abode that besides even those of better rank a number of neglected and forlorn patients also who are now led about half naked and starving as vagabonds may know where to apply themselves and meet with the soundest advice most sovereign medicines and other administrations or such further humane provision tendance and assistance as may be found requisite for their being admitted either within doors or supplied with all proper means of redress without as the nature of their conditions circumstances and cases or the extent of the charity will admit under such patronage we hope to see such a benefaction established which has been so hopefully proposed by mr tailor who has already toward bringing the same to perfection met with the encouragement of some noble persons for his knowledge and success in ocular diseases as having had five years education in france been regularly trained under the great practice of his father and also had experience of his own for nine years successively in london among his many extraordinary cures that which he performed the last year upon william tailor the blind boy of ightham in kent being not the least memorable or worthy of observation i shall here so far as good vouchers will authorize be somewhat particular thereon  as there was no prospect of procuring this boy any relief that might restore him to his sight in the country where he lived he was recommended to the care of the said mr john tailor the younger at london who soon found him so lively and active that he would not suffer his eyes to be even examined without much struggling but after some serious and affecting expostulations with him after the strongest assurances given him that if he did not patiently comply with the only means that were to be used for his cure he would be deprived of all ways to get his livelihood must be a beggarboy in want of clothes and victuals and be led about to seek his bread from door to door like such a one of whom he had heard and have nothing to depend upon but the cold scanty and precarious relief of an hardhearted world he thereupon consented to undergo any trial that should be made upon him at his fathers house in the country accordingly the oculist went thither but being apprehensive that his patient would not lie so still on the table as such a tender and steady operation of his hand required he told him that he must be tied fast down from stirring or winching but he as he could see no danger felt no fear therefore absolutely promised he would without any constraint lie unmoved which he did with his hands in his pockets till the obstruction in his right eye was in little more than a minute entirely removed without the least starting or complaint as soon as the inside of his eye was cleared of its little thick white cloudy spot by that delicate depression of it with the needle which is called couching so that it quite subsided and did no longer intercept the light or admission of objects to the organs of vision he being asked by some of the company for there were sixteen of his neighbors present what he saw answered with a kind of wild transport and wonder at the strange shapes forms and colors of many things so incomprehensible about him that he beheld the room full of lights and moons for as i understand his eyes were not so totally darkned by the cataracts but that he had some faint discernment or glimmering sensation of luminous bodies admitted round the pupil as in the most ordinary eclipses of the sun the moons disk does not so entirely overshadow and obscure it but that some edgings of its light will irradiate or break out at its sides or circumference the like of which might help the boy to describe some shining utensils he now saw by those names for next time upon the dressing of his eye he declared as it is attested in a letter of his fathers that he saw the pewter on the shelf with the clock and its case that all these things the boy knew before by feeling and i dare say adds he that now he can see the abovementioned things  these are his fathers words and they have been construed to signify that the boy distinctly named those several pieces of furniture upon his first beholding them from the knowledge he before had by feeling them without having felt them again after the use of his sight but such a familiar acquaintance instantly with objects never before seen how frequently so ever before felt has been much disputed by some oculists and opticians who have deeply considered the properties and powers of sight so long kept an utter stranger to those objects indeed the clock might be discoverable to him by the help of his hearing as from the vibrations of its pendulum striking and other sounds but the dishes plates shelves and other things though perhaps often handled could as it is thought scarcely be named upon the first sight only of them at least without feeling again and a better knowledge of those parts and places in the room where he might before feel them than he could receive in his state of blindness or retain and refer to at first sight  however there is an ingenious author the reverend mr edward sing the same i take it who was the late archbishop of tuam in ireland who has argued that the images of things shall be so well known to the sense of seeing how newly soever brought to use only by the ideas conceived of them through the sense of feeling that the patient shall be able instantly to know and name them without feeling them any more to inform or confirm his sight his arguments are drawn from a problem that was sent by mr william molyneux to mr lock who has honored it with a place in his essay on human understanding page     the case stands thus in the said mr synges letter to dr quayl vide the familliar letters between mr lock and several of his friends  vo   0  p      a man born perfectly blind has a globe and a cube given into his hands and instructed as much as he is capable of in the notion of each of these figures and the difference between them let us now suppose this man to be suddenly endowed with the sense of seeing and the question is whether the globe and the cube being placed before his eyes he would be able by his sight alone and without touching them to tell which was the globe and which the cube then one of his arguments is   if immediately upon the sight of the globe and the cube there be grounds enough for such a person clearly to perceive the agreement and the difference between his preconcived ideas and newly conceived images of those figures then may he be able to know which is the globe and which the cube without touching them again after he has seen them for the agreement which he may find between his idea and his image of a globe and the difference of the idea of a globe from the image of a cube et sic vice versa will be a sufficient direction if as he repeats again there be a sufficient ground immediately to perceive the said agreement and difference so without clearing this doubt which he has twice suggested he concludes such distinction may be made by sight alone and the patient be thereby rendered able to know and name one object from the other but mr molyneux in a letter of his to mr lock wherein he incloses that of mr sing tells him you will find thereby that what i say of its puzling some ingenious men is true and you will easily discover by what false steps this gentleman is led into his error idem p      and in another letter before to mr lock wherein mr molyneux first states this problem he assures him that he had proposed it to diverse ingenious men and could hardly ever meet with one that at first dash would give me the answer to it which i think true till by hearing my reasons they were convinced then having delivered the problem to the sense above repeated with the question whether by his sight before he touched them he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe which the cube he answers himself in the negative and gives his own reason in these words for though he has obtained the experience how a globe how a cube affects his touch yet he has not yet attained the experience that what affects my touch so or so must affect my sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that pressed his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube ibid p         it may be considered whether this opinion upon that problem might not receive some further confirmation from the mistake of a certain blind man who as it is reported upon his being first brought to sight could not distinguish by that sense a plain superficies from a prominent body or the figures of men painted in colors all even upon a canvas or wainscot picture from those of living persons but was greatly surpised at his disappointment that he could not find those figures as men by feeling no less than he though he had found them such by his sight and being told they were only the artificial imitations of men in their size shapes and proportions by the welldisposed lights and shades of colors he asked why then which of the two is the lying sense he meant the deceived sense not yet having had the experience of knowing the proverb that seeing is believing but feeling the truth and it may still be further considered whether external objects when rendered visible by the cure of a blind person may not contradict or at least confound the internal conceptions he had of them before he could see and whether they may not to the eye which is first brought to the sight of them become thereby rather less known more incomprehensible and confusing through the vast variety of their new and strange forms dimensions and complexions without any assistance from any other sense and consequently less able to be named than some of them might have been by the intelligence of some other sense during the former privation of sight therefore the boy of ightham as he discovered much consternation upon the first sight of the various objects about him might if he felt not the things mentioned in his fathers letter above cited before he named them have them inadvertently named to him in the very questions that were put to him whether he saw them as thus  what do you see can you see the pewter dishes here on this shelf the plates on that the clock there its case glass etc the enquirer pointing to the places where they stood and the boy might answer yes name those several things as he heard them named and saw them and also point out the places where they stood as he had been led the way which may be a truer interpretation of his fathers words that he declared he saw the pewter on the shelf etc than that he first named the pewter and other things himself as soon as he first saw them  this being presumed the case it may render his nomination of those things accountable and clear him from the objection that was made to the beggar of st albans who pretending to have been miraculously endowed with perfect sight though blind from his birth upon offering up his prayers at the shrine of that saint was brought before the sagacious duke humphrey and asked by him of what colors the gowns of several persons present and other things were that were pointed out to him which he naming truly was justly as an impostor sent to the stocks for he could no more know the names of all colors by barely once seeing them than he could those of all the men present only at first sight as sir thomas more has very judiciously observed in his dialogue on the worship of images and relics praying to saints etc from whence shakespeare has brought the story of the said impostor under the name of simcox upon the stage in one part of his play of king henry vi  indeed had that beggar while he was blind if he was ever so been taught to name the colors of things with the things themselves he might after he was brought to sight upon having those things produced and named to him name by the help of his memory the colors also whose names had been combined with or annexed to them and from thence likewise the same colors in different things for example had he heard in the state of blindness some things called bloodred others skyblue or grassgreen some coalblack and others milkwhite he probably when he was brought to the sense of seeing upon being showed some milk and told its name and asked what else it was called would answer it was white though the meaning of the word he could not explain but being told it was its color which distinguished it from others to the eye and from thence being referred to a piece of clean linen or some white paper he would say it was of the same color and so of the rest otherwise for a man to name all colors which he had never before seen is a greater miracle than that of being brought to the sight of them only by the intercession here in that cure at the shrine of st alban pretended but to return  at the next opening of the boys eye the persons attending to dress it said it appeared very clear and then besides the things within doors he took notice of the barn and other outhouses and in the letter of his fathers aforesaid i find it attested that he had never felt any pain since the first operation a few days after he was set before a lookingglass and was greatly delighted with the little man he saw in it whom he would have to be his own man because he so obediently imitated or repeated all the motions and gestures which he made with his head mouth and hands but said he would not close his eyes till he himself did first and whenever he went abroad he wanted and asked for his little man to go along with him it is in this view or prospect of that surprising and agreeable figure that his sculpture was preferred to be represented with an oval glass in his hand by that ingenious artist mr thomas worlige who lately published a print of him which he has etchd upon copper in a small octavo size but to many other images he could not so soon reconcile himself for when he saw any large utensil piece of furniture or apparel that stood or lay near him he discovered himself so perplexed to go forward that he would not stir till he was told what it was how far off and how to avoid or pass by it herein agreeing exactly with the behavior of the blind youth of newington when he was first brought to sight by mr grant in the latter part of queen annes reign as the ingenious author of the tatler among other curious circumstances has remarked vol  d edit      p     where we are informed that when he offered to move he seemed afraid of every thing around him yet one evening this young patient of ightham then residing for some time at mr taylors in hatton garden stole up to the top of the house and clamberd out at window along the leaden gutter without any apprehension of danger but being discovered brought down and asked what induced him to hazard his life if by a slip of his foot he had tumbled to the ground he replied that he only went thither to catch the moon when i saw him some weeks after he had received this new sense i observed the eye which was brought to light was in all due motion and symetry very clear lively and brisk but it seemed more infantine or as if it belonged to a body younger than one even of his years not looking methought so strong bold and ample in the pupil as if it had been longer exercised in the reception of various objects he is a lad of a pleasant aspect fair complexion with features soft and agreeable also of a sprightly and cheerful temper and has a quick or ready ear for music insomuch that to several tunes played before him on the german flute he would join in concert with his hands by drumming them over at the same time upon the table  whether he was as yet but shortsighted through the want of some transparent humor in the room of that which was depressed or he only appeared so through his ignorance of the proper space at which he might distinguish his objects i will not decide but it was remarked that when some money was laid on the table gold silver and copper and he was bid to take up a guinea or a shilling he would look as it were first for the table then upon several parts of it before he found where the money lay and when he perceived it by holding his head down very near it he would offer to snatch at the piece he aimed at two or three times before he could reach it because he could have no notion of distances which made him before so little afraid of being at the top of the house and think from thence of catching the moon  it is credibly attested that the ingenious mr king who reads lectures upon optics and other parts of philosophy has asserted that all objects to a person who is first brought from blindness to sight do appear inverted and that he confirmed himself in the same opinion by some experiments which he made upon this boy who having a pin held up before him of which he had been taught to distinguish the point from the head and being bid to touch the head he laid his finger upon the point of it the same mistake he committed in three several attempts upon which the gentleman who made the experiments smiled and said he knew it would be so those who have seemed unwilling this mistake should be ascribed to the objects appearing to the boy inverted are not satisfied belike in some doubts as first whether the boys mistake was not owing in this trial no less to his ignorance of situations as to higher and lower or right and left than it was in others before to his ignorance in the distances of things further or nearer and secondly they thought it very extraordinary that the eye framed and intended by nature most exactly and constantly to reflect and report the true unperverted positions of objects should as in submission to one of her most capricious operations be at first so unnaturally disposed as to behold those objects in the most false unfaithful and preposterous positions and yet so change to the utmost extreme as to reverse rather than ratify the habit by further practice of the same organs in the same manner upon the same objects so that those things which appeared to the same eye one while upside down shall appear at other times or at all times after upright and on their proper basis whether such appearances of objects in the reverse might be owing to any insufficiency in one of the humors upon the vacancy made by the removal of the opaque and phlegmatic obstruction whether to some irregularity some indisposition in the retina or in any other mediums to the sensory in the brain which were not yet settled in their due place or proportion by exercise and experience in proper distances for a true reflection of objects we need not here so much consider as whether some light into the cause might not be reflected from the usual experiments with an ordinary unequal glass which being held to any characters or images near at hand shall only magnify but not reverse them and yet the same glass held almost at arms length toward those objects at a further distance shall both diminish and turn them all topsyturvy  so that to see things first in this manner how much soever it may have of truth or fact in it and therefore may be less rare and uncommon yet is it no less remarkable in this boy and all in his case to have been endowed with that faculty really which was long since observed apparently in another boy mentioned by old dr william bulleyn in his dialogue of the pestilence  0      fol    b  who tells us he had two sights in one eye and if such the property be or objects do after that manner appear inverted at their first admission to the so long obstructed organ of sight it may possibly illustrate the blind mans similitude in the gospel who being brought to the use of that sense and asked if he could see any thing answered that he saw men like trees walking mark viii    for however he knew the trees at first sight enough to name them men reversed or standing upon their heads with their arms and legs as it were branching uppermost are more like trees and in that supposed posture have oftener of old been compared to them than when they stand upon their feet and what makes it more credible that this man was at first confused with the sight of those men in such perverted attitudes is that in the very next verse it is said after he had been touched again by the same allhealing hand that he was restored and saw every man clearly that is distinctly and perfectly in his real and proper posture  other and more remarkable observations might perhaps have been made had any thoughts of preserving and recommending them to public application or intelligence been designed at the first bringing of this boy to sight and several philosophical elucidations in the doctrine of vision might also perhaps be further made from the particulars above were it necessary or convenient to be more extensive and circumstantial in this place thereon  to mr john tailor junior by mr
