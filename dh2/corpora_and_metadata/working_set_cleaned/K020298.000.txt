well  i am determined to lead the gayest life in nature if she marries clerimont  i will have a new equipage that is one thing  and i will have greater routs than her that is another  positively i must outshine her there  and i will keep up a polite enmity with her  go and see her may be once or twice in a winter  maam i am really so hurried with such a number of acquaintances that i cannot possibly find time  and then to provoke her i wish you joy sister i hear you are breeding  ha ha  that will so mortify her  i wish it may be a boy sister  ha ha  and then when her husband begins to despise her really sister i pity you  had you taken my advice and married the india captain  your case is a compassionate one  compassion is so insolent when a body feels none at all  ha ha  it is the finest way of insulting    enter mr harlow mr harlow so my dear how are my sisters affairs going on   mrs harlow why my dear she has had another letter from mr clerimont  did you ever hear of such an odd unaccountable thing patched up in a hurry here   mr harlow why it is sudden to be sure    mrs harlow upon my word i think you had better advise her not to break off with captain cape    mr harlow no  not i  i wish she may be married to one or other of them  for her temper is really grown so very sour and there is such eternal wrangling between ye both that i wish to see her in her own house for the peace and quiet of mine   mrs harlow do you know this mr clerimont   mr harlow no but i have heard of the family  there is a very fine fortune  i wish he may hold his intention   mrs harlow why i doubt it vastly    mr harlow and truly so do i  for between ourselves i see no charms in my sister    mrs harlow for my part i cannot comprehend it  how she could strike his fancy is to me the most astonishing thing  after this i shall be surprised at nothing    mr harlow well strange things do happen  so she is but married out of the way i am satisfied  an old maid in a house is the devil    enter a servant servant mr clerimont sir to wait on you    mr harlow show him in exit servant  how comes this visit pray    mrs harlow my sister wrote to him to explain himself to you  well it is mighty odd  but i will leave you to yourselves the man must be an idiot to think of her   aside and exit enter mr clerimont mr harlow sir i am glad to have this pleasure   clerimont i presume sir you are no stranger to the business that occasions this visit   mr harlow sir the honor you do me and my family    clerimont oh sir to be allied to your family by so tender a tie as a marriage with your sister will at once reflect a credit upon me and conduce to my happiness in the most essential point  the lady charmed me at the very first sight   mr harlow aside the devil she did   clerimont the sensibility of her countenance the elegance of her figure the sweetness of her manner    mr harlow sir you are pleased to  compliment   clerimont compliment  not in the least sir    mr harlow the sweetness of my sisters manner aside ha ha   clerimont the first time i saw her was a few nights ago at ranelagh  though there was a crowd of beauties in the room thronging and pressing all around yet she shone amongst them all with superior luster  she was walking arm in arm with another lady  no opportunity offered for me to form an acquaintance amidst the hurry and bustle of the place but i enquired their names as they were going into their chariot  and learned they were mrs and miss harlow from that moment she won my heart and at one glance i became the willing captive of her beauty    mr harlow a very candid declaration sir  how can this be the bloom has been off the peach any time these fifteen years to my knowledge  aside  you see my sister with a favorable eye sir   clerimont a favorable eye  he must greatly want discernment who has not a quick perception of her merit   mr harlow you do her a great deal of honor  but this affair  is it not somewhat sudden sir    clerimont i grant it  you may indeed be surprised at it sir nor should i have been hardy enough to make any overtures to you  at least yet a while  if she herself had not condescended to listen to my passion and authorized me under her own fair hand to apply to her brother for his consent    mr harlow i shall be very ready sir to give my approbation to my sisters happiness    clerimont no doubt you will  but let me not cherish an unavailing flame a flame that already lights up all my tenderest passions   mr harlow to you sir there can be no exception  i am not altogether a stranger to your family and fortune  his language is warm considering my sisters age  but i will not hurt her preferment  aside  you will pardon me sir one thing  you are very young    clerimont sir  i am almost three and twenty   mr harlow but have you consulted your friends   clerimont i have  my uncle mr heartwell who proposes to leave me a very handsome addition to my fortune which is considerable already  he sir    mr harlow well sir if he has no objection i can have none    clerimont he has none sir he has given his consent he desires me to lose no time  i will bring him to pay you a visit  he rejoices in my choice  you shall have it out of his own mouth  name your hour and he shall attend you    mr harlow any time today  i shall stay at home on purpose    clerimont in the evening i will conduct him hither  in the mean time i feel an attachment here  the lady sir    mr harlow oh you want to see my sister  i will send her to you sir this instant  i beg your pardon for leaving you alone  ha ha  who could have thought of her making a conquest at last   exit clerimont alone sir your most obedient  now clerimont now your heart may rest content  your doubts and fears may all subside and joy and rapture take their place  miss harlow shall be mine  she receives my vows she approves my passion  sings and dances soft here she comes  her very appearance controuls my wildest hopes and hushes my proud heart into respect and silent admiration    enter mrs harlow mrs harlow sir your servant    clerimont madam  bows respectfully mrs harlow i thought mr harlow was here sir   clerimont madam he is but just gone  how a single glance of her eye overawes me  aside mrs harlow i wonder he would leave you alone sir  that is not so polite in his own house    clerimont how her modesty throws a veil over her inclinations  my tongue faulters  i cannot speak to her   aside mrs harlow he seems in confusion  a pretty man too  that this should be my sisters luck    aside clerimont madam    embarrassed mrs harlow i imagine you have been talking to him on the subject of the letter you sent this morning    clerimont madam i have presumed to    mrs harlow well sir and he has no objection i hope    clerimont she hopes heavens bless her for the word  aside  madam he has frankly consented if his sister will do me that honor    mrs harlow for his sister i think i may venture to answer sir    clerimont generous generous creature   mrs harlow you are sure sir of miss harlows admiration and the whole family hold themselves much obliged to you    clerimont madam this extreme condescension has added rapture to the sentiments i felt before and it shall be the endeavor of my life to prove deserving of the amiable object i have dared to aspire to    mrs harlow sir i make no doubt of your sincerity  i have already declared my sentiments  you know mr harlows  and if my sister is willing  nothing will be wanting to conclude this business  if no difficulties arise from her  for her temper is uncertain  as to my consent sir your air your manner have commanded it  sir your most obedient  i will send my sister to you    exit clerimont madam bowing i shall endeavor to repay this goodness with excess of gratitude  oh she is an angel  and yet stupid that i am i could not give vent to the tenderness i have within  it is ever so with sincere and generous love it fills the heart with rapture and then denies the power of uttering what we so exquisitely feel  generous miss harlow who could thus see through my confusion interpret all appearances favorably and with a dignity superior to her sexs little arts forego the idle ceremonies of coquetting teazing and tormenting her admirer  i hear somebody  oh here comes mistress harlow  what a gloom sits upon her features  she assumes authority here i find  but i will endeavor by insinuation and respect    enter miss harlow miss harlow my sister has told me sir    clerimont maam    bowing cheerfully miss harlow he is a sweet figure   aside clerimont she rather looks like miss harlows mother than her sisterinlaw    aside miss harlow he seems abashed  his respect is the cause  aside  my sister told me sir that you was here  i beg pardon for making you wait so long    clerimont oh maam bows the gloom disappears from her face but the lines of ill nature remain    aside miss harlow i see he loves me by his confusion  i will cheer him with affability  aside  sir the letter you was pleased to send my sister has seen  and    clerimont and has assured me that she has no objection    miss harlow i am glad of that sir  i was afraid    clerimont no maam she has none  and mr harlow i have seen him too  he has honored me with his consent  now madam the only doubt remains with you  may i be permitted to hope    miss harlow sir you appear like a gentleman  and    clerimont madam believe me never was love more sincere more justly founded on esteem or kindled into higher admiration   miss harlow sir with the rest of the family i hold myself much obliged to you and    clerimont obliged  it is i that am obliged  there is no merit on my side  it is the consequence of impressions made upon my heart and what heart can resist such beauty such various graces    miss harlow sir i am afraid  i wish my sister heard him aside  sir i am afraid you are lavish of your praise and the short date of your love sir    clerimont it will burn with unabating ardor  the same charms that first inspired it will for ever cherish it and add new fuel  but i presume you hold this style to try my sincerity  i see that is your aim  but could you read the feelings of my heart you would not thus cruelly keep me in suspense   miss harlow heavens if my sister saw my power over him  aside  a little suspense cannot be deemed unreasonable  marriage is an important affair  an affair for life  and some caution you will allow necessary    clerimont madam  disconcerted  oh i dread the sourness of her look    aside miss harlow i cannot help observing sir that you dwell chiefly on articles of external and superficial merit whereas the more valuable qualities of the mind prudence good sense a wellregulated conduct    clerimont oh maam i am not inattentive to those matters  oh she has a notable household understanding i warrant her  aside  but let me entreat you madam to do justice to my principles and believe me a sincere a generous lover    miss harlow sir i will frankly own that i have been trying you all this time and from henceforth all doubts are banished   clerimont your words recall me to new life  i shall for ever study to merit this goodness  but your fair sister  do you think i can depend upon her consent  may i flatter myself she will not change her mind    miss harlow my sister cannot be insensible of the honor you do us all  and sir as far as i can act with propriety in the affair i will endeavor to keep them all inclined to favor you    clerimont madam    bows miss harlow you have an interest in my breast that will be busy for you    clerimont i am eternally devoted to you madam    bows miss harlow how modest and yet how expressive he is   aside clerimont madam i shall be for ever sensible of this extreme condescension and shall think no pains too great to prove the gratitude and esteem i bear you  i beg my compliments to mr harlow and i shall be here with my uncle in the evening  as early as possible i shall come  my respects to your sister maam  and pray madam keep her in my interest  madam your most obedient  i have managed the motherly lady finely i think aside madam   bows and exit miss harlow what will my sister say now  i shall hear no more of her taunts  a malicious thing  i fancy she now sees that your giddy flits are not always the highest beauties  set her up indeed  had she but heard him the dear man  what sweet things he said and what sweet things he looked    enter mrs harlow mrs harlow well sister  how  what does he say    miss harlow say sister  every thing that is charming  he is the prettiest man    mrs harlow well i am glad of it  but all is well that ends well    miss harlow envy sister  envy and downright malice  oh had you heard all the tender things he uttered and with that ecstasy too that tenderness that delight restrained by modesty    mrs harlow i dont know though there is something odd in it still    miss harlow oh i dont doubt but you will say so  but you will find i have beauty enough left to make some noise in the world still  the men sister are the best judges of female beauty  dont concern yourself about it sister  leave it all to them    mrs harlow but only think of a lover you never saw but once at ranelagh    miss harlow very true  but even then i saw what work i made in his heart  oh i am in raptures with him and he is in raptures with me  sings yes i will have a husband ay marry etc   enter mr harlow mr harlow so sister how stand matters now   miss harlow as i could wish  i shall no more be a trouble to you  he has declared himself in the most warm and vehement manner  though my sister has her doubts  she is a good friend  she is afraid of my success    mrs harlow pray sister dont think so meanly of me  i understand that sneer maam   miss harlow and i understand you too maam    mr harlow come come i desire we may have no quarrelling  you two are always wrangling but when you are separated it is to be hoped you will then be more amicable things are now in a fair way  though sister let me tell you i am afraid our india friend will think himself ill treated   mrs harlow that is what i fear too  that is my reason for speaking    miss harlow oh never throw away a thought on him  mr clerimont has my heart and now i think i am settled for life  sister i love to plague her  now i think i am settled for life  for life  for life my dear sister    enter servant servant dinner is served sir   mr harlow very well come sister i give you joy  let us in to dinner   miss harlow oh vulgar  i cannot eat  i must go and dress my head over again and do a thousand things  for i am determined i will look this afternoon as well as ever i can    exit mrs harlow is not all this amazing my dear  her head is turned    mr harlow well let it all pass  dont you mind it  dont you say any thing  let her get married if she can  i am sure i shall rejoice at it   mrs harlow and upon my word my dear so shall i  and if i interfere it is purely out of friendship    mr harlow but be advised by me  say no more to her  if the affair goes on we shall fairly get rid of her  her peevish humors and her maiden temper are become insupportable  come let us in to dinner  if mr clerimont marries her which indeed will be odd enough  we shall then enjoy a little peace and quiet   exit mrs harlow what in the world could the man see in her  oh he will repent his bargain in a week or a fortnight that i am sure he will  she is gone to dress now  haha  oh how she rolls her pretty eyes in spite and looks delightfully with all her might haha delightfully she will look indeed   exit end of the first act act ii enter a servant and capt cape servant yes sir my master is at home  he has just done dinner sir    capt cape very well

hardly believe my own eyes  gods death i am almost inclined to think this letter signed with miss harlows name a mere forgery by some enemy to drive me into an excess of passion and so injure us both  i dont know what to say to it    enter mr harlow capt cape sir i have waited on you about an extraordinary affair  i cannot comprehend it sir  here is a letter with your sisters name  look at it sir  is that her handwriting    mr harlow yes sir  i take it to be her writing    capt cape and do you know the contents    mr harlow i cannot say i have read it  but    capt cape but you know the purport

fond of intermeddling    capt cape but sir  let me ask you  was not every thing agreed upon  are not the writings now in lawyers hands  was not next week fixed for our wedding    mr harlow i understood it so   capt cape very well then and see how she treats me  she writes me here in a contemptuous manner that she recals her promise  it was rashly given  she has thought better of it she will listen to me no more  she is going to dispose of herself to a gentleman with whom she can be happy for life  and i desire to see you no more sir  there that is free and easy is not it  what do you say to that    mr harlow why really sir it is not my affair  i have nothing to say to it    capt cape nothing to say to it  sir i imagined i was dealing with people of honor   mr harlow you have been dealing with a woman and you know    capt cape yes i know  i know the treachery of the sex  who is this gentleman pray   mr harlow his name is clerimont  they have fixed the affair among

excusable if i refuse to comply with the terms you impose upon me    miss harlow sir i really wonder what you can mean    capt cape mistake me not madam i am not come to whimper or to whine and to make a puppy of myself again  madam that is all blown over    miss harlow well then there is no harm done and you will survive this i hope   capt cape survive it    miss harlow yes  you will not grow

well maam very well  your humble servant madam  i promise you maam i can repay this scorn with scorn  with tenfold scorn madam such as this treatment deserves  that is all  i say no more  your servant maam  but let me ask you  is this a just return for all the attendance i have paid you these three years past    miss harlow perfectly just sir  three years  how could you be a dangler so long  i told you what it would come to  can you think that raising a womans expectation and tiring her out of all patience is the way to make sure of her at last  you ought to have been a brisker lover you ought
