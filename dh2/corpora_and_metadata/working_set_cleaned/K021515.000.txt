often in the silent hours of teeming thought as flattering prospects in his bosom wrought hope imagd to his sight your starting tear and brought the welcome plaudit to his ear but while he now revolves that mutual fame should join the poets and the actors name o let him here one tender tribute pay to early worth untimely snatched away to him who once alas his scene inspired whose softness

setting sun gilds his returning ensigns  great demophoon prepares to welcome home his conquering son and meet him with a fathers love  orcanes and yet amidst this hour of triumph sorrow clouds the splendour of a victors arms this eve foreruns a day of sad solemnity  adrastus orcanes yes  that sun whose cheerful light smiles on the harmless swain that piping leads his flock to fold must ere tomorrows noon behold his altar stained with guiltless blood thou know long since the oracle required a virgins life in annual sacrifice and every year on this returning day in solemn rites our weeping thrace gives up the melancholy victim  orcanes have the priests received the virgins yet whose names must stand tomorrows dreadful chance  adrastus not yet  and thence i fear new evils may arise it is whispered i know not what of something that portends contest and tumult to the state mathusius the hoary chief beneath whose fostering care our young timanthes learned the trade of war grown old in toils an alien to the court now lives sequestered since the king displeased recalled him from command and in his stead left his brave son to guide the thracian files retired he dwells where on the citys skirts the sea in tempests breaks or where in calms its glassy waves reflect the trembling towers with him resides his daughter fair ismena  orcanes the coldness twixt demophoon and mathusius has reached the public notice born to shine in camps alone mathusius has not learnt the soft address to rise in courts  adrastus it is true and bred with him timanthes has imbibed his tempers warmth which often by youth inflamed flies to extremes  cherinthus his young brother is formed of softer mould yet both possess demophoons heart and born of different queens he in timanthes seems to prize the gifts of manly fortitude while in cherinthus he loves the milder virtues that revive his queen serenas memory  orcanes cherinthus is now expected from the phrygian land sent by demophoon on some embassy of high concern  but see the king approaches enter demophoon attended demophoon it is well  mathusius absence on the eve of this important day when he should meet my conquering son the pupil of his arms argues a stubbornness and disregard a sovereign ill can brook we own his deeds his years of service for the state  but tell the allpresuming man that merit self oerrated cancels its reward  adrastus ought hearst thou of cherinthus  adrastus no my liege but to the thracian port the favoring winds must bring his vessel ere the close of eve forgive a subjects freedom but you seem oppressed with secret care  demophoon the time adrastus now calls for meditation and how few are a kings hours of peace whose every day teems with some counsel for the public weal  adrastus yet this auspicious day my king must own sets not with common luster when your son the brave timanthes from the scythian land adds to his fathers brow new wreaths of fame and to his people gives the palms of peace no sacred sir the hardy sons of thrace did never celebrate with greater joy a conquering chiefs return  demophoon well pleased i hear my faithful peoples shouts ascend the sky and sympathize in those exulting sounds that to the muchloved name of my timanthes join every wish  but hark the victor comes enter timanthes attended timanthes royal sir to whom timanthes owns the double tie of son and subject see him now returned from scythias kingdom with success and conquest to grace a fathers throne   demophoon timanthes rise the king and father give thee double welcome and treble praise to mars the armipotent that gives demophoon in his darling son his kingdoms best defender  timanthes thanks to heaven whose smiles have graced my unexperienced arms i may without a blush confess my deeds yes we have conquered never viewed the sun a more extensive slaughter midst the tumult of fear and rage were blended undistinguished the brave the base the victor and the vanquished the day at length was ours if you demand a proof of this behold yon captive bands behold yon shattered arms and streaming ensigns  demophoon it is not alone over the stern scythian foe thou spreadst thy trophies by subduing him thou triumphst in demophoons breast  meantime in this embrace receive my pledge of love thy father welcomes thee  proceed my son urge on thy course to honors furthest goal till verging on the extreme of age demophoon beholds thy fame eclipse his own  but toils demand refreshment and the wearied arm of valor gains new vigor from repose but i have that requires thy private ear let all except timanthes leave the presence exeunt attendants manent demophoon and timanthes demophoon come near my son  thou little think how much thy happiness employs my careful breast while in the distant fields of fame timanthes encountered dangers for his fathers honor demophoons thoughts were all employed at home to bless his glad return with halcyon days  timanthes have i not felt your goodness since the time of early childhood to the ripening age of manly life a father has prevented my every wish   demophoon thou know argea died ere twice six moons had taught thy tongue to lisp a mothers name  two years elapsed once more i tried the nuptial band cherinthus crowned this second union  but his birth alas was fatal to serena and with her in me the husband died and now the father engrosses all my soul  timanthes still may timanthes with filial duty sooth your days in peace and often as war shall call your banners forth return with conquest home  demophoon thou can not tell how dear i hold thee  to the toil of arms love gives its soft relief and beauty best smooths the rough front of war though now my years roll forward and the summer of my life yields to declining autumn well i know what youth has been and what befits the age when jocund spring leads up the laughing hours  timanthes alas my lord let not your goodness task timanthes gratitude i ask no more to crown my labors than demophoons smiles what bliss is wanting to that chief whose arms defend his sovereigns crown and guard his people  demophoon yes my loved son cephisas virgin charms cephisa daughter to the phrygian king shall be thy valors great reward  timanthes cephisa  demophoon what mean thou wherefore hangs this sudden gloom over thy changed features can cephisas beauties whom sighing kings  nay more   timanthes yet hear me sir be not displeased with your timanthes  heavens my witness gladly would i yield my life if such a sacrifice could aught avail to insure demophoons peace  but i confess repugnance here   demophoon timanthes   timanthes though i own what fame has loudly spoken every virtue that decks the royal virgin yet if aught my deeds have merited   demophoon where can we find another partner for timanthes bed unless a subject born  think not my son the shades of our great ancestors shall blush to see their line disgraced  from them we hold the statute that condemns to death the subject who weds with royal blood and whilst i live i am guardian of the laws and will enforce them even with severest rigor  timanthes sacred sir  enter orcanes orcanes the phrygian ships my lord are now descried full steering to the port their spreading sails swell in the winds that waft them to the shore  demophoon it is well  go thou my son to meet thy brother and bid the princess welcome to the land myself would with thee but the priests demand my presence at the temple to consult tomorrows mournful rites  timanthes aside doubts rise on doubts this dreadful sacrifice  yet stay my father   demophoon what would thou  speak   timanthes alas i know not what  fain would i utter  but   demophoon no more i cannot prolong the precious time in vain debate the terms are settled prince  then summon all thy virtue to respect a parents will and dress thy looks in smiles to meet cephisa exeunt demophoon and orcanes timanthes alone ha dress my looks in smiles to meet cephisa what have i heard  o where is ismena now that once could sooth my cares whose beauty best smoothed the rough task of war  methinks even now she chides the lingering hours  then let me fly steal unperceived upon the beauteous mourner and with timanthes love relieve her sorrows exit scene a garden enter mathusius and ismena ismena yet hear me sir nor chide your loved ismena if she presume with unexperienced counsel to guide a fathers thoughts  alas i fear the fond impatience of paternal tenderness but makes that evil sure which fortune else may otherwise dispose  has not demophoon dispatched some delegates to delphos shrine once more to seek a period to the scourge that hangs each year on our devoted thrace  mathusius from thence no comfort springs  this very morn arrived they from the sacred tripos brought this doubtful answer that the land must groan beneath the wrath of heaven till to himself the offender shall be known who guiltless now usurps a princes right  ismena mysterious all  mathusius meantime destruction with remorseless fury hangs over my child the darling of my age and shall i then consent   ismena yet recollect your wonted fortitude  why should you hope that midst the weeping maids of thrace ismena should stand exempted from the fatal urn you plead the king perhaps   mathusius and just the plea am i because a subject less a father apollo wills some virgin nobly born should stain his altar every year with blood let him recall his daughter kept at distance with artful policy  let him expose her name in yonder urn and let him prove what pangs distract a wretched parents breast when his heart trembles as the priest draws near the sacred vase while with a solemn mien his lips prepare to speak the victims name  ismena alas my lord cast round your eyes behold the thracian court and mark her proudest nobles whose hearts have shudderd on this awful day for a childs threatened life  it is true arsene the firstborn offspring of his queen argea resides at distance from demophoons palace but yet reflect that singly to refuse ismenas name will but incense the king let not my danger urge you to expose your age to further woe  too much already he views you with an unpropitious eye i dread to think if now too far provoked what mischief may ensue  mathusius in vain thou tell me of wrath or hatred in his breast while reason asserts my cause and heaven inspires my thoughts was it for this i taught his arms to conquer and bred his son to greatness yes by me the scythian foe is vanquished and by me this eve timanthes comes in triumph home  ismena timanthes o my heart aside what says my father is then the prince returned  mathusius he is ismena and comes in happy hour his generous soul disdains not to remember that mathusius taught his young sword to reap in glorys field to him i will appeal  he will with pity behold a parents sufferings  ismena yet my father should the brave prince with sympathizing heart plead vainly with demophoon o forbear to urge the contest further hope the genius that still has watched your years of danger past will guard your age from anguish  mathusius cease ismena to oppose with fruitless words my fixed resolve no if i still must be condemned to feel this anguish of the soul yon haughty monarch shall share with me those fears a father knows nor stand excluded from mathusius pangs exit ismena alone the tempest thickens round my little bark that till this hour has stemmed lifes boisterous wave at length i fear must sink  timanthes comes he comes with conquest crowned but where are now ismenas smiles to meet him is it thus with tears illomend with foreboding sighs i give him welcome here enter timanthes my life my lord come thou again preserved from dangers field to these fond arms  timanthes yes midst the sterner deeds which glory claimed thy image present still soothed every toil  and art thou then the same as when i left thee at the call of honor  ismena can thou then doubt me if thy heart timanthes in the rough shock of war and clang of arms forgot not softer hours of peace and love think thou ismena midst these shades that often have witnessed to our mutual vows would ever cast off remembrance that she once was happy  timanthes forgive the fondness of overflowing love that wishes still to hear those gentle lips breathe their soft vows  how fares my boy olinthus the precious pledge of our connubial joys that heaven bestowed while distant with thy father four springs renewing since the thracian grove timanthes marched against his countrys foes  ismena some god that watches over this pledge of love sure crowns his tender age with growing beauty or the fond mother with imagined grace has decked his infancy his looks already assume thy manly sternness when he smiles he is all thyself and often as i can steal a wished for look i gaze with rapture on him and think i view timanthes till deceived with the dear thought i strain him to my breast and in the son embrace the absent father  timanthes what place contains our infant hope o lead lead me ismena where these longing eyes may in his features read a fathers likeness or see them blooming with his mothers charms  ismena alas my lord awhile suppress these warm paternal feelings  some few miles remote sequestered from the city on the edge of the rude forest arcas and ianthe a rustic pair unconscious of their charge rear his young life  amidst the observing eyes that watch a princes deeds you must beware and but with caution see him  heaven allows to us with scanty hand the parents joys in the soft moments of overflowing nature to clasp him in our fond endearing arms and bless the prattler with the tongue of transport  timanthes by heaven it shall not be  i will burst at once from dark dissimulations veil  it is now the crisis of our fate  ismena it is indeed tomorrows sun lights up the solemn day of annual sacrifice ismenas name must stand enrolled amongst the elected train that wait the dreadful chance  timanthes ismenas name  ismena it is so decreed  and think not that i fear to die for thrace  no for her countrys sake ismena gladly would embrace her doom but phoebus words demand a virgins blood shall i a wife and mother dare approach his sacred altar an unhallowed victim thus if i speak or not i still am guilty my silence heaven offends my speech the king  timanthes the king must know the secret of our nuptials all all demands is now  for o ismena this very hour perhaps cherinthus brings a rival to thy love  cephisa comes but now demophoon urged me to receive the phrygian princess  but be witness heaven not all the cruel policy of courts not the stern mandates of a king and father shall ever dissolve those tender ties which love has formed and virtue sanctifies  ismena alas what can it all avail our union published thou know the sentence of the law impends on my devoted head  timanthes a monarch made a monarch can revoke the stern decree demophoon though severe is still a parent his kind indulgence shall avert the stroke that threats ismena  ismena rather let it come too long timanthes have thou sacrificed thy glory to ismena  o reflect how ill the name of thracias heir agrees with secret nuptials and clandestine love let me embrace my fate  i die with joy since i in death can call timanthes mine  timanthes o fortune wherefore did thy lavish hand give my ismena every charm yet place her virtues in the vale of private life but be it so  it rests on me to amend the partial error  thrace some future day with joy shall view her partner of my throne farewell my love and let this fixed assurance dwell in thy mind and calm thy troubled thoughts timanthes will be ever watchful over thee and hold thy peace far dearer than his own exeunt severally end of the first act act ii scene a seaport enter cherinthus cephisa and attendants cephisa what means this sadness prince with silent gaze you look and sigh and if with friendly speech i urge your converse when you seem prepared to tell me much your faultring tongue is mute where is your wonted cheerfulness the grace that seasoned your discourse are you in thrace the same cherinthus that i knew in phrygia or is it thus with melancholy looks you thracians to her lord conduct a bride  cherinthus if my afflictions bear a sad presage on me fair princess every evil fall my stars can little add to griefs like mine nor breathes a wretch so hopeless as cherinthus  cephisa and claims cephisa then so little share in your esteem the time has been   cherinthus forgive this cold reserve  and yet believe me fairone there is a something here commands my silence  cephisa it is true i am a woman and your secret were ill confided to our sexs weakness i urge no further  lead me to the palace  cherinthus yet hear  those eyes like lightning pierce my soul and all my firm resolves are lost before them o turn cephisa and with gentler looks unbend those brows while trembling i confess it is thou have robbed me of my peace  i gaze with rapture on thy matchless charms i own my love is fruitless all that these fond wishes would grasp they know not what i know that death alone can end my pains  cephisa what means cherinthus  cherinthus i knew too well i should offend  and yet the faults of love   cephisa forbear  i will hear no more  is this the brother of timanthes this the prince deputed by the thracian king and is it thus cherinthus thinks to guard that faith a brother and a father claim  cherinthus i own my crime  i know that every tie of son and brother should forbid my passion why was i only singled by demophoon to bring thee to timanthes could i view thy charms and yet resist  i saw and loved each day beheld me near thee while the name of kinsman gave a license to my tongue nor did this name alone deceive the world i was deceived myself  that love which made me sigh for ever for cephisas presence appeared but duty and a thousand times i thought to paint the affections of a brother while my too eager speech betrayed my own  cephisa aside alas twas not in vain  cephisa too perceived a something she would fain disown  cherinthus and yet sometimes i felt a flattering hope methought i often observed a tender sigh steal from thy breast viewed in thy eyes a softness that seemed much more than friendship   cephisa hold cherinthus thou do begin to abuse my easy nature it ill befits the daughter of nicanor affiancd to timanthes heir of thrace to hear with calmness these injurious vows at once destructive to her peace and fame  cherinthus forgive me princess and i will obey thou shall no more reproach my daring love injurious to thy glory  spite of all the pangs that rend my heart convictions force dwells in thy words and i will no more offend no i will strive to wear the face of joy and kindly bless my happier brothers fate enter timanthes welcome timanthes to thy native land fame the loud harbinger of thy approach has roused each thracian son to hail thy presence and i but join the common voice  timanthes receive in this embrace my thanks  but say cherinthus is this the royal fair one who forsakes her countrys gentle seat to visit thrace and with her beauties gild our rougher clime  cherinthus it is  behold while others with applause congratulate thy fortune what a treasure thy brother brings to give thee every blessing that love and beauty can bestow   timanthes her looks bespeak perfection  let timanthes then imperial virgin greet thy save arrival from phrygias happy shore  vouchsafe awhile cherinthus to retire apart  my thoughts revolve some secret of import that claims the princess ear alone  cherinthus i shall obey what can this mean but wherefore ask or what avails their converse to the lost cherinthus walks aside timanthes how shall timanthes beauteous princess dress his thoughts in apt expression i should now pour forth the raptures of a heart decreed to excellence like yours  but o there is fatality in man and often when heaven holds out an unexpected blessing to us some mystery forbids   cephisa what would the prince let not timanthes seek the low disguise of art the refuge of ignoble minds but boldly as he meets his foes in battle speak out his secret soul  timanthes the statesman often joins with the specious plea of public good two hearts averse our parents have decreed an union to thyself perhaps ungrateful thy virtues might demand the noblest heart but fate forbids us ever to unite there is a bar which nothing can surmount my father knows it not nor must i speak it refuse refuse me then enlarge my faults and thus preserve thy fame my peace and life  cephisa it is well  my lord   timanthes i see the conscious pride of greatness rising on thy cheek  my presence but adds to your displeasure  my cherinthus the care be thine with every mark of honor such as may suit her station and desert to lead from hence the princess to the palace exit cephisa what have i heard is this the boasted youth whom fame extols for gallantry and arms and is it thus he treats a virgin sprung from phrygias sceptered kings  neglected heavens and shall i tamely bear this outrage  cherinthus coming forward princess what indignation rises in your breast your looks are changed  has then my brother   cephisa yes i see your mutual purpose to betray me was it for this i left my native land left the loved arms of an indulgent father to meet with insult on this foreign shore to bear unmoved the injury that waits cherinthus passion and his brothers scorn but if demophoon  enter adrastus adrastus to the fair cephisa our sovereign wishes health the thracian palace adorned with every pomp expects your presence demophoon now as annual rites require sequestered with the priests till morning dawn invokes the powers divine mean while he sends by me to pay the tribute of respect your rank demands and to conduct you hence where suppliant crowds attend with duteous zeal to pay their homage to their future queen  cephisa i thank thee lord  cephisa hopes no less from great demophoon and her fathers friend cherinthus let us hence  but still remember thy plighted word for know whatever chance subjects cephisa to unlookdfor insult yet nothing from her mind can ever erase such thoughts as fit the daughter of a king exeunt scene changes to the garden ismena alone what would my fate  but now mathusius bade me prepare for flight  and whither must i fly what region will receive forlorn ismena to end her wretched life  o my olinthus must i forsake thy innocence forsake my muchloved lord without one parting look i sicken at the thought  enter timanthes timanthes what new distress hangs over my love though distant from thy sight my sympathizing spirit mourned with thee and whispered that thy sorrow claimed my aid  ismena o no  thy cares are vain  leave leave me then alone to perish  the big tempest swells that soon must hide me from thy sight for ever  timanthes what means ismena  ismena i must quit timanthes mathusius warns me hence  but now he left me some dreadful purpose laboring in his breast yet ere we part to thy paternal care i here commend my child for me embrace him give him this kiss and when his ripening age can feel compassion tell him all my story  timanthes it must not be  timanthes with the wings of love shall fly overtake thy fleeting peace and bring her back to her forsaken home soon as the morning dawns i will seek the king with filial reverence clasp his honored knees doubt not my love but all shall yet be well enter mathusius mathusius my daughter let us haste  art thou timanthes son of demophoon let me gaze awhile these features once bespoke thee kind and brave till now i ever held thee such  but say is not injustice stamped upon thy nature and all thy father in thy heart  o no you are still the same  yes i had sought thee prince thy old mathusius once revered in thee had vested every hope  but now it is past   ismena alas my father must ismena then for ever load a parents breast with anguish am i the unhappy cause   mathusius now hear timanthes and if thou ever heldst mathusius dear thy generous breast will feel a fathers pangs a father whom the rage of tyrant power pursues to ruin  o my child my child  timanthes mathusius speak  has then ismenas name been drawn tomorrows victim  mathusius no  demophoon has doomed her life a guiltless sacrifice without the sentence of the fatal urn  timanthes condemned to die the lots of death undrawn allpowerful gods   ismena o sir weep not for me i merit not the tears that stain those cheeks too deep they enter here  no let me bear afflictions pressure till the fainting sense sink with its anguish so i may retired from mortal eyes indulge my griefs alone nor bend that hoary head to earth with sorrow  timanthes it cannot be  mathusius thou rt deceived  how could thou kindle thus the kings resentment against her helpless life  mathusius because i sought to exclude ismena from the lots of fate because i durst produce his own example but now i met him near the temples porch encompassed by the priests with all the warmth of a fond father trembling for his child i urged entreated  but in vain  the king beheld me with an haughty eye enraged my tongue reproached the monarchs partial voice that to his subjects prodigal of death gave to the bloody knife our thracian virgins while kept at distance from the suffering land his own arsene shunned the fatal stroke  ismena i tremble for the event  not for myself but thee ismena fears  ah wherefore sir would you for me rashly incense a power which sovereigns ever jealous still defend what answer made the king  mathusius his indignation repressed within himself found little vent in words  at length  presumptuous man he cried soon shall thou feel that still demophoon knows how to avenge affronted majesty then turning from me swift the temple gates received and shut him from my sight  since when i have heard that secret orders have been given to seize ismena  timanthes ha  direct me heaven what now befits timanthes  aside ismena yes it dawns the work of fate now opens to my view and all must be revealed  be firm my soul and nobly meet the trial aside timanthes is it possible in this extreme what course remains  mathusius beside the clifted rock manned with a chosen few and trusty servants rides a bark prepared with secret care that will convey us hence to some far distant hospitable clime where it is not criminal to be a father  timanthes it must not be  o sir   mathusius what means timanthes  timanthes ismena must not quit the thracian shore   mathusius not quit the thracian shore  now by yon powers that sit in judgment over a fathers wrongs no human breath shall stay us  haste my daughter prepare this instant to depart   timanthes distraction and shall i then permit  mathusius hear urge not my temper further  well thou know my soul has ever held thee as her best her earliest guide  if i oppose thee now   mathusius is this thy love would thou forbid a father to save his only child from cruel death  timanthes o no  thou can not tell how dear i prize her safety here  come danger in her worst her ugliest form this breast shall meet the dart that threats ismena  mathusius we but waste the time that with destruction winged unheeded flies away my daughter   timanthes not the united force of earth shall bear her hence   mathusius nay then the sword shall vindicate the rights a father claims  ismena hold sir and hear ismena  o mathusius do thou not see some secret laboring here too big for speech  thou claimst a fathers right and sacred is that claim but yet beware nor let the hasty sword with thoughtless rage invade a right more sacred than your own the prince  how shall i speak  mathusius what new alarm runs through my soul  is it possible  timanthes my father for such thou art  think not thy breast can feel severer anguish for ismenas danger than what a husband feels   mathusius her husband  timanthes yes she is she is my wife  then judge mathusius if i could bear without the sharpest pang to see her torn for ever from my sight  mathusius ah prince what have thou done thy cruel love has filled the measure of mathusius woes thou most unkind is this the recompense awaits my suffering age  unhappy girl to tie the fatal knot that ends in death  ismena here prostrate at your feet permit me now to own the fault excess of love inspired and yet you can forgive for if i read those looks aright resentment dwells not there nor will i plead the virtues of the prince though these my lord were often your lips fond theme while under covert of yon arching shade i drank with greedy ears his grateful praise  mathusius no more my child  o i forgive thee all  but dangers thicken round these nuptials known the rigid law shall seal thee for destruction and mock a fathers sorrows  timanthes no mathusius by every future hour of hopdfor peace my life shall be her safeguard enter officer and guard officer pardon sir if with reluctance i obey the charge my sovereign gives  guards bear ismena hence  mathusius what means this violence  ismena the lot is cast come every spirit that has fired my sex through the long records of succeeding time to dare beyond the softness of our kind now steel my thoughts  my fortune claims it all so may thou own my father though one fond unguarded hour betrayed my yielding soul yet shall the sufferings of this awful day the little span of life that fate allows atone for every error  timanthes death to hear unhand her slaves  mathusius age has not yet unnervd this arm so far   officer forbear  if either moves to give her aid this dagger drinks her blood   timanthes inhuman villain hold   officer the royal mandate shall justify my deeds  away  ismena yet stay a moments pause  still still the woman here is struggling in my breast  my father  oh  i dare no further  looking at timanthes mathusius speak   ismena think not mathusius though black adversity now folds me round that aught of anguish for myself can shake thy daughters mind  no i could bear it all but when we view the pangs of those we love the firmest temper shrinks and even the tear of weakness then is virtue  gracious heaven protect defend  i would but must not speak  ye powers who read my thoughts supply the prayer i cannot utter and whatever her doom at least in those she loves preserve ismena exit guarded timanthes mathusius timanthes o give me patience gods  mathusius earth opens not nor lightenings fly to punish such injustice and shall we say jove watches over mankind timanthes speak  for we are now united in bands of wretchedness  timanthes go good mathusius and learn the place to which they bear ismena for should i strive in vain to appease my father yet love shall point the way   mathusius no  every hope is now extinct and black despair shuts up the gloomy prospect  timanthes can the son in vain plead with a father for his life his all o it is a cause will call down every soft propitious power that feels for human sufferings to heal the anguish of a parents breast to calm a lovers and a husbands pains to arrest the hand of fate and save ismena  end of the second act act iii scene a royal apartment enter demophoon and cephisa demophoon return to phrygia princess can thou ask abruptly thus to bid adieu to thrace while now timanthes with presaging hope anticipates the hour decreed to bless the prince and lover when this solemn day shall pass whose rising light now faintly strikes the sacred laurels where the temples grove receives the dawn  cephisa believe me my resolves are such as suit my sex and rank the name of virgin and of princess both require me to quit the thracian palace  for timanthes no longer urge   demophoon i can forgive thy anger nursed in the pleasures of the phrygian court a thracians manners may be harsh to thee wonder not then if so timanthes seems inured to rugged arms be thine the glory to teach him first the flowery path that leads to the calm dwelling of domestic sweets what cannot charms like thine  yes fair cephisa those eyes shall thaw the ice around his heart and warm the youth to unexperienced love  cephisa my lord it cannot be  as soon this morn that spreads the veil of sorrow over the land might raise each heart with gladness as cephisa find happiness in thrace  at thy command and thine alone the ships can quit the port to bear me back to my paternal land give orders then to loose the bark whose sails must waft me hence for ever  demophoon think not princess demophoon would detain thee while thy thoughts revisit phrygia yet permit me now to say i hoped far other from the daughter of him whose wished alliance promised all an anxious king and parent could demand but yet whatever thy wish till the next sun thou can not hence no vessel from the port presumes to rear the mast or spread the sail till this sad day declines  cephisa since now the law forbids to quit the realm i must submit to breathe the air of thrace  yet i respect the friend of great nicanor but remember my fathers honor and my own nay more demophoons urges me to leave a court where every moments voluntary stay insults my sexs rights and stains my glory exit demophoon alone ha whence is this sure something lurks beneath that yet i know not  i remember now when first i named the princess that my son heard with reluctance  should he disobey  a fathers just resentment  but no more it cannot be  i am alarmed too soon enter timanthes timanthes where is my king  demophoon timanthes thou art come in happy time   timanthes dread sir permit your son to sue for grace and pardon   demophoon say for whom do thou entreat  timanthes for an unhappy victim one whose misfortune is her only crime the daughter of mathusius   demophoon it is too late her doom is sealed   timanthes grant to your suppliant son her guiltless life   demophoon and dare thou still presume to name her if thou valust ought my love forego this vain request   timanthes alas my father i cannot now obey you  o if ever i have deserved a parents tenderness if with a bosom seamd with honest scars i have returned a conqueror to your arms if ever my triumphs in the glorious field have drawn the tear of pleasure from your eyes release forgive ismena  lost unhappy she has no friend but me to plead her cause and shall she perish  think you view her now in early bloom of life who never knew the thoughts of guilt stretched on the fatal altar in all the pangs of suffering  think you see the lifewarm blood gush from her tender breast hear the last accents from her trembling lips behold her dying eyes  but thou art pale why look thou thus upon me  o my father i see i see the gracious signs of pity do not repent my lord  indulge it still for never will i quit these sacred feet till thou have given the word to spare ismena  demophoon rise prince  almighty powers what must i think that with such tenderness thou namst ismena yet mark how far my fond indulgence yields on one condition i recall her sentence ismena yet may live but if
