prevail  london printed for richardson and urquhart under the royal exchange  m dcc lxxix  the tutor of truth letter liii g lascelles esquire to capt carlisle you are absolutely too effeminately scrupulous carlisle  what i proposed was well meant however as your virtue is of a most obstinate anchoretical nature which neither love nor friendship can make a voluptuous impression upon i shall quit the subject but not without saying that you are a very singular man and i question upon the whole whether the sex like you a bit the better for those scruples which stand so constantly betwixt you and a delicious offer  as to miss de gray it is as impossible she can love such a flash in the pan such a match always lighted as medway as it is impossible for her to live in the same house with clement carlisle and not be however secretly in raptures with him  that is to say  if his ice does not lie in the way seriously clement you make difficulties where i should go as smoothly as upon a carpet the marchioness remains quiet and i am your entire friend  george lascelles  letter live from the same to sir andrew flight dear andrew the stratagem takes i have written the letter we projected and it answers our expectation he could not bear the idea  he was hurt  he could not believe his eyes  he would not do her such a violence for the world  but you knew his virtue i judge it is owing in a great degree to my caution in directing to you in a counterfeit hand that has kept our correspondence so long as private as we wished it for had i written in my usual character a single letter would have betrayed me to carlisle with whom i have lived on terms of absolute intimacy for ten years without his ever suspecting me to be a jolly fellow so easy is it for men of spirit to impose upon these mighty good kind of men never surely was any thing half so apropos as his putting the marchioness under my care  or rather my sisters who really thinks me as great a saint as carlisle himself but to come to the point it may certainly be contrived for you to take unto your bosom this italian treasure  carlisle refuses her that is one plea  you are a fine fellow that is another  you have money that is greater than even the former her passions are awake that is number   in your favor she is married and therefore above the folly of solicitation  number    her constitution glows like the torrid zone  number    she abhors the marquis  count nine for that in short she will she must she shall be yours  as to the arrival of the marquis do not apprehend any danger from that quarter i have counteracted the contents of the letter from carlisle you may depend on it it is by your lascelles so ordered that if he goes at all in search of his perdita he will not direct his course to england but to a very different quarter of the globe i will prepare every other grand essential even till your bed is dressed with roses in the mean time keep heathcoate ignorant of the business and continue to use or rather to amuse him with the ridiculous that results from your play upon the hodsons drewsons hewsons  what the plague is their vulgar name he is a worthy fellow but not fit for such a plot as the present  therefore till the deed be done keep him out of it  as to the ladys beauty depend on your old caterer for that i have a hawks eye at a pretty wench to say the truth the marchioness is more to your taste than any i have had the honor and friendship to recommend her eyes have just that fluid floating in them and are exactly of that brilliant black you like her nose is turned to the perfection of your beauty  a little on the aquiline and set off by a pair of brows so markingly expressive of pleasure that you may depend upon them then her lips is first of that superior order without corpulence and so full of majesty without haughtiness that most attaches you her bosom is finely filled and rises as the poet emphatically terms it suing to be pressed her arms hands fingers are likewise all suited to you but enough she is to be the subject of a much closer criticism than it is even possible for me to give  once more however let me charge you by an old and serviceable friendship never to breathe the name of lascelles in any way not consistent with every thing sacred you know my loss of a damned fortune at one stroke of the die first reduced me to this as it was impossible to hold still the elbow something was necessary to repair my mischance and literally speaking keep me in play besides which i was to live as i had ever been used to do i was to be the same character two paths presented themselves the one led to the gallows by the way of pursegathering the other to the accommodation of a friend by the way of woman i saw you loved you valued your health and chose the latter path you know how i have succeeded let the ample catalogue of your passions gratified in every form convince you of it you only i served you only know me to be not absolutely  a carlisle i once more repeat to you the necessity of burning every letter and every slip of paper you get from me the moment it comes to hand if a syllable at any time transpires i am destroyed for ever the consequence of which irreparable injury is that i must cut your throat but keep our counsel and you shall be the very jupiter of a seraglio  i shook hard last night my hand trembles this morning at the disappointment pray send fifty pieces to take off by way of bracer  adieu lascelles  letter lv sir andrew flight to g lascelles esquire georgy though blessingbourne has not yet honored my last draughts and i have but just an hundred pieces about me i nevertheless divide cheerfully with you  my purse is yours  how can talk so childishly about disclosure of secrets could you not have me cut into piecemeal by fathers brothers aunts mothers and cousins if i were ridiculous enough to blab i adore woman to please me and men to laugh at you very liberally supply me with the one kind of gratification heathcoate with the other neither jars with the others province and i have money enough to support you both as to character i like it as well as you and except laughing at men and lying with women i solemnly declare i would not do a wrong thing for the world but every man to his passions  those are mine you rejoice my heart with repeating to me in every letter the personal charms of carlisles fair follower it is a confounded thing though to consider she is so taken with carlisle and yet to do him justice he is an elegant glorious fellow every day marks the goodness of his heart and you would be an ungrateful dog to say a syllable against him if you can prevent all risque for though you fight for me i hate quarrels i will be satisfied with your success by the middle of next month in the mean time i have a game of my own to play just such a one as i can manage without assistance not a snap of the finger of peril attending the whole enterprise but heathcoate is my correspondent in this adventure it is not of importance enough for the ambitious george lascelles whom even a marchioness cannot deter from his attempts the object of my present humble aspiring is only the wife of the most grazierlooking hal hewson but mum not a word more on a subject that does not belong to you heathcoate is the man for trifles and laugh medway is as usual the most sullen rascal in europe he was going to run me through the body the other day for tossing down a tumbler of fair water which though i swear it was an accident he insisted was done with an illnatured design to spot his waistcoat  carlisle who is ever a peacemaker interfered or else i should most likely have written to you from elysium  yours a f  letter lvi the earl of blessingrourne to mr de gray sir you did not remember either me or my overtures respecting my nephew sir andrew by the post certainly you are ill and therefore i send to make friendly inquiries after your health as to any other cause of your delay it is impossible to be conceived for how should so wellinformed a gentleman as mr de gray forget what is due to a very splendid offer from one of the oldest peers in the realm the countess renews her compliments i am in hourly expectation of a dukedom your address however at present is as usual to the right hon the earl of blessingbourne  i am sir yours blessingbourne  letter lvii captain carlisle to mr lascelles though your last relished more my dear lascelles of the inconsiderate than i hope belongs to your character yet it set my heart at rest upon the subject of the marchioness  another strange circumstance has happened in this family two days after i had returned such a reply to mr de greys letter as appeared to me proper and consistent he put into my hands a letter from blessingbourne who had made formal overtures of marriage betwixt miss de gray and sir andrew flight nothing ever excited more real astonishment for i had never once dreamt of a treaty coming from that quarter knowing so perfectly as i do lucias opinion of sir andrew the epistle was penned with all the titleswelled vanity connected with the blessingbourne character and coronets crests and supporters lions rampant spread eagles and fields azure danced through every line having commented upon the style with a good humor which is above turning the result of a mans infirmity into a cause of affront mr de gray asked me my opinion of the match   pray heaven i may never undergo so severe a trial as i sustained in the process of the following short but most agonizing conversation of which you will have the more perfect idea from dialogue it past in mr de greys library  mr de gray i have ever made you my dear mr carlisle my confident upon various occasions we have never canvassed together a love affair though you tell me you are to have a little more knowledge of society before you venture upon a wife yet i know you to have a very competent judgment of these things because you have ever been an accurate observer this letter before us opens to you a secret of the utmost consequence to your friends peace what do you think of it   carlisle sir  you must certainly  be  be the best judge of these matters  it is too nice a point    mr de gray riches you know are out of the question titles do not glow in my eyes as they do in those of his lordship    carlisle oh  mr de gray  what  what are titles to  to    de gray to what my clement   carlisle i beg pardon sir  perhaps a countess may not displease even the amiable miss de gray   de gray what you would advise her then to the match would you my friend   carlisle who i advise  gracious god forbid that i  that is  i should be sorry any thing might from my advice turn out so  so  so as    de gray nobody to be sure can answer for events but what do you think of sir andrew my dear carlisle   carlisle what does miss de gray think of him sir   de gray that is what i meant rather to ask you as an old friend i did not know but she might have let you into the secret    carlisle what secret sir    de gray perhaps you think more highly of  mr medway i was ready to sink into the earth lascelles at this question   carlisle of mr medway sir  to be sure medway  mr medway certainly sir  if he meets the ladys approbation   de gray at any rate i will decline his lordships offer i am persuaded lucia has no sort of affection for sir andrew he is too light too volatile  now that objection does not i think lie against medway he is a strange headed but i believe he is a good hearted creature do you think this person a better match   carlisle he has made offers then sir has he   de gray admitting he had is he a man you would have me fix on    carlisle if to miss de gray he were agreeable sir  to be sure  you  you  you could not do better    de gray tell me frankly my dearest captain do you know any body whom you think she likes better in the tender way we speak of    carlisle sir  likes better  likes better than mr medway   de gray aye my friend  i could wish her happiness to depend in some measure upon your choice perhaps neither sir andrew nor medway are the men you would fix on  be candid  do you know  are you acquainted with any person who you think loves her more tenderly    carlisle more tenderly  oh yes my dear mr de gray ten thousand times  more tenderly  oh god of heaven    de gray you charm me with the tidings  pray name him to me  is he young is he amiable  is he steady  has he any of the virtues that distinguish the  of  of   here lascelles the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of medway himself who came bursting into the library for his fishing pole  never was man relieved more critically we were talking of you mr medway said mr de gray  hush  hush  cried medway emphatically extending his finger  it is plain mr de gray has fixed his heart as well as lucia here is on this man yet what a strange conversation for heavens sake help me if possible to a clue yet medway  depend on it medway is the man to the terror of   your clement carlisle  letter lviii mr de gray to the earl of blessingbourne my lord the importance of the consideration to both the young parties concerned and the regard that is due to the natural inclinations as to the acquired affections are the apologies i have to offer for appearing to neglect a suitable return of acknowledgment for the honor of your lordships letter and for the ample proposals it contained  prior to the receipt of your lordships favor i made some attempt to obtain the secret of my childs heart and since i have made a like attempt upon the heart of another person not my lord that it is possible for me to prefer any gentleman to the nephew of the earl of blessingbourne but because i suspected an affection subsisting elsewhere i think my lord i have discovered a passion in my daughter and a return of it in a certain young friend of mine that may possibly grow in a little time into a circumstance of essential consequence  within a few days i shall be more assured of this and if my child proves to have a heart not preengaged there can be no doubt of her soon becoming sensible of the great honor of an alliance with so near a branch of the blessingbourne family on the contrary if it should turn out that her affections are already possessed it will appear obvious to your lordship that as in such a case she cannot reward the tenderness of sir andrew she can have no just title to the many dignities and the immense fortunes which would follow such a union  what i would invite then from your lordship is a short suspension that the matter may lie open i again repeat that a few days will naturally determine every thing in the mean time sir andrew had better i conceive remain unacquainted with our treaty left it should any way terminate to his dissatisfaction on my part i will hasten the necessary discovery as much as in my power although your lordship will easily imagine a fathers power in a point of so much importance is not very extensive when the father is convinced of his childs integrity and discretion  i shall be happy my lord to hear that the mode i have submitted to your lordship is crowned with your approbation  i distinguish myself when i present my most humble compliments to the countess and i have the honor to be  my lord your lordships most devoted and obedient servant robert de gray  letter lix the earl of blessingbourne to r de gray esquire sir the countess and i had no conception of such a reply to our very distinguishing overtures in favor of a young person utterly untitled we receive a very ill return from you mr de gray our visit to prudence place was principally out of an old friendship and because we thought your daughter a very decent prudent person to promote a match between her and our nephew we offered the most peculiar splendours we offered lineal honors  but we are desired to wait the issue of another treaty and pray sir may we ask which or who it is amongst your friends that ought to have the first offer in preference to the nephew and heir of the earl of blessingbourne i shall not mention the clear annual rentroll of near fifty thousand guineas a year that will devolve to him nor will i rest my consequence upon the superbest equipage nor on the most magnificent seats in europe i confine myself to that illustrious line into which the arms of your young lady would be if i may so say  encoated every body can tell mr de gray i am not a boaster but indeed your tardy conduct borders somewhat upon incivility and disrespect the countess thinks so too nevertheless we still think your lucia would adorn a coronet she is her favorite a little intercourse with my lady after marriage would make her  would  properly speaking  prepare her for her new honors once more therefore we offer our services to you again and upon the full assurance of your immediate consent the countess and i are proceeding to measures that may bring the point to a crisis  i am sir your most obedient servant blessingbourne  letter lx from the same to sir andrew flight at r de greys esquire dear andrew we have reasons to desire you will look upon lucia de gray as upon a lady that is first to be the lady flight and afterward countess of blessingbourne if not of a rank still higher she will be informed of this circumstance at the same time you are and as soon as certain preliminaries between mr de gray and i are adjusted the ceremony shall be completed to be sure the honors are every one in our hands but never mind that she is a beautiful woman and with regard to honors as they cannot be divided we are contented to bestow them in consideration of her merit and person  i shall give you very liberally and i send you now a bill for present use though bytheby it astonishes both me and the countess how you can continue to squander such sums in a country village during the time of a visit  adieu blessingbourne  letter lxi the countess of blessingbourne to miss de gray miss de gray i have prevailed on the earl to suffer andrew our nephew to offer you his hand the acceptance of it is a point so much out of the question that it would be ridiculous to mention it to do you justice you are the only young woman i know of no descent who could sit at my righthand upon a visit to certain people without disgracing me nay more i believe your being about me a little when you are lady lucia flight for i dare say you will wait patiently for my coronet a few years will totally finish you both for a carriage and a drawingroom this is saying very much lady lucia  pshaw i am so used to write only to people of condition that i declare i can scarce reconcile my pen to a miss or a madam  this miss de gray is i say allowing great matters for you i know but four people upon earth  and one of them is a crowned head  who can either sit in a sedan carry themselves in a coach or fill a chair  on the day of marriage which shall not be distant if mr de gray behaves prudently i shall decorate you with my own hand mean while you will doubtless become sensible of the accomplishments of your future husband  adieu c of b  letter lxii sir andrew flight to mr heathcoate here is a fine piece of work cut out heathcoate aunt and uncle have resolved to marry me to lucia de gray the old foolish lord has sent me a letter which set me laughing for a whole hour he bids me look upon the damsel as upon the happy she who is to be the cara spsa of sir andrew flight he bids me prepare for marriage  marriage heathcoate if i ever marry  why then  but by the sacred souls of all the lords barons farls dukes dutchesses popes cardinals kings and grand monarques that went before me i will turn this event to some pleasant advantage i say pleasant because to think upon it seriously is quite and clean out of the question lucia de gray is too modest yet too aweful and too much  a thousand times too much hovered over by a set of cutthroat fellows who would slice me and eat me were i to pretend to the serious fact and between ourselves i believe both carlisle and medway are in her train to say the truth she is a woman i can never laugh either with or at for as to the former i never could make her smile at the expense of another in my whole life no not even the hewsons who might set the muscles of the very devil upon the simper and as to the latter she does every thing so unaffectedly that ridicule is obliged to give up the subject in despair then she has a cursed method of looking so as to command deference and therefore beautiful as she is i hate to be in her company  nevertheless heathcoate if i do not draw from this precious epistle of my uncle some divine un  but enough  time will show  i am now likely to be in the very meridian of my species of enjoyment  after much fatigue of  laughing i have brought the hewsons to the true perfection of absurdity  a very little time will show you that the ludicrous can go no farther than i have made it go in them  such joy  such frolic  such  but it would be absolutely iniquitous to forestall the business  no let it take you by surprise  let it come on you unawares  let it seize you unprepared and deluge your cheeks in tears of extacy  farewell a f   letter lxiii mr gabriel hewson to miss de gray charming madam it is impossible to have been so long burning under the torrid rays of your transporting beams of beauty without becoming sensible to their piercing  heartpiercing fervor as well might the tender bud lie on the shore of india without being parched by the favors of apollo  a titled gentleman now at my elbow but whose name i am not yet entitled to disclose is as it were my guardian genius and tells me that you charming madam have within these few days been pleased out of the benignity of your gracious self to speak of my parts and person with some condescending complacency this emboldens me charming madam to say that i think you are the most incomparable piece of celestial workmanship in the way of woman that ever glowed under the astonished eyes of a small spectator  the natural consequence of all this madam is that i am the humblest of your idolaters i find charming madam met in you all the graces which horace pliny homer virgil and all other writers ancient or modern give to their several favorites your lips are sweeter than those attributed to briseis  your hair has more of the nitidus in it than belonged to that which was the distinguishing property of the divine lyces and your air is considerably more ennobled than that of the majestic dido queen of carthage celebrated in the aeneid written by virgil  i should never charming madam have presumed to address such ambitious sentiments to your exalted elegance were i not told that you prefer scientific superiority to personal perfection some persons have been pleased to flatter me with possessing pretty fully the laurels of the first excellence and as to the last though nature has not endowed me altogether with the graces of a carlisle yet i find in my glass an alteration somewhat for the better every day and hope in the end to step without any kind of embarrassment  i take lovesecrets to be amongst the sanctum sanctorum of arduus rebus and therefore i beg this may be confined to the sacred shrine of your most beautiful bosom  i am charming madam your obsequious slave in rosy fetters gabriel hewson p s  omnia vincit amor    letter lxiv mr henry hewson to mr heathcoate esquire esquire i have not catched up goose feather for some time case why because i was amind to gee time for the perfaction of the thing  i am got a woundly way since my last and fancy a couple oweeks more will finish me that is if sir andrew sticks close by me and i continues to practice the thing  case why practice makes parfect to show you that i have not been silent for nothing i must let you know that i have not changed ten words with hett this week case why what is so far from the go of the genteel gig as to take notice of ones household spouse before company specially when a body is learning a touch of the times to say truth her lips looked develish ruddy the other day and i lent um a smack that echoed like wagon whip  for i could not help it seeing that is she is one of your dainty ones  but sir andrew soon took me aside and ga me a bit of a lesson and made me heartily ashamed on it i must let you know too that i manage my little bit of a black sack bobbishly thof ribbons and flourrididdles at sides tickle nape of ones neck consumedly neither do i look so damned ugly as might be surspected regard to frenchfied foretop and hairbundles stuck out side of ones head fat of ones feace helps to take of hugeness of thing which is but natural seeing that one swells out the other and this makes feace and hair go as a man may say cheekbyjowl without quarreling it is pity i am given to sweattin so much as i find it dont do at all for a bettermost person i have got half dozen fine white handkerchiefs but they are so cussed cambrickey that they are nothing in such a grepe as mine and i melt so this fmoaking weather that i make  em every mothers son quite of a stew truth is i begin to see pliteness has like every thing else vantages and not vantages when i was an ignoramus i used to sit in hall or ride to hayfield with nightcap on head or colored handkerchief under hat for vantage of dripping in summertide but no such matter now there is nothing so illbred as to be caught sweattin nay more than that it is quite out of the go of the thing to mention the very word  it is sweattin with fellers of yesterday but i find it is presfieration with folks that are obliged to be desunt sir andrew has been t me some time seeing i cannot keep this presfieration to myself to bleed and bolus for six weeks or so that i may vacuate some of my moister and dry up my porusses abit what do you think of this esquire i hate purgers as i hate lucifer  satancotus as gab calls him but i would even potecarryarize myself for sake of good breeding to tell you the truth there is sort of a pleasant comical nothingatall in the life of your bettermost genii that i like mortationly well indeed i warrant you we went it round the great garden last night by moonshine for two hours  none but your tiptop specie giggling and going it all the time  clack  clack  clack  yes  yes  yes  no  no  no  ha ha ha  he he he  titum titum  titidum  pardon me madam  pardon me miss  skuse me sir  out with the foot  off with the hat  down with the breech  oh esquire  esquire heathcoate it is just the thing to a t last night a little before we went awalkin i finished giving the hand as they call it  that is to say getting a pretty lady over a gutter for instance  or handin her over a puddle or any thing the same way  allowing for thalteration i was once before i had my fortune low enough to say on such cassion come bet het pol mol fan kit or what not  allowing for the alteration  come gee us your fist or tip us your daddle  or lends hold of your forefoot else may hap you may draggle the tail of you in the water odds merciful miserecordibus as gab says no such thing now by a million contrary so much that one of the best things a bettermost body can do is to manage this matter ast should be sir andrew himself for sample is the greatest dabster in the world at it for instance there is he there is a woman and there is a crossing or a slippihin of waterwash mayhap well say covered over with stepping stones  now mark esquire now comes your jemmy work  well  get over they must  indulge me miss or madam or my lady says he allowing for thalteration with the favor of your fair hand  sir you are very plite well  what is next whew  she is a the other side but how the miserecordibus did she get there i wonder says you ah there lies the point now i will tell you first miss etc allowing for the alteration tucks up piece of petticoat sets her pretty foot on stepping stone shows dainty turned ancle and is obliged for the sake of bettermost breedin to look a little as if she was scared oh lord  says she  fear not dear creature divine angel noble madam magnanimous miss etc allowing for the alteration  fear nothing then esquire he takes her hand and takes her waist and gis her a querrick and they take a little bit of a thing twixt a hop and a jump and he kisses her glove and bends hinderpart and bows head and gets grin intos feace and gis a bit of he he he and shows his white powderpurgd grinders and  and  it is all over as neat as the ladys leg i have been a long while on this head case it is almost half way clean up to the top genii and sir andrew clares pon his honor no gentleman can do long without it  i have practiced hugely and i find i am up to every part of the puddlepliteness cept pousing out hinderpart and getting the grin in aiming at the first matter i have overset one of master de greys china jars for the thing is natural i ant made quite so plite as i should be bout the bottom of waist or mayhap a little bit farther so it is out of the question for me to wrigglet as little and limberly as such a fine genteel greyhoundhamd son of a gentleman as sir andrew the grin too is as i just now said a hard thing to hit off i cannot for soul of me find out any thing to make a man laugh at getting a woman over a cartret and as to laughing where one dont see the joke and where the thing is one almost nothing at all i never could do it since i was born besides why i am so cussd covered about the gills that if i could laugh as heartily as sir andrew twould not do for my cheeks are too solidum firmus if a man chose to be learned that it is enough to crack ones cheek furniture i begin to day to learn to hold my tongue or else talk about nothing just as cassion sees fit hett gets on at a pure size sir andrew is giving her a lectur about airs and high notions fanfluttering  hemming and the like now in the garden gab would do very well if his larning did not stand in his way but we shall all be fit to be seen in a short time before we go back though as to coming near captain carlisle that is impossible yet i am sure he never took any pains to be bettermost for every thing he does looks too easy for that  same thing with miss lucia  esquire farewell or valley as gab says yours h hewson  letter lxv mrs hewson to sir andrew flight you assure me there is nothing more common than for elegant people to write to each other while they are under the same roof you propose lord and lady shuttlecock of your acquaintance as examples who you tell me when even they are chagrind retire to their chambers and keep the waiting woman upon the hurryscurry with carrying notes of reproach to and fro for several hours well i protest i wish the practice were universal for it is mighty pretty but then indeed it would become vulgar and after that it would nauseate  miss lucia is so filled with spleen and megrim that there is no getting an answer out of her as to corresponding with you sir andrew whom i see every hour what can i possibly have to say if you wish me upon paper as well as in person to assure you that i most cordially detest  detest every thing that was once most charming i will repeat it no truth was ever clearer those lasses who were favorites formerly in my village are now as detestable to me as the village itself i was once so great a novice as to find pleasure in seeing my rustic neighbors walk in their sunday dresses with their happy homely husbands and assemble in the shade my foolish heart leapt as they sat singing at their doors or working at their windows  the very hollo  howdoyou and hailfellowwellmet had all attractions for me  the smell of an haycart was pleasure and the sight of an harvesthome absolute extacy note the alteration i am wholly inverted in point of pleasure if on my return to helterskelterhall which is fitting up i feel any satisfaction from the sight of people working at windows or singing at doors it will be upon account of the pride of comparing their grovelling situation with mine if i bear the noise of an haycart it will be only from reflecting that my carriagehorses for such i will have shall fare the better for it  if i can again reconcile to myself the presence of lads and wenches dizened out in their foolish finery it will only be for the joy of my sweeping by them in magnificence that shall make them shy off with amazement and if an harvesthome can ever more become supportable it will only be from the consideration that it comes but once a year and is then over for a twelvemonth  what other arguments can i use to convince you of my readiness to adopt the modes and manners you speak of  as to mr hewson  he is a very good creature and when you have done with him i shall love him better than ever i cannot come into your opinion about the elopement you speak of be it ever so fashionable for i most assuredly do love harry and therefore it is impossible your assertions of tenderness to me i am to take you know as mere effects of sentiments which are to come of course and as such they are very gallant i shall not indeed be in any degree angry with you for the continuance of such civilities in the way of promoting breeding nor will i scruple any thing so accomplished a gentleman proposes except the elopement scheme which i again say i can never consent to any thing else i obey  nay i have convinced you of it i do not speak to harry before company i walk and step as different as possible from what i did  i perceive the absolute necessity of only occasionally hearing and seeing i find every now and then as violent a desire to faint after a little decent walking as lady blessingbourne herself  i was almost expiring with the smell of violets last night in my room though i used to dote on them i can drink two glasses and exactly another half of wine and water  my dinners of late never digest without a drop of ratasia those drops and restoratives which i before never heard of but in books are now a part of my existence i can bear no smells but such as are artificial every thing natural actually turns upon my stomach i used to rise at six i am now never up till near twelve  i used to let my arms brave the sunbeams  i now sleep in gloves  i used to defy the tan i now never venture to stir without a shade  what would you wish more  my seven oclock lesson in lucias bower shall certainly not be forgotten mean time i have the great honor to be  sir andrew flights most obedient and very humble servant henrietta hewson  letter lxvi miss de gray to miss lascelles o miss lascelles what strange and unaccountable confusions are every hour happening in this house here is now come down formal overtures from lord blessingbourne for the ever fickle sir andrew flight the countess too has written to me in a way that ought to make me ill satisfied with her my father has had a letter and sir andrew himself received encouragement in this business from  his own vanity he sent into my chamber this morning the ridiculous enclosure but i must break off my letter almost as soon as i have begun it a summons is given which i never disobey in haste therefore  adieu lucia de gray the enclosed sir andrew flights letter to miss de gray what lovely lucia is to be done in this business the old folks you see are resolved  what says your heart upon the subject please to consult that and at your leisure make acquainted with its determinations  your andrew flight     letter lxvii mr de gray to the earl of blessingbourne my lord i can now take upon me to say i should do some violence to my childs inclination and perhaps wound the bosom of another person equally dear to me were i to carry on any longer the most distant idea of a tender connection betwixt her and sir andrew flight it is impossible that i should reply to more of your lordships last peculiar letter or indeed that i should with any propriety lengthen this letter beyond adding to it the name of  your lordships obedient and most humble servant robert de gray  letter lxviii captain carlisle to g lascelles if i described to you in my last a scene that was painful i have now one to relate that is dreadful mr de gray again desired today a conference with me  miss de gray was to partake of it  ten minutes before we had met accidentally in the garden and after a moments pause of confusion parted precipitately by different walks  this second interview therefore came upon us before the anxiety occasioned by the first had worn off our disorder became exceedingly visible and neither of us spoke for a minute though during that minute it was the elaborate design of both to speak  have you not received a letter said mr de gray to lucia  a letter sir said she trembling  yes my dear from   from miss lascelles do you mean sir oh yes i had one this day   no lucia i mean from the earl of blessingbourne  from lord blessingbourne papa  here lascelles i rose as if to withdraw  pray mr carlisle dont leave us no business can happen at this house without your being a welcome party  yes my dear lucia i mean from the earl  no indeed sir  nor from the countess  yes sir  i  i must confess i am honored with one from the countess  may i see it  if i have it about me sir  but i am afraid  oh no  here it is  read it to us my dear girl we know what the countess can do  and i have i believe the fellow of it  excuse me sir i have got a terrible cough if you please i will leave it with you and captain carlisle  pray my best lucia dont stir  come clement  here take my letter too and read both to us   i sir   then i will  here lascelles he read first the earls and then that of the countess upon which i had the rashness to exclaim  i am not very apt to give way to my indignation but if i had here that scoundrel lord who can suffer his wife to insult such a woman as miss de gray i would twist his nose off  oh my dear lascelles what a scene ensued lucia turned pale  fixed her eyes upon me in a kind of gentle reproach and after making an effort to retire she fell lifeless on the floor god of heaven what did i feel at that moment  she continued to rise only to faint again  i kneeled down  i caught her in my arms  my tears bathed her beautiful hand  i staggered under the weight of her through enfeebling agony  her dear lips quivered  i leaned down in my confusion even till i felt her cheek upon mine  i kissed the tears away  her father was speechless  she revived a little but again relapsed and without alarming any other part of the house which her delicacy desired might be the case she was conducted by mr de gray into her apartment he is still by her side  i went out in an agony and i write this in the same situation what can possibly be the meaning of all this  is sir andrew then at last the man  was she so violently hurt at my menace against lord blessingboune does her passion extend to the very roots of the family what then becomes of medway whatever be the truth  it is certain that lucia de gray is wretched and therefore it is impossible the most poignant misery should be escaped by the unfortunate  clement carlisle  letter lxix mr lascelles to captain carlisle i have the pleasure to inform my dear friend that augusta is more reconciled to her situation than could be expected she seems at length to become conscious of the propriety of taking our advice admires you for the fortitude of your virtue and even induces the idea of soon seeing the marquis whom bytheby it is near time to hear from i dispatch this news in a short note merely because i am convinced it will communicate to you the pleasure it has already given  your g lascelles  letter lxx captain carlisle in answer your favor relating the happy change in

business  the marchioness begins to rave about her confinement which without the presence of carlisle is she says insupportable she raves  she stamps  she insists upon seeing him thirteen love letters

glorious fire which she expresses there shall in due time burn for you  i  george lascelles the successful have said it my sister has written twice to miss lucia of late  she always gives me her packets to put in the office  not knowing but she might say something improper of the violent marchioness i threw the aforesaid packets not into the office but into the fire  my head and hands are full but the lady is beyond every thing that was ever before seen on this side heaven and so i shall go through it with spirit for the sake of my beloved baronet  i have been thinking that a few new trinkets might soften a hard place or two  she came unaccommodated you know if you were to supply this matter you might perhaps get her vanity in your favor  that is a wonderful point gained when afterward she came to know that one of the richest as well as neatest men in england was the accommodator and upon so disinterested a principle too why it is ten to one  the thing is at least worth an effort or two  whatever therefore you remit shall be laid out to the most promising advantage i am pretty well versed in the baubles that set a womans eyes sparkling and if you can once charm the eyes

wanting some employment as i told you to amuse the time betwixt four oclock and mrs h  s appointment i must needs swagger away into the garden where i knew medway the monster had just withdrawn with his angle he was standing with his eyes fixed intently upon the line greedily devouring the dancing cork upon the stream when i passed by on the opposite side as not seeing him the earls letter was in my hand  i appeared to be tickled to the soul i affected to hold my sides with the pain of laughing i mentioned the name of lady lucia thrice with rapture my hero threw down his fishingrod and coming round to me with inconceivable violence and the most scarlet visage you ever beheld even more a flame than a setting sun he cries out  puppy jackanapes  what did you frighten away my fish for the largest carp that ever was seen nibbled that moment at my bait had it not been for you i should have hooked him what name likewise was that i heard you mention  it sounded like lucia  what letter is

will not be sported with sir andrew  nay i am all upon honorable terms there are no secrets  it is to be a public affair olly there is the letter for thy inspection  he took it hastily  while he was swallowing the contents up came captain carlisle but seeing us engaged with his usual politeness was going to take another part of the garden as if from some secret impulse that worse was at hand i beckoned him he walked toward me  so then you are a fellow who make pretensions to miss de gray are you  i did by no means like a certain illlook about his eyes and therefore replied mildly  as to that my dear olly you may easily see it was all my uncles doing  my uncle you see   your uncle be damned replied he have you written to the lady yourself  written to the lady my dear olly written to the lady  why as to a letter to the lady   look ye sir andrew as i know you dont run into danger i shall not hurt you but i must just inform you casually that for equivocating you are a most abominable coward and as to the matter of daring but to think of miss lucia  hush  hush  my dear say no more upon that subject  i shall be satisfied with giving you to the fish that is all   at the close of this speech he caught hold of my arm and would absolutely have twirled me souse into the pond had not carlisle ran briskly to my rescue and saved me from the barbarians fury he even told carlisle that he insulted the fishes by saving me and then walked away growling like a lion  poor carlisle seemed to be sadly out of spirits and when he had rescued me bowed with his wonted elegance as if i had done him the favor and walked dejectedly away  such heathcoate has been my fun  however bad luck now better hereafter says the proverb to convince you that i have a bolder heart than you imagine i will in despite of events go this moment to mrs h  for my watch tells me it is exactly the time  adieu a flight  letter lxxvi mr medway to the duke of downderdale my lord if you knew me

miss lascelles my misery increases every moment  i am scarce able to hold the the pen  carlisle still avoids me most assiduously  yet it is a generous sentiment of his that has reduced me to the state in which i have for some time been involved my father has been several times on the point of making particular enquiries but so great a simpleton am i that whenever he takes hold of my hand and begins to press it to his bosom i tremble from head to foot and he is deterred from speaking i am certain my heart will break if an alteration does not soon take place medway has again this minute been aiming his moonstruck mysteries at me coming out of my chamber i saw him upon the staircase i dont wonder child at your indisposition said he  but hush  hush  think of it no more  you may depend upon

half distracted  the marchioness has escaped  my sister discovered me just as i was about to pull the fruit which was makebelieve ripening for our tool sir andrew and i am in the utmost confusion  to crown the whole i have reason to think that cursed letter of carlisles got safe to hand while mine miscarried  for within this hour i have noticed two strange muffled up fellows walking backwards and forwards within sight of my dining room windows  perhaps the marquis himself may be in town and according to his italian custom these may be his desperadoes who will dog me to my destiny  i am all

and conversation has given me a very poor opinion of   i caught hold of her again   she threw me from her and gave a shriek  but what of that  to make the matter ten times more terrible her exclaiming arroused the ear of the pensive carlisle who was sitting not far off never saw i such manly menaces upon the brow of mortal his look awed me more than the loudest threats of the terrific medway  fie sir andrew said he when the lady was walking off in pretty confusion  is this well concerted must you violate the laws of hospitality at the very time that you seduce simplicity  fie upon it  i am not one sir andrew who pique myself upon breaking in upon the private revellings of the libertine but the ground you now tread upon is consecrated by belonging to your friend  if that sir has no weight with you i must add something to its force by informing you that it is the property of my guardian  saying this he gave a gentle inclination of his head and passed on  oh heathcoate heathcoate how diminutively was i shrunk up how despicably was i dwindled after his departure i sat a little while under the agony of being the subject of my own ridicule annihilation just then would have been a blessing and i sneaked into the house at last as melancholy a mite as even crawled upon the earth to finish the matter carlisle treated me at supper as if nothing had happened  adieu a flight  letter lxxx mr lascelles to mr heathcoate the fellows that hovered over my house have disappeared and i take up the pen again in more quiet to speak upon the subject of the runaway marchioness ah what a line of success was i in if my cursed passion had not made it crooked  but there was no possibility of resisting the temptation  i saw the lovely creature in so many different positions  this moment she dropped upon her knee to call blessings on her carlisle  the next she sprung up and execrated her fatal partiality twas in vain under such circumstances to attack her in my own person  she looked  she loved  she existed only in carlisle what was to be done stratagem assisted  i counterfeited the hand of carlisle  made in his name a solemn appointment to meet her with mr lascelles permission  enjoined a sacred league of reciprocal silence during the midnight visit  was punctual to the assignation  assumed the murmurs of carlisles mellifluous voice and was received with rapture  felicity was before me  but i was interrupted even at this very moment just as the heaven of beauty was in prospect it was contrived by some demon that detests me to occasion a stumble as i was stepping along the apartment by appointment no lights were to be admitted  but this unfortunate stroke soon introduced one and it was brought in the hand of my very sister the marchioness was fixed in astonishment  i knew not which way to stir  the rest is too painful to repeat  we left augusta in her chamber but about an hour after we were departed my sister to weep and i to curse myself i heard somebody go softly down stairs and presently tampering at the bars of the streetdoor  i followed the impulse of my suspicions and hurried down also  you are not to be told it was the marchioness  i besought her to return  without condescending to reply she proceeded in her efforts upon my interfereing a second time she exclaimed in a voice that at once terrified and commanded me  villain set me at liberty  i was fool and idiot enough to obey her  she rushed into the street like lightning and being habited in her boys apparel ran along unsuspected  caroline does nothing but upbraid  one thing is the marchioness has no idea of carlisles address  at all events i must weather it out  perhaps all may again be well  whatever folly you commit let not the cursed lusts of the flesh get the better of your policy  adieu adieu george lascelles  letter lxxxi captain carlisle to mr lascelles how is it that i do not hear any thing respecting the marchioness  but you will send me by the bearer geoffry an

adieu  i have a little disguised my hand for fear of accidents  but no more  adieu  ten thousand times adieu   carlisle   this fallacious piece of wickedness under the appearance of tenderness was delivered as usual by the execrable lascelles  to what end do you think  ah my dear signora it is too shocking for your fancy ever to conjecture it with a blush i tell you that on my part  for oh signora i loved to death  the moment of assignation was expected with unutterable impatience it was observed  the apartment was dark  universal tremor shook every nerve as i heard the step approach me  but the foot in advancing encountered a chair  sure it was placed there by providence to produce the alarm which discovered to me    i am overwhelmed in tears  which discovered the villainy of lascelles and carlisle yes viola carlisle the great the elegant the virtuousseeming carlisle  carlisle degenerated to a mere pander  an ordinary wretch who had agreed to sacrifice the woman that adored him  sacrifice her to the man with whom he placed her for protection  but this is not half his baseness  this was not an enormity of sufficient magnitude for the illustrious carlisle when lascelles left the room while i was hurrying on my boys apparel resolved to escape  i felt under my feet some papers which my good genius directed me to take up i got safe from the detested house and wandered a solitary wretch in the streets i knew not whither it could not yet be past two oclock in the morning and the watchmen who are always abroad till after that hour were still upon their guard as there are lamps disposed through all the parts of this city i stood under one of them to examine my papers which i judge must have fallen from lascelles pocket  they contained  they contained  o pity me viola  read  read their infamous contents and confess that your poor marchioness has but too much justice in the vengeance which she is resolved to take  the enclosed papers paper i

widow i would dissuade you from it rather follow my first advice and as i do assure you she is perfectly detestable to me make the easiest terms you can with her but you still insist on treating her with terms of honor what will you show fidelity to her after she has received you under the notion of your being clement carlisle i must again say that you are too generous to such a wanton but act as

marchioness i dote upon my beautiful intended  adieu c carlisle   such were the complottings levelled by two barbarous men my viola against your poor  your unhappy marchioness i thought madness would have seized me at the moment of reading such a black design  a design my viola which lascelles was cruel enough to endeavor to carry into execution  but why do i tell you of the misery i have sustained  why do i dwell upon the hardships of passing formerly through the streets of london while every happier heart was at rest  what are these viola to the agony of a soul burning with revenge  marriage too  the villain is upon the verge of matrimony is he this then is the cause of all my misery  of all my disappointments his truth his love his tenderness is all reserved for another woman it

preparations for his marriage  oh my brain  my brain  i would die with transport to prevent it  it must be prevented  my oath  my oath  my oath  farewell  in continuation  i have had a second string to my vow of vengeance i shift my place alternately from watching the house of carlisle to that from which i have a prospect upon lascelles by this means i am mistress of both nothing can happen but

day in vain to pacify my outrageous sister but to no purpose her cursed virtue plagues me to death i have dispatched a line to carlisle which i hope will keep all quiet till by some means i can recover the marchioness  but at present i have not had courage to step over my own threshold since the cursed accident happened one thing consoles me not a little i perceive two papers which i purposely wrote forged and dropped in augustas apartment are  beyond my expectation as she went away in the night  picked up as she knows not carlisles address in the country and is i believe without much money  she may be tempted to return on the other hand if these scheming papers have fallen into my sister carolines possession it is worse still  however at all events i take care no letters shall go out or come into my house without my knowledge yet i suspect that caroline receives letters left for her at some other place  i know not what to think the cursed uncertainty too of the marquiss journey either to my place of direction or to carlisles much increases my anxiety ah heathcoate heathcoate what a hell it is to be liable to so many terrible apprehensions o guilt guilt guilt  adieu g lascelles  letter lxxxvi from the same to captain carlisle previous to lascelless receipt of the captains last  i did not my dear captain write to you again upon the subject of the

necessary  to multiply those attentions which are employing your generous heart at prudenceplace i am astonished at the marquiss delay your letter must have miscarried is it not advisable to write

greatest in the world  the poor girl is quite sick upon my delay  she chides me with her looks every time i see her i cannot even have leisure enough to put to death the uncle and nephew  they must

she already kept her chamber  mum  mum  no noise  i have the thing that will settle the business in my pocket  this conversation was like all his discourse in set solemn sentences  mr de gray with an air of sadness upon his venerable brow came into the room and we parted  oh lascelles help me to language  help me to sentiments which describe sensations of horror that i may transmit to you some idea of the feeling that took hold of my heart when i beheld medway put as if by stealth into the hand of mr de gray a paper that seemed to be stamped with several seals  though it was too much like a letter and too small to be a settlement yet my fancy suggested it was some deed sufficient to my destruction   had not water been at hand i should certainly have dropped  to swell the circumstance both the hewsons and sir andrew flight were in the room  this was not all mr de gray seemed to receive the packet with pleasure and retired rather abrupter than he was wont to do when he leaves a company  medway hummed a love sonnet and capered about the room passing by me every now and then with a wink  the trial was too hard to be supported i withdrew what was to be done it was plain that sir andrews affair was out of the question medway  medway only was the man for medway  the cruel  ah why do i call her cruel  the charming lucia de gray was now languishing in her chamber for him she had been long indisposed  his image it was that filled her thoughts  his person it was that charmed her eyes  he only was  to  to   i lost my senses lascelles  and i now lose them again at the

so  upon these words she went again into the house in anger and agony inexpressible but who could ever have suggested that her passion for that strange man should have made her so sensible of the slightest impression against his character his very name pronounced in a loud voice sets her on flame  an old friend  ungenerous to an old friend  to be sure i have known mr medway some time  i have  but why do i argue upon the subject  every moment makes my disappointment more manifest  why then am i perplexing my heart with constant attempts to explain what if i was not wilfully blinded is as clear as the light of heaven the only wise part  the only possible part for me now to act is directly to withdraw perhaps the morrow may complete my misery mr de gray is now even now adjusting the ceremony  the very ring is before me were i to stay longer i should not be able to answer either for my truth or my honor oh lucia  lucia  lucia  i can no more   p s  the  00l you shall have from my own hand  dear friend farewell  c carlisle    letter xci mr de gray to mr medway conscious dear mr medway of no sort of offense but on the contrary feeling for you the same warmth of friendship as usual i am not a little surprised at the turn and coloring of the sentiment in your last letter i have now puzzled over it a great while without being in any measure rewarded for my pains to speak the whole truth i do not comprehend one sentence of your whole favor you seem to be agitated and desirous of performing certain ceremonies with peculiar privacy at a very early hour of the morning and yet i cannot conceive of what nature those ceremonies should be nor if they are of an hostile complexion can i suggest to myself whence they should happen i beg you will be so friendly as to explain this matter if you can point out to me any circumstance that to your eye looks like an impropriety no man will be more willing to be instructed how it may be amended if it should prove that you are yourself mistaken no man will more cheerfully impute it to that origin from whence many similar errors have proceeded namely from excessive sensibility  i am my dear medway your obedient servant

insolent if i see your grace again on this side heaven it will be with honor if not i shall meet you in elysium your lordship  i should say  your grace will pardon my being a little jocular upon these

ol medway  letter xcvii captain carlisle to mr de gray i feel myself of late my very dear friend not quite so well in my health i impute it to the recent alteration of climate a little excursion may possibly assist me and therefore i propose to set out tomorrow morning to my town house and so back again  but as it is possible my dear sir some changes may happen in your family before my return i will with your leave joined to that of mr medway who i understand is now closeted with you make bold to pay my parting devoir  in your presence  to miss de gray perhaps sir it is decreed that i am never more to salute her under that appellation nothing however can happen that can violate the heartfelt esteem with which  i am my dear sir your most affectionate servant clement carlisle  letter xcviii mr lascelles to mr heathcoate joy joy heathcoate  i  i i have recovered my lost treasure  recovered her though by compulsion  i caught her upon the lookout for captain carlisle and as good luck would have it scarce ten minutes before old limping geofery the captains favorite footman arrived with a letter from his master  i am ready to leap out of my skin though as to the lady herself never did i see such a dreadful alteration her visage pale her eyes dim her air languid  she scarce seems to have taken refreshment since her escape  though my sister kneels down and presses her with tears to eat she most obstinately refuses what a violent woman i gave it out to two fellows whom i had upon the scout that she was a relation of mine hurt in her senses who had broke from us her behavior to them on being seized justified this for in getting her up stairs to her old apartment she took a little pocketknife from her side and aimed it with full force at one of the mens throats i own i am sorry to see her in this situation though i had rather have her any way than have her to look for carlisle would certainly have taken vengeance now all may be well again i am glad to see my sister behave so prudently to augusta in a day or two i shall send you better news about her if i ever again run the risque of gratifying my passion at the price of my policy then execrate  your old unfortunate g lascelles p s  i am going down on wednesday to fight for five hundred pounds olly medway is to be the mark the money you may be sure is to be for andrews friends the fame he may put into his pocket if he pleases it is to be within half a mile of prudence place  yet shall i not be seen i shall fire my pistol and come away again directly as to my exit that is out of the question i am shotfree    letter xcix captain carlisle to mr lascelles  the strangest as well as the most sudden alteration has happened in the affairs at prudence place that you can possibly imagine oh my lascelles i am lighter than the air  the dead weight is taken from my bosom  i have neither a thorn in my heart nor a wrinkle on my brow though the path that led to this paradise was not without brambles that obstructed it presented at last the smoothest the most lawny as well as the most rosy prospect in the world  you shall hear  unable any longer to bear the increasing perplexities of my situation i wrote a letter of excuse to mr de gray for a weeks absence and went to pay my farewell respects to lucia  suggesting what might be the state of my feelings at the close of such an interview i took care to have my carriage waiting for me at the door the moment i left her apartment  nor did i even allow myself this pleasure of entering her apartment at all till i had preinvited mr de gray to be present and even till i had apprized mr medway of the sole purpose of my visit  i meant only to make  my heart ach  and withdraw  oh human nature   mr de gray opened the door to me he had scarce entered himself  behind him stood  medway making his salutations to lucia who upon seeing me advance put on as of late had been usual a sort of anxiousness which i have been but too apt to construe in my disfavour  lucia de gray looked as if she thought it a strange meeting  pray sit down gentlemen said she in a fluttering manner  pray sit down  her father took her by the hand i was preparing to speak on the subject of my departure  but could for the soul of me get no farther than  i am come madam  i am come miss de gray  i am  i am come   very true captain replied mr de gray taking me up briskly you are come extremely apropos  you are come just in time to be a witness to    oh lascelles my perverting fancy caught at the only wrong construction of the sentiment and i interrupted him by exclaiming  excuse me my dear mr de gray  pray excuse me  i would dedicate not only my leisure but my life to the wishes of your family  but to be a witness  to be a witness my good sir upon so interesting an occasion  is  is  is  indeed i could not be of any service  service mr carlisle said medway  there is no service in the case  the only service you can be of in promoting the design of our visit to this young lady is to be a witness that i have had all the reason in the world to suppose i was beloved by her  was it ever questioned mr medway said i  questioned  retorted miss de gray  questioned mr carlisle  beloved by me  mr medway beloved by me   yes madam i  said medway  now then we come to the point replied mr de gray   perhaps these explanations said i may be improper before me  i certainly intrude  family affairs are sacred  i beg permission to withdraw  had i known you were upon business of so much delicacy   stay mr carlisle answered lucia with more firmness than is usual to such extreme delicacy as here is  it is a justice you owe me to stay sir  with regard to you mr medway i beg to know upon what misconstruction you found the astonishing fact you charge me with   astonishing fact madam rejoined medway  is it not clear have i not fed my fond heart with this idea many months  did you not always meet me with a smile  have i not a thousand times said that you was made to be the best wife in the world  have i not been ready to murder any man that should dare to look steadfastly at you has not your father heard me declare that i would lose my blood in your service  here lucia lifted up her hands again  i grant all this my dear medway said mr de gray but surely this is no foundation for a passion lucia smiles whenever she meets any of her friends it is a complacency that belongs to her character  it belongs even to her face her features are made for giving welcome to her fathers friends  such mr medway most certainly is  lookee mr de gray replied medway  hush  hush  no noise about this business  i am no talker i have been intending to make your daughter my wife a long while i thought both you and she knew plain enough my meaning especially as i was exceeding cautious least it should be known to any body else  which i despise i took the affair for granted it seems i am deceived nobody understood my meaning but myself  the business is easily brought to an issue here is the upshot do you now mr de gray approve of my beginning more explicit overtures  that question said mr de gray is first to be submitted to my daughter you are a worthy man and i here declare i have no objection to any gentleman upon whom i have any solid reasons to believe she places her affections  give me your hand cried medway you speak fairly  i love honor better than life  life  it is my heaven  well miss lucia now is the time every thing rests with you  guess if you can lascelles what i underwent at this moment my heart was at my lips  since it is incumbent on me to speak said the beautiful trembler i must confess that though there is no man i more esteem than mr medway as a friend yet yet in the light of  of  a lover i  i  cannot say that  that  pray be not displeased with me if i say that    enough said enough said  hush  hush  i am only angry said medway that you did not tell me so before but  no noise  i see it was partly my own fault give me a buss  you are a good girl  a bad one at a hint though  hush  hush  you are a bad one at a hint give me your hand mr de gray i thought i was acting the right part  but i am too old and too odd a fellow to die of disappointment so all i have farther to say on the subject is this dont speak of my affair below  let us separate  let us go down a little after one another  who is the wiser who is the wiser  another moment if you please said mr de gray rising and advancing to lucia whom in the course of the conversation he had left  since matters have gone thus far and we are all friends together tell me lucia if you think there is any other person who may be going on in the same mistake if so we may rectify it in time do you imagine any other in this family for instance lays claim to your tenderness my dear  my god lascelles what a question  no indeed sir answered lucia with a sigh  oh yes rejoined medway that bit of a baronet sir andrew flight  sir andrew flight cried she hastily  the matter was not improbable with so worthy a man as mr medway but surely sir andrew flight could never    madam returned medway i was about to have jerked him into a fish pond upon that account if you have ever any thing to say to such a fellow as that i will never forgive you  perhaps it may be in your power mr carlisle said mr de gray coming round to me to help us to another upon the lovers list  think of my confusion lascelles after great hesitation i spoke as follows while lucia went first to one window then to the other as if taking different views of the garden  i must own sir it does not seem difficult for me to mention another of miss de greys admirers the difficulty would be in finding a person of her acquaintance who did not come under that character  come come carlisle no noise  no noise said medway you have yourself been her admirer any time these    here lucia turned round with a face blooming with a thousand blushes  mr carlisle my admirer mr medway    yes miss de gray mr carlisle has to my knowledge been your admirer before he went to italy you may thank me  for now i see the whole train of my mistake  that he has pined and grieved and    for heavens sake mr medway said lucia  clement said mr de gray medway is too hard upon you he has had a slight scratch of the passion himself and he wants to make us believe you have had a wound too but come mr medway i have something to show you in the library  such a fishingpole as perhaps you never saw  they both went out of the room handinhand  lucia attempted to follow  and must you go then miss de gray said i  go replied she turning  lord why not mr carlisle  i am going to see the fishingpole  what a blessing i should have deemed it miss de gray if this discovery had been made before i went to italy  what did you say mr carlisle  italy  good god  has your italian attractions then    o lucia  lucia i can hold no longer  too long  too long already has a sense of honor and a religious regard to what i all the time thought your happiness kept me silent  for this i bleed  for this i was in despair  for this too it was that i was again preparing to depart  but  truth requires no longer sacrifice my feelings may now again show themselves  again may i adore those charming eyes  again  you are not angry with me lucia  angry with you  clement  dear generous lucia de gray  this hand must bear the impression of my gratitude  pshaw  nonsense  how can you carlisle but you were departing  whither would you go carlisle  i had forgot that my chaise is at the door lucia  and must you go then clement   go my adorable lucia yes i must go this moment  i must go as fast as my feet can carry me to  order my horses to be put into mr de greys stable  how soon you men alter your minds clement  ah lucia lucia i am now possessing one of the happiest moments of my life  i am myself not miserable carlisle  and  and  and so take my hand and    do with it what i please    for the first time since my return i not only kissed that lascelles but ravished a rapture upon her rosy lip here is an end of my conversationletter  i shall not come to town  my horses are turned to grass  love is likely to allow them a long feast of pasturage  i cannot tell you how light i feel at the heart  but let me not in my ecstasy forget my friend the cash which i designed to bring myself i now remit a draft for i beg you will ever continue to command on all sorts of occasion the services of  yours clement carlisle  letter c mr lascelles to mr heathcoate a misery and a misfortune more extreme than before has fallen upon me  the marquis is come  the marchioness is every thing but absolutely distracted  my sister is overwhelmed in tears i am plunging in the abyss of despair my whole family is in ruins  a violent thundering at my door last night and almost toward the zenith of it announced the impatience of somebody who had authority to disturb us  ah heathcoate conscious guilt at that moment emasculated my usual hardihood i felt my heart convulsing in my bosom and the shameful drops of fear were upon my brow flying then from my bed wrapped up only in a robe de chamber i charged my servants to deny me  gave my sister the like injunction and then stole with inglorious terror into a kind of lumberroom at the top of the house that i might escape even the voice of my accuser to this precaution probably am i indebted for my life  who heathcoate can expect to conquer the man whom he has wronged for money i am mercenary enough to fight but with the weight of crimes upon the heart ones intrepidity has no room to play  the knocking being for some time repeated and every repetition with more vehemence admittance was at length given  oh these highspirited foreigners no sooner was he entered than he demanded in a tone of implicit command his violated wife he did not it seems wait any reply he did not wait even long enough for obedience in disregard of every thing that looked like ceremony he flew up stairs  rushed from one room to another and found at last the object of his search i heard the shriek of the marchionesss amazement even to the remotest corner of my hiding hole barbarous man abandoned woman reechoed through the cave i was witness to the clamourous denunciation of death upon carlisle and myself i was witness that the marquis was in possession of carlisles address  the name of de gray and even of lucia were articulated with curses of vengeance  with execrations still stronger was all future connection with the marchioness renounced and he rushed down the staircase at last swearing never more to close his eyes till his revenge as far as it could be had in this world that was his expression was complete  since his departure i have crept from my sanctuary and tried but not without tremor to gain admittance to the apartment of augusta she has drawn a triple bolt across the door  she will not speak  my sister is on the bed of sickness o truth what a deity art thou  thy smile might chase away despair but what are these reflections to the pusillanimous and false  g lascelles  letter ci from the marquis of n to miss de gray madam do a stranger the honor to deliver the enclosed after you have yourself read it to the greatest and most accomplished villain upon earth i take this mode of getting my letter to his hand that you whom i presume to be young and innocent may if not too late escape the wrongs that are heaped upon the head of  the marquis of n the enclosed to captain carlisle sir as cowardice is not i hope amongst the number of your vices i send you this honorable warning that i shall be within ten paces of prudence place at twelve oclock this night to pay you a double debt the first in nature of a money obligation the second in recompense for having debauched the wife of a friend your conduct would warrant assassination but i scorn it  the marquis of n p s  i have no design to rob you of the marchioness she is sighing for you where you placed her if you exceed my appointment but a single moment i will be in your house my soul is determined  m of n       letter cii miss de gray to miss lascelles at length my dear miss lascelles the long line of mysteries is unravelled yes my friend the cause of your poor lucias anxiety is now no longer problematical alas it is made but too manifest so there is an italian attachment i find after all the warm heart of captain carlisle could not it seems remain insensible of beauty blooming under so bright a sun nay his passion to do him justice is of the most fashionable kind a wife has been his object to give him greater eclat  the wife of his friend   oh miss lascelles i have not patience to go on  oh that i could find  that i could but have a single glance of this allaccomplished marchioness of n  that is his dulcinea  she must be very handsome  she must certainly surpass all the ladies on this side the line  heavens miss lascelles what an angel she must be  i must be a  but why do i talk of such a deformity as myself the superior charms of the marchioness  oh miss lascelles that i could see her  but from whom do you suppose i received this illustrious intelligence  even from the injured husband himself the letter of the marquis is at this minute before me my eye even now fixes upon that part of the epistle where   oh miss lascelles however merited the vengeance which i now perceive hanging over the head of carlisle his life is still precious to me and i must make an effort at least to prevent the mischief  i thought him my friend the very tutor of truth instead of which i behold him the preceptor of infamy  yet  for his life  let it be preserved that he may mend it  what measure shall i take there is no time for choice or deliberation  a few hours only are between captain carlisle and death  death  death  oh miss lascelles i am distracted  lucia de gray  letter ciii captain carlisle to g lascelles esquire sent previous to his knowledge of the marquiss arrival  such is my joy since this happy alteration in the posture of affairs at prudence place my lascelles that it is impossible for me to leave it again till the loveliest of women is firmly and irrevocably mine i have fixed in my mind saturday next for that blessed change in my condition against which time i could wish to present the lovely lucia de gray with certain little elegancies that might show my attention though they can never add any thing to the graces of her person do you then my friend be my agent upon this occasion let your taste be consulted and give mine the credit of it i enclose you an order for five thousand pounds and i recommend you by a line to a person who has a better mechanical knowledge than you or i of the true water and intrinsic excellence of diamonds this business must be done immediately and you are not to forget that in doing it you oblige lucia de gray at the time you oblige  clement carlisle  letter civ miss lucia de gray to miss lascelles who caroline can say unto misery thus far shall thou go and no farther i am more completely a wretch than ever  soon after i had sent away my last carlisle came to pay me the compliments of the day he paid them with the best dissembled tenderness you ever saw he congratulated his heart upon the return of its tranquillity  he took my hand and carried it with a zeal which any woman might have taken for real to his lips he even talked with blooming cheeks upon the day of marriage he pretended that he suffered unutterable things by delay he said he should never be happy till i was his he absolutely carried the cruel joke so far as to assert he had commissioned your brother to purchase decorations for the joyful day  this seemed a proper opportunity to draw up the curtain and discover the first scene of his farce oh what a dialogue  i think mr carlisle you wrote some letters to my father from the house of a marquis of n during your residence at rome  i did madam  i did my dear lucia  you spoke i think occasionally of the marchioness his lady  i did she is a charming woman except lucia de gray i never saw a lovelier  pshaw your exception is a flattery is she sensible  she is beyond imagination  you were upon very good terms no doubt  the best in the world i have sat the whole evening conversing with her upon subjects even of science  a learned lady then  rather accomplished than learned she wants however that gentleness which distinguishes the lovely lucia de gray  you left her certainly with regret  had it not been for lucia de gray whom i fondly expected to see it might have been so  is she still at rome captain carlisle  i fancy not lucia the marquis visits in rome but his home is paris though the marchioness herself is a native of england and i had the pleasure to revive her acquaintance with her own language so much that she now speaks it as fluently as the french and italian  those were agreeable teteatetes pray did she never express any desire to see her native country  oh often  almost every hour  was it not incumbent on your politeness clement to offer them a    i did but the marquis was obliged to take a journey to the interior part of italy  the marchioness accompanied him him no doubt  no she was ill at that time with a cold and did not go with the marquis  i protest i should not have been surprised if she had in such an absence played truant and come over to her native country with you clement  with me  lucia  come over with me  why that you know would have been  a  a    like a woman of spirit that is all i dare say now clement if you would but confess this has been the case  how can you think so  what reason in nature have you  to  to   why not much reason indeed but a billet which i received this morning mentions a lady that in some degree allowing for the alteration as mr henry hewson says answers the description of the marchioness  may i  may i beg permission to peruse your billet lucia  is it from    it is from a quite new correspondent and bytheby there is a small enclosure for you here are both  i gave him miss lascelles the marquiss letter  it is very true miss de gray said he without any emotion after reading them that the marchioness is at present under my protection and it is true also that she came to england though not with me very soon after me  is it then the marquis is not angry without cause  it is a painful circumstance to relate my dear lucia though there is no guilt on either side you will excuse me on the subject i beg you will for a few hours keep the matter from mr de gray and all the rest of the family i shall certainly wait upon the marquis and accommodate every thing she is still worthy of his affection  did you ever caroline see guilt confessed carried with so high a hand he is so habituated i suppose to crimes of this nature in his italian connexions that he thinks nothing of it it is in his notion i dare say an innocent freedom and not seduction was there ever so composed a libertine he has just made his bow without any other sort of disorder and walked off  let him fight caroline let him fall  i hate the sight of him  i  i  i  oh my god my god what a wretch i am  lucia de gray  letter cv from the same to the same ah caroline caroline i renounced the barbarous reflection  i shuddered at the horrid idea of clement carlisles death this moment have i sent the enclosed to that ungenerous man i wait the issue with anguish inexpressible  adieu adieu the enclosed from miss de gray to captain carlisle sir i conjure you to preserve your life or at least not to risque the loss of it do not meet the marquis ah what have i said have i recommended cowardice to my  to  to mr carlisle yet what can courage do to the man of conscious guilt it can at best only aggravate guilt by precipitating death to the man who is already wronged i charge you to  to  i know not what to say to you captain carlisle you have murdered the peace of the unhappy  lucia de gray     letter cvi from the same to the same he will go miss lascelles  he talks with firmness and the coolest fortitude of his innocence he even accuses me of an unkind suspicion he has that philosophy of assurance if i may so call it to confront conviction yet i am cheared at the idea  ah if it should indeed be possible for his avowed innocence to appear  if it should indeed be possible   alas it is not possible is she not under his protection is she not the handsomest woman in italy is not her husband at hand to take vengeance on the seducer   but yet who knows what softening circumstances may at length turn out on the side of mr carlisle  in the mean time he may perhaps fall a victim to appearances  oh what agony besets me on either side  why caroline do you not write to the wretched  lucia de gray  letter cvii from the same to the same it strikes ten oclock  we have just risen from supper carlisle did the honors of the table my father choosing to sup in his room with as much grace and composure as ever he was neither more dejected nor elated than usual and he behaved to me as if an upbraiding sentiment had never past between us he was dressed in his new regimentals  his colonels commission is come down i think i never saw him look so lovely  he says it seems awkward to be called colonel  surely he must  he must be innocent and if he is  o heavens he is gone out of his room i heard his door shut  excuse me caroline i must not lose sight of him if he goes i have a foreboding that he will fall  what then remains for your  lucia de gray p s  i dare not acquaint my father    letter cviii mr lascelles to mr heathcoate the obstinate marchioness has rejected all nourishment till this day with a pertinacious violence and resolution peculiarly her own i was alarmed even for her life and her death would at this conjuncture of affairs be the most unseasonable thing that could possibly happen this apprehension is removed by the receipt of the enclosed billet  you will there see the terms upon which she requested carlisles direction you will see too that it would have been impolitic in me under such circumstances and especially as she must be too feeble to stir abroad to stand out with her besides this i have her under guard the trusty maryanne will not suffer a second escape the marchioness seems much more composed she does not beat her beautiful bosom she does not loudly lament her fate as before the maid is this moment passing my room in her way to the apartment of my poor sick caroline with assurances of augustas tranquillity  thus far therefore there is a treaty betwixt me and agony but this is only guarding against the enemy in one quarter while one is more open to his attack in another the marquis is certainly hovering about  perhaps he is gone down with the sword of italianttaught revenge even to prudence place upon that supposition the utmost confusion if not the most complicated death succeeds upon that supposition too i am not safe in this house a moment i know not what to do let me think a little  george lascelles the enclosed from the marchioness to mr lascelles the marchioness will be quite easy and will submit with the greatest patience to her confinement if mr lascelles will give her some such written testimony as may be convincing that the person of carlisle is not in imminent danger  if it is in danger the marchioness will never more during her whole life complain if mr lascelles will warn that gentleman of his real situation by forwarding the card enclosed by a special courier  augusta n   to captain carlisle sir one whom it seems you detest and who is in your opinion a wanton takes this method of informing you that while you continue in england your life is at a hazard from the marquis of n as you value that therefore go immediately to some place of safety where you are not the object of an assassin you will think i am sincere in this counsel when i further inform you that the chamber of augusta would be the only part of the world where the tenderness of that foolish wanton dare not now wish you  augusta n     letter cix mr lascelles to mr heathcoate let no man despair heathcoate let him rather put his trust in this maxim of the song the wretch of today may be happy tomorrow blessed be the hand of the postman and may he ever travel through the winter night in security for bringing me so many cordials oh heathcoate how infinitely are our pains and pleasures dependent upon half a sheet of paper made legible by so insignificant a thing as a gooses feather heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid but i have not time for either sentiment or poetry would you believe it my friend all is yet quiet at prudence place carlisles affair with his lucia goes on smoothly and he has absolutely enclosed me an order for five thousand pounds to  to  to  what do you think  even to purchase jewels for the day of marriage could i possibly have a greater proof of nothing having yet happened respecting the marquis  but on the other hand this general quietus cannot much longer be expected we shall certainly soon have a fresh alarm the present calm i take to be only one of those which succeeds one tempest and foretells another take my word for it the clouds are again collecting and will again break perhaps with more fury than ever  this then is the moment to strike some masterstroke  this is the time to  to  soft let me again think a little  in continuation  te deum my friend te deum it is

now while the odd trick is ours let us repair all by one lucky hit my sister has a morsel of independency enough for the subsistence of such a character  the marchioness will either by heaven or by her husband be soon provided for carlisle is rich enough to lose a sum of  000l  we are poor enough to find it acceptable  you understand me all is still in my house  i am going to slip on a ridingdress  i shall desire to see you in the same situation exactly at   peace  peace by heaven heathcoate it is not yet too late to improve our winning cards fourfold it is not too late to observe

and make with him such terms of sighting as shall not only pursedraw but draftdraw him here is one of the tribe of benjamin who will give me solid moneys for his flimsy paper heathcoate these preliminaries being settled he will naturally leave me in expectation of the battleloving medway and in that moment my friend will i  but hush as medway says no noise  leave every thing to me be ready i shall put this letter into the office where i take chaise and if occasion sees fit shall dispatch others upon the road or even by especial messengers for you know how i act in a plot adieu  i shall press this with my seal and be gone  adieu  i could not help listening at augustas door  all quiet there  caroline almost snores  maryanne winks in her wicker chair  i have stripped the house it is a mere shell so now i will leave it  again  adieu letter cx the marchioness of n to signora  at rome be it sufficient apology to you for my late silence that i tell you i have been a prisoner till within this hour without the privilege of getting a letter to the post such is the consequence of following the fortunes of the man you love but on this subject i can speak no more my strength is almost gone and yet i am setting out for a journey  the horses are putting to the carriage it is not to rome it is not to paris  no signora it is to the retreat of captain carlisle yes my viola i have at length obtained his address his real address and i am going at full speed to make use of it  be not startled my friend  i set out with no hostile design  my violent wishes for revenge are all composed now their object is in my power  in my power viola oh heavens carlisle is in the marquiss power  even now perhaps there may be an horrid interview  my blood runs cold at the thought  oh that the horses were ready  they are  they are  the postilion opens to me the door  i will take the unfinished letter in my pocket  i will pay double  double viola i will pay an hundred fold for my speed  the life  the precious life of carlisle is in danger  i am gone   in continuation  there is five minutes stop to change horses  the other poor faithful creatures are panting before me  i take up a very bad pen to tell you that though i am now traveling in the night and that a dark one i travel as a man and am not without arms join with me viola to bless the name of maryanne  to a poor creature so called am i indebted for at least the chance of saving the loveliest of men  the chance oh my god is it then reduced to a chance  to a bare probability i would sooner have every other work of nature annihilated than that the least misery should happen to clement carlisle  ah signora that the marquis of n had been such a man  i am summoned  the letter must not yet be sent away  adieu  in continution  we are changing again  but i am always somewhat the later as there is it seems a gentleman traveling with equal speed the same road and he forestalls the swiftest horses perhaps signora it is the marquis  perhaps every turn of his carriagewheels precipitates the fate of my carlisle  oh horror  horror  oh that the horses had wings instead of feet  thank heaven they look fleeter than my last  they are pawing and champing the bit proudly before me  i shed tears of joy at the symptom  i move onwards   in continution  ah signora  signora i am agitated by ten thousand fears  the person who is going so furiously before me proves to be lascelles  the maid who released me from my prisonchamber told me he was gone a different road  what can be the meaning of this  i have all along described the person of the marquis but have received no account that answers  perhaps he may be yet tracing his enemy as he calls him through the streets of london and i may still be so happy as to preserve him  oh viola what a charming thought  the pen and ink is with me in the chaise  you must dispense with a handwriting scarcely legible   i keep at proper distance from the carriage of lascelles  i have bribed my postilion into implicit obedience  money seems to do every thing in this country   oh heavens viola we are in the middle of the last stage  lascelles increases his pace  how shall i obtain an interview with carlisle shall i drive directly to the house and require an audience shall i carry to him terror in my look and insist upon being heard  ah no signora  let me not now that all my unhappy enthusiasm for revenge is over  let me not interrupt the scheme of joy that is carrying on betwixt him and a worthy woman  why poor innocent should her passion be destroyed by mine  here is is regular  chaste correct consistent  she never intentionally clashed with the unfortunate marchioness of n     no viola i will never disturb the gentle bosom of another woman whom i know to be guiltless  let them be happy signora  let them be happy  i shall be in my grave  i have come to a resolution viola i will discharge my carriage before i enter the town and then wrapping myself up in my coat walk on till i enquire out some inn or open house  there will i write my fears and send them to mr carlisle if his answer mentions his safety and his intention to remain so i will then return to  ah whither signora  i have no house  no fortune  no husband  no friend   and shall i depart without even seeing him  hard  a very hard trial for me viola oh what feelings oppress me  no matter  no matter  my fatal love has already endangered his precious life and if i can now save him i will be content to suffer  lascelles paid off his chaise before me  we stopped within a quarter of a mile of the village  i saw him descend  he walked briskly on  i hastened to discharge my account  saw both the carriages return homeward and prepared to follow mr lascelles  i will follow his steps precisely unless they lead directly to mr carlisle and delicacy shall prevail though the sacrifice were to kill me  ha the postman blows his horn  he passes me  he takes my packet though his bags are sealed  i pay for his civility  upon the chance of my letters getting to rome i make use of the wafer i have in my pocket and send it away  oh  farewell letter cxi miss de gray to miss lascelles he is gone miss lascelles he is gone i saw him move with the most reserved steps toward the green lane that leads to the horrid scene of rencontre  i am resolved to pursue him let the consequence be what it will  your l d g  letter cxii from the same to the same never surely miss lascelles was any scene so complicated with horrors and surprises as that to which i have just been a witness i write now in the deepest distress and write now in the deepest distress and in a house of general mourning in the first place miss lascelles your brother is no more  the fair but unhappy occasion of his death is also near her end and the husband is almost distracted ah my caroline how i tremble  but it is necessary for me however painful to proceed to the minutest of this horrid business  i traced mr carlisle unobserved till he came within view of the spot i heard somebody advance from behind a tree it was the marquis of n  it was too late to discover myself or to hope any thing from entreaties they joined and walked together i went tremblingly behind carlisle told the whole history of the unfortunate augusta he attributed the whole to frolic he protested that she was still under the most sacred protection at the house of mr lascelles in london he pleaded a thousand apologies  pledged himself for her fidelity the marquis would scarce suffer him to finish a single sentence without interruption he is the most headstrong man in the world he execrated carlisle as a seducer he even reprobated him as a coward he infisted upon taking his life if it was not immediately defended he strode onward to measure the ground  a little farther on then sir said he to the marquis this is not a proper place for our in my opinion very unnecessary business  behind yonder house is a heath the clash of our weapons will not there be heard  i was ready to expire my dearest miss lascelles at every step and with very great difficulty escaped observation  if it must be so sir continued carlisle this is the spot  at this moment miss lascelles we heard a confused murmur of voices the sounds came from the other side of a small plantation of firs  stop sir cried the marquis  no witnesses  all fair play if you please i do not mean to assassinate you carlisle nor shall you assassinate me  they both went on the other side of the plantation  the moon shot forth her ray at the very instant of entering and as if providence designed it so her beams were beyond comparison bright  oh earth and heaven what a scene was opened upon us from removing this curtain of darkness  in one part we beheld the persons of mr medway and mr lascelles as it proved to be standing upon the defensive in another stood the figure of a stripling leaning pensively against a fir as if he were unengaged in the combat yet chose to be a spectator at a small distance yet not sufficiently near to be distinguished for the persons they really were clustered another groupe as if they wished rather to see than to be seen  confusion said medway we are discovered if i knew by whom i would annihilate him  ha continued he looking in the face of his antagonist by heaven this is not sir andrew flight  i am his friend sir said the other and i choose to fight for him  curse on the moonbeams   good god cried carlisle by this time come near enough to recognize him is it my friend lascelles whom i behold   carlisle exclaimed mr lascelles  is it you  come sir said the marquis eagerly no trifling  my time is precious  carlisle drew his sword  oh oh hush  hush  said medway softly  if that is the case  no noise we are all come upon the same errand i find advance then every man his bird and there is an end of it as to sir andrew i will chastise him for himself and in the mean time as you think fit to represent him i will chastise you for meddling in the quarrels of a fool  come on sir  he fired his pistol in a moment mr lascelles exchanged the salutation  they were preparing again  the marquis and carlisle began to parry  mr lascelles seeing this eagerly threw down his pistol  stop stop for heavens sake stop said he to the marquis  touch not  lift not your arm against carlisle i charge you  here sir  here into this bosom direct your vengeance  it is i marquis i have been the cause of all your misfortune  there was no time for expostulation mr lascelles caught the sword from the hand of carlisle and insisted upon first engaging with the marquis  carlisle was without arms medway hastened to arm him the marquis rushed upon him without regarding lascelles  lascelles again threw himself before carlisle and even pushed vigorously at the marquis he was at length provoked to begin with your brother my dear miss lascelles the very first thrust of the marquis was fatal for the weapon passed through the side of mr lascelles into his heart the marquis received a wound also in exchange   your brother had scarce fallen before the stripling whom the other objects had prevented from more notice and who had indeed retired farther off upon seeing us now came forward in a feeble manner and fell upon the ground almost at the feet of the marquis  desist desist said the poor thing in the most piercing tone in the world  desist from farther altercation  here lies at the point of all her wishes the unhappy cause of    the sentence was left unfinished for the speaker of it fainted away  oh miss lascelles it was the marchioness of n  in disguise  she had raised her own beautiful arm against her own charming bosom the point of a small sword was still sticking there  i ran to her relief  the marquis stood fixed in horror but still looked sullen  medway was gone  carlisle was agonized by the most divided attention  the marchioness appeared to be expiring  she requested to be carried to lascelles who was in the same situation   it is too hard a task for me miss lascelles to recount to you the dreadful particulars of this pathetic scene it is incumbent upon me however to observe that such circumstances appeared on the part of your brother by his own dying confession that as it is impossible for his life to have been happy you will the less lament him you however my dear miss lascelles he cleared from every imputation that might in consequence of these discoveries have been thrown upon you  he confessed his error  he bathed the lovely hand of poor augusta with his last tears he received her forgiveness  as for the marchioness herself  oh miss lascelles  words can give you no idea of her situation  she was tremblingly sensible to every thing  she looked tenderly at me and gave my hand to carlisle  she gave it as she lay bleeding before us  we conveyed her to prudence place her husband is not even yet convinced of his cruelties yet she kissed his hand  she wondered not she said at carlisles preference  superior beauty added to superior virtue said she taking my hand might well conquer  ah caroline how i felt this flattery  it went through my very heart  my father wept over her  i never saw a house of so much misery  poor carlisles condition was more touching than the rest  he execrates himself as the innocent cause of all  the marquis and he are now together  the marquis seems not to regard his wound which is deeper than we imagined  yet he is not so tender as he should be to augusta your brother is laid on carlisles bed  i saw him a little while since take his lifeless hand gently and turn away weeping  poor fellow said he afterward to me the beauty of the temptation was great  his love of the dice may well account for all the rest i loved him much  let his failings excite no other terror than that of making us the wiser for his example  here my caroline is a prospect darkened  do not believe i can rejoice under such circumstances  your brothers corpse will be  oh caroline these are hard subjects  i must resign them to a firmer hand than that of the trembling  lucia de gray  letter cxiii mr medway to sir androw flight sir though death has been but too busy in this house within these few hours i cannot bear to have a trick put upon me without punishing the tricker you imposed upon me a stranger whom i might have sent to the shades without any right so to do but you are yet in the land of the living and i insist upon justice you sent a challenge with your own hand if you do not meet me this night by the way of hush without any noise i will cane a coward all the way from prudence place to the duke of downderdales  hush  you comprehend me  o medway  letter cxiv mr de gray to miss lascelles dear madam the tears that flowed from the eyes of lucia as she bade the servant carry a letter with your address to the post convince me how sincerely she joins me in deploring the unhappy circumstances of mr lascelless death yet what consolation can in these cases be offered to you notwithstanding your brothers mistakes in other respects his fraternal affection might be very unblemished if so you will naturally cast a veil of oblivion over such parts of his character as were concealed from you and his other friends and you must lament that part of the misfortune which deprives you of a tender relation lucias society however may assist your sense and smooth your path to that acquiescence which must be obtained come therefore dear madam amongst us or rather prepare yourself for such a journey it is not methinks advisable to be here till after the present week mr lascelles with his dying breath bequeathed his remains to clement carlisle he requested that the legacy might be accepted as a testimony of mr carlisles forgiveness he will perform his duty to your satisfaction  our situation is too painful at this crisis for me to proceed but let it be considered for indeed the poet is right our only lesson is to learn to suffer and he who knows not that was born for nothing   i am sincerely yours robert de gray  letter cxv from miss de gray to miss lascelles what a peculiarity of disposition marks the marquis of n though his wound which he received from your brother is become more alarming he insisted upon being permitted to go into the apartment of the poor languishing augusta at a very unseasonable hour of the last night carlisle dissuaded him from this but soon after he again renewed the subject and was admitted  he shut to the door and spoke to his lady in a very ungentle manner we were going to expostulate with him upon the impropriety of this conduct when he came out of the room and told us the marchioness would be well enough to depart soon  he did not stay for any reply to this strange intelligence but ran down stairs into the saloon and from thence into the stable he insisted upon his horse on which under pretense of taking the air though he was scarce able to sit he rode away at full speed he disturbed us to enjoy this frolic in the middle of the night and he has not been heard of since surely there never lived so singular a character  alas the marchioness is by no means in the recovering way the marquis represented her though her wound was more promising at the last dressing her fever is rather increased than abated yet she has never spoken disrespectfully of this strange husband since her illness she seemed much relieved however at the news of his being gone then says she i shall die in peace he will not come again to abuse me  how pathetically my dear miss lascelles am i concerned for the life of this lovely woman  do not believe i counterfeit i speak sincerely her conduct has a larger apology in the treatment of so barbarous a husband  pray heaven she may recover  since i wrote this sentence i have been at her bedside and she cried out  oh miss de gray how good you are  violent as i have been  for which i know you will forgive me  had i known mr carlisles lucia before i am convinced my veneration for her would have cured me if i wish to recover madam it is only to show you my gratitude indeed it is  oh caroline that she may live even though the marquis is unworthy of her is the prayer of  your lucia de gray  letter cxvi mr medway to mr townsend here is pretty news for you a rascally lord refuses to give me satisfaction and a villainous baronet has writ me a challenge and run away without keeping his appointment he wanted moreover to have bilkd me by a representative one lascelles who is killed by another hand just as he was going to attack me for a sum of money with a design to send me to the shades and make off with the price of killing me there have also several other strange things happened in this family of late there is a wounded marquis gone just now bleeding away and his wife is upon her as i think deathbed for this last matter i am much concerned as she is even now a most lovely young creature and i hate of all things that young handsome women should die though the marquis her husband has no worthy quality belonging to him but his courage i choose to give up my pretensions to lucia i choose to give her to carlisle because she loves him i find better than me i choose to alter my will in her favor all these points are so many touches of my humor but as to this baronet i must hunt him every where on this side heaven till i have him upon his knees he made his escape ingloriously this morning and indeed lurked about the house like a scout with a pale face ever since the death of lascelles his bravado i will either pink him or humble him townsend were he to take refuge under the hooppetticoat of his aunt downderdale i will not be tricked  hush  no noise my honor must be satisfied another way the opportunity is at hand i would not die with a debt upon my sword for the world hush   o medway  letter cxvii from the same to mr gabriel hewson sir you some time ago brought a letter of assignation from sir a f who is gone off without either drawing his sword or firing his pistol which of these do you choose he being gone the laws of honor require in my idea that you should represent him  i must therefore have a shot or a stroke at you  hush  ol medway  letter cxviii from the same to t townsend esquire surely townsend it is fated for me to be pestered with rascals i expected satisfaction from the cowardly second of the vile sir a f and behold you i had no sooner intimated my design than he took to his heels also and sends me the sorry excuse i enclose to you  but by heaven i will have them both on their knees yet  hush  o medway the enclosed from mr gabriel hewson to mr medway sombrehedges sir the most superlative degree of astonishment seized me at the receipt of your letter as to sir a fs epistle i knew not its contents and i do not find any law in my classic oracles  tully tacitus and pliny junior not forgetting the goldenruled epictetus which ordains the single combat to be fought by the carrier of a challenge  besides this sir my authors tell me such battles are criminal and that he who kills a man by the way of a duel sports with that eternity which he enters upon without his commission but you are a very fierce gentleman and if the sage socrates himself was to tell you you were in the wrong i do not doubt but you would stigmatize the venerable seer as a coward  to avoid all these concussions of the soul and body and to fly from a scene which is no longer fit for a scholars residence i have betaken myself away and send this immediately on my arrival at sombrehedges  if i have unwittingly offended sir be assured that i implore a thousand pardons and that i may never offend again be satisfied also that i will no more put my head into high places where the superior powers of the foodful earth are quarrelling in the face of day for want of other avocation  i am yours gabriel hewson     letter cxix mr medway to the duke of downderdale my lord your nephew has run away when i thought of giving him the meeting i imagined him my equal  that is to say i imagined him an honest man who is a princes equal but within these few minutes i have found him very much my inferior and below my sword by being  a villain who not only hired a tool to fight for him but had condescended to lay plots for the destruction of the sex which he ought to protect this therefore is written to acquaint him that i have for the future nothing to do with any part of him but his nose which i shall twist as nearly round as possible when i see him no noise let him keep his secret and no greater harm will happen to him from the supreme indignation of  olly medway  letter cxx mr medway to mr gabriel hewson sir colonel carlisle and mr de gray have interceded with me to accept your apology you may therefore go safely to bed in sombrehedges with pliny junior although i have just heard you were bold enough to write a letter to lucia upon a certain subject at a certain time  hush  you comprehend me however let that pass read in a corner and keep at home for the future  you did me justice in supposing i would not take an affront from socrates by heaven i would not brook a wrong look from that caesar who penned his own commentaries  no not from mars himself never make a noise but let hush be your motto  o medway  letter cxxi miss de gray to miss lascelles not a word yet from the unaccountable marquis although we wish very much to send him news of his wifes surprising change for the better by the care of our excellent physician and by her own previous happy state of health her wound is healed within a few days to every bodys astonishment her candid behavior to me has engaged not only my attention but my tenderness she says she loves mr carlisle now just as much as she ought to love an amiable man who is to be the husband of her protectress  she never enquires after the marquis  i am summoned make yourself easy for heavens sake my caroline  this request is not more at the heart of your lucia than at that of the beautiful marchioness who speaks of you with a warmth of gratitude peculiar to her poor thing i hope we shall nurse her up yet  your l de gray  letter cxxii from the same to the same the occasion of my being so soon called away from my writingdesk while i was last addressing my very dear caroline was to be present at an interview betwixt my father and mr and mrs hewson  they desired a few minutes conversation with me and mr de gray in the library they came handinhand they opened the design of their visit immediately  master de gray said the husband i am obliged to you for all favors but i have had enough of your high life so has hett we have seen men killed women wounded friends fighting honest mens wives attempted to be  bauched and lords taking pet without  casion so in a few words hett and i have  solved to go back and live again at skelter as to fine breedin we will make that out as well as we can better be unplite master de gray than  plite enough to cut friends throat and  bauch friends wife so servant master de gray and god be with you  my father applauded this resolution and without any more ceremony they parted  they are this minute actually on their way to helterskelterhall  the marchioness continues to improve but  soft  there is a servant just dismounting from his horse whose sides give smoking testimony of the riders expedition  he is coming into the house  his look and speed alarm me  in continuation  oh heaven my caroline the marquis of n    is no more the messenger delivered a letter to the marchioness which mentions his death the letter is from a relation of his in london where he died  the wound being neglected turned to a mortification and dispatched him in a few hours  this obstinate man it seems showed his resentment even upon his deathbed and bequeathed all his fortune to a distant branch of his family  not a single guinea to his lady  she read the letter with very little emotion considering what is said to be his natural violence but she resolves to go directly to london feeble as she is and pay him the last duties she hazards the air too soon but she persists carlisle says she is deprived of every thing by this stroke but a scanty jointure i ventured to touch upon this she frankly said in answer that she had sufficient fortune in the loss of a cruel tyrannical husband  in continuation  no entreaties can prevail upon the marchioness to stay she declares she is well her fever is indeed gone but the doctor says she risques a relapse she has paid to my father and me her parting civilities they were terribly touching caroline she suppressed a sigh as she gave her hand to carlisle but she recovered herself and with incredible resolution got into her chaise accompanied by mr medway  pray come down to us immediately with the different transitions from one affecting object to another i am quite fatigued i tremble for the marchioness  i feel for you  i am unhappy to think it should be my fate to interfere with the happiness of another woman yet clement is too dear to be resigned and poor frail human nature will prevail  hasten then to comfort the heart of  your lucia de gray  letter cxxiii miss lascelles to miss de gray i wave all remarks

mr gabriels answer i perfectly approximate to my beloved brothers last sentiments i see plainly that a quiet corner and philosophical soul are the best of blessings helterskelterhall cannot be more dear to you than sombre hedges are to him who is thy tenderly fraternally affectionate friend i gave an entertainment last night without sixpence expense to better society that ever were seen at prudenceplace if we except the colonel his guardian and miss de gray who thinks my brother was at my banquet even some of the greatest men of all antiquity  homer horace cicero and seneca  such friends will i never more leave unless it is to visit my relations at helterskelterhall  i will suffer the sacred dust again to gather around my dwelling i will again nurse my frugal blaze and trim my decent lamp  i will once more plant the pensive yew the oak oershadowing and the willow gray  pensive pleasures shall again be mine and those who love the bustling of the world shall not if they are pinched want a protector  yes henry  beloved henry  i am now refixed for life  my old woman shed a tear at my return  my cat rubbed fondling her tabby sides against me and if it had been possible my dog would have spoke my welcome  again are you addressed by the dusky gentleman of sombre hedges who is resolved to play no more the truant  my bag and other instruments of my folly i shall not burn but i have fixed it in the deepest disgrace upon a peg opposite my study that it may ever be saying or seeming to say unto me  oh gabriel gabriel be contented with thy own hair and the best authors though thou were to be tempted by bags of gold instead of silk   adieu gabriel hewson  letter cxxvii mr medway to colonel carlisle dated two months after his departure from prudenceplace dear colonel i have been the constant companion of this charming widow ever since we left your house there is something about her that attaches me to her but no circumstance so much as that she has lost her fortune and buried the fellow who deprived her of it decently i do not know how it is but she has got a stronger hold of my heart than ever your lucia had the plague of it is i suspect she still likes you  yet i struck a bold stroke yesterday   mark it  hush hush augusta said i it is not to be expected that olly medway should please your eye after such a fineformed fellow as clement carlisle but he is engaged you know  with respect to the marquis no noise child about him he is not worth keeping terms of mourning with  i despise the black custom of seeming to lament when one ought to jump for joy  now the case stands thus can you behave well enough to olly medway not to call him at every third word clement carlisle if you say you dont love the said clement i should hate you but can you take for a husband a man who loves him as much as you ought  i believe for his sake and miss de greys replied she sighing i could  but what do you sigh for then  pshaw  will mr medway comply with my terms  name them  will he reconduct me to the house of signora  at italy  no noise  shall i order a chaise to the door  yes  hush  damn it carlisle she sighed again but what a poor reduced rascal i must be i like her well enough to take her any way  you must excuse said she now and then a sigh  even miss de gray did not frown at me for that  confusion carlisle a tear which i caught upon my lip followed this remark but what is a more childish trick still the water came running from my eyes too  willing to get her a thousand miles from prudenceplace i am going to order a chaise  i know no more than you what will be the result of it but i will follow my humor were it to lead me to the end of the earth and the water  i received your two letters but pray keep your money for other purposes  there is no occasion to make the woman more uneasy by your damned presents  her affairs are now mine and whether she is ever nearer to me than she is now no man shall dare to be her banker but  olly medway  letter cxxviii from the same to the same rome we are with signora  augusta sighed for the first six hundred miles of the journey every half hour  the rest of the way pretty well  i have been with her to all her old friends  i have trotted after a fair face like a chit of nineteen  but she does not sigh above once a week  she suits my humor to a hair i shall certainly have her in a short time  at least by the hand and if you dont interrupt me perhaps by the heart  send word when you are married  that will be my cue if you ever come to rome i will move with the marchioness further still and if you resolve to pursue me i will cut your throat i did intend to give my money to your lucia but i shall now give it to my augusta hush  i will follow my humor hush  i am a man of few words and the
