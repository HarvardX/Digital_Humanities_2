a supplement to the tour through great britain  price two shillings  entered at stationers hall  a supplement to the tour through great britain containing a catalogue of the antiquities houses parks plantations scenes and situations in england and wales arranged according to the alphabetical order of the several counties  by the late mr gray author of the elegy written in a country churchyard etc  to which are now added by another hand several additions also blank spaces at the end to enable every traveller or reader to make his own remarks or corrections  london printed for g kearsley at johnsons head no    fleet street       advertisement this catalogue was originally written on the blank pages of kitchens english atlas by mr gray his own extensive researches into the topography of this island furnished him with many of the particulars the summer tours which he made supplied him with more and to these he was frequently adding from the information of such persons on whose taste and judgment he could best depend  a few copies were first printed and interleaved with a view that those to whom they were presented might at their leisure make such short remarks as their own personal knowledge of the several counties enables them to do and in these to add or expunge what they may think proper because as on the one hand it is possible some places worthy of note may be omitted so on the other some may be mentioned which are hardly deserving of the travellers attention the excellent person beforementioned who made the catalogue was apprehensive of this and was therefore far from thinking his manuscript perfect yet as many of his friends had transcribed it in his lifetime and many more have requested copies since his decease it was thought best to print it in this pocket form not only for their present gratification but as the most likely means of rendering this little work complete and of fitting it hereafter for the eye of the public  the present prevailing passion for viewing and examining the beautiful scenes which abound in our native country precludes every necessity for an apology for the publication now offered to the world and the name of the compiler will secure to it a favorable reception what mr gray thought important enough to engage his attention those for whose use it is intended will not receive with neglect scenes situations seats and antiquities selected as worthy of notice by the elegant author of the churchyard elegy will be visited with a degree of respect unfelt before to his taste no person will venture to dissent and to his judgment few but will readily subscribe  as the present catalogue was compiled several years since some alterations by change of property or by deaths may have happened in the names of the owners of particular seats  these however can be but few and it is presumed of no material consequence but as the publisher wishes to be accurate he will very thankfully receive any corrections which may render the work more perfect and by that means more useful  the copies of the former edition where interleaved in this the blank leaves are placed at the end upon a more convenient plan see page    etc   this mark placed before any place denotes that it is more particularly worthy of notice  just published price four shillings sewed a new edition corrected love and madness in a series of letters one of which contains the original account of chatterton  governor  who did the bloody deed  oroonoko  the deed was mine bloody i know it is and i expect your laws should tell me so thus
