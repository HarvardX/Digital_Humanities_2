hodges a millar j whiston and j robinson mdccxlii  a tour through the island of great britain vol iii letter i containing a description of the counties of lincoln rutland northampton huntingdon and bedford sir from newark still keeping the fossway which lies as strait as a line can mark it out we went on to lincoln having a view of the great church called the minster all the way before us the river trent on the left and the downs called lincolnheath on the right  lincoln is an ancient city governed by a mayor aldermen etc it is so full of the ruins of monasteries and religious houses that the very barns stables outhouses and as they showed me some of the very hogstyes are built churchfashion that is to say with stonewalls and arched windows and doors here are    churches but the meanest to look on that are anywhere to be seen the cathedral indeed and the ruins of the old castle are very venerable pieces of antiquity  lincoln was a colony of the romans and by them named lindum colonia which very easily falls into the present abbreviated appellation lincoln from its bold and noble situation upon an high hill it seems a collection of five cities for first below the hill and westward of the city the river throws itself into a great pool called swanpool from the multitude of swans upon it all around this place the ground is moory and full of bogs and islets and the place is called now carham i e a dwelling upon the car or fen here was the british city in the most early times which they used as a fastness for themselves and cattle in times of deep distress from this carham is a pleasant view of the westfront of the cathedral    the romans pleased with this eminence placed their city upon it which they first built in the form of a large square the southern wall being sufficiently secured by the precipice quite round the other three sides they carried a deep trench which still remains except on the southeast angle this city was divided into four equal parts by two cross streets the two southern quarters were taken up one by the castle the other by the church which remigius built but when bishop alexander projected a structure of much larger dimensions the enclosure was carried beyond the eastern bounds of the city and a new wall built farther that way as at present with battlements and towers the north roman gate of this part of the city still remains entire called newport gate and the noblest remnant of this sort in britain it is a vast semicircle of stones laid together without mortar and cemented only by their wedgelike shape this magnificent arch is    feet diameter the stones four feet thick at bottom from this gate eastward some part of the old roman wall is to be seen made of stone and very strong mortar the west gate toward the gallows was pulled down within memory that on the south side still shows one jamb from between the houses and two or three stones of the same make as the former the rest has been pulled down by mr houghton on the east side one postern is visible and big enough for a bed to stand in by newport gate is another large and curious piece of roman workmanship called the mintwall this is still    feet high and above  0 feet long composed of brick and stone laid alternately    the romans finding this city well situated for navigation added another to it as big as the former this they did southward upon the declivity of the hill and so made it parallel with the other and the most southern side lay upon the river eastward the ditch without is turned into a broad street called the beastmarket and there below claskgate a great part of the old roman wall is left made of stone one piece of it is now  0 feet long and    high a little of it lower down is    feet long and as much high between that gate upwards and the old citywall by the greestonestairs the old ditch called weredyke is to be seen to the west the ditch and foundation of the wall are still lost though many times repaired and demolished in the frequent sieges this town has sustained especially in the wars of the empress maud at the bottom of it toward the water is a round tower named lucytower much known in her history    another great addition to the length of this city northward above the hill was called newport or the new city  00 paces long this probably was done in the time of the saxon kings it lies on both sides the hermenstreet and was fenced with a wall and ditch hewn out of the rock at the two farther corners were round towers and a gate the foundations of which remain there were several churches and religious houses in this place it was chiefly inhabited by jews who had settled here in great numbers and grown rich by trade there is a well still named granthamswell from a child they impiously crucified as was said and threw it into that place    after the norman conquest when a great part of the first city was turned into a castle by king william i it is probable they added the last intake southward in the angle of the witham and made a new cut called sinsildyke on the south and east side for its security it is observable that the normans could not well pronounce lincoln but vitiated it to nichol as we find it written in some old authors and to this day a part of the swanpool is called nicholpool  though since those times the city has much declined of late it seems to revive and trade and manufactures to flourish  in this last part of lincoln on both sides the roman road were many of that peoples funeral monuments some of which they now dig up there is an inscription of that sort behind the house where the lord hussy was beheaded for rebellion in the time of king henry viii the great bowwindow through which he passed to the scaffold was lately taken down it stands over against another stone building of an antique model which was the palace of john of gaunt duke of lancaster who lived here in royal state and had the privilege of coining his arms are here carved in stone over against the castle westward is an entrenchment made by king stephen  the situation of the city from what i have said must appear very particular one part is on the flat and in a bottom so that the witham a little river that runs through the town flows sometimes into the street the other part lies upon the top of a high hill where the cathedral stands and the very steepest part of the ascent of the hill is the best part of the city for trade and business  nothing is more troublesome than the communication of the upper and lower town the street is so steep and so strait that the coaches and horses are obliged to fetch a compass another way as well on one hand as on the other  the river witham is arched over so that you see nothing of it as you go through the main street but it makes a large lake on the west side and has a canal called the possdike by which it has a communication with the trent whereby the navigation of that river is made useful for trade to the city this river must have run into the humber had it not been broken off in the middle by that great valley under lincoln and turned into the saltmarshes hence it is that the stone upon this western cliff is full of seashells for the shellfish when by the restless motion of the waters in the universal delage they were carried into the midland places were hindered by the weight of their shells from regaining their original stations and thus were confined within the growing stone as a testimony of which the skeleton of a crocodile or some such animal enclosed in a broad flat stone was sent to the royal society from these parts by dr stukeley from whom we borrow this observation  there are very good buildings in the upper city and several families of gentlemen have houses there besides those of the prebendaries and other clergy belonging to the cathedral  the cathedral is a magnificent fabric and is reputed the largest in extent of any cathedral in england except york but there are in it many obvious blemishes which i shall particularly take notice of in comparing it hereafter with york minster the situation is infinitely to its advantage as it stands upon a high hill and is seen into five or six counties it has a double cross or transept the west end receives a great addition to its breadth by reason of two chapels on each side of the sideayles but the two towers and spires are very mean though not for want of height  this cathedral has many bells and particularly the northern tower is filled up as one may say with the finest great bell in england which is called tom of lincoln being probably consecrated to thomas becket archbishop of canterbury  as loud as tom of lincoln is a proverb it weighs   tons      pounds and will hold     gallons alemeasure the circumference is    feet   inches  the middle or rood tower is the highest in the whole kingdom and when the spire was standing on it it must in proportion to the height of the tower have exceeded that of old st pauls which was   0 feet the monks were so proud of this structure that they would have it that the devil looked upon it with an envious eye whence the proverb of a man who looks invidious and malignant he looks as the devil over lincoln at present there are only four very ordinary pinacles one at each corner it has two great gatehouses or entrances from the west the lower part of the frt and of the two towers are of remigiuss building as is easily discoverable by the color of the stones and by the manner of architecture but alexander built the additions upon it as likewise the body of the cathedral the choir and st marys tower which once had a very lofty spire st hugh the burgundian built the east end or st marys chapel where he had a shrine and the chapterhouse which is ceild with a beautiful stone roof and one pillar in the middle  the cloisters and the library are fine and the latter is well furnished with printed books and manuscripts  two catharinewheel windows as they are termed at the ends of the larger transepts are remarkably fine for bullionwork and painted glass  here are great numbers of antique brasses and monuments  south of the church upon the very brow of the hill is the bishops palace built by robert de chesney who gave two great bells bishop bek and other successors improved it into a magnificence equal to the cathedral it stands just south of the roman wall it had many large bowwindows of curious workmanship looking over the lower city into nottinghamshire the kitchen had seven chimneys the hall was stately the gatehouse remains entire with the a of the founders this palace was ruined in the time of the civil wars but might be rebuilt with no very great expense as the church is very large so is the revenue of the bishopric which was formerly immensely great as may be seen by the monasticon where is an astonishing account of the wealth of the place  the church as it is the seat of the bishopric is not so ancient as some others the sea being removed since the norman conquest from dorchester a little town in oxfordshire on the river thames not far from tame of which i have spoken in its place but the city is truly ancient and the ruins of it tell us as much  mr camden says king vortimer the valiant briton died here and was buried in the church of the great monastery  it is certain as i have observed that william the conqueror built the castle to curb the potent citizens and the ruins show that it was a most magnificent work well fortified and capable of receiving a numerous garrison  the bishopric of lincoln at that time contained all that now is comprised in the dioceses of ely peterborough and oxford besides what is now its own and it is still the largest diocese in england containing the several counties of lincoln leicester huntingdon bedford bucks and part of hertford and in them      parishes whereof     are impropriations and there are in these bounds six archdeacons viz lincoln leicester bedford buckingham stow and huntingdon  here was the famous battle fought between the friends of the empress maud mother to king henry ii and king stephen in which that magnanimous prince was overthrown and taken prisoner  lincoln stands in a most rich pleasant and agreeable country for on the north and southeast the noble plain called lincoln heath extends itself like the plain about salisbury for above  0 miles viz from sleeford and ancaster south to the bank of the humber north though not with a breadth equal to the length for the plain is hardly anywhere above three or four miles broad  on the west side of this plain the trent waters make a pleasant and rich valley running from newark to gainsburgh thence to burton and so into the humber  gainsburgh has a large and fine market and is very flourishing for trade and business which has increased of late years to the detriment of boston and hull  the body of the parish church of this place had been under a general decay and the walls arches and pillars so shaken and declined from their proper position that it was judged incapable of repair an act of parliament therefore passed in      for pulling down and rebuilding it it is famous for the danes having landed here when they came up the trent  passing the trent by a ferry you land in the isle of axholm which is environed by the trent and the dun littleborough is the agelocum or segelocum of the romans a small village three miles above gainsburgh just upon the edge of the water and in a nook it seems only to have been environed with a ditch and was of a square form the water ran quite round it for to the west where whitesbridge is a watery valley hems it in so that it was sufficiently strong the church stands upon the highest ground the trent has washed away part of the eastern side of the town foundations and pavements are visible in the bank here an urn with the coin of domitian was found and great numbers of coins have been taken up in ploughing and digging which they call swinepennies because those creatures sometimes rout them up and the inhabitants take little care to preserve them mr ella vicar of rampton hard by has collected several and some valuable  in      two altars handsomely molded of coarse gritstone were dug up which are set as piers in a wall on the side of the steps which lead from the river to the inn many very small coins like flatted peace called mites are also found mr hardy has a large urn with a female face on the outside  in this field near whitesbridge are great foundations of buildings coins are often found at the lowest edge of the water when the tide is gone off and in dry seasons on the east side of the river has been a camp  by tilbridgelane upon the top of the heath is a spring which according to the vulgar report flows and ebbs with the trent though at five miles distance the like is said of several others hereabout  ten miles from lincoln northward is spittle all the way to which place are milliary stones it is very pleasant riding being wholly champaign or heath of these stones i believe some are roman others later crosses to supply their place this was no doubt a mansion because hard by a little beck runs through it here is an hospital said to be founded in the year   0  there are great foundations all around some of which perhaps are roman at present the village consists of two farmhouses a chapel an inn and a sessions house upon the latter is this inscription haecce domus dat amat punit conservat honorat aequitiam pacem crimina jura bonos    0 that is this court does right loves peace preserves the laws detects the wrong rewards the righteous cause   to the left is normanby where the last but one duke of bucks was born and whence he assumed his title of marquis  half a mile east of the present wintringham stood the old roman town now a common bounded by the marshes upon the humber the city was ploughd up of late years and many antiquities found  the present wintringham is a dirty poor place but still a corporation and the mayor is chosen only out of one street next the old town where was a chapel the bell of it now hangs in a wooden frame by the pillory here is a vast jawbone or rib of a whale which has remained time out of mind  as the middle of the country is all hilly and the west side low so the east side is the richest most fruitful and best cultivated of any county in england so far from london one part is all fen or marsh grounds and extends itself south to the isle of ely and here it is that so vast a quantity of sheep are fed as makes this county and that of leicester an inexhaustible fountain of wool for all the manufacturing counties in england as before observed  there are some good towns on the seacoast but i include not barton which stands on the humber as one of them being a straggling mean town noted for nothing but an illfavored dangerous passage or ferry over the humber to hull where in an open boat in which we had about    horses and  0 or    cows mingled with about    or    passengers we were about   hours tossed about on the humber before we could get into the harbor at hull  well may the humber take its name from the noise it makes for in a high wind it is incredibly great and terrible like the crash and dashing together of ships  passing over whitton brook a roman road goes directly to aukborough by that people called aquis their camp is now called countessclose from a countess of warwick who they say lived there at least owned the estate the roman castle is square  00 feet each side very conveniently placed in the northwest angle of lincolnshire as a watchtower over all nottinghamshire and yorkshire the church is of good stone and has a square tower but the choir is ruinous and separated from the rest of the church by a wooden partition here are numerous relics of the deluge as seashells subterraneous trees etc  in a square plot called the green is a round labyrinth named julians bower probably from the warlike games in use among the roman and british youth called ludi trojani and said by virgil to be first introduced into italy by iulus the son of aeneas and the boys to this day divert themselves with running in it one after another and eluding their playfellows by their intricate mazes it seems that our tournaments so much in fashion till queen elizabeths time are remainders of these ancient diversions  burton makes a pretty prospect has several mills and the houses are pleasantly intermixed with trees there are also two churches one of which is so low in respect of the precipice under which it stands that a person may almost leap from thence upon the steeple  at barrow is a british temple vulgarly called a castle  a little eastward hence is thornton college a great abbey founded by william le gros earl of albemarle in the year      the gatehouse is very perfect being a vast tower or castle of great strength both for offense and defense before it is a large ditch across which is laid a bridge with walls on each hand and arches which support a broad battlement to keep off the enemy before it are two round towers there was a portcullis at the great gate and behind it another gate of oak over the gate are three old clumsy statues in the ordinary niches a woman seeming a queen or the virgin mary to the right a man with a lamb probably st john baptist and to the left a bishop or abbat with a crosier upon taking down an old wall they found a man with a candlestick table and book who was supposed to have been immured the whole monastery was encompassed by a deep ditch and high rampart to secure the religious from robbers because near the sea  a mile east of thornton are the ruins of another great castle called kelingholme  in goswel parish northward is burham once a chapel which belonged to the monastery now a farmhouse  in the same parish near the humber is verecourt which belonged to the ancient family of that name  the land hereabout is good and wellwooded and many roman coins are found  two miles west of thornton are the ruins of a great roman camp called yarborough which surveys the whole hundred denominated from it mr howson of kenington which is hard by has pecks of roman coins found here  grimsby lies also on the humber but lower down toward the ocean it is a mayortown and seaport but its harbor is not very safe for ships to ride in as appeared at the time of the great storm in   0  when all the ships in that road were driven from their anchors and most of them lost here is a very large sumptuous church  we took the round of the seacoast from hence southward all the way to boston and passed through saltfleet burgh and wainfleet besides several villages lying on the seaside the two first are but inconsiderable market towns but wainfleet is a wellcompacted town and neat though situated in the fens it is noted for a fine free school and giving an addition to the name of the founder of it who was called william of wainfleet afterward bishop of winchester and who founded also winchester college  the river witham crosses the county from lincoln to boston where it disembogues at the source of it is a little river of the same name  between this river and the seacoast northeast the several inland towns of bolinbroke famous for giving birth and title to king henry iv also title to mr secretary st john one of the greatest geniuss of the age though unhappy in some of his politics spilsby horncastle and tattersal on the south about the middle of this division made by the witham lie stanton marketrasen louth and binbroke and higher up northward stand kirton glandsord brigs and caster  spilsby is a pretty good town and has a wellfrequented market  horncastle is almost surrounded with water and is a large well built town but the rest are inconsiderable except louth and caster the first has two weekly considerable markets and is famous for a fine spire steeple as high as that of grantham  caster is the ancient durobrivis though dornford retains somewhat of the old name where the hermenstreet crossed the river by a bridge of brass according to the vulgar at chesterton is a large tract of ground called the castlefield with a ditch and rampart around it the roman road runs directly through it and still retains its high ridge beyond the river it extends for some space upon the meadow along the bank then forms an angle and proceeds full north caster is above half a mile from it upon the hill a part of the foundation of the wall of the old roman camp is visible in the street to the northwest corner of the church under the wall of the house where the minister lives it may be known by the great strength of the mortar built of the white slabstone of the country underneath this lay the city for below the churchyard the ground is full of foundations and mosaics  in the boot alehouse cellar is a piece of a pavement as are many at mr wrights and in a garden an entire one besides great numbers of roman coins in the possession of mons baillardeau in the ploughd fields between the town and the river toward fordgreen is a tract which runs quite through whereon corn grows very scantily this is nothing but a road laid with a deep bed of gravel though the superstitious country people believe it was cursed by the lady kyneburg the abbess who built a religious house which stood eastward of the church and some part of which still remains this meadow is called normangate or more properly dormangate field from the town whose foundations are found all about this place and also innumerable coins called dormanpence part of this is berrystead where antiquities are daily dug up millfield stands higher toward peterborough where mosaic pavements etc are found and seems to have been a little citadel belonging to the town  part of the church is an antique building but newmodelld upon a stone over the choirdoor is a curious inscription importing that the church was consecrated on the   th of april      the steeple stands in the middle of the church the tower is a fine piece of ancient architecture with semicircular arches the square well by the porch is roman surrounded with hewn stone and though it stands on a hill the water is very high at the east end of the church is a very old cross  a little higher up the river near wansford bridge a gold british coin was found which is in the possession of mr maurice johnson an eminent counselor  the fen country begins about wainfleet which is within twenty miles of grimsby and extends itself to the isle of ely south and to the grounds opposite to lynnregis in norfolk east  this part is indeed very properly called holland for it is a flat level and often drowned country like the province of the same name in the low countries insomuch that the very ditches are navigable and the people pass from town to town in boats as they do there here we had the uncouth music of the bittern a bird formerly counted ominous and presaging and which as some say thrusts its bill into a reed and others into a bog and then gives the dull heavy groan or sound like a sigh which is so loud that it is heard two or three miles distance as some people say  here we first saw boston and making toward it found it a seaport town at the mouth of the witham  the tower is the highest and noblest in europe being  00 yards and is seen plainly  0 miles round this level country and farther by sea the octagon lantern on the top is very beautiful and admirable for the thinness of the stonework mariners find it particularly useful to guide them into this port and even into the mouth of the river ouse for in clear weather it is seen quite out at sea to the entrance of those channels which they call lynn deeps and boston deeps which are as difficult places as most upon the eastern shore of britain this is particularly taken notice of in an act passed in the reign of the late queen anne for enabling assessments to be made for repairing and keeping in repair this church in the preamble to which it is described as it deserves as an ancient well built fabric that the tower thereof is very high and an useful seamark and that it being situate near the haven a great sum is necessary yearly to be raised to preserve it from a violent constantly ebbing and flowing water  there was a prodigious clockbell which could be heard six or seven miles round it had many old verses round it but anno    0 was knocked in pieces and the inscription not taken  twenty yards from the foundation of this tower runs the rapid witham through a wooden bridge  this town abounded with religious houses whose lands king henry viii gave to the town  queen mary i was a great benefactress likewise to it and gave them lands called erection lands to pay a vicar lecturer and two schoolmasters  the church is reckoned the largest parish church without cross ails in the universe it is  00 feet wide and  00 long within the walls the roof is handsomely ceiled with irish oak supported by    tall and slender pillars  formerly the town labored under the want of fresh water which was a great discouragement to merchants and others settling there to remedy which inconvenience john smyth of heath in the county of york esquire procured an act of parliament which passed in the reign of queen anne to enclose two acres of the great common called the west fen for a pond or cistern and to erect a waterhouse and mill upon the said common and other proper edifices and to lay pipes from the pond for supplying the town  the town is large populous and well built full of merchants and has a good share of foreign trade as well as lynn it is built on both sides of the river witham it is a corporation governed by a mayor and    aldermen it has two markets weekly and a commodious haven here is held one of those annual fairs which preserve the ancient title of a mart whereof i remember only four in england of any considerable note viz lynn gainsburgh beverly and boston its trade of late years has not increased  east of boston was a chapel called hiptoft and in the town a church dedicated to st john but both demolished queen elizabeth gave the corporation a court of admiralty over all the seacoasts hereabouts  the country round this place is all fen and marsh grounds the land is very rich and feeds prodigious numbers of large sheep and also oxen of the largest size the best of which are driven to london market and from this part as also from the downs or heath abovementioned comes as i have before noted a great part of the wool known as a creditable distinction because of its fineness by the name of lincolnshire wool which is sent in great quantities into norfolk and suffolk for the manufacturers of those countries and indeed to several other of the trading counties in england  these fens are very considerable for their extent for they reach in length in some places  0 miles and in breadth above  0 and as they are so level that there is no interruption to the sight any building of extraordinary height is seen a long way for example boston steeple is seen upon lincoln heath near  0 miles peterborough and ely minsters are seen almost thoughout the whole level so are the spires of lynn whittlesea and crowland seen at a very great distance which adds some beauty to the country  from boston we came on through the fen country to holbech a little market town and so on to spalding which is another seaport in the level but standing far within the land on the river welland which almost incloses it here was nothing very remarkable to be seen as to antiquity but the ruins of an old monastery of which the monasticon gives a particular description there is a bridge over the welland and vessels of about  0 or  0 tons may come up to the town and that is sufficient for the trade of spalding which is chiefly in corn and coal  we must not pass by crowland another place of great religious antiquity here being once a famous monastery the remains of which are still to be seen the monks of crowland were eminent in history and a great many stories are told of the devils of crowland also and what conversation they had with the monks which tales are more out of date now than they were formerly  the abbey was founded  000 years ago by athelbald king of mercia in the midst of bogs and thorns in honor of his chaplain guthlac who chose this place to mortify in the foundation is laid on piles of wood several of which have been found in tearing up the ruins of the eastern part of the church for what remains is only part of the westend and of that only one corner in tolerable repair which is at present their parish church in the middle of the cross stood once a lofty tower and in it was a remarkably fine ring of bells the first as is said in the county the roof which was of irish oak finely carved and gilt fell down about  0 years ago and pieces of it are to be found in almost every house people at pleasure dig up the monumental stones for private use and what are left in the pavement are covered over with shrubs it was made a garrison in the late civil wars and the soldiers destroyed the painted glass in it all the eastern part of the body of the church is entirely razed to the foundation the monastic buildings cloisters hall abbats lodgings are absolutely demolished in the northwest corner of the church stands a strong tower with a very obtuse spire and a pleasant ring of small bells over the west gate are the images of diverse kings abbats etc among the rest guthlac with a whip and knife his usual symbols  not far from the abbey is the remnant of a little stone cottage called anchorchurchhouse where was a chapel in which st guthlac was buried and where he lived a hermit  over against the west end of the abbey is the famous triangular bridge hardly to be equalled in britain if in europe it being too steep for horses and carriages to go over they pass under it it is formed on three segments of a circle meeting in one point and each base they say stands in a different county here meet the rivers nine and welland so that the bridge being fixed at the very point where they join stands upon a center in the middle of the united waters and then parting into two bridges lands you one to the right on thorney and one to the left upon holland on one side fits an image of king athelbald founder of crowlandabbey with a globe in his hand  the town of spalding is not large but pretty well built and well inhabited and is a handsome and large market town but for the healthiness or pleasantness of it i have no more to say than that i was very glad when i got out of it as well as out of the rest of the fen country for it is a horrid air for a stranger to breathe in  the history of the draining these fens by a set of gentlemen called the adventurers the several laws for securing and preserving the banks and dividing the lands how they were by the extraordinary conflux of waters from all the inland counties of england frequently overflowed and sometimes lay under water most part of the year how all the waters in this part of england which do not run into the thames the trent or the severn fall together into these low grounds and empty themselves into the sea by those drains as through a sink and how by the skill of these adventurers and at a prodigious expense they have cut new channels and even whole rivers with particular drains from one river to another to carry off the great flux of waters when floods or freshes come down either on one side or on the other and how notwithstanding all that hands could do or art contrive yet sometimes the waters do still prevail the banks break and whole levels are overflowed together all this and much more that might be said on so copious a subject though it would be very useful to have it fully and geographically described yet it would take up so much room that i cannot think of entering any farther into it than just to mention that an act of parliament lately passed to enable the adventurers owners and proprietors of the taxable lands and the owners and proprietors of the free lands in deeping fen pinchbeck and spalding south fen therlby fen bourn south fen and croyland fen etc in the county of lincoln containing in the whole about  0000 acres to raise a competent sum for the effectual draining and future preservation of all the said fens according to their agreement in that behalf dated febr        and to carry the said agreement into execution  we shall only observe further that sir john heathcote bart has made so good a progress in draining     acres of the therlby fen pastures belonging to him that he is particularly exempted from paying toward the sums levied upon others by this act  these fens of lincolnshire are of the same kind with and contiguous to those already mentioned in the isle of ely in the counties of cambridge and huntingdon and here as well as there we see prodigious numbers of cattle which are fed up to an extraordinary size by the richness of the soil  here are also an infinite number of wildfowl such as duck and mallard teal and wigeon brandgeese wildgeese etc for the taking of the four first kinds here are a great many decoys from all which the vast number of fowls they take are sent up to london  the accounts which the country people give of the numbers they sometimes take are such that one scarce dares report it from them but this i can say of my certain knowledge that some of these decoys are of so great an extent and take such great numbers of fowl that they are let from  00 l to     and  00 l a year rent  the art of taking the fowls and especiaally of breeding up a set of creatures called decoyducks to entice and then betray their fellowducks into the several decoys is very ingenious and though it is not very easy to describe it i will give it in as few words as i can  the decoyducks are hatched and bred up in the decoy ponds in which are certain places where they are constantly fed and being made tame they are used to come to the decoymans hand for their food  when they fly abroad it is not known whither they go but some conjecture they fly quite over into holland and germany where they meet with others of their own kind and sorting with them they by some art unknown to us draw together a vast number of the fowls and in a word kidnap them from their own country for being once brought out of their knowledge they follow the decoys as a dog follows the sportsman and it is frequent to see these subtle creatures return with a vast flight of fowls along with them after they have been absent several weeks together  when they have brought them over the first thing they do is to settle with them in the ponds to which the decoyducks belong here they chatter and gabble to them in their own language as if they were telling them that here they should soon see how well they should live  when the decoymen perceive they are come and that they are gathering and increasing they go secretly to the ponds side under the cover which they have made with reeds so that they cannot be seen where they throw over the reeds handfuls of corn in such shallow places as the decoyducks are usually fed and whither they are sure to come for it and to bring their new guests with them for their entertainment  this they do for two or three days together and no harm follows to the poor strangers till throwing in this bait one time in an open wide place another time in another wide place the third time it is thrown in a narrower place where the trees which hang over the water and the banks stand closer together and then in another yet narrower where the said trees are overhead like an arbor though at a good height from the water  here the boughs are so artfully managed that a large net is spread near the tops of the trees among the branches and fastened to hoops which reach from side to side this is so high and so wide and the room is so much below and the water so open that the fowls do not perceive the net above them  here the decoyman keeping unseen behind the hedges of reeds which are made perfectly close goes forward throwing corn over the reeds into the water the decoyducks greedily fall upon it and calling their foreign guests seem to tell them that now they may find how well the ducks live in england so inviting or rather wheedling them forward till by degrees they are all gotten under the arch or sweep of the net which is on the trees and which by degrees imperceptibly to them declines lower and lower and also narrower and narrower till at the farther end it comes to a point like a purse though this farther end is quite out of sight and perhaps two or three hundred yards from the first entrance  when the whole flight of ducks are thus greedily following the decoys and feeding plentifully as they go and the decoyman sees they are all so far within the arch of the net as not to be able to escape on a sudden a dog which till then keeps close by him and which is perfectly taught his business rushes from behind the reeds and jumps into the water swimming directly after the ducks and barks as he swims  immediately the frighted ducks rise upon the wing to make their escape but are beaten down again by the arched net which is over their heads being then forced into the water they necessarily swim forward for fear of the dog and thus they crowd on till by degrees the net growing lower and narrower they are hurried to the very farther end where another decoyman stands ready to receive them and who takes them out alive with his hands  as for the traitors that drew the poor ducks into this snare they are taught to rise but a little way and so not reaching to the net they fly back to the ponds and make their escape or else being used to the decoyman they go to him fearless and are taken out as the rest but instead of being killed with them are strokd made much of and put into a little pond just by him and plentifully fed for their services  there are many particulars in the managing and draining these levels throwing off the water by mills and engines and cultivating the grounds in an unusual manner which would be very useful to be described but the needful brevity of this work will not admit of it yet something of it may be touched upon   that here are some wonderful engines for throwing up water and such as are not to be seen anywhere else whereof one in particular threw up as they assured us   00 tons of water in half an hour and goes by windsails    wings or sails to a mill   here are the greatest improvements by planting of hemp that i think are to be seen in england particularly on the norfolk and cambridge sides of the fens as about wisbech wells and several other places where we saw many hundred acres of ground bearing great crops of hemp   here is a particular trade carried on with london which is nowhere else practiced in the whole kingdom that i have met with or heard of viz for carrying fish alive by landcarriage this they do by carrying great buts filled with water in wagons as the carriers draw other goods the buts have a little square flap instead of a bung about  0    or    inches square which being opened gives air to the fish and every night when they come to the inn they draw off the water and let more fresh and sweet water run into them again in these carriages they chiefly carry tench and pike perch and eels but especially the two former of which here are some of the largest in england   whittlesea and ramsey meres are two lakes made by the river nine which runs through them the first is between five and six miles long and three miles broad and is indeed full of excellent fish for this trade  the hermenstreet goes in a strait line through great and little stukely anciently written styvecle which name it acquired from its stiff clay soil in great stukely church is a font of a very antique make the hermenstreet after this becomes notorious by the name of stangate near stilton some parts appear still paved with stone which strengthens the conjecture that the name stangate was given it from thence it traverses great woods between the two saltries where was a religious foundation of simon silvanect the second earl of huntingdon and northampton among the ruins of which lie buried robert brus lord of anandale in scotland and of cleveland in england with isabel his consort from whom the scottish branch of our royal family is descended near the road side roman urns have been dug up  half a mile out of the road is the seat of sir robert cotton the learned friend of the great camden where he had a choice collection of roman inscriptions from all parts of the kingdom the house was built in a magnificent manner of hewn stone but now lies in dismal ruins by it is a most beautiful church with a tower and in the windows is fine painted glass from those woods abovementioned your eye commands the whole level of the fens particularly whitleseymere where the gentry have little vessels to sail in for pleasure sir robert cotton digging the foundation of a house on the hill whence you enjoy this prospect found the skeleton of a fish    feet long  a little to the right lies ramsey famed for a rich abbey little of which is now left but a part of the old gate house in the yard i saw a neglected statue of the founder alwyn who was called alderman of all england and was cousin to king edgar and son of duke athelstan surnamed halfking this is one of the most ancient pieces of english sculpture which we know of the keys and ragged staff in his hand denote his office the abbey was dedicated to st dunstan of canterbury and st oswald of york and was a rich foundation and at the dissolution valued at      l per annum for the maintenance of  0 monks in the year      a great quantity of roman coins were found at ramsey which were believed to be hid there by the monks upon some inroad of the danes  at every mile from grantham to stangate are stones set up by mr boulter which he designed to have carried on to london for the general benefit  all the country between huntingdon river and peterborough river is clay sand and gravel but beyond that to the humber stone  at gunworth ferry over peterborough river is a bridge a few years ago erected where boats pay toll the people of peterborough were a good while averse to having their river made navigable out of an absurd notion that it would spoil their trade but they begin to be better informed or as i may say to have more wit on the progress made in that navigation which i shall mention more particularly byandby when i come to oundle  from the fens longing to be delivered from fogs and stagnate air and water of the color of brewed ale like the rivers of the peak we first set foot on dry land as i called it at peterborough  but before we enter it we must not omit to take some notice of foderinghay castle situate on a branch of the nine famous for the imprisonment and decollation of the unfortunate mary queen of scots it seems to have been very strong and it had a high mount or keep environed with a deep ditch it is mostly demolished and all the materials carried off some say it was destroyed by order of king james i in revenge of his mothers sufferings they pretended to show me here the ruins of the hall where that princess was beheaded it was the seat of edmund of langley duke of york whose body was buried in the collegiate church here a very neat building founded by edward duke of york likewise interred here the chancel in which they were buried was entirely demolished at the suppression but these monuments were restored by queen elizabeth the church windows are filled with handsome painted glass saved by a sum of money to the soldiery in the late civil war and represent st denis st guthlac abp scrope etc  peterborough stands in northamptonshire and is a little city of great antiquity seated on the river nine and indeed it is the least in england for bath or wells or ely or carlisle are all much bigger yet peterborough is no contemptible place neither here are some good houses a handsome marketplace and the streets are fair and well built but the glory of peterborough is the cathedral which is truly fine and beautiful and the noblest piece of gothic building in england but it appears to be more modern than the story of raising this pile implies which was near  0 0 years ago it wants only to make it complete a fine tower steeple and spire on the top of it a mayor aldermen and recorder are the chief magistrates here  in this church was buried the body of the unhappy mary queen of scots abovementioned but it was afterward removed by king james i her son into westminsterabbey where a monument is erected for her in king henry viiths chapel though some do not stick to tell us that though the monument was erected the body was never removed  here also lies interred catharine of spain another unhappy queen and the divorced wife of king henry viii and mother to queen mary i her monument is not very magnificent but it is far from mean here is an old decayed monument of bishop wulfer the founder of the church but this church has so often been burnt and demolished since tha time that it is doubtful whether the monument be authentic or not  in the cathedral is the figure of one scarlet a sexton who buried the above named two queens one  0 years after the other and under it the following inscription you see old scarlet s picture stand on high but at your feet there does his body lie he did interr two queens within this place and this towns householders in his lifes space twice over but at length his own turn came another man for him should do the same he died at    years old  the chapel here called st marys is a very curious building though now not in use the choir has been often repaired and beautified and is now very fine but the west end or great gate is a prodigy for beauty and variety it is remarkable that as this church when a monastery was famous for its great revenues so now as reduced it is one of the poorest bishoprics in england  in the year    0 at thorp the seat of sir francis st john by peterborough a mosaic pavement was found this was undoubtedly a villa of some roman of distinction in the garden are some fine antique marble statues which suffer more from the weather than from age in the middle is a livia of a colossean proportion in the four quarters diana amphion an orator and a gladiator upon the terrace an admirable hercules killing the hydra in the court two equestrian figures in copper king henry iv of france and don john of austria over most of the doors of the house are placed bustoes of bassianus caracalla and others these antiquities were of the arundel collection  as great part of lincolnshire which is a vastly extended county remained yet unseen by me i was obliged to turn north from peterborough and take a view of the fens again though we kept them at some distance too here we passed the welland at market deeping an old illbuilt and dirty town then we went through bourn to folkingham near which we saw two pieces of decayed magnificence one was the old demolished monastery of sempringham the seat of the gilbertine nuns famous for austerity and the other was the ancient house of the lord clinton queen elizabeths admiral where that great and noble person once lived in the utmost splendour the house though in its full decay shows what it has been and the plaster of the ceilings and walls in some rooms is so fine so firm and so entire that they break it off in large flakes and it will bear writing on with a pencil or steel pen like the leaves of a table book this sort of plaster i have not seen anywhere so prodigiously fine except in the palace of nonesuch in surrey near epsom before it was demolished by the lord berkley  from hence we crossed part of the great heath mentioned before and came into the high road again at ancaster a small but ancient roman village called segeloci it is full of remnants of antiquity a sufficient testimony of which may be deduced from the traffic which the townspeople have for many years carried on with the sale of them after a shower the schoolboys and shepherds look for them on the declivities and never return empty  the town consists of one street running north and south along the road there is a spring at both ends of the town which no doubt was the reason for the romans pitching it at this place for there is no more water from hence to lincoln  on the west side of the town is a road formerly designed for the convenience of those who traveled when the gates were shut in the churchyard are two priests cut in stone  this must have been a populous place from the large quarries about it and the rock lying a very little way beneath the surface  from ancaster we came to grantham famous for a very fine church and its spire steeple the general notion that this steeple stands leaning is certainly a vulgar error i had no instrument indeed to judge it by but according to the strictest observation i could not perceive it or any thing like it and am much of opinion with that excellent poet it is height makes grantham steeple stand awry the chief magistrate here is an alderman assisted by twelve justices this is a neat pleasant well built and populous town has a good market and the inhabitants are said to have a very good trade and to be generally rich  it was certainly a roman town and remains of a castle have been formerly dug up there the spire steeple is  00 yards high and equalled only by another in this county at louth besides the tower of boston here were many religious houses ruins of some of which still remain in one just by the marketplace is a very pretty little chapel or oratory adorned with imagery here is a good freeschool erected by richard fox bishop of winchestor where sir isaac newton received the first principles of literature under the famous william walker then schoolmaster this town lying on the great northern road is famous as well as stamford for abundance of very good inns some of them fit to entertain persons of the greatest quality and their retinues and it is a great advantage to the place  within a mile of grantham stands belton a latebuilt house belonging to the family of brownlow lord tyrconnel in ireland one of the most regular and beautiful seats in this county adorned with curious gardens and a large park but i should not omit to take some notice before i quit lincolnshire of the duke of ancasters pleasant seat at grimsthorpe it is a handsome and commodious house the park is large and beautiful the lawn there whereon is an annual horserace is delightful in the middle of the park stood vaudy abbey founded anno      some small ruins of which are still to be seen  from a hill about a mile beyond this town northwest being on the great york road we had a prospect again into the vale of bever or belvoir which i mentioned before and which spreads itself here into three counties to wit lincoln leicester and rutlandshires also here we had a distant view of belvoir castle which it is supposed took its name from the situation from whence there is so fine a prospect over the country that you see from the hill into lincoln nottingham derby leicester rutland and northamptonshires the castle or palace for such it now is of belvoir is the seat of the noble family of manners dukes of rutland who have also a very noble estate equal to the demesnes of some sovereign princes extending itself into nottingham and derbyshires far and wide and in which estate they have an immense subterranean treasure never to be exhausted i mean the leadmines and coalpits of which i shall say more in their place  in the fine gallery of this noble seat are very ancient and modern family and other pictures particularly the original one of king charles i as he sat at his trial  at bottesworth on the edge of lincolnshire we visited the tombs of the manners noble family which are worth seeing  the other towns which lie on the southwest of the witham in this county not already mentioned are   beckingham an inconsiderable little place lying north of grantham   dunnington a good market town noted for large quantities of hemp and hemp seed   seaford situate in a valley on a little river which is so rapid that its streams never freeze it has a good market and a long square marketplace facing three streets and also   bourne famous for the inauguration of edmund king of the east angles   turning southward from hence we entered rutlandshire remarkable for being the least county in england having but two market towns in it viz okeham and uppingham  okeham stands in the rich valley of cathross it has a castle in which the assizes are held an hospital for the poor and a free school for the education of youth it is a custom in this town that when a nobleman comes on horseback within its precincts he is obliged to pay homage of a shoe from his horse or to commute for it in money  uppingham is a new well built town standing on a hill and has also an hospital and free school  this county though so small is famous for abundance of fine seats of the gentlemen and some of first rank as particularly the earls of gainsborough and winchelsea the late earl of nottingham at a very great expense rebuilt the ancient seat of burleigh on the hill near oakham and on the edge of the vale of cathross it would take up too much of my room to describe as i ought this noble house with its curious paintings fine library and delightful gardens i can only observe that though there may be some sumptuous palaces in england which abounds with so many fine ones that excel in this or that particular i do not know a house in britain which excels all the rest in so many particulars  i cannot help mentioning here that i was drawn to make a visit in my journey to the reverend mr edward roberts of glaston in this little county purely for the sake of his excellent character and we were received by him with great courtesy this gentleman had a very small living in the county the income of which with the surplus of his estate he devoted to the necessitous and of late years had provided himself with all sorts of medicines from london so that his time was spent in relieving the poor in a double capacity as a divine and a physician he often refused promotions in the church though his rectorship was accounted the poorest in the county he disapproved pluralities and always looked with love on his parish as his family but this excellent clergyman died a few months after we were there in march      0 universally lamented his brother thomas roberts esquire died about twelve months before him with as good a character for a lawyer as this gentleman had for a divine for he would give his advice gratis as well as his practice to all without exception and though a great friend to the present royal family would never accept of place or pension and never would interfere in elections which he thought should always be left free and uninfluenced  from hence we came to st martins and stopped at the george out of curiosity because it is reckoned one of the greatest inns in england and thence proceeded to stamford this town is placed in a kind of an angle of the county of lincoln just upon the edge of three counties viz lincoln northampton and rutland this town boasts greatly too of its antiquity and indeed it has evident marks of its having been a very great place in former days  history tells us it was burnt by the danes above   00 years ago being then a flourishing city it was also once an university and here are still the remains of two colleges one called blackhall and the other brazen nose on the gate whereof is a great brazen nose and a ring through it like that at oxford nor could it take this from oxford but oxford from that which is as old as edward iii at the least while that at oxford was not built before henry vii but the famous camps and military ways which still appear at and near this town are a more visible testimony of its having been a very ancient town and that it was considerable in the romans time  it is now a very fair well built and wealthy town consisting of six parishes including that of st martin in stamfordbaron that is to say in that part of the town which stands over the river which though it is not a part of the town critically speaking being not in the liberty and in another county yet it is all called stamford and is rated with it in the taxes  the government of this town is by a mayor and aldermen and not as some write by an alderman and    comburgesses  they boast in this town of very great privileges especially to their mayor such as being freed from the sheriffs jurisdiction and from being impanelled on juries out of the town to have the return of all writs to be freed from all lordslieutenants and from their musters and for having the militia of the town commanded by their own officers the mayor being the kings lord lieutenant and immediately under his majestys command and to be esteemed within the liberties and jurisdiction of the town the second man in the kingdom and the grant of those privileges concludes thus ut ab antiquo usu fuerunt as of ancient time they had been accustomed so that this charter which was granted by edward iv anno      seems to be only a confirmation of former privileges not a grant of new ones  in the church of st martin in stamfordbaron is a very noble monument of william cecil lord burleigh who lies buried there in a large vault just under it and opposite to it on the north side is a more ancient but handsome monument though not so magnificent as the former in memory of richard cecil esquire and jane his wife the father and mother of the said famous lord burleigh also a more modern monument for the great earl who reedifyd the house and for his countess a sister of the late duke of devonshire this is a finished piece it is all of the finest marble and was made at florence and sent over the said earl died on his return from rome at issy near paris aug      00  there is a very fine stone bridge over the river welland of five arches and the town hall is in the upper part of the gate upon or at the end of the bridge which is a very handsome building here are two constant weekly markets three annual fairs and a great midlent mart but the latter is not now so considerable as it is reported to have been formerly  but the beauty of stamford is the neighborhood of the noble palace of the earl of exeter called burleighhouse built by the said lord burleigh lord high treasurer to queen elizabeth  this house is situated in northamptonshire it is built all of freestone looks more like a town than a house at which avenue soever you come to it the towers and the pinacles so high and placed at such a distance from one another look like so many distant parish churches in a great town and a large spire covered with lead over the clock in the center looks like the cathedral or chief church of the town  the house stands on an eminence which rises from the north entrance of the park coming from stamford on the other side viz south and west the country lies on a level with the house and is a fine plain with posts and other marks for horseraces as the entrance looks toward the flat low grounds of lincolnshire it gives the house a most extraordinary prospect into the fens so that you may see from thence near  0 miles without any thing to intercept the sight  as you mount the hill you come to a fine esplanade before the great gate or first entrance of the house where is a small but very handsome semicircle taken in with an iron balustrade and from this rising a few steps you enter a most noble hall but made infinitely more noble by the invaluable paintings with which it is so filled that there is not room to place any thing between them  john earl of exeter grandfather of his present lordship had a great genius for painting and architecture and a superior judgment in both as every part of this noble structure will testify for he changed the whole face of the building pulled down great part of the front next the garden and turned the old gothic windows into those spacious sashes which are now seen there and though the founder who had also an exquisite taste as the manner of buildings then was had so well ordered the situation and avenues of the whole fabric that nothing was wanting of that kind and had also contrived the house itself in a most magnificent manner the rooms spacious the ceilings lofty and the decorations just yet the late earl found room for alterations infinitely to the advantage of the whole as particularly a noble staircase a whole suite of fine apartments with rooms of state fit for the entertainment of a prince especially those on the garden side  as the noble lord abovementioned loved paintings so he had infinite advantage in procuring them for he not only traveled three times into italy and stayed every time a considerable while at florence but his princely deportment and fine accomplishments procured him the personal esteem of the great duke who assisted him in the purchase of many excellent pieces and likewise presented him with several others of great value  among the rest there is in the great hall his lordships picture on horseback done by the great dukes principal painter at his highnesss charge and given to his lordship as a mark of special favor there is also a fine piece of seneca bleeding to death in the warm bath and dictating his last morals to his scholars a piece so excellent that i have been told the late king of france offered the earl  000 pistoles for it  the staircase the ceilings of all the fine lodgings the chapel the hall the late earls closet are all finely painted by the celebrated varrio whom the earl kept    years in his family wholly employed in them and allowed him a coach and horses an equipage a table and servants and a very considerable pension  by the park wall or as some think through the park adjoining to burleighhouse passed an old roman highway beginning at caster a little village near peterborough but which was anciently the roman station or colony durobrevum as i have said this whole town takes in three squares of full  00 feet each two of which are allotted to the castle the third is an area lying to the east before it between the castle and the hill which is still the marketplace from under the castlewalls almost quite round rise many quick springs but of these the syfer spring is the most noted having now four fluxes of water from between the joints of great stones laid flat like a wall and joined together with lead probably by the romans being under their wall it is very pleasantly overshaded with trees its name is saxon and signifies pure which appellation it well deserves the roman way is still to be seen and is now called the fortyfeet way passing from gunworth ferry and peterborough to stamford this was as the antiquaries are of opinion the great road into the north which is since turned from stilton in huntingdonshire to wandsworth or wandsford where is a very good bridge over the the river nine which coming down from northampton as i have observed already passed thence by peterborough and so into the fen country but i am of opinion neither this nor wandsford was the ancient northern road used by the romans for it is evident that the great roman causway is still seen on the left hand of that road and passing the nine at a place called water neuton went directly to stamford and passed the welland just above that town but not in the place where the bridge stands now and this roman way is still to be seen both on the south and the north side of the welland stretching itself on to brig casterton a little town upon the river guash about three miles beyond stamford which was as all writers agree another roman station and was called guasennae by the ancients from whence the river is supposed also to take its name whence it went on to panton another very considerable colony and so to newark where it crossed the fosse  hence the road goes by stretton then leaves a little on the left hand colsterworth highly memorable for being the birthplace of the great philosopher sir isaac newton  this fortyfoot way then must be a crossroad from caster and by that from the fen country so leading into the great highway at stamford as likewise another crossroad went out of the said great road at panton a village of antiquity near ancaster to the town of ancaster where a roman cohort was stationed and thence joined the fosse again at lincoln  near this little village of caster lives the lord fitzwilliams of an ancient family but of an irish title his lordship some years ago built a very fine stone bridge over the river nine near gunworth where formerly was the ferry as i have mentioned before for the passing of which in a coach we paid   s   d  as we pass by burleighpark wall on the great road we see on the west side not above a mile from it another house built by the same lord burleigh and which might pass for a very noble seat were not burleigh by this is called wathorp and stands just on the great roman way mentioned above this is the house of which the old earl is reputed to have said he built it to remove to and to be out of the dust while burleighhouse was sweeping  from hence we went to oundle being told that the famous drum was to be heard at that time in the well but though we saw the well we heard no drum or any noise at all no doubt it is owing if there be any thing in it to the passage of the water and air here are two long stone bridges lowick church on the side of a hill is very fine the monuments of the founder john de drayton of the veres and staffords earl of wiltshire etc are to be seen here as is that of the late duchess of norfolk who after her divorce married sir john germayn of draytonhouse who in a manner entirely new built this ancient seat  oundle is almost surrounded by the river over which it has two handsome stone bridges it is a neat uniformbuilt town  the nine has a range of eminent towns along the banks of it viz northampton wellingborough highamferris thrapston oundle foderinghay wandsford and peterborough all in this county the two first i have already mentioned  highamferris is a small neat and healthful mayortown pleasantly seated on a rising ground and is also an ancient borough  thrapston is delightfully situated in a fine valley and surrounded wlth a rich soil and well watered it has a fine bridge over the nine but is not eminent either for trade or buildings though it will probably soon change its face by virtue of an act passed for making the nine navigable which has had so good an effect that when i was last there the   th of november      on that very day boats were brought up to thrapston for the first time which occasioned much joy in the town  here also is a most beautiful range of meadows and pastures perhaps not to be equalled in england for length they stretch uninterrupted from peterborough to northampton which is near  0 miles in length and in some places are near two miles in breadth the land rich the grass fine and the cattle which feed on them hardly to be numbered  northwest of this river lies kettering a handsome wellfrequented town upon a rising ground and beyond that again is rothwell a pretty good market town  from oundle we traveled northeast into yarley in huntingdonshire a little town tolerably well built the church has a neat lofty spire in our way hither we crossed the watlingstreet way at overton now called cherry orton a village near gunworth ferry is an old mansion house formerly belonging to a very ancient and almost forgotten family of great men called lovetoft on the other side of the river is the fine house i mentioned before belonging to sir francis st john bart which affords a very beautiful prospect to travelers as they pass from the hill beyond stilton to wandsford bridge this wandsford has obtained an idle addition to its name from a story firmly believed by the country people viz that a great flood coming hastily down the river nine in haymakingtime a country fellow having taken up his lodging on a cock of hay in the meadow was driven on the hay down the stream in the night while he was fast asleep toward wisbech in the fens when being wakened he was seen and taken up by some fishermen almost in the open sea and being asked where he lived he answered at wansford in england and we saw at the great inn by the south end of the bridge the sign of a man floating on a cock of hay and over him written wandsford in england  falling down southward we come to stilton a town famous for cheese which is called our english parmesan and is brought to table so full of mites or maggots that they use a spoon to eat them we came again into the roman way at stilton which comes from caster aforementioned and runs all the way to huntingdon which we followed through sauterylane a deep descent between two hills in which is stangatehole noted for being the greatest robbingplace in all this part of the county and so came to huntingdon anciently called huntersdune the countytown situated on a rising ground on the north side of the ouse it is a great thoroughfair on the northern road and is full of very good inns and is a strong pass upon the ouse and in the late civil wars it was esteemed so by both parties it was given by king stephen to david king of scots as an augmentation to his estate and taken away by king henry ii however the scottish kings always claimed it  it is a mayortown and had anciently fifteen churches of later days but four and in the civil wars they were reduced to two the cause of its decay at first is said to be owing to a court minion who procured the passage of the ouse to be stopped which had been navigable to the town the said river is now made navigable for smaller vessels to bedford  the witches of warbois in this county have made so much noise that i shall just mention the fatal end of a man his wife and daughter who were all three hanged for torturing the children of a gentleman in the parish the history of it is kept in queens college library in cambridge and one of their fellows preaches yearly at huntingdon on that occasion the children being sick their urine was sent to master dr dorrington at cambridge who sent a medicine against worms that prevailing nothing the doctor upon second thoughts pronounced the symptoms were from witchcraft it was not long before a proper family was suspected the woman and her daughter were frequently sent for and kept with the children and the disease remitted upon the sight of them but chiefly upon a confession and a sort of petition added to it to this effect was the girls as i am a witch and a greater witch than my mother so i desire that the pains shall go off from this child these confessions were the chief point against the prisoners which they had been prevailed upon to repeat by the strandersby who had observed the children relieved upon it as they imagined and thus three unhappy persons were sacrificed to ignorance and superstition  i shall take farther notice of this subject when i come to lancashire a county formerly famous for witches and where persons likewise suffered for this pretended crime  here are the most beautiful meadows on the banks of the river ouse that i think are to be seen in any part of england which in the summer season are covered with such numerous herds of cattle and flocks of sheep as are hardly credible  this town is one long continued street pretty well built especially from the ground plot where the castle stood here was born oliver cromwell of genteel and worthy parents the house is newbuilt but the room in which he was born is preserved in its first state it has a good marketplace but the freestone bridge or bridges rather and causway over the ouse are a very great ornament as well as benefit to the place here is a good public school  between godmanchester or gormanchester a roman camp and huntingdon is a wooden bridge erected over a rivulet upon principles of gratitude and public charity with this inscription robertus cook emergens aquis hoc viatoribus sacrum dd      that is robert cook having escaped the danger of drowning consecrated this for the use of travelers       on the west side of this town and in view of the plain lower side of the county is a noble though ancient seat of the earl of sandwich the gardens very fine and well kept the situation seems a little obscured by the town of huntingdon in the same plain we saw bugden a small village in which is a very pleasant though ancient house or palace of the bishops of lincoln the house and garden surrounded by a very large and deep moat of water the chapel is very pretty though small there is an organ painted against the wall in a seeming organloft and so properly placed and well painted that we at first believed it really to be one  erith is a large town but without a market  st ives is a pretty neat market town but is lessened and suffered greatly by fire here cromwell after he had prodigally wasted his paternal estate rented a farm before he was elected burgess for cambridge  hinchinbrokehouse which gives title of a viscount to the eldest son of the earl of sandwich and the village of the same name lie at a small distance from huntingdon and a little way southwest stands the town of kimbolton and that most nobly situated and pleasant seat of the duke of manchester kimbolton castle where no pains or cost has been spared tu improve the most beautiful situation in nature with the works and ornaments of art  kimbolton town is the kiniubantum of the romans here queen catharine after she was divorced resided for some time  at ailweston in this county are two springs one of fresh water good for dim eyes the other brackish of use for curing of scabs leprosy etc  from huntingdon we came to st neots on the ouse over which is a good stone bridge the church is strong and well built and the steeple manifests the skill of the artist much to his advantage the town takes its name from neotus a learned and pious man who was interred here from whom likewise st neots in cornwall takes its name where he for some time resided hither coals are brought by water and conveyed by land around the country  here we entered bedfordshire and came to bedford the chief town for it has no city in it though this town is larger and more populous than several cities in england it is one of the seven counties which they say lie together and have not one city among them namely huntingdon bedford bucks berks hertford essex and suffolk  it is remarkable that though a great part of this county viz the two whole hundreds of stodden and bedford lie on the north of the ouse yet there is but one market town in all that side of the ouse beside bedford  it is also remarkable that though the ouse by a long and winding course cuts through the county so as to make above  0 miles between oulney and st neots not above  0 by land yet in all that course it receives only the little river ivel which falls into it a little above temsford  bedford is a large populous thriving pleasant and well built mayortown it has five parish churches a very fine stone bridge over the ouse and the high street especially is very handsome and well built here is also a fair marketplace but it is much improved lately in new buildings the river has also been made navigable and runs through the town it had formerly a castle and now where it stood is one of the most beautiful bowlinggreens in the kingdom it has two hospitals for lazars and another for eight poor people here is a free school well endowed and a charityschool for forty children and though the town is not upon any of the great roads in england yet it is full of very good inns which afford elegant entertainment for here is the best market for all sorts of provisions that is to be seen at any country town in all these parts of england and the reason of it is that though it is so far from london yet the higglers or carriers buy great quantities of provisions here for the london markets here also is a very good trade down the river to lynn  here likewise is a great cornmarket and vast quantities of grain are bought here and carried down by large vessels and barges to lynn where it is again shipped and carried by sea to holland the soil hereabouts is exceeding rich and fertile and particularly produces great quantities of the best wheat in england which is carried by wagons from hence and from the north part of the country  0 miles beyond this to the markets of hitchin and hertford and bought again there and ground and carried in the meal still by land to london  indeed the whole product of this county may be said to be wheat and malt for london for here are very few manufactures except those of straw hats and bone lace of which by itself there are but ten market towns in the whole county which i shall recount as i took them in my course  potton which lies on the borders of cambridgeshire and of no note southward stands  biggleswade a pleasant situated place on the ivel and furnished with a great number of good inns for accommodating travelers between london and york still more southward lies  shefford between two rivulets over each of which is a bridge  west of this town stands ampthill a pretty town delightfully seated between two hills near it is a large park with a great mansion house in it which king charles ii gave to the noble family of bruce who had their title of viscount from this town notwithstanding which and that they were always hereditary stewards of the manor of ampthill yet the present lord bruce lately sold his whole estate here to his grace the duke of bedford  queen catharine after she was divorced chose this town as one of her retiringplaces farther southward is  woburn noted for having plenty of fullers earth near it and likewise another kind of earth which petrifies wood into stone this town having been almost demolished by a terrible fire which happened a few years ago is now rebuilt and makes no mean appearance it belongs almost all of it to his grace the duke of bedford who finished in feb      a fine and commodious marketplace here  the dukes house called woburn abbey is just by the town a good old house and exceedingly pleasant by its situation which is in a fine large park walled round the duke had once designed to have pulled down the old house and to rebuild it in a magnificent manner but laid aside that resolution and only repaired it there are many noble rooms in it and particularly a very capacious and long gallery furnished with a great variety of fine pictures chiefly of the russel family the wainscoting of this noble apartment is strewed as one may say with gilded stars which have a pretty effect among the pictures a room has been laid into this gallery at one end where a good billiardtable is placed  before the house is a very large basin of water surrounded with a fine broad gravelwalk which is bounded with posts and iron chains on the water is a most beautiful yacht of between  0 and  0 tons burden elegantly carved and gilt and completely rigged and mounts ten guns which are fired on occasion of entertainments etc given on board her by his grace there is also an elegant boat with a fine awning over it a wherry of the common shape and a skiff which are very neat and make a beautiful appearance on this noble basin of water  near woburn is battlesden the seat of thomas page esquire abounding with many beauties and still daily improving by additional works in a very fine taste  dunstable is seated on a hill in a chalky ground in the county of bedford it consists of four principal streets answering to the four quarters of the world it is well inhabited and furnished with many good inns for the accommodation of travelers in the center stood one of queen eleanors beautiful crosses which was demolished by the parliament soldiers the situation of this place being high and no running water near they are forced to draw it up from deep wells by means of great wheels and they have four large ponds to receive the rainwater which as a mark of the holding quality of the soil are never dry though they have no other supply they have sometimes dug    fathoms deep in search of springs to no purpose  kingsbury once a royal seat over against the church is now a farmhouse the church is composed of many pieces tacked together as it were some of which are very old it was part of the priory and archbishop cranmer was the last prior who here pronounced the sentence of divorce against queen catharine  the gentlemen of bedford lately came to a laudable resolution of levelling the chalkhill near this town for the benefit of the road which in a frost or after a snower of rain used to be so slippery that neither man nor horse could keep their feet which occasioned often great damage to both to prevent which for the future they employed a number of hands to lower it  dunstable stands on the roman watlingstreet just where it is crossed by icknildstreet here have been roman coins frequently found and on the descent of chiltern hills not far from the town is a large round area of nine acres surrounded with a deep ditch and rampire called mardinhour it was burnt by the danes and rebuilt by henry i to repress a vast number of robbers which infested the country thereabouts and it takes its name from dunning one of the thieves and from dunningcestaple it is now by contraction called dunstable  on the borders of buckinghamshire stands leighton famous for a great cattle and horsefair  northeast of dunstable on the edge of hertfordshire lies luton a little pretty town seated very pleasantly amongst hills and noted for a good market and marketplace  this county is remarkable for having more noblemens and gentlemens seats in it than any county in england the middle part of the county is well stored with wood which affords a great deal of game  through the whole south part of this county as far as the borders of buckinghamshire and hertfordshire the people are taken up with the manufacture of bonelace in which they are wonderfully increased and improved  also the manufactures of strawwork especially straw hats spreads itself from hertfordshire into this county and is greatly increased within a few years past  having thus viewed this county in all its most considerable towns we came from dunstable to st albans where we saw the handsome almshouses built and endowed by the marlborough family and so returned to london  yours etc  letter ii containing a description of part of nottinghamshire of derbyshire and part of yorkshire sir having finished the account of my several circuits which complete the southern part of britain i am now to begin this circuit from the river trent and to confine my observations to the country which is called by some north by trent  the river trent is deemed by ancient writers as the fourth capital river in england the other three being the thames the severn and the humber  though the trent is not the largest yet it may be said to run the longest course and rises nearer to the west side of the island than any of the others it is also the largest and of the longest course of any river in england which does not empty its waters immediately into the sea for the trent runs into the humber and so loses its name before it reaches the ocean  it rises in the highlands of staffordshire called the moorlands receiving from the edge of cheshire and toward lancashire a great many some say  0 and that thence it had its name for trent in french is  0 little rivulets into it very near its head so that it soon becomes one large river and comes down from the hills with a violent current into the flat country where being increased by several other little rivers it carries a deeper chanel and a stiller current and having given its name to trentham a small market town in the same county it goes on to stone a considerable town on the great road to west chester  one branch of the trent rises within a quarter of a mile of the dane from a moor adjoining to a little ridge of hills called molecop hill near congleton within    miles of the irish sea as the dane runs into the weaver and both into that arm of the sea which the mersee makes from frodsham to liverpool and hylelake and as the trent runs into the humber which opens into the great german ocean these rivers may be said to cut the island across in the middle  it is true the northern part is much larger than the southern now scotland is united otherwise the country south by trent including wales is by far the largest as well as the richest and most populous occasioned chiefly by the commerce of the city of london as for the towns of bristol exeter lynn norwich yarmouth etc which are large and very populous and carry on a prodigious trade as well in merchandise as manufacture we shall find them pretty near equalled by the towns of liverpool hull leeds newcastle and manchester and the cities of edinburgh and glasgow  the trent runs a course of near  00 miles through the four counties of stafford derby nottingham and lincoln it receives besides lesser waters the larger rivers of the sow from the west side of the county and from the town of stafford the tame from birmingham and tamworth the soar from leicester and the dove and derwent two furiously rapid streams from the peak of derby the idle a gentle navigable stream from rhetford and nottinghamshire with part of the witham called the fossdike from lincoln also navigable and the greatest of them all the dun from doncaster rotheram and sheffield after a long and rapid course through the moors called stanecross on the edge of derby and the west riding of yorkshire  the trent is navigable by ships of good burden as high as gainsborough which is near  0 miles from the humber by the river the barges without the help of locks or stops go as high as nottingham and farther by the help of art to burton upon this river in staffordshire the stream is full the chanel deep and safe and the tide flows up to gainsborough and newark the navigation by these advantages is a great support to the trade of those counties which border upon it especially the cheese trade from cheshire and warwickshire which have otherwise no navigation but from these parts about west chester to london whereas by this river it is brought by water to hull and from thence to all the south and north coasts on the east side of britain  the only towns of note standing upon the north shore of trent are nottingham and burton of which i shall speak in their order  the counties north of trent are yorkshire which may not improperly be called three counties as it is divided into three ridings each equal to some large counties lancashire which is very large derbyshire and nottinghamshire which are more southerly i shall begin with these two and take them together  beginning at the mouth of trent the first town of note that i met with is nottingham the capital of that shire and the most considerable in all that part of england the county is small but like the peak full of wonders   it is remarkable for its situation being bounded entirely by four counties and those toward the four cardinal points a circumstance peculiar to this county only   for its soil which on the south part is the richest and most fruitful and in the north part the most wild and waste even almost to barrenness of any part of england within many miles of it   for the fine seats of noblemen and gentlemen especially those of the dukes of norfolk kingston rutland newcastle lord middleton and several others  nottingham is one of the most pleasant and beautiful towns in england from its situation were its buildings not to be named  it is situated on the steep ascent of a hill or rock overlooking a fine range of meadows of great extent a little rivulet running on the north side of them almost close to the town and the noble river trent parallel with both on the south side of the meadows over the trent is a stately stone bridge of    arches where the river is very large and deep having received the addition of the dove the derwent the irwash and the soar three of them very great rivers of themselves which fall into it after its passing by burton in staffordshire mentioned before  the rock whereon the town stands is of a sandy kind and so soft that it is hewed into vaults and cellars and yet so firm as to support the roofs of these cellars two or three under one another the stairs which lead to these vaults are cut out of the rock two or three stories deep to  0 steps sometimes and these cellars are well stocked with excellent ale of which the inhabitants are very liberal among their acquaintance as some in our company experienced  the hill or rock was called of old the dolorous hill or golgotha because of a great slaughter of the ancient britons there by king humber a piratical northern monarch who being afterward drowned between hull and barton gave name as it is said to that arm of the sea which is now called the humber and receives the trent and almost all the great rivers of yorkshire into it though others derive the name from the dreadful noise of its waves  they tell us that these caves and cellars served the people for a retreat from their enemies and that from thence the town first took its name which was snottengaham signifying hollow vaults in a rock speluncarum domus and as mr camden observes the british word was tui ogo bauc which signifies the same as the latin a house of dens or secret caves to hide in  besides the delightful situation of nottingham toward the river it is equally pleasant to the land side toward the forest on the north of the town where is a fine plain for a horsecourse where races used to be run once a year  at the west end of the town is a very steep hill and at the south side of it a cliff which falls in a precipice down to the river on this hill stood a castle of so great antiquity that the time of its first erection could never be traced the first account we read of it is that there was a tower here which the danes obstinately defended against king alfred and his brother aethelred  upon the same situation william the conqueror or as others with greater probability maintain william peverell his natural son built another castle which was afterward repaired or rather rebuilt by edward iv who added fine apartments to it which richard iii his brother still farther enlarged whereby it became in time very considerable and so strong that nothing could reduce it but famine it is certain it has not undergone the ordinary fate of other fortified places to be often taken and retaken for it was never stormed once indeed it was taken by surprise in the barons wars by robert earl ferrers who also plundered the town or city as it was then called  the people here tell us of one of the davids king of scotland being kept prisoner in it and that roger mortimer earl of march was hid in a vault under ground which they call mortimershole whence he was taken and hanged for treason  this report has some foundation in history but is so obscured by vulgar tradition that it led mr camden first into some mistakes in his narration and afterward into a disbelief of it mortimer with the queen the bishop of lincoln and others being possessed of the castle could have no reason to hide himself under ground but it was by this private passage which goes by steps through the rock up to the keep that sir william montacute with others   edw iii found means in the dead of the night to seize him and sending him up to the tower he was there beheaded  the castle was granted by k james i to francis earl of rutland and k charles i made it remarkable by erecting there his royal standard      but he soon quitted it and the parliament kept possession of it till the end of the war when it was ordered to be demolished some parts of it however were standing at the restoration when george villiers duke of buckingham whose mother was the sole heir of the foresaid earl of rutland sold it to william cavendish marquis of newcastle he in      cleared the foundations of the old tower a small part excepted and founded the noble structure which is now standing and devolved to the house of pelham the present duke of newcastle beautified it and wainscoted the rooms with cedar and had laid out a plan for the finest gardens in all that part of england being to contain no less than  0 acres but the design is changed and the intended gardens are made a park  the castle built on a high perpendicular rock as i have hinted seems to have been modeled after some of the draughts of inigo jones there are many good pictures in it and it commands a vast prospect the south side of the rock is altogether inaccessible and vast subterraneous grottoes are cut underneath and a winding staircase quite to the bottom ends in mortimershole abovementioned  this castle at present is much neglected being stripped of its best furniture and hangings and the floors of some of the noblest apartments suffered to fall in  st marys church is a fine lightsome gothic building with a good ring of   bells but the great tower makes a mean appearance the butchers shambles is an old edifice built for a granary  they showed us the gardens of count tallard who in his confinement here after having been taken prisoner by the renowned duke of marlborough at the glorious battle of blenheim amused himself with making a small but beautiful parterre after the french taste which happens not to be the reigning one with us at present it is said likewise that this gallant gentleman left behind him here some living memorandums of his great affection and esteem for the english ladies  a handsome townhouse upon piazzas has been erected within these few years for the transacting of the business of the corporation not many years ago the hall where the assizes were held gave such a crack that the people were exceedingly frighted and all ran out of it leaving mr justice powis upon the bench calling out after them is there nobody will take care of the judge for he was so aged and infirm that he could hardly walk but finding himself neglected he made shift to descend from the bench and hobble out at the door where he denounced vengeance against the town which with a very seasonable piece of justice he fined for neglecting to keep the hall in repair  the town has been at great expense in making the trent navigable here for vessels or barges of burden by which all their heavy and bulky goods are brought from the humber and even from hull such as iron blocktin salt hops grocery dyers wares wine oil tar hemp flax etc and the same vessels bring down lead coal wood and corn as also cheese in great quantities from warwickshire and staffordshire as i have already mentioned  when i said the bridge over trent had nineteen arches i might have said also it was a mile long for the trent the last time i was there being swelled over its ordinary bounds reached quite up to the town yet a high causeway with arches at proper distances carried us dry over the whole breadth of the meadows which i think is at least a mile and may justly be called a bridge as that at swarston and also that of poul spooder in wales are called  the chief manufacture carried on here is frameworkknitting of stockens the same as at leicester and some glass and earthen ware the latter is much increased by the consumption of teapots cups etc since the increase of teadrinking as the glasshouses i think are of late rather decreased a proof one would think that the luxury of the males is less predominant than that of the females or rather as some would say that the men are brought over by the ladies to join with them in the love of the teatable and indeed the latter seems pretty much the case whether it be owing to gallantry and complaisance or to effeminacy and indolence let those concerned in the observation answer  as they brew very good liquor here so they make the best malt and more of it of any town in this part of england and send it by landcarriage to derby through all the peak as far as manchester and to other towns in lancashire cheshire and even into yorkshire itself for which purpose all the low lands of this county and especially on the banks of the trent are made to yield prodigious crops of barley  the government of nottingham is in a mayor recorder six aldermen two coroners two sheriffs two chamberlains and    common council whereof six are called juniors here they hold a court of pleas they have two sergeants at mace and another officer which they call a billbearer and two more called pindars one for the fields and the other for the meadows the first is also the town woodward and attends the forest courts for this town is within the jurisdiction of the forest  i might enter into a long description of all the modern buildings erected lately at nottingham but that would be too great a task only i must take notice of the house of mr plumtre which is justly to be admired for its elegant front and observe in general that as the castle has oftener been the residence of kings and queens than any other place so far distant from london so the town has more gentlemens houses than any other of its bigness in great britain one may easily guess nottingham to have been an ancient town of the britons as soon as they had proper tools they fell to work upon the rocks which everywhere offer themselves so commodiously to make houses in one instance of which though perhaps not old enough to be formed on theirs is a ledge of perpendicular rock in the duke of newcastles park hewn into a church houses chambers dovehouses etc the church is like those in the rocks of bethlehem in the holy land the altar is natural rock and there has been painting on the wall a steeple where perhaps was a bell and regular pillars the river here winding about makes a fortification to it for it comes to both ends of the cliff leaving a plain before the middle the way to it was by gates cut out of the rock and with an oblique entrance for more safety  between this and the castle is an hermitage of like workmanship  clifton in this neighborhood is a good seat with pretty gardens and a noble prospect and in the church are many old brasses of the clifton family  three miles from nottingham is wallatonhall the seat of my lord middleton and the noblest building in this county except belvoir which only exceeds it in spaciousness but not in beauty  the park enclosed within a brick wall is much finer than the great park adjoming to the castle of nottingham being much better planted with timber whereas that at nottingham was all cut down and sequestered in the late wars  there is a pretty summer house panelled and ceiled with lookingglass which produces a pleasant effect underneath is a waterhouse with grotesque work of shells etc the hall at the first entrance into the house is so high that a man on horseback might exercise a pike in it  the forest of shirwood is an addition to nottingham for the pleasure it affords of hunting there are also some fine parks and noble houses in it as welbeck the late duke of newcastles now lord oxfords and thoresby the present noble seat of the pierrepoints dukes of kingston which lies at the farthest edge of the forest but this forest is now given up in a manner to waste even the woods which formerly made it famous for thieves are destroyed so that robin hood would now hardly find shelter for a week nor is there any store of deer now left at least not worth mentioning  from this forest i went purposely out of my intended way to take a view of the collegiate church of southwell  southwell is a market town in nottinghamshire its church is both parochial and collegiate which i think is the case of no other in england except rippon in yorkshire to it belong sixteen prebendaries or canons six vicars choral an organist six singing men six choristers besides six boys who attend as probationers a register to the chapter a treasurer an auditor a virger etc  this church is generally supposed to be founded by paulinus the first archbishop of york about the year   0 it was surrendered to the king   d henry viii and was actually in the kings possession until by act of parliament    henry viii it was refounded and restored to its ancient privilege and incorporated by the name of the chapter of the collegiate church of the blessed mary the virgin of southwell  queen elizabeth confirmed its privileges as did afterward on a trial at law king james i  the chapter have a peculiar jurisdiction and there are    parishes subject to it to most of which they have the right of presentation besides some others in lincolnshire and yorkshire this jurisdiction is exercised by a commissary or vicar general chosen by the chapter out of their body who holds visitations etc twice a year and besides these there are two synods yearly to which all the clergy of the county of nottingham pay their attendance and a certain number of the prebendaries and others of the considerable clergy are appointed commissioners by a commission granted by the archbishop of york to preside at the synods  the civil government of the jurisdiction of southwell is distinct from the county at large it is called the soke of southwell cum scrooby which is another town in this county there are about twenty towns subject to this jurisdiction  the custos rotulorum and the justices of the peace are nominated by the archbishop of york and constituted by a commission under the great seal of england who hold their session both at southwell and scrooby and perform all other justiciary acts distinct from the county  the church is a strong plain gothic building it has no painted figures in the glass work nor images nor so much as a niche capable of placing an image in and from hence it has been conjectured that it was probably built before image worship was practiced among christians  on monday the fifth of november      about ten a clock at night the top of the ball on one of the south spires of this church was fired by lightning which backed by a furious wind that drove it almost directly on the body of the church in a few hours burnt down the spire and roof melted the bells and spared nothing which was combustible except the other spire till it came to the choir where after it had consumed the organs it was by singular providence stopped and extinguished the damage was computed at near four thousand pounds  the church is built in form of a cross a great tower in the middle in which are eight bells and two spires at the west end there is a handsome chapter house on the north side of the choir  the length of the church from east to west is  0  feet the length of the cross isle from north to south is     feet the breadth of the church is    feet  there are no very remarkable monuments in this church except one of archbishop sands which is within the communion rails and is a fair tomb of alabaster with his effigies lying on it at full length with a fine inscription upon it in latin greatly to his honor but which being very long i have not room to insert  here was formerly a palace belonging to the archbishop of york which stood on the south side of the church the ruins of which still remain by which it appears to have been a large and stately building it was demolished in the time of the late civil wars the church escaped the fury of those times by the good offices of one edward cludd esquire one of the parliament side who lived at norwood in the parish of southwell in a house belonging to the archbishop here were no less than three parks belonging to the archbishop which though disparked still retain the name one of which is norwood park in which is a good house which has been very much enlarged and beautified by mr burton a descendant of the above edward cludd esquire who lives in it some part of the year  there is a free school adjoining to the church under the care of the chapter where the choiristers are taught gratis and other boys belonging to the town the master is chosen by the chapter and is to be approved by the archbishop of york  there are also two fellowships and two scholarships in st johns college in cambridge founded by dr keton canon of salisbury in the   d year of king henry viii to be chosen by the master and fellows of the said college out of such as have been choiristers of the church of southwell  from southwell i turned to the left to newsted to visit the ancient seat of the very ancient family of the byrons who even in the conquerors time were wealthy it was a small priory founded by king henry ii and given by king henry viii to sir john byron one of which name having signalized himself very remarkably for his loyalty to king charles i was created a baron which honor still continues in the family near this place is the head of the little river lin  we came next to ainsley which town gave name to a family that were possessed of it from the conquest to the time of king henry vi from whence are descended the earls of anglesey but for want of heirs male it came then by marriage into the family of the chaworths who have a good seat here well wooded and watered with beautiful fish ponds  we then turned again on the right to mansfield which lies in the forest a large well built market town noted now for its trade in malt and for having been formerly the place to which the kings of england used to retire for the pleasure of hunting in the forest of shirwood insomuch that a manor was held in this county by henry fauconberg for shoeing the kings horse whenever he came to mansfield  from hence we kept still to the right northeast and came to taxford in the clays an ordinary dirty market town on the great road to york and of no other note than being situated in a miry clayey country and called by king james i taxford in the t  d  we kept the road north to east retford so called as it lies on the east side of the river idle it is an ancient bailiwicktown and noted for an exemption of all tolls and foreign services it holds pleas without limitation of sums and enjoys many other valuable privileges and immunities it has a steward who is generally a person of quality  west retford is so called from its situation in regard to the other though they seem to be but one town the idle only dividing them this is famous for a fine hospital founded by dr dorrel in      and since incorporated it has a master  0 brethren a steward and a nurse and they have a garden and orchard divided into  0 shares  chaworth is a village just by noted for a fine rectory of  00 l a year  higher up stands blithe which is a kind of market town where are a very large good church and some old ruins of a castle and a priory  we then fell down southward and visited the noble seats of the duke of kingston at thoresby of the lord oxford at welbeck and of the late marquis of halifax but now of sir george savil at rufford or rugford abbey all very magnificent structures though ancient especially that at welbeck which is beautified with large additions fine apartments and good gardens but particularly the park which is well stocked with large timber of the finest kind and with great numbers of deer for the late duke of newcastles delight whose property it was before it came by marriage into the harley family being chiefly on horseback and in the chase it is not to be wondered if he rather made his parks fine than his gardens and his stables than his mansion house yet the house is noble large and magnificent  hard by welbeck near the head of the river ryton is wirksop manor the sometime stately seat of the noble family of talbot descended by a long line of ancestors from another family illustrious though not innobled of lovetofts one of whom being lord of this place under the normans built a priory here and john the second earl of shrewsbury being slain at the battle of northampton    henry vi was buried in it which afterward at the dissolution of monasteries was settled on francis his great grandson this house though in its ancient figure is outdone by none of the best and greatest in the county it now belongs to the duke of norfolk  here is a good market town also of the name of wirksop where are the ruins of a monastery to be seen in the meadows on the east side of it and the west end of the church which is still standing and has two beautiful and fair towers this place is noted for liquorice and malt  from hence leaving nottinghamshire the west part of which abounds with lead and coal we came to balsover in derbyshire which stands on a rising ground and has a castle and is the property of the duke of newcastle but is no market town  from hence we intended to pass directly to derby but being informed that the moors by reason of the rocks and bogs which render the roads difficult and hazardous were too dangerous to travel over we left them on the west of us and passing through mansfield in nottinghamshire and alfreton a small market town within the skirts of derbyshire we arrived at derby the countytown but though we avoided the moors yet we had some reason to complain of the roads which we took from the north of nottinghamshire where we were informed that if we had come directly from nottingham to this town and kept the midway between the trent on the left and the mountains on the right we should have found the    miles which lie between them as agreeable with respect to the situation of the country the soil and the well planting of it as any of the same length in england  the town of derby is situate on the west bank of the derwent over which it has a very fine stone bridge well built but ancient and a chapel upon the bridge now converted into a dwelling house it is a fine beautiful and pleasant town and has more families of gentlemen in it than is usual in towns so remote perhaps the more because the peak which takes up the larger part of the county is so inhospitable rugged and wild a place that the gentry choose to reside at derby rather than upon their estates as they do elsewhere  here is a curiosity of a very extraordinary nature and the only one of the kind in england i mean those mills on the derwent which work the three capital italian engines for making organzine or thrown silk which before these mills were erected was purchased by the english merchants with ready money in italy by which invention one hand will twist as much silk as before could be done by fifty and that in a much truer and better manner this engine contains       wheels and       movements which work       yards of silkthread every time the waterwheel goes round which is three times in one minute and     0   0 yards in one day and night one waterwheel gives motion to all the rest of the wheels and movements of which any one may be stopped separately one fireengine likewise conveys warm air to every individual part of the machine and the whole work is governed by one regulator the house which contains this engine is of a vast bulk and five or six stories high  a patent passed   george i to secure to sir thomas lombe the sole property of this invention for    years but the requisite buildings and engines and the instructing of proper persons to work them took up so much time and when all was completed the king of sardinia prohibiting the importation of the raw silk made by the said engines into his dominions all which rendered the undertaking expensive and difficult and the term of    years being near elapsed without any great benefit accruing from the useful invention sir thomas applied for a consideration from the public and the parliament accordingly to preserve so useful an undertaking for the benefit of the kingdom in general allotted   000 l to be paid to sir thomas on condition that he should allow a perfect model to be taken of his newinvented engines in order to secure and perpetuate the art of making the same the preamble to this act sets forth that sir thomas lombe did with the utmost difficulty and hazard and at a very great expense discover the art of making and working the three capital engines made use of by the italians to make their organzine silk and did introduce those arts and inventions into this kingdom  this wonderful piece of machinery was under the direction of sir thomas lombe or as some say of his brother erected by one soracole a man expert in making millwork especially for raising water to supply towns for family use  derby as i have said is a town of gentry rather than trade yet it is populous well built has five parishes a large marketplace a beautiful townhouse of freestone and very handsome streets but the entrance into it every way is so choked up with dirt and mire that it is no small matter of reproach to the inhabitants  in the church of all saints is the burialplace of the noble cavendish family and an hospital close by the church built by one of that family for eight poor men and four women  this church is remarkable for the architecture of its beautiful gothic tower     feet high and for the elegance of its ornaments as well as height is not to be equalled in this or in any of the adjacent counties  according to an inscription in this church the steeple was erected about queen marys reign at the charge of the maidens and batchelors of the town on which account whenever a maiden a native of the town was married the bells used to be rung by batchelors how long the custom lasted i have not read but i do not find it is now continued this union of the maidens and batchelors to build a steeple reminds me of a bell cast by a like contribution upon which was this device materiem juvenes formam tribuere puellae  the government of this town is in a mayor high steward   aldermen a recorder    brothers    capital burgesses and a town clerk what trade there is in the town is chiefly in good malt and good ale  beyond derby along the ricning way is burton upon trent where is a bridge of    arches here was an old abbey out of whose ruins they have within these few years built a new church  a mile below derby upon the derwent stood the old roman derventio now little chester remains of the old walls vaults wells roman coins aqueducts human bones brass rings and other marks of antiquity have been from time to time discovered and dug up the river being too rapid for a ford a bridge was anciently there the foundations of which with a staff they can still feel  a little further north is horreston castle whose ruins on a hoary rock are scarce discernible  it is observable that as the trent bounds the county of derby south so the dove and the erwash make the bounds east and west and the derwent runs through the center all of them beginning and ending their course in the same county for they rise in the peak and end in the trent the derwent is remarkable for its brownness the dove for its blue transparency from whence it probably took its name it is endued with such a peculiar fecundity supposed to arise from a bed of lime through which it passes that it has often been compared to the river nile  it is not less swift in its operations than effectual for by hasty rains which fall from the hills it sometimes strays over the meadows and having impregnated them in    hours time retires into its bed again  it was in one of these temporary inundations i saw it when having gone from derby to dowbridge as it is called i passed it with difficulty to see two market towns ashbourn and utoxeter the utocetum of the ancients  the first lies on the east side of the river in a very rich soil to the northwest of derby and the other commonly called utcester is situate due west of derby on the other side of the river in staffordshire upon a delicious rising ground of an easy ascent and very fruitful overlooking a track of fine rich meadowgrounds the town is very ordinarily built but has a good and commodious marketplace and an excellent market for all sorts of living kine besides butter cheese and corn and also all kinds of provisions  in our way to the high peak we passed an ancient seat large but not very gay of sir nathanael curson from hence we kept the derwent on our right hand which having overflowed its banks by the accession of floods pouring down from the peak hills rendered it so frightful that we contented ourselves with hearing at a distance its shocking roar and so came to quarn or quarnden a little ragged but noted village where is a famous chalybeat spring to which abundance of people resort in the season to drink the water as likewise a cold bath there are also several other mineral waters in this part of the country a hot bath at matlock and another at buxton of which in their places besides these there are hot springs in several places which run waste into the ditches and brooks and are taken no notice of being remote among the mountains and out of the way of common resort  we found the wells at quarn pretty full of company the waters good and very physical but wretched lodging and entertainment  from quarnden we advanced due north and mounting the hills gradually for four or five miles we soon had a most dismal view of the black mountains of the peak however as they were at a distance and a good town lay on our left called wirksworth we turned thither for refreshment here we found verified what i had often heard before that however dreary the hills might appear the vales were everywhere fruitful and delightful to the eye also wellinhabited and having in them good market towns abounding with all necessary provisions and as for the ale the further we went northward the better it seemed to be  wirksworth is a large wellfrequented market town though there is no very great trade carried on in it but what relates to the leadworks  the peakrills as they are called are a rude boorish kind of people but bold daring and even desperate in their search into the bowels of the earth for which reason they are often employed by our engineers in the wars to carry on the sap when they lay siege to strong fortified places  the barmoot court kept at wirksworth to judge controversies among the miners and adjust subterranean quarrels and disputes is very remarkable it consists of a master and    jurors who when any person has found a vein of ore in anothers land except it be in orchards or gardens assign two meres of ground in a pipe as they term it and a flat the former being    yards long and the latter    yards square appointing to the finder one mere and the other to the owner of the land half at each end of the finders and moreover certain fees and perquisites for the passage of carts the use of timber and the like this court not only prescribes rules to the miners and limits their proceedings in the works underground but is judge of all their little quarrels above  the produce of the mines in this hundred is very considerable the king claims the   th penny duty for which they compound at the rate of  000 l a year nay i have been informed that the tithe of wirksworth alone has been worth to the incumbent yearly that sum  not far from hence lies hartington which gives title of marquis to the eldest son of the duke of devonshire  near wirksworth and upon the very edge of derwent is a village called matlock where as i said are several warm springs one of these is secured by a stone wall on every side by which the water is brought to rise to a due height and if it is too high there is a sluice to let it out as low as you please it has a house built over it and room within the building to walk round the bath and so by steps go down gradually into it the water is but just milkwarm so that it is no less pleasant to go into than sanative  this bath would be much more frequented than it is if a sad stony mountainous road which leads to it and no good accommodation when you are there did not hinder for from the bath you are to cross over the meadows and then ascend a derbyshire hill before you meet with a house of refreshment  for some miles before you come to matlock you pass over barren moors in perpetual danger of slipping into coalpits and leadmines or ride for miles together on the edge of a steep hill on solid slippery rock or loose stones with a valley underneath the bottom of which you can hardly discover with your eye instead of trees and hedges they fencein their poor meadow for arable with walls made of loose stones picked from under their feet the extended sides of the mountains are generally powdered over as it were with rocks streams of water dribbling down every where and sometimes bolder cataracts diversify the romantic scene  at the smeltingmills they melt down the lead ore and run it into a mold whence it becomes pigs as they call them the bellows are kept in continual motion by running water we were complimented to be let down  00 yards deep into the mines if we pleased over against this warm bath and on the east side of the derwent we came to a monstrous parcel of gigantick rocks seemingly pild on one another called the torr a few inhabitants in little cottages trusted themselves at bottom under so ruinous a shelter i took the pains on hands and knees to clamber near the top and entered an hermits cell hewn in the rock with a most dreary prospect before it on one end is a crucifix and a little nich where i suppose the anchorite placed his saint over against it about half a mile off is such another cliff but by the care of a gentleman who lives underneath mr ash is hewn out of the rock an easy ascent by steps and there are abundance of alcoves grotts summerhouses cellars pinacles dials balustrades urns etc all of the same materials and by the help of earth carried up to the top there are fine grass walks with greens planted along them upon this hanging terrace whence you have a fine view over many a craggy mountain  a little on the other side of wirksworth begins a long plain called brassington moor which reaches from brassington to buxton full    miles from wirksworth it is not quite so much the peak people who are mighty fond of raising the admiration of strangers told us here of another high mountain where a giant was buried which they called the giants tomb  we rode up the hill which seemed to be round with a precipice almost on every side of it while we were in quest of the tomb of the dead we found the rock afforded an habitation for a poor woman and her children we entered into their mansion divided by a curtain into its several offices and a funnel worked through the top to carry the smoke out where the celebrated tombstone was her husband she said was a miner who if he had good luck could earn his five pence and she could also earn her three pence a day were it not for the care of so many children but she blessed god they lived very comfortably an instance of that happy contentment oftener met with in habitations like this than in gilded palaces  we went next by the direction of the good woman to a valley on the side of a rising hill where were several grooves for so they call the mouth of the shaft or pit by which they go down into a lead mine as we were standing still to look at one of them admiring how small they were and scarce believing a poor man who told us they went down those narrow holes to a great depth in the earth we were surprised with seeing a hand and then an arm and quickly after a head thrust up out of the very groove we were looking at  immediately we rode closer up to the place where we saw the poor wretch working and heaving himself up gradually as we thought with difficulty but when he showed us that it was by setting his feet and elbows upon pieces of wood fixed cross the angles of the groove like a ladder we found the difficulty was not much and that if the groove had been larger he could not go up and down with so much ease or safety  those who would have a more perfect idea of those grooves need only see the square wells in the church of st paul by which the workmen go down from the top of the church into the very vaults under it to place the leaden pipes which carry the rain water from the flat of the roof to the commonsewer they have small iron bars placed cross the angles for the men to set their feet on in the manner here represented  when this subterranean creature was come quite out with all his furniture about him he afforded us new matter of wonder which satisfied our curiosity without venturing down ourselves for the man was a most uncouth spectacle he was clothed all in leather had a cap of the same without brims some tools in a little basket which he drew up with him not one of the names of which we could understand but by the help of an interpreter nor indeed could we understand any of the mans discourse so as to make out a whole sentence and yet he was pretty free of his tongue too he was lean as a skeleton pale as a dead corpse his hair and beard a deep black what little flesh he had was lank and as we thought something of the color of the lead itself besides his basket of tools he brought up with him about three quarters of a hundred weight of ore which was no small load considering the manner of his coming up and it was this which occasioned that heaving and struggling at his first appearance and it seems he was at work  0 fathoms deep but that there were five men of his party two of whom were    fathoms and the other three    fathoms deeper the man seemed to regret that he was not at work with these three for they had a way out at the side of the hill without coming up so high as he was obliged to do we then looked on the ore and got the poor mans leave to bring every one a small piece of it away with us for which we gave him two pieces of better metal  from hence entering upon brassington moor mentioned above we had eight miles smooth green riding to buxton bath which they call one of the seven wonders of the peak comprised in that noted verse of mr hobbs aedes mons barathrum binus fons antraque bina house mountain depth two fountains and two caves   this place has some advantages beyond what the city of bath can pretend to here is an open and healthy country a variety of fine views to entertain the curious and a beautiful down for the ladies to take the air in much more agreeable than the close city of bath which is very deficient in this particular  and as to the medicinal nature of the waters at buxton hear what dr leigh says of their virtues and the manner of their operation in his natural history of lancashire and of the peak his words are as follow the waters are sulphurous and saline yet not fetid but very palatable because the sulphur is not united with any vitriolic particles or but very few saline it tinges not silver nor is it purgative because its saline parts are dispensed in such small proportions  if drank they create a good appetite open obstructions and no doubt if mixed with the chalybeat waters that are there also may answer all the intentions of the bath water in somersetshire and that of st vincents too at bristol so noted for curing the diabetes of which i have seen several instances in these parts and likewise for curing of bloody urines of which i saw a most noted instance at liverpool  this bath is of a temperate heat and without question by a reverberating halitus might be brought to any degree of heat but i think in its own natural heat it may in general be said to be more agreeable to the constitution and where the hot baths cannot be safely used this may this last summer i saw remarkable instances of its effects in scorbutic rheumatisms in persons that could not go before without the help of crutches who came from thence to manchester on foot without them distant from buxton full    northern miles    the village where the principal springs are is called buxton though there are several of them for they rise unregarded in the banks of the enclosures and on the sides of the hill so that their number is hardly known  the duke of devonshire lord of the village has built a large and convenient house for the reception of strangers the bathroom is arched overhead and the whole made handsome convenient and delightful this collection of tepid waters exceeding clear will receive  0 people at a time to walk and swim in the temper of the water is equal to new milk or bloodwarm procuring a moderate perspiration its effect is remarkable for giving that gentle relaxation of the solids which takes off the weariness and fatigue of a journey and refreshes instantly it is physically useful in many cases and may be indulged in more than the hotbaths of somersetshire which frequently do harm through imprudent use such a one as this naturally is was aimed at by the sumptuous bagnios of the roman emperors  sir thomas delves who received a cure here gave the pump and a pretty stone alcove over the drinkingspring in the yard the water may be raised at pleasure to any height we found in one of the rooms these verses written upon the wall by a physician who formerly frequented the place corpore debilior grani se proluit undis quaerit aquas aponi quem febris atra necat ut penitus renem purget cur psaulia tanti vel quae lucinae gaudia calderiae sola mihi buxtona placet buxtona britannis undae grani aponus psaulia calderiae which may be thus translated in grans famed baths the weakly patient laves whom dismal fevers seize in apons waves at psaulia shall a purge so dear be bought in teeming throes calderiae far be sought when here at buxton  britains choice appear places abroad noted for the virtue of their waters gran upon psaulia and calderiae near   as to the antiquity of these baths though there is not a king bladud to testify for them as for those at bath in somersetshire yet the learned author abovementioned observes that it is certain they were eminent in the time of the romans lucan and others acquaint us that they were extraordinary hot etc and the highroad called the roman bathgate as mr camden says farther confirms it but it is especially evident from a roman wall cemented with red roman plaster close by st annes well where we may see the ruins of the ancient bath its dimensions and length  the queen of scots took her leave of this place with a distich of julius caesar somewhat altered which is still shown written with a diamond on a pane of glass as the last classical authority of antiquity buxtona quae calidae celebrabere nomine lymphae forte mihi posthac non adeunda vale buxton whose fame thy baths shall ever tell whom i perhaps shall see no more farewell   about half a mile off is that stupendous cavern called pooleshole at the foot of a great mountain and deemed the second wonder of the peak the entrance is so low and narrow that you must stoop to get in but immediately it dilates into a wide and lofty concavity which reaches above a quarter of a mile endwise and farther as they say some old women with lighted candles are guides in this dark way water drops everywhere from the roof and incrusts all the stones with long crystals and fluors whence a thousand imaginary figures are shown you by the name of lions fonts lanterns organs flitch of bacon etc at length you come to the queen of scots pillar as the boundary of most peoples curiosity it was so named by that unhappy princess when she visited this place nor needed she any other monument for by this incident she may be said to have erected one to her memory which will probably last as long as the works of nature though every one almost that comes hither carries away a piece of it in memory of the princess or the place it is a clear bright stone like alabaster or rather like that kind of spar which is found about lead and considering the country where it grows is probably something of that sort  a stream of water runs along the middle among the falling rocks with a hideous noise reechod from all sides of the horrid concave on the left hand is a sort of chamber where they say poole a famous robber lived and whose kitchen as well as bedchamber they show you after you have crept  0 yards on all fours  the most surprising thing you meet with in it is the extraordinary height of the arch which however is far from what a late author has magnified it to a quarter of a mile perpendicular dr leigh spends some time in admiring the spangled roof cotton and hobbes are exceedingly witty upon it dr leigh calls it fretwork organ and choirwork the whole of the matter is this the rock being everywhere moist and dropping some of the drops are fallen which you see below some are falling and others are pendent in the roof now as you have guides before you and behind carrying every one a candle the light of the candles reflected by the globular drops of water dazzle your eyes like the dew in a sunshine morning whereas were any part of the arch of this vault to be seen by a clear light all this beauty would disappear  let any person therefore who goes into pooles hole and has a mind to make the experiment take a long pole in his hand with a cloth tied to the end of it and wipe the drops of water away he will at once extinguish all those glories then let him wait till other drops emerge and he will find the stars and spangles glittering as before  as to the several stones called cottons stone haycocks stone pooles chair flitch of bacon and the like they do not enough resemble what they are said to represent as to be the foundation of even a poetic metamorphosis  the petrifying water indeed might have exercised ovids fancy for you see drops pendent like icicles or rising up like pyramids and hardening into stone just the reverse of what the poet describes of stones being softened into men  the third wonder of the peak is mam tor or as the word in the mountain jargon or rather in the british signifies the mother rock for mam is the british word for mother upon a suggestion that the soft crumbling earth which falls from its summit produces several other mountains below the whole of the wonder is this on the south side of this hill is a precipice very steep from the top to the bottom and the substance being of a crumbling loose earth mingled with small stones is continually falling down in small quantities as the heavy rains loosen and wash it off or as frosts and thaws operate upon it now the great hill which is thick as well as high parts with this loose stuff without being sensibly diminished so the bottom into which it falls being narrow is more easily perceived to swell here then is the pretended wonder that the little heap below should grow up into a hill without any decrease of the great hill as it should seem notwithstanding so much has fallen from it but the fact is certainly otherwise though not perceivable  this hill lies on the north side of the road from buxton to castleton at which place you come to the fourth much famed wonder styled the devils arse in the peak the short account of it is this on the steep side of a mountain is a large opening almost in the form of an old gothic arch from its center only that the entrance is horizontal it is upwards of  0 feet perpendicular and twice as much broad at the bottom at least  it continues thus wide but a little way yet far enough to have several small cottages built on either side of it within the entrance like a little town in a vault in the middle as it were of the street is a running stream of water in poetical descriptions it is called a river though not the river styx  as you go on the roof descends gradually and is now so far from having houses that a man cannot stand upright in it till stooping for a little way and passing over another rill of water likewise called a river you find more room over your head but going a little farther you come to a third water which crosses your way and the rock stooping as it were down almost to the surface of the water puts an end to the travellers search  but when we read in scripture that the caves of adullam and macpelah were able to receive david and his troop of  00 men and what travelers relate of a cave in the apennine mountains near florence large enough to contain an army and when we know that there are many others in the alps and the hills of dauphine and savoy and other parts of the world this surely can be thought no wonder unless we credit gervaise of tilbury who tells us of a shepherd that ventured into the third river in this den and being either carried over it or down the stream he knew not whether saw a beautiful heavenly country beyond it with a spacious plain watered with many clear rivers pleasant brooks and several lakes of standing water  castleton takes its name from the castle that lies near it which is a very ancient building and so situated as to be only one way accessible being erected on an high steep rock and the way that goes to it is so full of twinings and turnings that it is two miles from the bottom to the top  not far off is a little village called burgh frequented by the romans on account of the baths as appears evidently by a causway leading from hence thither  the fifth wonder is called tideswell or weedenwell a spring which according to some writers ebbs and flows as the sea does the basin or receiver for the water is about three foot square the water seems to have some other receiver within the rock which when it fills by the force of the original stream the air being contracted or pent in forces the water out with a bubbling noise and so fills the receiver without but when the force is spent within then it stops till the place is filled again and in the mean time the water without runs off till the quantity within swells again and then the same cause produces the same effect so that this oceanet as mr cotton calls it which has been the subject of several philosophic inquiries is owing wholly to the figure of the place and is only a mere accident in nature and if any person were to dig into the narrow cavities and give vent to the air which is pent up within they would soon see tideswell turned into an ordinary stream  this spring lies near the little market town of tiddeswall wherein are a very good church and a free school  so much for the five fictitious wonders i come now to the two real wonders elden hole and the duke of devonshires fine house at chatsworth the one natural the other artificial  in the middle of a plain open field gently descending to the south is this frightful chasm in the earth or rather in the rock called elden hole the mouth of it is about  0 feet over one way and  0 or  0 the other descending down perpendicular to the earth how deep could never yet be discovered notwithstanding several attempts have been made to find its bottom mr cotton says he let down  00 fathom of line which is   00 yards near a mile perpendicular  the author has poetically enough described the noise the huge massy stones make which the country people often throw down here the hissing of spears and arrows is seldom omitted in poetry to describe the terror they bring he has here improved a similar noise into a mark of fear when ones turned off it as it parts the air a kind of sighing makes as if it were capable of the trembling passion fear till the first hit strikes the astonished ear like thunder under ground thence it invades with louder thunder those tartarean shades which groan forth horror at each ponderous stroke the unnatral issue gives the parent rock whilst as it strikes the sound by turns we note when nearer flat sharper when more remote when after falling long it seems to hiss like the old serpent in the dark abyss   they tell a dismal story here of a traveller who inquiring his way to castleton or to buxton in a dark night two villains offered to guide him but intending to rob him led him to the edge of this gulf and either thrust him in or made him believe there was a little gull of water and bad him take a large step which he did into this abyss and into that of eternity at the same time one of the villains being hanged at derby some years after for some other roguery confessed this diabolical action at the gallows  it raises an horror in the imagination when one does but look into this frightful hole and so i shall leave it with the words of the forementioned author who supposing it one of the entrances to the infernal world says for he who standing on the brink of hell can carry it so unconcerned and well as to betray no fear is certainly a better christian or a worse than i   i come now to the magnificent seat of the earls and dukes of devonshire called chatsworthhouse  this glorious fabric may be said to have had two or three different founders who have all improved upon one another in the completion of this great design  the house was begun on a much narrower plan than it now takes up by sir william cavendish of cavendish in suffolk who by marriage with the countess dowager of shrewsbury became entitled to a noble fortune in this country  sir william died after having done little more than build one end of the fabric and lay out the plan of the whole but his lady finished it in the magnificent manner which it appeared in when it was was first ranked among the wonders of the peak and if it deserved to be so ranked then how much more does it now with the additional improvements made by the first duke of devonshire  one thing is observable that the very disadvantages of situation contribute to the beauty of the place and by the most exquisite management are made subservient to the builders design on the east side not far distant rises a prodigious high mountain which is so thick planted with beautiful trees that you only see a rising wood gradually ascending as if the trees crowded one above the other to admire the stately pile before them  upon the top of this mountain they dig millstones and here begins a vast extended moor which for    or    miles together due north has neither hedge house or tree but a waste and houling wilderness over which when strangers travel it is impossible to find their way without guides  nothing can be more surprising of its kind to a traveller who comes from the north when after a tedious progress through such a dismal desert on a sudden the guide brings him to this precipice where he looks down from a comfortless barren and as he thought endless moor into the most delightful valley and sees a beautiful palace adorned with fine gardens if contraries illustrate each other here they are seen in the strongest opposition it is really surprising to think what a genius it must be that should lay out so great a design in such a place where the mountains intercept the clouds and threaten were earthquakes frequent here to bury whole towns and what seems equal to a town this house in their ruins  on the plain which extends from the top of this mountain is a large body of water which takes up near  0 acres and from the ascents round it receives as into a cistern all the water that falls which through pipes supplies the cascades waterworks ponds and canals in the gardens  before the west front of the house which is the most beautiful and where the first foundress built a very august portal runs the river derwent which though not many miles here from its source yet is a rapid river when by hasty rains or the melting of snows the hills pour down their waters into its chanel for the current by reason of its many contracted passages among the rocks pieces of which of an incredible bulk come sometimes rolling down its stream on the least motion of its waters above their ordinary height roars like the breaches on the shores of the sea  over this river is a stately stone bridge with an ancient tower upon it and in an island in the river an ancient fabric all of stone and built like a castle which are the works of the said foundress and show the greatness of the original design but are all except the bridge eclipsed as it were by the modern glories of the late edifice  the front to the garden is a regular piece of architecture the frize under the cornice has the motto of the family upon it in gilt letters so large as to take up the whole front though the words are these two cavendo tvtvs which is no less applicable to the situation of the house than the name of the family  the sashes of the second story we were told are    feet high of polished lookingglass two feet wide and the woodwork doublegilt  under this front lie the gardens exquisitely fine and to make a clear vista or prospect beyond into the flat country toward hardwick another seat of the same owner the duke to whom those things which others thought impossible were practicable removed a great mountain that stood in the way and which interrupted the prospect  in the usual approach to this noble fabric it presents itself thus first the river which in calm weather glides gently by then a venerable walk of trees where the famous hobbes used often to contemplate a noble piece of ironwork gates and balusters expose the front of the house and court terminated at the corners next the road with two large stone pedestals of attick work curiously adorned with trophies of war and utensils of all the sciences in basso relievo this part of the building is ionick the whole being a square of a single order but every side of a different model a court in the middle with a piazza of dorick columns of one stone each overlaid with prodigious architraves the stone is of an excellent sort veined like marble hewn out of the neighboring quarries and tumbled down the adjacent hill in the anteroom to the hall are flat stones of    feet square laid upon the heads of four pillars and so throughout in the hallstairs the landingsteps are of the same dimensions the doors chimneys windowcases stairs etc all of marble the ceilings and walls of all the apartments charged with rare painting of varrio and other famous hands the bathroom all of marble curiously wrought  the chapel is a most ravishing place the altarend and floor marble the seats and gallery cedar the rest of the wall and ceiling painted  the gardens abound with greenhouses summerhouses walks wildernesses orangeries with all the proper furniture of statues urns greens etc with canals basins and waterworks of various forms and contrivance as seahorses drakes dolphins and other fountains that throw up the water an artificial willowtree of copper spouts dropping water from every leaf a wonderful cascade where from a neat house of stone like a temple out of the mouths of beasts pipes urns etc a whole river descends the slope of a hill a quarter of a mile in length over steps with a terrible noise and broken appearance till it is lost underground beyond the garden upon the hills is a park and that overlooked by a very high and rocky mountain here are some statues and other antiquities  i should never have done were i to say all that might be said of this august palace but two historical circumstances in its honor must not be forgotten viz that mary queen of scots whom we had occasion to mention as a visitant of the peak was for    years in custody in this house under the care of the celebrated foundress of it in memory of this royal captive the new lodgings that are built instead of the old are still called the queens of scots apartment happy for her could she have been allowed to have paid the same fine compliment to the owner of it which the count de tallard did and is our other historical circumstance when he had been entertained for a few days by the late duke of devonshire when i return said he into my own country and reckon up the days of my captivity i shall leave out those i spent at chatsworth  i will close all i have to say of this famous palace as i may call it with the following brief extract from the letter of an ingenious gentleman to his friend this place says he exceeds all the high ideas and descriptions that were ever given me of it the house yields to nothing in europe it is prodigiously great in every part i never saw such a number of fine rooms but the situation surpasses all nature has laid herself out in amazing variety of greatness and prospects a fine river below with fine banks some naked and rocky others declining and woody many smooth and proper for walking large groves and fishponds and canals between the river and the house which rises proudly upon several terraces and has behind it a great lawn intermixed with plantations and great walks all rising one above another at first gently afterward over vast precipices to the top of a high mountain which was all covered upon the brows with high trees two or three miles on either side then breaks into a thousand vales and green hills then resuming its former height and bulk proceeds again a mighty mountain covered with rocks and heath its sides in many places adorned with wood the whole yielding a most extensive prospect of many miles every body has heard of the great cascade    there are likewise other curiosities in the peak which i need but just mention as the tottering stones at byrch over standing upon a hard rock one of them said to be four yards high    round and yet rests upon a point so equally poised that it may be moved with a finger the roman causeway called bathgate the several minerals found in the hills and in the lead mines as black lead stibium or antimony and crystal  bakewell is the best town in the northwest side of the peak it lies on the banks of the wye and has a good market the parish is exempt from episcopal jurisdiction near this the duke of rutland has a very noble palace called haddon now entirely uninhabited it was anciently the seat of the vernons some of whom were members of parliament for this county as early as edward iii sir george vernon in queen elizabeths time was styled king of the peak and his daughter being married to thomas the son of the first earl of rutland it came into the family of the manners  the extended angle of this county which runs a great way northwest by chapel in the frith which was formerly a market town and which they call high peak is perhaps the most desolate wild and abandoned country in great britain the mountains of the peak of which i have been speaking seem to be but the beginning of wonders to this part of the country the tops of whose hills seem to be as much above the clouds as the clouds are above the ordinary hills  nor is this all the countenance of these mountains is such that they have no bounds to them but the sea they run on in a continued ridge from one to another even to the highlands in scotland so that they may be said to divide britain as the apennine mountains divide italy thus joining to blackstone edge they divide yorkshire from lancashire and going on north divide the bishopric of durham from westmorland and so on all the rivers in the north of england take their rise from them those on the east side run into the german ocean those on the west side into the irish for instance the dove and the derwent rise both at the south end of them and come away south to the trent but all the rivers afterward run as above east or west and first the mersee rises on the west side and the dun on the east the first runs to warrington and into the sea at liverpoole the other to doncaster and into the sea at humber i shall confirm this observation as i go on for to give an account of rivers is the best guide to the geography of a country but to return to my progress  we went next to chesterfield a handsome populous town situate between rivulets on the south side of a hill northeast from chatsworth well built and well inhabited notwithstanding it stands in the extremity of this rocky country for being on the north side of the county next to yorkshire it leads into the hundred of scarsdale which is a rich fertile part of the country though surrounded with barren moors and mountains for such the name scarsdale signifies it is a mayortown of great antiquity and was made a free borough by king john it is now a place of considerable merchandice and dealings in lead grocery mercery melting of barley tanning stockens blankets bedding etc in which they have great intercourse to and with yorkshire nottinghamshire lincolnshire leicestershire and london also to and with the towns and places of bakewell tiddeswell wirksworth ashbourne the peak and west of derbyshire with chester manchester liverpoole etc it has a fair church the spire of its steeple being timber covered with lead is warped all awry it has also a free school and a new large marketplace which is well supplied with lead and with the commodities abovementioned  dornfield is a small market town noted only for its high situation just on the edge of the peak  we are now entered into the county of york which is of larger extent than any two counties in england joined together being in compass   0 miles its figure is a large square and is adequate to the dukedom of wirtemburgh in germany and contains more ground than all the seven united provinces i was at first puzzled which way to direct my course in this large county but at last resolved to strike through the middle of the county and along the northeast part of the west riding up as far as rippon which is about the center of the county  this great county is divided into three ridings north east and west riding this last which i choose first to speak of is much the largest and most populous and has in it the greatest number of towns as well as the most considerable and likewise the best manufactures and consequently the greatest share of riches  sheffield situated on a rising ground is the first town we came to from derbyshire it is famous for whittlemaking cutlery wares and ironwork there being a great many good iron mines about it and likewise some of alum the town is very ancient and has been always considerable though no corporation and that it was noted in chaucers time for the same trade appears by those lines of his  a miller  with a rizzled beard and a hooked nose and a sheffield whittle in his hose   the town is very populous and large and the houses built with stone but look dark and black by the continued smoke of the forges which are always at work and the streets are narrow here were set up the first mills for turning grindstones in england  the church is very large and spacious in the form of a cross and has a fine high spire  sheffield is reputed to excel birmingham in cutlery wares and files and birmingham is allowed to outdo sheffield in locks hinges nails and polished steel  the cutlers here are incorporated by the style of the cutlers of hallamshire and have many privileges they are said to be  00 in number and are called mastercutlers each of whom gives a particular stamp to his wares the corporation choose a master and other officers yearly and it is judged that no less than  0000 are employed in the irontrade in sheffield and the adjacent tract of land called hallamshire  from hence it will be judged that the said parish church the only one in this populous town was not able to contain one half of the people of sheffield which induced one mr robert downs goldsmith of this town to contribute a large sum and to procure other sums by contributions for erecting a chapel of ease and accordingly he got leave anno      from william archbishop of york to proceed in so good a work and built a handsome and stately structure on a piece of ground called shawclose purchased by the said mr downs who also settled to the value of  0 l a year for ever on a preacher to be elected and nominated by him his heirs and assigns  but though the building was thus finished and mr downs had actually nominated to it his nephew joseph downs yet the nomination being contested by the patrons of the vicarage of sheffield and the vicar also it remained unconsecrated till the year      when the parties differing coming to an agreement an act of parliament passed confirming the same and it is now consecrated by the name of the chapel of st paul in the town of sheffield  formerly here was a very fine castle with a noble mansion house the seat of the dukes of norfolk but it is now all demolished and decayed though the manor remains still in the family  in the great church in this town are several very ancient monuments of the family of talbots earls of shrewsbury who once had great possessions in this and the next county  in particular george the first earl of shrewsbury who died      george the second grandson to the first under whose care the queen of scots was here in custody for    years who died    0 and gilbert his son who founded the stately hospital in this town all lie buried here  the gift of this hospital is perpetuated in the following inscription the hospital of the right honorable gilbert earl of shrewsbury erected and settled by the right honorable henry earl of norwich earl marshal of england great grandson of the said earl in pursuance of his last will and testament anno       here is a fine engine for raising water to supply the town here is also a very large and strong bridge over the dun as there is another at rotherham a market town six miles lower of late several acts of parliament have passed to make this river further navigable to different places which will greatly increase the trade of those parts  it is in the park here that the great oaktree grew formerly of which mr evelyn gives a long account in his book of foresttrees and what became of the chesnuttree near aderclift mentioned by camdens continuator the body of which could hardly be fathomed by three men i could hear no account of  the remains of the roman fortification between sheffield and rotherham are still to be seen and probably will continue to the end of time  here is also the famous trench by some called devils bank other danes bank which is said to run five miles in length and in some places is called kemp bank in others temples bank  rotherham is the next market town northeast of sheffield it is noted for its fine stone bridge over the dun which is here increased by the river rother from whence the town no doubt took its name  the church is built in the form of a cathedral and is a fair stone building with a handsome spire steeple  from rotherham we turned northwest to wentworth on purpose to see the old seat of the wentworths who have flourished here ever since the conquest and been possessed of the estate of woodhouse from the time of henry iii among the several noble persons of this family who have resided here was the great thomas wentworth earl of strafford beheaded in the time of king charles i whose body lies buried in this church his honors were extinct in his son but his seat is still in the possession of sir thomas wentworth earl of malton his great grandson who has made such improvements to it that it is inferior to few in great britain it is situated on the side of a hill defended from the north and west but opens to the south and east toward which quarters it commands a very extensive prospect over a rich and beautiful country which belongs to the family  the gardens are large and adorned with obelisks statues etc having a greenhouse and bathingroom on one side there is an uninterrupted view into the park and neighborhood here are two beauties rarely to be met with anywhere else a grove of old firtrees and a mount of above  00 feet high perpendicularly measured the circumference of the parks is about eight miles and is beautified with fish ponds woods of timber of an uncommon size and with plantations innumerable the turf is of a fine verdure and the soil fruitful  the house with the additions lately made and now carrying on will extend  00 yards in front and is built in imitation of wanstead in essex the seat of earl tilney and an improvement has been added to the park and fish ponds one whereof consisting of    acres of ground receives a small brook which being conducted through a winding cut for  00 yards falling down six steps is brought by a canal of  00 yards into the lake and so affords a pretty prospect of water for near a mile together  from hence we went to see stamborough a fine seat now belonging to the earl of strafford the late earl built the house here which has an exceeding noble front and adorned it with large plantations fine waterworks and gardens to which if we add the vistas walks and woods which are large and numerous it may vie with most seats in great britain for elegancy  we afterward steered our course back again to rotherham and leaving that town came to sandbeck a fine seat of the earl of scarborough which considering the beautiful lawn before the house and the extent of the adjoining woods remarkable for the improvements of art as well as for the bigness and flourishing state of the trees may vie with most seats in respect to situation  from hence we pursued a bytrack in order to see a famous yewtree which stands in a field called cuckolds haven and is a very surprising production of nature and which i shall attempt to describe it has a strait smooth stem about  0 feet high from which the branches extend in circles above each other like the divisions of a pineapple and of that shape and of equal exactness the figure of the tree is much more beautiful than could have been made by art of man the branches from top to bottom are so thick that a bird can scarce creep through them in any part and every shoot and fiber put out the same length each year and are of so bright and pleasant a green in all seasons that at some distance the clothing of the tree appears like velvet there is a hedge planted round it for a fence and many people have thought it worth their while to ride  0 miles to view it  upon sight of this curiosity and thousands of other trees of the same species in its neighborhood i could not but lament that avarice should so far prevail especially with gentlemen as to consent to grant what i call a dead warrant for the selling of many noble stately ones in the height of their glory which for some hundred of years had been an ornament to the places where they grew when perhaps one of the largest of them which in a garden or park would be esteemed above any price is sold for no more than  0 or  0 shillings to make naves for wheels  afterward we struck into a byroad which brought us to the ruins of roch or rock abbey hid by a steep woody cliff toward the south and by large rocks every other way except eastward one side of the nef of this building from north to south under the middle tower and some odd pillars and arches are all that is now left great part having been carried away from time to time to repair adjacent churches or build gentlemens seats though now care is taken by the present earl of scarborough to preserve what remains these ruins among which large trees are now grown up and the contiguous borders make a picture inexpressibly charming especially when viewed with the lights and shadows they receive from a western sun and its recluse situation still from every noise except the murmur of a limpid rivulet together with the fragments of sepulchral monuments and the gloomy shades of those venerable greens ivy and yew which creep up and luxuriantly branch out and mix with the beautiful whiteness of the rocks give such a solemnity to this scene as demands a serious reverence from the beholder and inspires a contemplative melancholy oftentimes pleasing as well as proper to indulge  the stone of which this abbey is built was dug out of the famous quarry near adjoining and so well known to masons by the name of roch abbeystone which for whiteness and beauty is not to be equalled  another thing worthy of notice in this neighborhood is the tower and spire of the church laughton which for a delicacy and justness of proportion is not excelled by any other gothi piece of the kind how it happened that so elegant and ornamental a structure superior by far to all others round it was bestowed upon a villagechurch is matter of some wonder  the building stands upon a very high hill which appears at distance like that at harrow in the county of middlesex the height of the steeple to the weathercock is     feet and by its situation the most conspicuous every way of any perhaps in the whole kingdom being seen from many places  0  0 and  0 miles it has a peculiar beauty when viewed in the diagonal line the pinacles at the corners of the tower being joined by arches to the spire as are others above them which break its outlines and give at the same time a beautiful diminution but time will not permit it to stand much longer without considerable repairs  the duke of leeds whose seat at kiveton is at about three miles distance has cut a vista through the woods of his park to take this steeple into his view  about two miles from laughton we saw the said seat of kiveton it is an elegant house and the apartments and offices are disposed with great convenience the situation is in a wholesome air and commands fine prospects here are pleasant gardens and a beautiful park  we omitted visiting many other places in these parts which had time allowed would have answered the trouble of riding uneven roads which are tiresome hereabouts and hastened to reach tickhill which is a small market town and very ancient  here is an old castle which is large but surrounded with a single wall only and an huge mount with a round tower on the top of it it was anciently of such dignity that all the manors round about it belonging to it were styled the honor of tickhill the church in this town is very large and a handsome building  we now returned once more to rotherham and pursued our course higher up on the river dun to coningsborough castle called in british caer conan situate on a rock where matthew of westminster says that aurelius ambrosius a british prince vanquished hengist the saxon general and took him prisoner where in revenge of his barbarous murder of the british nobility in cold blood near stonehenge in wiltshire he cut off his head  before the gate is an agger said to be the buryingplace of hengist it is not only famous for its antiquity but its situation too upon a pleasant ascent having six large market towns   0 villages many large woods of oak some containing  00 acres and others beautifully cut through into walks six iron furnaces many mines of coal and iron quarries of stone for building nine large stone bridges  0 watermills six seats of noblemen  0 of gentlemen    parks and two navigable rivers upon the dun also a little way from coningsborough is a place called templebrough a roman fortification of which the northeast corner is washed away by the river the area is about  00 paces long besides the agger and on the outside of it is a large trench    paces deep on the other side of it is another trench covered with large trees  traveling northeast from hence we came to bantry which stands just at the entrance from nottinghamshire into the west riding a town blessed with two great conveniences which contribute to its support and make it a very wellfrequented place   that it stands upon the great postroad from london to scotland which makes it full of very good inns and houses of entertainment   that the little but pleasant river idle runs by it which contrary to the import of its name is a full and quick though not rapid and unsafe stream with a deep chanel which carries lighters and flatbottomd vessels into the trent that comes within seven miles of it to a place called stockwith from thence to burton and from thence if the weather be fair to hull if not it is sufficient to go to stockwith where vessels of  00 tons burden may come up laden to the town   by this navigation bantry becomes the center of all the exportation of this part of the country especially for heavy goods which are brought down hither from all the adjacent countries such as lead millstones and grindstones from derbyshire wrought iron and edged tools of all sorts from the forges at sheffield and from the adjacent country called hallamshire  from hence to doncaster is a pleasant road that never wants repair which is something extraordinary in any part of this lower side of the country  doncaster so called from the river on which it stands and the castle which is now ruined is a noble large spacious town and exceeding populous governed by a mayor and carrying on a great manufacture principally for stockens gloves and knit waistcoats and as it stands upon the great northern postroad is full of good inns there is a remarkable old column called a cross at the end of the town with a norman inscription upon it  here we saw the first remains of the great roman highway which though we could not perceive before were eminent and remarkable just at the entrance into the town and soon after appeared in many places here are also two strong stone bridges over the dun besides a long causeway beyond them the waters of the river being dangerous to passengers when they swell over its banks as is sometimes the case  this town mr camden says was burnt entirely to the ground anno     and was hardly recovered in his time but it now looks more decayed by time than accident and the houses which seem ready to fall might rise again to more advantage after another conflagration  it has but one church which is large and its tower of admirable work there is a remarkable epitaph on one robert byrk a famous man of doncaster who gave a place called rossington wood to the poor how how who is here i robin of doncastere and margaret my fere that i spent that i had that i gave that i have that i left that i lost a d      quoth robertus byrks who in this world did reign threescore years and seven but lived not ane   here lies also under a plain gravestone in the church the body of one thomas ellis memorable for having been five times mayor of the town for founding an hospital there called st thomass the apostle and endowing it plentifully  we ought not to forget that the celebrated sailor sir martin frobisher was born in this town he was the first englishman who in the reign of q elizabeth discovered the north passage to china and cathai and found some streights which he called after his own name and a foreland after the queens at his first voyage one of the company brought back some black stones out of which the refiners it is said extracted gold which encouraged him to load his ship with them afterward but they were then found to be fit for nothing but to mend the highways he signalized himself against the spanish armada and received his death wound by a shot at breast in britany the surgeon having extracted the bullet left the wadding behind by which means the wound mortified and he died as soon as he had brought back the fleet to plymouth  we set forward directly west and came to barnesley a little market town well built of stone where a manufacture and iron and steel work flourishes it has a smoaky aspect and is called blackbarnesley but whether on that account or from the moors which look all black like bagshot heath i know not  after we had passed these moors we came through a most rich pleasant and populous country to wakefield  wakefield is a large town situate upon the river calder which was made navigable in the year school since which time the town has increased considerably in riches and number of inhabitants there is a handsome stone bridge over the river upon which stands a chapel erected by king edward iv in memory of his father richard duke of york who was slain near this place as i shall mention byandby the chapel is  0 yards long and six broad and though very much defaced by time it appears to have been wrought in a very curious manner a little above the bridge is a wash or dam over which the water rolling forms an admirable cascade of a great length  this town consists of three great streets which meet in a center near the church where there might be formed a very spacious marketplace but by reason of the great number of inhabitants it is so crowded with buildings that there is only a small area round the marketcross which is a very elegant building being an open colonnade of the dorick order supporting a dome to which you ascend by an open circular pair of stairs in the center of the building this brings you to a room which receives light from a turret on the top and may be called the town hall for here they transact all their public business  the church is a very large and lofty gothic building the body of which was repaired in the year      but the spire which is one of the highest in the county remains in the same state it was  in this town was born john green the famous pinder who fought robin hood so manfully  from the bridge you have an agreeable view to the southeast where by the side of the river rises a hill covered with wood at about a mile distance this joins to an open moor or common called heathmoor upon which are several gentlemens seats very pleasantly situated  south between wakefield and a village called sand they showed us a small square piece of ground which was fenced off by itself and on which before the late civil war stood a large stone cross just upon the spot where the duke of york fighting desperately and refusing to yield though surrounded with enemies was killed but though religion has suffered the cross to fall the chapel i mentioned on the bridge at wakefield the other monument of this battle is still preserved by being made use of for civil affairs some say there are more people here than in the city of york and yet it is no corporation town  here is a market every friday for woollen cloths after the manner of that at leeds though not so great yet as all the clothing trade is prodigiously increased and still increasing in this county so this mket flourishes with the rest  i cannot here pass by my former observation that all the great rivers take their beginning in the mountains of blackstone edge and high peak which as i have said part the counties of lancaster and york and that these rivers all take their course due east the dun is the first the next is the calder now becoming a very large river at wakefield and the air is the next which rises at the foot of the mountain penigent on the edge of lancashire of which it is said proverbially pendlehill and penigent are the highest hills between scotland and trent   as the calder runs by halifax huthersfield and through wakefield so the air runs by skipton bradford and through leeds and then both join at castleford bridge near pontefract three miles from bradford and in an united stream form that navigation from this trading part of yorkshire to hull which is of so much advantage to the whole county  i went to see the ancient town of pontefract with the castle where so much blood has been spilt in different ages for here henry the great earl of lancaster who was lord of the castle and whose ancestors had beautified enlarged and fortified it was beheaded by his nephew king edward ii with three or four more of the english barons here richard ii was murdered and if history may be credited in a most cruel manner and here antony earl of rivers and sir richard gray the first uncle and the other brotherinlaw to king edward v were beheaded by king richard iii in the late civil wars a small party of brave fellows took this castle by surprise for the king and desperately defended it to the last extremity but being at length obliged to yield five of them attempted to break through the besiegers camp three of whom perished in the attempt  the town is large and well built but much smaller than it has been the castle lies in its ruins though not demolished it is a corporation by prescription and the mayor and    aldermen are always justices of the peace it is said that anciently none could be arrested at the marketcross called oswalds cross and a free way leading to the cross with about two yards around it was kept unpavd in memory of that privilege but in the year      the old cross was pulled down and a handsome dome supported by a colonnade of dorick pillars the charge whereof was defrayed by a legacy left by one dupere an inhabitant of the town was erected for that purpose  the ruins of the castle show it to have been a noble pile a round tower yet standing is entire in or near which the tradition is king richard ii was slain adjoining to this tower are windingstairs which descend into several vaults and subterraneous passages  the parish church which stands near the castle and was prodigiously large received so much damage in the late civil wars that no more than the shell is now left standing it is a handsome gothic building in the form of a cross with a tower in the middle which is in good proportion and was formerly crowned with a magnificent lantern enriched with carved work but it received such damage from a cannon shot during the siege of the castle that it was soon after blown down and upon the surrender of the castle the parliament did by resolution of the house of the   th of march      grant one thousand pounds to be raised by sale of the materials of the said castle to the town of pontefract toward the repairing of their place of public worship and reedifying an habitation for a minister part of this grant might be applied in erecting a plain octagon building upon the tower which finishes the whole in a manner not disagreeable though far inferior to the former in the north west corner of this tower are two circular flights of stairs winding about the same center with separate entrances below and distinct landings above the inhabitants of the town still continue to bury in this churchyard but divine service is performed in a chapel adjoining to the marketplace which is very spacious  at the bottom of the marketplace stands the town hall  near the road is a noble seat which belonged to the late lord bingley it is a newbuilt beautiful house with curious gardens though not very large  at pontefract the great roman highway which i mentioned at doncaster and is visible from thence hither in several places though not in the open road is plain to be discerned and from castleford bridge which crosses over the united rivers of air and calder it goes on to aberforth and so through tadcaster to york  in some places where this causeway is broken up the courses appear to be of different materials the bottom of clay upon that is chalk then gravel and upon the gravel is stone and then gravel upon that and so other kinds of earth where the first was not to be had  in several places between this bridge and aberforth the causeway being disused for the common road it appears as entire as at its first making though a work undoubtedly of    or   00 years old i take notice of it here because i have not seen any thing like it in any other place of england  castleford is a village that stands near the confluence of the two rivers above and was formerly a place of great consideration insomuch that some authors call it a city there have been dug up here diverse pieces of roman coin  aberforth is a small market town a few miles northeast of pontefract and is noted for pinmaking only  from ferrybridge within a mile of pontefract extends a large stone causeway about a mile in length to a village called brotherton where margaret wife of king edward i was forced to take up as she was hunting and was delivered of a son called from the village thomas of brotherton this son was afterward made earl of norfolk and marshal of england not far from the church is a piece of ground of  0 acres surrounded with a trench and a wall where as tradition informs us stood the house in which the queen was delivered and the tenants are obliged by tenure to keep it surrounded with a wall of stone  brotherton is now noted for burning limestone which is brought from tadcaster in great quantities and carrying and dispersing it into the southern parts which turns to very good account and imploys a great many hands  a little to the south of this village the great road divides in two parts one goes on to the right to york and the other through aberforth and wetherby over brahammoor to scotland  at brahammoor a battle was fought between the royalists and general fairfax where he was worsted and wounded but made so soldierlike a retreat that it gained him as great a reputation as a victory would have done  but we followed neither of these two roads leaving the towns that way for the entertainment of another journey so we passed directly west along the banks of the air to leeds which is a large wealthy and populous town standing on the north side of the river air with large suburbs on the south side and both joined by a stately strong stone bridge so large and so wide that formerly the clothmarket was kept upon it and therefore the refreshment given the clothiers by the innkeepers being a pot of ale a noggin of pottage and a trencher of broiled or roast beef for twopence is called the briggshot to this day  the increase of the manufactures and of the trade soon made the market too great to be confined to the brigg so that it is now kept in the high street beginning from the bridge and running up north almost to the markethouse where the ordinary market for provisions begins which also is the greatest of its kind in all the north of england you may judge of the plenty of it when  00 loads of apples have been numbered by the mayors officers in a day  but the cloth market is chiefly to be admired as a prodigy of its kind and perhaps not to be equalled in the world the market for serges at exeter is indeed a wonderful thing and the money returned very great but it is there but once a week whereas here it is every tuesday and saturday  early in the morning tressels are placed in two rows in the street sometimes two rows on a side cross which boards are laid which make a kind of temporary counter on either side from one end of the street to the other  the clothiers come early in the morning with their cloth and as few bring more than one piece the marketdays being so frequent they goin to the inns and publickhouses with it and there set it down  at about six oclock in the summer and about seven in the winter the clothiers being all come by that time the market bell at the old chapel by the bridge rings upon which it would surprise a stranger to see in how few minutes without hurry noise or the least disorder the whole market is filled and all the boards upon the tressels covered with cloth as close to one another as the pieces can lie longways each proprietor standing behind his own piece who form a mercantile regiment as it were drawn up in a double line in as great order as a military one  as soon as the bell has done ringing the factors and buyers of all sorts enter the market and walk up and down between the rows as their occasions direct some of them have their foreign letters of orders with patterns sealed on them in their hands the colors of which they match by holding them to the cloths they think they agree to when they have pitched upon their cloth they lean over to the clothier and by a whisper in the fewest words imaginable the price is stated one asks the other bids and they agree or disagree in a moment  the reason of this prudent silence is owing to the clothiers standing so near to one another for it is not reasonable that one trader should know anothers traffic  if a merchant has bidden a clothier a price and he will not take it he may go after him to his house and tell him he has considered of it and is willing to let him have it but they are not to make any new agreement for it so as to remove the market from the street to the merchants house  the buyers generally walk up and down twice on each side of the rows and in little more than an hour all the business is done in less than half an hour you will perceive the cloth begin to move off the clothier taking it up upon his shoulder to carry it to the merchants house at about half an hour after eight the market bell rings again upon which the buyers immediately disappear the cloth is all sold or if any remains it is carried back into the inn by nine oclock the boards and tressels are removed and the street left at liberty for the marketpeople of other professions the linendrapers shoemakers hardware men and the like  thus you see  0 or  0000 l worth of cloth and sometimes much more bought and sold in little more than an hour the laws of the market being the most strictly observed that i ever saw in any market in england  if it be asked how all these goods at this place at wakefield and at halifax are vended and disposed of i would observe  first that there is a homeconsumption to supply which several considerable traders in leeds go with droves of packhorses laden with those goods to all the fairs and market towns almost over the whole island not to sell by retail but to the shops by wholesale giving large credit it is ordinary for one of these men to carry a thousand pounds worth of cloth with him at a time and having sold that to send his horses back for as much more and this very often in a summer for they travel chiefly at that season because of the badness of the roads  there are others who have commissions from london to buy or who give commissions to factors and warehousekeepers in london to sell for them who not only supply all the shopkeepers and wholesale men in london but sell also very great quantities to the merchants as well for exportation to the english colonies in america which take off great quantities of the coarse goods especially new england new york virginia etc as also to the russia merchants who send exceeding great quantities to petersburg riga dantzick narva and to sweden and pomerania though of late the manufactures of this kind set up in prussia and other northern parts of germany interfere a little with them  the third sorts are such as receive commissions from abroad to buy cloth for the merchants chiefly in hamburg and in holland etc these are not only many in number but some of them very considerable in their dealings and correspond with the farthest provinces in germany  on account of this trade it was that the rivers air and calder were made navigable under the direction of alderman pickering the celebrated author of the marrow of mathematics and performed at the expense of several private merchants without calling in the assistance of the nobility and gentry by this means a communication was opened from leeds and wakefield to york and hull so that all the woollen manufactures now exported are carried by water to hull and there shipped for holland bremen hamburgh and the baltic and encouraged by the success of this act in the session of parliament anno    0 an act passed for continuing the navigation of the river calder from wakefield to ealand and halifax which will be a farther benefit to the trade of those parts and at the same time several other acts passed for mending of highways around all these parts to halifax ealand doncaster york etc which will no less promote the commerce and trade of this noble county  there is another trade in this part of the country become very considerable since the opening the above navigation which is the carriage of coals down from wakefield and leeds at both which places they have inexhaustible stores these are carried quite down into the ouse and then either go up that river to york or down to the humber where the trent and ouse meet together and which in a few miles falls into the sea in this passage abundance of large towns are supplied with coal with this advantage too that whereas the newcastle coals pay four shillings per chaldron duty to the public these being only riverborne coal are exempted and pay nothing so that the city of york which strenuously opposed the first navigation of these rivers in this particular as well as in many others daily experiences the benefit of it  i need not add that by the same navigation all heavy goods imported to hull are brought up these rivers as well as goods brought from london and other parts of the kingdom such as butter cheese lead iron salt sugars tobacco fruit spice hops oil wine brandy spirits and the like  the antiquity of leeds is very great being mentioned by venerable bede but it was not incorporated till   car i when sir john savile afterward lord savile was made the first honorary alderman in memory of whom the arms of the town are adorned with his supporters and those very suitable being the two athenian birds sacred to that goddess who was deemed the patroness of spinning and weaving as well as arts in general  at the west end of the town formerly stood a castle wherein king richard ii was imprisoned before he was carried to pontefract and on the site thereof now stands the ancient manorhouse with the park etc lately belonging to mr richard syes here are two magnificent halls both built about the year      one for white cloths supported by pillars and arches which form a quadrangle like the royal exchange with a handsome cupola and bell on the top to give notice when the market for these sort of goods begins the other is the guild or moot hall the front of which is built likewise on arches with rustic coins and tabling where in a nich is placed a fine statue of queen anne done by mr carpenter at the expense of alderman milner  here are three churches st peters the parish church is built in the form of a cross with a tower rising from the middle with eight bells in it in the ceiling is the giving of the law finely painted in fresco by parmentier who voluntarily gave this specimen of his art in gratitude for the encouragement he had met with here st johns was built in      at the sole expense of mr harrison who likewise built the almshouses adjoining a free school a marketcross and the street called newstreet the rents of which he appropriated to pious uses  i must not omit the new chapel as it is called erected by the presbyterians in      which is said to have been the first as it certainly is the stateliest they have in the north of england  from leeds we advanced northward and came to harwood a pretty little town on the river wherfe over which is a very costly bridge and there formerly was a strong castle the church here is remarkable for several things particularly for the interrment of sir william gascoigne who had the courage to commit prince henry afterward k henry v to the kings bench for affronting him while he was in the seat of justice letting him know that though the son might bear the image of the kings person the judge bore that of his authority  we passed the wherfe over a fine stone bridge of    arches the river runs in a bed of stone which makes it look as clear as rock water  the plenty of stone in the north is no doubt the reason why there are so many noble bridges in that part of england insomuch that i dont remember to have seen one of timber from the trent to the tweed  we traveled along the wherfe into the dale that takes its name from the river which reaches from york about  0 miles enlivened almost all the way with gentlemens seats at a little distance from each other and left ottley on the south side of the river a small market town no otherwise of note than for its situation which is under a large craggy cliff if yorkshire owed us any pleasure for the fatigues of a former day it was abundantly made up to us here for i cannot but think this one of the most delightful parts of england and i have met with travelers who have compared it to the plain of palermo itself nor ought you to be surprised to hear some parts of the north compared with italy the testimony of bishop tonstal is well known who in his progress to york with king henry viii in the year      declared that the country north of doncaster and south of haslewood was the richest he had found in his travels through europe it would be endless to mention all the seats we passed but the motto at least of mr ibbotsons at denton will naturally engage the speculation of every traveller qvod nec iovis ira nec ignis nec poterit ferrvm  the house it seems belonged once to lord fairfax general of the parliament forces and was about to be demolished by prince rupert but was happily saved by the sight of a picture of one of the generals worthy ancestors it was afterward burnt down by accident and rebuilt by the present possessor and now after the rage of war and devastation of fire in a poetical rant defies them both  knaresborough known among foreigners by the name of the yorkshire spaw stands near ripley a market town upon the river nyd in the town and the lands adjacent are no less than four different mineral waters one of the springs is a petrifying water which in a little cave drops from the roof of the cavity and as they say turns wood into stone  the other two springs are indeed the most valuable rarities of the kind in england  the first is the sweet spaw or a vitriolick water it was discovered by one mr slingsby anno    0 and all physicians acknowledge it to be a very sovereign medicine in several particular distempers see dr leigh s natural history of lancashire  the other is the stinking spaw or according to the learned the sulphur well this water is clear as crystal but so fetid and nauseous to the smell that many are obliged to hold their noses when they drink it yet it is a valuable medicine in scorbutic hypochondriack and especially in hydropick distempers  the people formerly for many years only drank these waters but they now make use of them as a cold bath and in this manner they must necessarily be very good for rheumatick pains paralytick numbnesses and many other distempers  these baths were heretofore well frequented insomuch that i have been told  00 l per annum rent has been given for a cold bath but now scarborough has the vogue  at rippon are two good stone bridges one of which has i think thirteen arches or more over the eure and is a very stately one there is another over the same river at burrowbrigg four miles lower than rippon which has indeed but four or five arches but then these arches are near  0 feet wide and one of the middlemost much more and are high in proportion the ends of the bridge are likewise continued by high causeways built of stone to keep the water in its course which however sometimes overflows them  from these bridges as well as that abovementioned at harwood it may be observed that however low these waters are in the summer they are high and furious enough in the winter and yet the river air though its source is in the same ridge of mountains as the other is gentle and mild in its stream whereas the others are raging and furious the only reasons i can give for it are that this river runs in a thousand windings and turnings more than any other in these parts insomuch that as camden expresses it near its head in craven it seems doubtful whether it should run forward to the sea or return to its spring and from skipton to gargrave it is observed to be passed over eight times within the compass of three miles the next reason is that after it has descended from the mountains it has a deeper chanel  rippon the isurium of the romans is a very neat pleasant well built town and an ancient corporation it has not only an agreeable situation on a rising ground between two rivers but the buildings are good likewise particularly the marketplace which is accounted the finest and most beautiful square of its kind in england  in the middle of it stands a curious obelisk built by mr aislaby whose seat at studley is about a mile distant the town is governed by a mayor and aldermen  here is a large collegiate church and though but a deanery in the diocese of york yet it is a very handsome ancient and venerable pile and shows itself a great way in the country mr camden says rippon owes its greatness to religion and that here was a famous monastery built by wilfrid archbishop of york in the first ages of christianity in this island is certain but this pious gift of the bishop was lost some years after for the danes overrunning yorkshire rifled and burnt it to the ground together with the whole town of rippon it afterward flourished again as a monastery but that with the rest being given up in the reign of king henry viii the church only was preserved  while it was a monastery here was a famous sanctuary a thing much abused in foreign countries this privilege was it seems granted to the church of rippon by king athelstan and whoever broke the rights of sanctuary which he extended a mile around the church were to forfeit life and estate so that in short not the church only but the whole town and a circle of two miles diameter was a refuge for all that fled to it where they lived safe and out of the reach of all law  annexed to this monastery was an hospital the purposes of which are very remarkable and would be worthy imitation in our days of protestant charity the house was called the hospital of st mary magdalene where according to the foundation were to be maintained two chaplains to perform divine service and if any begging clergyman or other needy person should happen to travel or stray out of his way and call at the said hospital he should be relieved there for one night only with food and a bed and so be gone in the morning and every poor person that came craving an alms on st mary magdalenes day yearly should have one loaf value an halfpenny when corn was at the price of five shillings per quarter and one herring  it is also recorded that one branch of this hospital was given to a society of religious sisters to maintain a chaplain to perform divine service and to keep all the lepers born and bred in hipschire but the sisters being in time removed a brotherhood was established in their stead which continued for a while and after that a mastership at length all except the church was demolished together and the house with the monastery suppressed  the church is an ancient gothic building firm strong and plain no imagery or statues to be seen about it there are three towers on which formerly were spires  the whole revenues were seized by king henry viii so that little or nothing remained for an officiating clergyman but king james i having the case represented to him by his queen was pleased to found and endow in this church one dean and seven prebendaries besides petitcanons singingmen and choiristers of his own royal bounty and benevolence under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of york  but i must not leave rippon without mentioning st wilfrids needle a place famous in ancient times being a narrow hole in a close vaulted room under ground in which womens chastity was tried and if chaste they passed through but if otherwise the whim was they could not some saxon coins were found here in the year       in the churchyard of this minster lies a plain monument or gravestone over the remains of a generous soul who gave two thousand pounds to pious uses and yet has no other epitaph than the following hic jacet zacharias jepson cujus aetas fuit    per paucos annos tantum vixit  we spent a considerable part of a day in the celebrated park or rather garden belonging to mr aislabie which is visited by all the curious and admired as a wonder not only with regard to the various beauties which nature has so lavishly bestowed but those of art and cultivation wherewith it is so liberally adorned the latter exhibit a noble specimen of that exquisite fine taste for architecture and gardening in which the present worthy owner is allowed to excel the temples and loggios built in many delightful recesses may vie with the best models of the ancients and the wide extended plantations are judiciously varied as the objects of the landschape become new in one part the hills gradually ascend with tufts of shade interspersed over the verdure in another they precipitately rise with rocks projecting from their rough sides and tall woods covering their brows above these a beautiful gothic but unconsecrated tower lifts up its head and below the skirts of the cliffs are watered by a river which wanders in one place with a silent current and in another falls down in cascades an easy eminence commands a prospect of the town and minster of rippon with a large extent of country beyond and the stately ruins of fountainabbey are seen from another besides gentlemens seats in the center of many views the fine turf of the park is constantly cleared of weeds and equal care is taken to preserve the best trees from decay through the whole scene of variety the improvements are adapted to follow the luxuriant fancy of nature and humor her different propensities you see her decked out and enriched where necessity or propriety bespeak such indulgence but in the simplicity of her own dress where ornament would disfigure her beautiful attire  the house is an old building but a noble plan is laid down for a new one and in a better situation of the park there are stables built which are very grand  the late bishop of namur abbot strickland when he resided in england in the year      took a journey from london to studley with intention to transplant some of the beauties of this place as near as might be in the disposition of his plantations adjoining to a magnificent palace he was then about to build at his episcopal residence  a mile from rippon or less is a stately beautiful seat called newbie built some years since by sir edward blacket the park is extended to the bank of the river eure and is sometimes in part laid under water by the river which coming down from the western mountains through a marly loamy soil fructifies the earth they say as the river nile does the egyptian fields about grand cairo  as sir edward spared no cost in the building and sir christopher wren laid out the design as well as chose the situation i shall only say tbat nothing can be added to the one or the other the building is of brick the avenues to it are very fine and the gardens not only well laid out but well planted and as well kept but for want of fine gravel the walks cannot show themselves as they would do were they in the southern part of england the house has a fine prospect over the country almost to york with the river in view most of the way and it has a very noble appearance to the great north road which lies at burrowbridge within two miles of it  as you begin to come into the north riding for the eure parts the west riding from it you find yourself in a place noted in the north of england for the best and largest oxen and the finest galloping horses bred either for the light saddle for the race or the chase for running or hunting sir edward was a grazier and took such delight in breeding and feeding large black cattle that he had two or three times an ox out of his park led about the country for a sight and showed as far as newcastle and even to scotland for the biggest bullock in england and twas very seldom if ever he was overmatchd  from the town of rippon the north road and the roman way also which comes from castlefordbridge parting at aberforth leads away from the town of bedal in the north riding and in a strait line called leeminglane leaving richmond about two miles on the west goes on to piersbridge on the river tees which are the utmost limits of this vast county of york  but as i proposed at my entering into this west riding to go no further than rippon which stands on the northern boundary of it i must stop here and likewise make it the boundary as well of this journey as of this letter since i find it impracticable to take a survey of this large populous and wealthy division on one journey without wandering to and fro up and down backward and forward on purpose which would be exceedingly fatiguing and uneasy and as i was resolved to make as perfect observations as i possibly could of every thing that i could find remarkable in my way and especially of the manufactures of the country which i account as well worthy a travellers notice as the curiosities and wonders of nature and the most refined operations of the liberal arts and sciences i have therefore concluded upon another journey into these parts and to enter by the way of lancashire and to coast it along the west and northwest sides of the country up to the river tees and the southern side of the bishopric of durham and from thence strike down south into the center of the county and so take a trip east into the heart of the north riding to see the towns that lie that way and then return west into york and passing thence southeast take in such towns as stand on the east side of the west riding till i arrive at the fall of the trent into the humber and crossing that river view the towns in the east riding and lastly follow the seacoast all the way up into durham which will complete my tour through the whole county  i am sir yours etc  letter iii containing a description of part of the west riding of yorkshire and of all the north and eastridings the bishopric of durham and the county of northumberland sir according to what i proposed in my last i am now going to enter the west riding of yorkshire from the east side of lancashire i must premise to you that all this part of the county is so considerable for its trade that the postmaster general has thought fit to establish a crosspost through all the western part of england into it to maintain the correspondence of merchants and men of business of which all this side of the island is full this is a confirmation of what i have so often repeated of the greatness of the trade carried on in this part of the island this crosspost begins at plymouth in the southwest part of england and leaving the great western postroad of excester behind comes away north to taunton bridgwater and bristol from thence goes on through all the great cities and towns up the severn such as gloucester worcester bridgenorth and shrewsbury thence by west chester to liverpool and warrington from whence it turns away east and passes to manchester bury rochdale halifax leeds and york and ends at hull  by this means the merchants at hull have immediate advice of their ships which go out of the chanel and come in by their letters from plymouth as readily as the merchants of london and without the double charge of postage the shopkeepers and manufacturers can correspond with their dealers at manchester liverpool and bristol nay even with ireland directly without the tedious interruption of sending their letters about by london  i followed this postroad from liverpool to bury both manufacturing towns in lancashire and the last very considerable for a sort of coarse goods called halfthicks and kersies the market for them is very great though the town is situated so remote so out of the way and at the very foot of the mountains that it would otherwise be but little frequented  rochdale farther on in our way to blackstone edge is a good market town and is of late very much improved in the woollen manufacture as are also the villages in its neighborhood  here for our great encouragement though it was but about the middle of august and in some places the harvest hardly got in we saw the mountains covered with snow and felt the cold very acute and piercing but we found as in all those northern countries the people had a happy way of mixing the warm and the cold together for the store of good ale which flows plentifully in the most mountainous part of this country seems abundantly to make up for all the inclemencies of the season or difficulties of traveling adding also the plenty of coals for firing of which all those hills are full  we mounted the hills fortified with a little of this precaution early in the morning and though the snow which had fallen in the night lay a little upon the ground yet we thought it was not much and the morning being calm and clear we had no apprehension of an uneasy passage neither did the people at rochdale who kindly directed us the way and even offered to guide us over the first mountains apprehend any difficulty for us so we complimented ourselves out of their assistance which we afterward very much wanted  for though the sun shone when we came out of the town of rochdale yet when we began to mount the hills about a mile from it we found the wind rise and the higher we went the more it increased upon us by which i soon perceived that it had blown before and perhaps all night upon the hills though it was calm below and so we were obliged in a most discouraging manner to travel through trackless drifts of snow and it continuing snowing too in our faces over blackstone edge we knew not whether we were wrong or right till we perceived some landmarks that the honest rochdale men had told us of which gave us great comfort  but after we had passed this dismal edge it was our constant labor as soon as we were at the top of a hill to come down it again on the other side and then another hill arose i do not remember that there was one bottom that had any considerable breadth of plain ground in it but always a brook in the valley running from those gulls and deeps between the hills and it was observable that they always crossed our way in the bottoms from the right hand to the left the reason of which you shall see presently  from blackstone edge to halifax is eight miles and all the way except from sorby to halifax is thus up hill and down so that i suppose we mounted to the clouds and descended to the waterlevel about eight times in that little part of the journey  but now i must observe to you that after we had passed the second hill and come down into the valley again and so still the nearer we came to halifax we found the houses thicker and the villages greater in every bottom and not only so but the sides of the hills which were very steep every way were spread with houses for the land being divided into small enclosures from two acres to six or seven each seldom more every three or four pieces of land had a house belonging to them  in short after we had mounted the third hill we found the country one continued village though every way mountainous hardly a house standing out of a speakingdistance from another and as the day cleared up we could see at every house a tenter and on almost every tenter a piece of cloth kersie or shalloon which are the three articles of this countrys labor  in the course of our road among the houses we found at every one of them a little rill or gutter of running water if the house was above the road it came from it and crossed the way to run to another if the house was below us it crossed  from some other distant house above it and at every considerable house was a manufactory which not being able to be carried on without water these little streams were so parted and guided by gutters or pipes that not one of the houses wanted its necessary appendage of a rivulet  again as the dyinghouses scouringshops and places where they use this water emit it tinged with the drugs of the dyingvat and with the oil the soap the tallow and other ingredients used by the clothiers in dressing and scouring etc the lands through which it passes which otherwise would be exceeding barren are enriched by it to a degree beyond imagination  then as every clothier must necessarily keep one horse at least to fetch home his wool and his provisions from the market to carry his yarn to the spinners his manufacture to the fullingmill and when finished to the market to be sold and the like so every one generally keeps a cow or two for his family by this means the small pieces of enclosed land about each house are occupied and by being thus fed are still farther improved from the dung of the cattle as for corn they scarce sow enough to feed their cocks and hens  such it seems has been the bounty of nature to this country that two things essential to life and more particularly to the business followed here are found in it and in such a situation as is not to be met with in any part of england if in the world beside i mean coals and running water on the tops of the highest hills i doubt not but there are both springs and coals lower in these hills but were they to fetch them thence it is probable the pits would be too full of water it is easy however to fetch them from the upper pits the horses going light up and coming down laden this place then seems to have been designed by providence for the very purposes to which it is now allotted for carrying on a manufacture which can nowhere be so easily supplied with the conveniences necessary for it nor is the industry of the people wanting to second these advantages though we met few people without doors yet within we saw the houses full of lusty fellows some at the dyevat some at the loom others dressing the cloths the women and children carding or spinning all employed from the youngest to the oldest scarce any thing above four years old but its hands were sufficient for its own support not a beggar to be seen not an idle person except here and there in an almshouse built for those that are ancient and past working the people in general live long they enjoy a good air and under such circumstances hard labor is naturally attended with the blessing of health if not riches  from this account you will easily imagine that some of these remote parts of the north are the most populous places of great britain london and its neighborhood excepted  we have all this while been in the parish of halifax and before i come to the town i must add a word or two of the river calder to complete the description of the country i passed through as i said before that all the rills of water which we crossed one at least in every bottom went away to the left or north side of us as we went eastward i am to add that following those little brooks with our eye we could observe that at some distance to the left there appeared a larger valley than the rest into which not only all the brooks which we passed emptied themselves but abundance more from the hollow deep bottoms among the hills on the northside beyond it which emptied this way south as those on our side run that way north and at the next village called sorby or sowerby we passed a considerable river formed from those brooks and the melted snows over a stately stone bridge of several great arches and this was the main river calder which i mentioned at wakefield where it begins to be navigable and which without any spring may be called the head of it  the same observation will hold on most of the great rivers in the north there being hardly any that have their beginning in any public springs or lakes as the rivers in the south of england generally have which is the case particularly of the derwent and the don from the high peak and the hills of the same range more south of the edge of the air the wherfe the swale the eure the nyd the tees and the were all in the same county of york and the tyne the cockett the till and the tweed farther north and even the forth the tay the clyde the nyd in scotland and the mersee the ribble the rock and the lune the west calder the lowther and the eden on the other side of these mountains in lancashire westmorland and cumberland  having thus accounted for them all at once i shall only mention them now as they come in my way for you will observe i crossed one or other of them at every considerable town all the rivers as well in england as in scotland north of this place running from the middle of the country where these mountains rise either east into the german or west into the irish sea none of them run like the severn or the wye or the rivers in south wales or the exe in devon or the avon in wilts or the arun in sussex and others north and south but i return to my journey  having passed the calder at sorby bridge i now came to the town of halifax the most populous parish or vicarage in england for it is but one though    miles in diameter but it has    or    chapels of ease besides about    meeting houses which they call also chapels being conformable in fashion to them having bells and buryingground to most of them not reckoning those of the quakers into the number  in the year      there were but  0 houses in it but in the next century it was much increased for history tells us that queen elizabeth being petitioned by the inhabitants of halifax to grant them some privileges they set forth as an instance of their loyalty that no less than   000 young men went out armed from this one parish and at her majestys call joined her troops to fight the popish army then in rebellion under the earl of westmorland  if they then were so populous what must they be now their trade is so vastly enlarged by the great demand of kerseys for clothing the armies abroad some maintain that it is increased a fourth at least within these  0 years from their having entered upon a manufacture of shalloons which were never made in these parts before at least not in any quantities and it is computed that  00000 pieces are worked up in this parish only and yet they do not make much fewer kerseys than they did before for i was assured that there was one dealer in the vicarage who traded by commission for  0000 l a year in kerseys only to holland and hamburgh and of late years it is still more increased by the people of a neighboring part driving away about  000 irish manufacturers who with about  000 others accompanying them settled there as the vicarage is thus far extended and so populous what must the market be which supplies this vast number of inhabitants and yet these are all brought from other parts of the country for as to corn they sow little and they feed very few oxen or sheep and as they are surrounded with large manufacturing towns on every side all of them employed like themselves in the clothing trade they must necessarily have their provisions from other more distant parts  the consequence then is plain their corn comes up in great quantities out of lincoln and nottinghamshire and the east riding the black cattle from thence and from lancashire sheep and mutton from the adjacent counties every way butter from the east and northridings and cheese out of cheshire and warwickshire  the markets in the months of september and october are prodigiously thronged that being the time when the clothiers buy up as many oxen as will serve their family for the whole year which they used to drive home kill salt and hang up in the smoke to dry this was heretofore their common diet but now they live more upon fresh meats  thus one trading manufacturing part of the country in a barren soil gives and receives support from all the countries round it  there is nothing extraordinary in the town itself but the multitude of people who resort to it on a market day as well to sell their manufactures as to buy provisions is prodigious in this respect no places equal it in all the north part of england except leeds and wakefield  the church is old but stately and venerable and has in it many extraordinary monuments but most of them of great antiquity here is a very good hospital and a workhouse of an ancient establishment and there are several charities of like sort in different parts of the parish  halifax gave birth to john of halifax or de sacro bosco the chief mathematician of his age who was buried at the public expense of the university of paris and to the late archbishop tillotson the model of true rational preaching though a new sect lately sprung up called methodists with great pretenses to meekness and intolerable conceit and vanity at present seek publicly to depreciate the memory and works of that truly great man  the course of justice anciently made use of here to prevent the stealing of cloth is very remarkable modern authors pretend to say it was for all sorts of felons but i am well assured it was first erected purely or at least principally for such thieves as were detected in stealing cloth from the tenters and it seems very reasonable to think it was so because of the conditions of the trial the following is a brief account of it  the woollen manufacture was erected here about the year    0 when king henry vii caused an act to pass prohibiting the exportation of unwrought wool and to encourage foreign manufacturers to settle in england several of whom coming over established different manufactures of cloths in different parts of the kingdom as that of bays at colchester says at sudbury broadcloth in wilts and other counties and the trade of kerseys and narrow cloth at this place and other adjacent towns and as at the time when this trade began nothing was more frequent than for young workmen to leave their cloths out all night upon tenters which gave an opportunity for the idle fellows to steal them a severe law was made against stealing cloth which gave the power of life and death into the hands of the magistrates of halifax but this law was extended to no other crime and the conditions of it as i have said intimate as much for the power was not given to the magistrates to give sentence unless in one of these three plain cases   hand napping that is when the criminal was taken in the very fact   back bearing that is when the cloth was found upon him   tongue confessing which needs no explanation   the fact likewise was to be committed within the liberties or precincts of the forest of hardwick and the value of the goods stolen was to be above thirteen pence halfpeny  when the criminal was taken he was brought before the magistrates of the town and they judged sentenced and executed the offender or cleared him within so many days i think it was three market days if the offense was committed out of the vicarage but within the bounds of the forest then there were frith bourgers also to judge of the fact who were to be summoned out of the forest holders as they are called who were to hold of that frith that is of the forest if they acquitted him of the fact he was immediately discharged if they condemned him nobody could reprieve him but the town the country people were it seems so terrified at the severity of this proceeding that hence came that proverbial litany which was used all over yorkshire from hell hull and halifax good lord deliver us   hull was included in this petition on account of their rigid discipline to beggars for they whipped out the foreign poor and set their own to work  the manner of execution was very remarkable by an ax drawn up by a pulley and fastened with a pin to the side of a wooden engine which when pulled out the axe fell swiftly down and did its office  the engine is now gone but the basis on which it stood still remains being a square foundation of stone to which you go up by steps the engine was removed as we were told in the year    0 during the reign of k james i  in the reign of the same prince the earl of morton regent of scotland passing through halifax and seeing one of these executions caused a model to be taken and carried into his own country where it is made use of at this day but his lordships own head was the first that was cut off with it and it being many years before that happened the engine got the name of the maiden before it was handselled by the execution of the earl and this it retains though it has cut off many a head since  the ways to halifax used to be exceedingly bad and except at the west entrance almost inaccessible but of late years they have been much mended and several acts of parliament have passed very lately which will greatly increase the conveniences of the people thereabouts as well as improve its commerce and communication all around it to lancaster as well as to leeds doncaster and all the great trading towns even to the city of york itself  due east from halifax is kirkley a small village situated on the calder near which is the monument of the famous robin hood and upon the moor his butts two little hills so called about a quarter of a mile asunder i have now traced this hero from the forest of shirwood the scene of his exploits to his grave i before doubted whether there ever was such an one but epitaphs as great liars as they are i suppose are evidence that such a man once existed his is as follows here undernead dislaid stean lais robert earl of huntingtun nea areir ver az hie sa geud an pipl kauld im robin heud lick utlawz hi an is men vil england niver see again   near this place is a little town called burstall where they make broad cloth so called in distinction from kerseys and druggets and the like though the cloths in this country are called narrow when they are spoken of in london and compared with the broad cloths made in wilts gloucester somerset and devonshire  this town is famed for dying and there are made here a sort of cloth in imitation of gloucester whites which though they may not be so fine yet their colors are as good  from hence to leeds and every way round the country appears exceedingly busy and diligent the houses are not scattered and dispersed as in the parish of halifax but crowded up in large villages and thronged with people  a few miles southwest of halifax is huthersfield upon the calder which is the first noted town it comes to this town is one of the five where that vast clothingtrade which i have already mentioned is carried on they have a market here for kerseys every tuesday  while i am speaking of their manufactures i must not forget that very essential one called yorkshire ale which indeed is in its perfection in all this part of the county but i cannot pass over huthersfield without taking notice of its old neighbor almondbury a famous town in the time of the romans and called campodunum but it is now a village only mr camden calls it a royal town and says it had a cathedral church in it dedicated to st alban from whom it was called albanbury whence its present name the ruins of a stone castle and rampire are still to be seen near it  the river calder having been made navigable to wakefield and great benefit arising from it it is now  ann      about to be made further navigable to the towns of ealand and halifax which will be of inexpressible service to those populous and improving places and all the villages and towns adjacent and as there have just passed new acts to mend the road from selby to leeds bradford and halifax and from ealand to leeds which have been torn in pieces by the heavy carriages passing to and fro in the carrying on the vast extended trade of those parts it is hardly to be conceived what benefit will accrue from these public works  the first town we came to from halifax was bradford it has a market but is of no other note than having given birth to dr sharp the good archbishop of york  we soon entered craven which is a very hilly and craggy country as the name signifies for craven comes from the british word craig a rock but however unpleasant  we proceeded farther northwest and arrived at skipton a good well built town encompassed with hills on every side the market is well frequented and supplied here is a large handsome church and a good grammar school to which one mr petyt who had been principal of bernards inn london gave a considerable parcel of books and likewise erected a good library in the church we were agreeably surprised to find so handsome a town and such good accommodations in so mountainous a country  this is a healthy country however and the inhabitants live to a great age a father and son giving evidence at the assizes at york it appeared the first was   0 and the son  00 years old  here the road turns almost due west which brought us to a town called settle a much better town than we expected in such a country it lies on the road to lancaster at the foot of the mountains which part that county from yorkshire upon the river ribble  and a little lower upon the same river upon the borders of lancashire stands gisborne but has nothing remarkable in it  looking forwards to the northwest of us we saw nothing but high mountains which had a terrible aspect and more frightful than any in monmouthshire or derbyshire especially pingent hill which camden derives from the british word pengwin i e whitehead from the snow lying upon it so that having no manner of inclination to encounter them merely for the sake of seeing only a few villages and a parcel of wild people we turned short northeast and came to the great road leading northward to richmond at a village called brumstal noted for the birth of sir william craven an alderman of london who was a great founder and builder of churches bridges causways and other public edifices in this country  having passed through some other inconsiderable villages we entered midlam a little market town on the river your and the north riding of yorkshire together and so leaving masham another inconsiderable market town which lay upon the same river to the southeast of us we passed along to bedal which is likewise of no great note saving that the living is worth  00 l a year and that we met here again the roman causway which leads up through richmond to barnards castle in the bishopric of durham and is called leeminglane for  0 miles together we put ourselves upon this way and were not long before we arrived at richmond  though i met with nothing else within the town of bedal worth observing yet the country round it as indeed the whole county is more or less full of jockies and dealers in horses and the breed in this and the next county is so well known that though the pedigree of them is not preserved for a succession of ages as it is said they do in arabia yet are their stallions denominated by certain names that never fail to advance the price of a horse according to the reputation of the sire he comes of  and indeed let foreigners boast what they will of barbs and turkish horses or of the spanish jennets from cordoua for which  00 l apiece have been given i believe that some of the gallopers of this county and of the bishopric of durham which joins to it will outdo for speed and strength the swiftest horse that was ever bred in turkey or barbary take both advantages together for though the barb may beat yorkshire for a mile course yorkshire shall distance him at the end of the four miles the barb shall carry the day with seven and a half but yorkshire with    and    stone in a word yorkshire shall carry the man and the barb a feather but they are universally allowed to be the best hunting and road horses in the world and are bought up by foreigners on that account  as this part of the country is so much employed in horses the young fellows are bred up in the stable and make excellent grooms  besides their fame for horses they have the reputation also of being good grafiers over this whole country and produce a large noble breed of oxen as may be seen at north allerton fairs where incredible numbers of them are bought eight times every year and brought southward as far as the fens in lincolnshire and the isle of ely where they are fed up to the grossness of fat we see in london markets the market these north country cattle are generally brought to is at st ives a town between huntingdon and cambridge upon the river ouse  richmond is so called from its situation upon a hill or mount fruitful though the country about it is rocky and barren and it gives the name of richmondshire to the district it is in as another east of this is called allertonshire the former is in the diocese of chester and the latter in that of durham  this town in the time of richard ii was annexed to the duchy of lancaster and so still continues earl edwin built a castle here the tower o which is still standing as is also the steeple of the old priory it is a borough governed by a mayor etc and holds pleas in all kinds of action has a good marketplace and three gates which lead to three different suburbs it is well built all of stone and some houses of freestone  we were told that in the year      mr wharton of newcastle agent to his grace the duke of richmond by ordering several places here to be dug very deep discovered the drawbridge and moat belonging to richmond castle which were of very curious workmanship  here thrives a kind of manufactory of knit yarn stockens for servants and ordinary people every family is employed that way both great and small and here you may buy the smallest sized stockens for children for   s   d the dozen pair sometimes less  this trade extends itself also into westmorland or rather from westmorland hither for at kendal kirkbystephen and such other places in this county as border upon yorkshire the chief manufacture of yarn stockens is carried on which is indeed a very considerable one and of late greatly increased  we made some excursions from this town into the country round it and followed the river swal west which runs under the wall of the castle of richmond and by reason of rocks which intercept its passage forms here a natural cataract this river though not extraordinary large is noted for giving name to the lands which it runs through for some length called swale dale and to an ancient family of that name the last of whom was sir solomon swale bart who wrote himself of swale hall in swale dale by the river swale this gentleman became unfortunate and was supplanted by a person not long since dead who was a clerk in the exchequer office and observing this family held their estate of the crown and that they had omitted to renew for many years procured a grant from the crown of this estate for himself a great many lawsuits ensued but to no other effect than to increase the misfortunes of this gentleman who died a prisoner in the fleet but i think not till his adversary had first made away with himself  swale dale is a low pleasant and rich valley abounding with grass but very bare of wood though here is a place just by called swale dale forest it might have been so anciently but there are hardly trees enough in it now to denominate it a forest  not ar from this forest lies wensdale a very rich and fruitful valley well covered with delicate green grass and stocked with vast herds of cattle and in some places produces lead ore the eure runs through the midst of it and rises in the western mountains very near the srce of the swale which as it were leaps into it from a precipice at myton both these rivers are plentifully stocked with fish and eure has crash in it  but let me stop in this ce to take notice of one of the greatest raes that england ever produced i mean henry jenkins whose remarkable great age deserves our particular notice he was born in the year   00 and died in    0 being then     years of age there are no registers of so long a date and therefore his age must be guessed at by other circumstances either from his own account or the probable evidences of others which are these  first being demanded by a gentlewoman who was curious to know as exactly as possible how old he was what kings he remembered he answered after a little pause that he thought himself about     or     years old and that he could remember plowden meaning floddon field fought against the scots in king henry viiis reign she then asked him was the king himself there he replied no he was in france and the earl of surrey was general she asked him then how old he was then he said about    years old that battle was fought september        king henry being then at tournay  secondly there were four or five of the same parish at that time of an  00 years old or very near it who all declared that they never knew him any other than an elderly man and that he told them he was butler to the lord coniers the last of that name died without issue   and   philip and mary i an dom      and he remembered the abbot of fountains before the dissolution in king henry viiis time  thirdly he went often to the assizes on foot and was used as a witness in other courts whose records speak largely of his age in the chancery he was sworn to the remembrance of above   0 years and as much often at york assizes in the kings remembrancers office in the exchequer a record says that henry jenkins labourer aged     years deposed as a witness in      and to confirm his age diverse ancient men who were witnesses swore that he was a very old man when they first knew him  he was for the last century of his life a fisherman and used to wade and swim in the rivers even after he was an hundred years old and lived upon very coarse diet in some of his last years being unable to work at his trade he went a begging to gentlemens houses who used to relieve him cheerfully as a great curiosity and his great age was the more to be credited because he could neither write nor read and so what he reported was from strength of memory two years before his death he was able to bind sheaves after the reapers and had his sight and hearing to the last  the next excursion we made was up to the banks of the tees through gilling eggleston and bows now ordinary towns or rather villages though the first had formerly a great castle which in the conquerors time and long afterward was the seat of the lords of that country whereas richmond which has since rose out of the ruins of gilling was but a fort and in subordination to it  eggleston is famous for marble which they dig out of the rocks there and imploys a great many hands  bows stands upon the military roman way and has been therefore undoubtedly a place of great note  in this part of richmondshire and up northward are no less than three forests viz applegarth forest new forest and lune forest and all these within a tract of ground of no great extent not far off is besides the forest of swale dale beforementioned  the tees is famous for salmon and is a rapid river and sometimes swells up so suddenly that a man in passing the ford in the road to darlington on foot whilst the water was low and hardly up to his knees was overtaken as he was going over by a sudden swell of the stream and carried off and drowned the people this way talk much of an ancient city they had formerly hereabout the antiquaries agree there was one called by the romans cataractonium but differ as to its situation but i think mr salmon has placed it most probably upon the confluences of the tees and greta at a place called merton where indeed the remains of it are very visible and also about gretabridge which is just by it  we crossed the river and entered bernardscastle which lies on the north side of it and consequently within the bishopric of durham it was built by the grandfather of baliol king of scotland and is an ancient well built town but not large here they have an excellent art of dressing their hides into leather out of which they make the best bridles reins and belts as at rippon they were wont to furnish you with the best spurs and stirrups  the manufacture for stockens continues thus far and flourishes here and at marwood and other little villages on the borders of durham but the jockeytrade extends much farther  between this part of the bishopric where this town stands on the east and lancaster on the west a mountainous tract of yorkshire runs like a promontory up northward a great way hill upon upon hill cliffs rocks and terrible precipices most astonishing to behold this rugged part of the country is called stanmore hills which are desolate and solitary excepting one inn for the entertainment of such as may be hardy enough to go among them as for us we did not think it worth our while but here are it seems abundance of the frolicks of nature in stone which exactly resemble serpents and other various forms  the west side of the bishopric being very mountainous too and corresponding with that of stanmore we turned northeast to visit a little market town but a little way off called stainthorp but being of no other note than having a stately tomb in the church to the memory of one of the nevils and his two wives we passed on to raby castle which stands just by it the ancient seat of that family but now of the lord vane but it has nothing remarkable in it  we came next to piersbridge to which the roman causway leads or as they call it leeminglane here have been many remarkable remains of antiquity dug up and particularly an old altarpiece we thought to have returned by this bridge into yorkshire but were desirous to take in darlington first and pass over the tees there  darlington is remarkable for its dirty situation for a beautiful church with a high spire rising up from the midst of it and for a good long stone bridge over very little or no water it is a large considerable market town of great resort and well supplied the marketplace is large and convenient it is noted for the linen manufacture as the water of the skern on which it is situated is exceeding good for bleeching insomuch that linen has been sent hither from scotland to bleech but it particularly excels in huggabags of ten quarters wide which are made nowhere else in england and of which as well as other linencloth it sends up large quantities to london  a greater rarity i may mention in this town was our landlord at the fleece inn by name henry lovell who died in may      in the   d year of his age and had kept this inn ever since      he was never known to have one hours sickness nor even the headache though a free toper of ale sometimes for days and nights successively but had an aversion to drams of all kinds retained his hearing sight and memory to his last moments he never made use of spectacles nor ever lost a tooth he was esteemed in his life and lamented at his death being of a humane temper and had the deportment of a gentleman  at oxehall near this town we saw the famous hell kettles which are three deep pits full of water which have occasioned many fabulous stories among the country people and diverse conjectures among the learned but they seem to be nothing else but old coal pits and yet there is no coal near them now filled by the water of the tees through some subterraneous passage as it is said bishop tunstal experienced by marking a goose and putting her into one of the pits which he found next day in the tees others say they were occasioned by an earthquake which is recorded in the chronicle of tinmouth for the year      when the earthquake happened  we passed on east and came to yarum bridge where we recrossed the tees it is a very good and well built bridge the town is incorporated and but small lying near the influx of the little river levan into the tees it has seen much better days but however of late years it is a little recovered and carries a pretty trade by water for lead corn and butter with london  stokesby is also but a small market town and stands near the source of the same river a few miles east of yarum inland which lies in a little tract of rich and fruitful ground called allertonshire and watered by the river wysk it is a corporate town consisting of one street about half a mile long well built with a very good market and is noted for having the greatest beastfair in england  here was a bloody battle fought in king stephens time between david king of scotland and archbishop tunstall who was lieutenant in these parts for king stephen which was called the battle of the standard which it seems never used to be erected but when the kingdom was in imminent danger the bishop prevailed and routed the scots though henry king davids son kept the field of battle with a band of hardy soldiers after the bulk of the army was fled with their king after them and fought valiantly till he was overpowered and obliged to follow his father  from hence we advanced still south and passed through thirsk a corporate town which has but an ordinary market to aldborough and boroughbrigg which lie within three miles of rippon upon the river eure  these are two borough towns each sending two members to parliament which is a circumstance peculiar to this place and to weymouth and melcomb in dorsetshire  boroughbrigg or bridge seems to be the modern town risen up out of aldborough the very names importing as much the one being borough at the bridge and the other old borough that was before it all the antiquaries are agreed in this who place on the side of aldborough or old borough an ancient city and roman colony called isurium brigantium at present there are not so much as the ruins of a city to be seen above ground but the coins urns vaults pavements and the like frequently dug up there give evidence to the thing and some of them are so very remarkable that i cannot choose to refer you to mr camden and his continuator for farther satisfaction only adding to what they have observed that a curious piece of antiquity was discovered a few years ago which is a mosaic pavement of singular form and beauty brought to light on digging the foundation of a house and which is now about two feet from the level of the street  at the door of the college is another tesselated pavement of a different form from the other and though not above three yards from it it is a foot nearer the surface of the street the former is composed of white and black squares with a border of red but the stones of this are lesser squares and are white yellow red and blue  not long since more pavements of this kind were discovered on an eminence called boroughhill as also the foundations of a considerable building two bases of pillars of some regular order large stones of the grit kind with joints for cramping sacrificing vessels flews for conveyance of smoke or warm air bones and horns of beasts mostly stags an ivory needle and a copper roman stylus from all which it may reasonably be supposed that a temple formerly stood in this place i had not so much curiosity as to go to see the three great pyramidal stones in the fields on the left hand as you go through boroughbridge which the country people being unable to comprehend how they came there will have to be brought by the devil and so call them the devils arrows mr camden describes them as also does mr drake in his history of the antiquities of york to whom therefore i refer  boroughbridge the latest built of the two towns i have mentioned is undoubtedly very old for here in the barons wars was a battle and on this bridge the great humphrey de bohun earl of hereford was killed by a soldier who lay concealed under the bridge and wounded him by thrusting a spear or pike through a chink into his body as he was passing over it from whence we may conclude with mr camden that it was a timber bridge then and not built of stone as it is now  at boroughbrigg the battle was fought between king edward ii and his barons who were defeated and after ensued the bloody execution at pontefract of the earl of lancaster and others of the barons as i mentioned when i spoke of pontefract  these two borough towns lying near the center of this vast county and on the skirts of the north and west ridings and there being a great many towns about the middle of the first that we could not more conveniently visit than from hence we therefore struck away east and northeast through the towns of hovingham rydell hemesley and kirkby moore side which is so called because it lies on the side of blackamoore but they were far from answering our trouble of going so far out of the way excepting that hemesley seemed to be tolerably well built with stone and the houses covered with slate the two first having hardly a market but the situation of rydell is pleasant being in a fine fruitful vale wherein are    parishchurches  we then turned southeast and came to pickering a pretty large well built town which has a wellfurnished market and belongs to the duchy of lancaster having jurisdiction over several neighboring villages and is called the honor of pickering it has formerly been a fortified place as appears by the ruins of a castle which lie upon a hill  it is situate on the west side of a wild hilly country and a forest which is within the liberty of the town and called pickering forest which we did not care to traverse over and so passed southwest down to malton on the derwent  this town is divided into two parts by the river which are called old and new malton the old is the camalodunum of the romans and was burnt by thurstan archbishop of york in king stephens cause against eustace the lord of it who had betrayed part of this country into the hands of the scots but eustace being afterward received into favor rebuilt it and it has been ever since called new malton here has been a famous abbey and the church of it is still standing but very ruinous though the castle is quite demolished  this town is well built and inhabited and has two wellsupplied weekly markets which are held by prescription for it is not incorporated it is the best market in the county for horses cattle and provisions and is noted for utensils in husbandry it has likewise three handsome parish churches and a good stone bridge over the derwent near this town is a well whose water is said to have the same virtue as that of scarborough  we set out from hence and for some miles coasted along the banks of derwent toward york taking hinderskell in our way where the late earl of carlisle built the magnificent seat of castle howard upon the spot of ground where the old castle stood in the middle of a wood but his lordship died before it was finished i shall mention this again byandby  but i must not omit that on the south side of the derwent we saw auldby a little village where it is said stood in the roman times a city called derventis where a company named derventienses was stationd  the derwent is a river very full of water and overflows its banks and all the neighboring meadows always after rain it is likewise wellstockd with fish and runs between the east and north ridings  we are now entering the great city of york the eboracum of the romans and of such account in their time that no less than three military ways passed through it and it was not only a roman colony but the seat of some of the emperors and principal generals particularly of severus and constantius chlorus the father of constantine the great  in our approach to it we discovered many visible marks of antiquity not reducible to description and though time and misfortunes have so deeply effaced all traces of its once glorious splendour yet some noble remains of majesty are still to be seen there especially as we viewed it from a rising hill at some small distance on the london road nay after we were within the walls and had leisure to look about we found ourselves not disappointed in the idea we had before conceived of it and every traveller who is inquisitive in the search of antiquities or curiosities will be tempted to make some stay at york there being a very great variety of each to detain and amuse him  among the former i shall only mention the arch at micklegatebar and the multangular tower and wall near a place called the mintyard both built in the time of the romans but whether the two statues now prostrate on the wall of st laurence churchyard be roman or saxon is hard to determine certain it is that the sepulchral monument of the standard bearer to the ninth legion of the roman army was dug up near micklegate and in other parts of the city have been found many roman altars inscriptions urns coins and the like now in the possession of the curious  i do not include the ruins of abbeys churches and castles now to be seen in this place among the antiquities of it because they are but of a late date compared with the ancient remains of the roman skill and grandeur and because they would take up more time and room than the nature of my work will allow  the city of york is surrounded by a strong wall kept in good repair in which are four gates and five posterns it is a county of itself extending ever all the wapontake called ainsty and is governed by a mayor who is styled lord as at london a recorder    aldermen in commission of the peace two sheriffs    prime common council men eight chamberlains    common council men a town clerk sword bearer and common sergeant and the mayor and aldermen have conservation of the rivers ouze humber wherse derwent air and dun within certain limits of each  this city always gives title to the second prince of the blood royal and the two citizens they return to parliament have a privilege of taking their places in the house of commons next the citizens of london upon what is called the privy counsellors bench a privilege which if neglected to be claimed ought to be made known as it appertains to the citizens of london and york only and is by those of london exercised the first day of the meeting of every new parliament  the situation of york is in a plain on both sides the river ouse it was formerly very populous and had a great trade but has declined since the reformation and the difuse of the court of president of the north in henry the vths time there were    parishes    chapels    hospitals and nine abbeys besides the cathedral and now there are only    churches in use  the present support of the city is chiefly owing to the gentry who make it their winter residence as there is great plenty of provisions of all kinds to furnish an elegant table at a moderate expense so that the altar which was found there with a roman inscription is applicable to the present circumstances of the place dis deabusque hospitalibus and as the inhabitants abound with the conveniences of life they likewise partake of its diversions there being plays assemblies musickmeetings or some entertainments every night in the week  the public edifices which most deserve mention i shall now take notice of and first of the bridge over the ouse it consists of five arches the diameter of the middle arch which was the largest in the kingdom before that at blenheim house was built is    feet and its height    feet the reason it was built so wide was on occasion of an accident which once happened to it when upon a sudden thaw which occasioned a great flood a prodigious weight of ice drove down two arches of the old bridge by which    houses were demolished and several persons drowned  the great council chamger for this city near which the records are kept as also the exchequer and courts of the sheriffs and beneath them the two city prisons for debtors and felons are all upon this bridge  the castle which stands at the confluence of the ouse and the fosse was built by william the conqueror anno  0   and though the face it now wears and the use made of it are so different from that which was the primitive state of this fortress yet in its present disguise it brought to my memory that tragical scene of bloodshed perpetrated within its walls upon the   th of march      which being to be met with in very few historians i shall give a brief account of it  the jews from their first introduction into england growing immensly rich by traffic never failed to become the objects of envy and hatred both to prince and people and the slightest pretenses were always eagerly laid hold of to plunder them so that on every new accession or turn of affairs they were forced to compound for their safety by large presents to the prince  at the accession of richard i though that prince gave them no disturbance yet he issued out an order that no jew should be present at the ceremony of his coronation either at church or at dinner  however the chief of the jews from all parts being summoned to london by their brethren there in order to agree upon a rich gift to the new king to obtain his favor and protection many of them notwithstanding the injunction had the curiosity to see the ceremony and being discovered among the crowd by the guards they were beat abused and some of them killed  the people hereupon being possessed with a notion that the king had given orders that the jews  be destroyed began a massacre of them in  and plundered and burnt their houses and  them many of their wives and children  and though the king immediately ordered a proclamation to stop these proceedings yet the example at london was followed at norwich lynn and stamford and with still greater fury at york notwithstanding the king at his departure to the holy land left orders for the protection of the jews and the punishment of such as should molest them for being inflamed by a wicked priest certain bloody wretches who had resolved upon the destruction of the jews and to enrich themselves with their pillage set fire to a part of the city of york and while the citizens were busy in extinguishing the flames broke into the house of a principal jew who had been murdered at london and whose wife had strengthened it for her defense and murdering the whole family and all who had taken refuge there burnt the house to the ground  the jews hereupon in the utmost terror got leave to convey all their wealth into the castle and obtained shelter there for their own persons and for their wives and children except some few who were sacrificed to the rage of the populace who burnt all the houses of the jews throughout the city  it unluckily happened that the governor of the castle having business in the town the poor jews being afraid he went out to agree upon delivering them up to their enemies refused him admittance into it which incensing him he applied to the high sheriff who raising the posse comitatus besieged the castle and reduced the jews to so great extremity that being refused mercy though they offered to buy it at the expense of immense sums they took the dreadful advice of one of their rabbis come lately among them from abroad and first having burnt all their rich goods and so damnifyd even their plate that their barbarous enemies could not be much the better for their spoils they set fire to all the towers of the castle and fell each man to cutting of the throats of his own family till they had destroyed all who came into this dreadful scheme of their rabbis who in the last place followed the advice he had given  in the mean time the fire of the castle increasing a number of unhappy jews who would not come into this bloody action in vain endeavoring to extinguish it from the walls besought the mercy of the besiegers acquainting them with what had happened and threw over the dead bodies of their brethren in confirmation of the truth of what they said and offering to become christians had hopes given them of their lives but no sooner did their merciless enemies gain admittance than they butchered every one of the jews calling aloud for baptism in hopes of escaping their worse than paganish cruelty  not satisfied with this the barbarous robbers as well as murderers ran next to the cathedral where were deposited the bonds and other securities of the money owing to the jews by the christians broke open the chests and destroyed them all  there were  00 men who took shelter in the castle besides women and children so that the whole number of the jews thus miserably slaughtered must be between  000 and   00 besides those who were massacred in the city  we must do this justice to the king who was then in the holy land that as soon as he heard of this unparalleled proceeding he was highly incensed and sent orders to the bishop of ely his chancellor and regent to go down in person to york and execute strict justice without favor or affection on all offenders the bishop came to the city but the chief authors of the riot had fled to scotland however the citizens were laid under a large fine and the sheriff and governor of the castle were removed from their places and committed to prison and the soldiers concerned in the fray were punished and turned out of service but not one man either then or afterward was executed for the unheard of villainy  the strength of this castle has been often experienced in times of war and become famous in history upon account of several memorable events we hope for the future there will never be occasion to make any other use of it than to the same necessary purpose to which it is now converted namely a prison but a prison the most stately and complete of any in the whole kingdom if not in europe the present edifice was erected in the year   0  in the left wing of the building is a handsome chapel neatly adorned with suitable furniture and an allowance of  0 l a year is settled upon a minister for performing divine service and preaching to the prisoners weekly and such of the debtors as attend at sermons are allowed each a large loaf of fine bread the justices of the peace take great care that the gaol shall be kept as neat withinside as it is noble without the felons are allowed straw and their beds are now raised from the ground and there is an infirmary apart from the common prison to which the sick are conveyed and a surgeon has an appointed salary to attend them  the castleyard is larger than the areas of the fleet or kings bench in london and the situation is so high pleasant and airy that it is surprising any prisoners should remove themselves by habeas corpus to either of those prisons unless it be with a view of purchasing the liberty of the rules because here they are never permitted to go without the walls strangers who visit the inside of it seldom depart without making a trifling purchase of some of the small manufactures the prisoners work up for subsistence  the next building we come to is the assemblyroom for the entertainment of the nobility and gentry who reside at york during the races it was designed by the earl of burlington that part which is the egyptian hall taken from a draught of palladio is in length     feet  0 broad and rather more in height this hall communicates with the common ballroom in length    feet in height and breadth    feet besides other rooms for cards and tea all richly decorated and illuminated with magnificent lustres the front to the street is an exceeding fine piece of architecture but the egyptian hall if you except the banqueting house at whitehall may undoubtedly claim the preference of any other room in the kingdom if not in europe the expense of this edifice amounting to several thousand pounds was defrayed by subscriptions chiefly among the nobility and gentry of the county who contributed some  0 l and none less than    l  in the year      a very handsome mansion house was erected for the lord mayor the basement is a rustic arcade which supports an ionick order with a pediment in it there is a large room the length of the front    feet by    so that this city has had the honor to begin a precedent for the city of london to copy after  the guild hall is a building very well deserving notice as likewise are several other public edifices which are equally useful and ornamental to this ancient city  but what exceeds all others in it is the cathedral church which for magnificence of structure challenges the preeminence of all other gothic churches not only in this kingdom but throughout europe if i may rely upon the opinion of a gentleman with whom i viewed it and who had seen the churches at strasburgh milan and notre dame in paris  the city of lincoln indeed contends with this of york for a preference to its cathedral and as this is a point in which both cities are very tenacious i will distinguish the particulars wherein each of them have the advantage over the other as i have promised in page    in the first place then lincoln cathedral has greatly the advantage of york in the height of its situation and by different accounts given by several authors of the dimensions of both churches it appears lincoln exceeds york in length from east to west either    or    or three feet and a half in the middle cross or transept from north to south five feet in the outward breadth of the west end by the addition of two chapels as at st pauls london    feet in the height of the west towers and spires    feet and of the middle tower including the pinacles    feet  york exceeds lincoln in the breadth of its middle nef and side ails withinside    feet in the height of the middle nef to its canopy    feet and in the inside height of the middle lantern    feet and a half  the breadth of the west end of lincoln will not the least avail in this dispute as it has so many egregious defects not to say absurdities the two steeples are crowded together instead of being placed at the extremities of the front which by that means would have had an appearance much more grand they rise up above the body of the church as if behind a screen without the least affinity to any part of the building below their ornaments are but mean and the leaden spires upon them still meaner the whole front extending in a strait line wants boldness when viewed at some distance and there is such an expansion of solid wall without windows or any sort of aperture as gives a heaviness throughout the cloistred work or niches for images which is the chief ornamental part of gothic structures is disposed with a shameful disregard to every thing like design in one place crowded with needless profusion in another wanted to fill up where now there is nothing but a naked and dead space and in the ornaments the fancy is so irregularly varied that all kind of connection and harmony is destroyed so that the building to appearance has the same effect as if it were pieces of different structures patched up together  the plan of the church is very irregular the middle transept from north to south having no ails on the west side to answer those on the east the upper transept or double cross can never be considered as a beautiful addition especially since this and the eastern parts beyond are surrounded with chapels and vestries erected without uniformity and the windows of the church are meanly small crowded and out of proportion  it is to be observed there is a great resemblance between the groundplat of lincoln and that of canterbury and the one was certainly built after the model of the other  the only defect objected to york is that the middle tower or lantern wants height and that the cross or transept from north to south is built in a different style and manner from the rest of the cathedral both these must be admitted to be faults but by the way the middle lantern is as lofty as the celebrated towers of canterbury and gloucester exclusive of their pinacles though not sufficiently high in proportion to its breadth being  0 feet square or to the height of the church they have a tradition in this city that a wooden spire was once intended to have been raised upon this tower which in that case would have exceeded the height of salisbury steeple as the present battlements are higher by six feet and of a larger square than the present tower at salisbury  i am not sorry this project failed because it is obvious all wooden spires have a most wretched aspect  the only amendment that can be made would be to pull down the bellturret at one corner and to raise the battlements about  0 feet piercing them through with proper ornaments and carry four pinacles above them about  0 feet more  however this building has two remarkable beauties not to be found in any other gothic edifice which are that the height and breadth of the nef and side ails of the church and of all the arches and windows come very near if not agree with the dimensions laid down by the established rules of roman architecture that the span of the roof from east to west rises very near equal to the modern proportion the excessive height of the roofs being the chief blemishes in most cathedrals as may be seen at lincoln salisbury westminster and particularly winchester  the plan of the whole church is uniform as well as the superstructure especially from east to west the windows are of a size and distance proper to the magnitude of the structure and are admirable for their workmanship neither is it crowded and encumbered on the outside by its butresses but every part is enriched with ornaments which receive an additional beauty from the color of the stone as it retains almost its original whiteness  thus far what i have said of this building in general was necessary in comparing it with lincoln i will now take some notice of its several parts distinctly both withinside and without beginning first at the outside  the west end which is     feet in breadth shows a grandeur inexpressible this front contains two uniform towers diminished by several contractions all cloistred for imagery and enriched with other ornaments in the south tower hangs a deep peal of    bells the tenor weighing    hundred weight  between these towers over the principal entrance into the church is a large window whose tracery in masons work is of a figure so beautiful that it cannot be equalled anywhere the several windows in the towers are large and their tracery and ornaments well fansied  the south entrance is ascended by several courses of steps and tradition assures us there was once as great an ascent to the west door here a remarkable spiral turret is erected on the middle of the pediment and called the fiddlers turret from an image of a fiddler on the top over the door is a dial both horary and solar on each side of which two images strike the quarters on two bells  in viewing the building from this part eastward we easily discerned it to be much newer than that westward though conformable to it  the east front is exceeding noble and has the finest window in the world  the north side is the same as the south only a wall is built to prevent nightwalkers and other disorderly persons from nesting and intriguing in the obscure corners of the buttresses  the lantern steeple of which i have spoken already is ornamented in a fine taste wanting nothing but a better finishing at the top it has eight windows two on each side to give light within these windows from top to bottom are    feet high  we now entered the inside at the west door opening into the middle nef of the church under the largest gothic arch in europe which binds and supports the two towers the nef is the most spacious of any in europe except st peters at rome it exceeds the dimensions of the nef of st pauls cathedral four feet six inches in width and    feet in height and that of westminster abbey    feet six inches in breadth but its height is two feet less this is an instance of what i took notice of before with regard to the justness of the proportion of york cathedral and at the same time shows the extravagance of that of westminster abbey in this particular the canopy at top is enriched with curious knots of carving  from thence we proceeded under the middle lantern to a stone screen that parts the choir from the body of the church adorned with curious workmanship among which are placed the statues of the british kings from the conquest to henry vi  over the entrance into the choir stands the organ having a double front it had before been removed from thence by king charles i to one side opposite to the bishops throne the reason his majesty gave for doing it was that it spoiled the prospect of the fine east windows from the body of the church  the choir is adorned with ancient woodwork carved and set up with clusters of knotted pinacles of different heights the ascent from the body of the church through the choir to the altar is by a gradation of    steps the altar has lately received a considerable improvement as to its situation and the whole church in its beauty by taking away a large wooden screen which almost obstructed the view of the east window by this means it was carried one arch farther back to a stone screen of excellent gothic architecture which now not only shows a beauty in itself before hid but opens a view to one of the noblest lights in the world both for masonry and glazing which is the aforementioned east window  this window is  0 feet nine inches broad and    feet high the upper part is a piece of fine tracery but in my opinion not so beautiful as that at the west end below the tracery are     partitions wherein are represented in fine painted glass most of the history of the bible this window was glazed in   0  by one john thornton glazier of coventry who received for his own work   s a week and contracted to finish the whole in three years  in a circular window at the south end of the church is another fine piece of masonry in the form of a wheel called the marygold window from its painted glass which resembles the color of that flower the north end has five noble lights each constitute one large window and reach almost from top to bottom there is a tradition that five maiden sisters were at the expense of these lights the painting of the glass represents a kind of embroidery or mosaic needle work which might perhaps give occasion to the story  i ought not to omit mentioning that all the windows of the church except one or two are adorned with painted glass representing the sacred history and the portraitures of eminent persons this painting was preserved at the time of the civil wars by the lord fairfax general of the parliaments army who at the request of the gentry and citizens of york placed a guard of soldiers about the church for that purpose  the body of the church has been lately new paved the plan of which was drawn by that ingenious architect mr kent under the direction of the earl of burlington the figure is mosaic and properly adapted to a gothic building  the monuments in this church are numerous many of them very ancient and several very magnificent but to enumerate them distinctly would take up more room than i can spare  after taking this view of the cathedral we were conducted into the chapter house a building which for a gothic piece disdains to allow an equal in the universe and well deserves the encomium bestowed upon it as is said by a great traveller in an old monkish verse inscribed on the wall in golden letters as follows ut rosa phlos phlorum sic est domus ista domorum   it is an octagon of    feet diameter the height to the middle knot of the roof is    feet ten inches unsupported by any pillars and entirely dependent upon one pin geometrically placed in the center the whole roof has been richly painted and the knots of carved work gilt but is now defaced and sullied by time over the roof is a spire of timberwork covered with lead admired as a masterly piece of work in the carpenters art the eight squares of the octagon have each a window beautifully adorned and imbellished with painted glass  the next place we saw was the vestryroom its dimensions    feet by    wherein are kept several antiquities particularly the famous horn so called made of an elephants tooth which is indeed the greatest piece of antiquity the church can exhibit and to which they ought to pay a high veneration on account of the benefit they reap from the act that it witnessed to the account camden gives of it is that ulphus the son of toraldus who governed in the west parts of deira by reason of a difference likely to happen betwixt his eldest son and his youngest about his lordship when he was dead presently took this course without delay he went to york and taking the horn wherein he was wont to drink with him he filled it with wine and kneeling before the altar bestowed upon god and the blessed st peter all his lands  the lands are still called de terra ulphi the horn was imagined to have been quite lost but thomas lord fairfax was the occasion of its being preserved where it had lain or where he got it is uncertain but stripped of its golden ornaments it was restored by his successor the chapter thought fit to decorate it anew and bestowed the following inscription to the memory of the restorer upon it cornu hoc ulphus in occidentali part  i will now conclude my account of this noble pile of building with the character given of it as mr camden informs us by aeneas sylvius afterward pope pius ii it is says he famous for its magnificence and workmanship all the world over but especially for a fine lightsome chapel with shining walls and small thin wasted pillars quite round  the south side of the church is enriched by a library to which archbishop matthewss widow was a great benefactress a bishop was her father and an archbishop her fatherinlaw she had four bishops for her brethren and an archbishop for her second husband  the bishop had a palace in the minsteryard where great hospitality was wont to be kept but it has been long since leased out and to show the wondrous change of times one end of it is now converted into a dancingschool and the other into a playhouse  in the archbishops register and prerogative office is a noble repository of ancient ecclesiastic records bearing date    years earlier than any at lambeth or canterbury  the church of all saints in the pavement is a beautiful old church with a gothic steeple of exquisite workmanship upon the tower is a fine lantern with pinacles of a considerable height not much unlike that of boston in lincolnshire  st margarets church has one of the most extraordinary porches i ever saw it is a most sumptuous and elaborate piece of gothic architecture with our savior on the cross on the top of it but what seems still more surprising is that they say it did not originally belong to the church but was brought hither from the dissolved hospital of st nicolas  st marys in castlegate is admired for a pyramidical steeple as christs church is for a very fine modern one  in the month of august      a subscription was set on foot for an infirmary in this city like those begun at london winchester etc which we have mentioned and this excellent charity has found much encouragement and support here  a manufacture of cotton is lately established in this city and is arrived at a very great perfection and i could not but be greatly pleased when i was there last to see a very handsome procession made on this occasion viz on may day    0 at which time mr clough the master of the manufactory together with the several artificers concerned therein marched through the city in the following manner preceded by the city music viz there were three stages borne each by six porters on the first stage were the teazer carder rover spinner and reeler of the cottonwool on the second the bleecher and winder of the linenyarn on the third the quillwinder and weaver each person exercising their several branches from the picking of the wool to the finishing the cloth the men women and children employed in the manufactory closed the procession all of them clothed with cottons or striped and figured fustians of their own making provided for them by the generous contributions of the citizens  this manufactory being so well fixed and established in so short a time is principally owing to the great encouragement given by the city who are determined to spare no pains or expenses to support it the bells in the cathedral and in all the parish churches rung the whole time of the procession  the city of york stands upon more ground perhaps than any in england except london and norwich but then the buildings are not so close as at bristol or durham nor is it so populous as either bristol or norwich but as york is full of gentry and persons of distinction so they have houses proportioned to their quality which makes the city lie so far extended on both sides of the river  while we were here we took one days time to see the fatal field called marston moor where prince rupert a third time by his excess of valor and defect of conduct lost the royal army and had a victory wrung out of his hands after he had all the advantage he could desire  i made another excursion to the duke of leedss house at kiveton then to the earl of carlisles called castle howard and the earl of burlingtons at lanesborough in the east riding  carlislehouse or castle howard is in the middle of a wood which is as great a wonder in its kind as mr aislabies park the house is of a vast extent and though it makes a fine appearance at a distance yet will it not bear a critical examination of the architecture when viewed near there goes a story that the architect was so sensible of his errors in one of the fronts that he would fain have persuaded the late earl of carlisle to pull it down again the whole is not yet finished  the earl of burlingtons in an oldbuilt house most advantageously situated on a rising ground with a noble prospect as well toward the humber as toward the woulds  i passed likewise through the forest of galtres a little north of the city it is in some places very thick of trees and in others very moorish and boggy it formerly extended to the very gates of the city but now it is much lessened and several considerable villages are built in it  having mentioned so many forests you will undoubtedly conclude there is no want of firing in this county it is very true for here is not only wood enough but coal too which is a very great comfort to the poor against the inclemency of this cold northern climate which indeed has very great need of firing  at hambletondown are the races where the kings plate of an hundred guineas is run for once a year by fiveyearolds a gift nowhere better bestowed than on that county which is so famous for breeding of horses for the rest of the kingdom  from york we entered again into the west riding and traveling due west we came to wetherby upon the river air which we omitted to take in our course as we passed by this river in our former journey being then more out of our way than here it is a good trading town but has nothing remarkable in it  some miles farther to the south stands tadcaster upon the south side of the river wherfe where the road from chester and that from cambridge to york meet and is consequently well provided for the reception of travelers it is principally noted for limestones and a fine stone bridge over the river but it has nothing that we could see to testify the antiquity it boasts of but some old roman coins which our landlord the postmaster showed us among which was one of domitian of the same kind i believe as that which mr camden gives an account of but so very much defaced with age that we could read but do and av at a distance here is the hospital and school still remaining founded by dr oglethorp bishop of carlisle who for want of a protestant archbishop set the crown on the head of queen elizabeth but she afterward notwithstanding that circumstance deprived him  here also we saw plainly the roman causway which i have beforementioned at aberforth and a stately stone bridge over the wherfe  mr camden gives us a distich of a learned passenger upon this river and the old bridge at tadcaster i suppose he passed it in a dry summer nil tadcaster habes musis vel carmine dignum praeter magnifice structum fine fiumine pontem in english thus naught tadcaster can thee to fame bequeath but a proud bridge  with never a stream beneath   but i can assure you to the contrary of this for though when i traveled this way it was about the middle of june i found the river pretty full  on this road we passed over towton that famous field where a most cruel and bloody battle was fought between the two houses of lancaster and york in the reign of edward iv i call it most cruel and bloody because the animosity of the parties was so great that though they were countrymen and neighbors nay as history says relations for here fathers killed their sons and sons their fathers for some time they fought with such obstinacy and rancour that they gave no quarter it is certain such numbers were never slain in one battle in england since that fought between king harold and william the conqueror at battle in sussex for here fell in the whole   000 men and the yorkists proved victorious  tradition guided us to the very spot but there remain no visible marks of the action the ploughmen indeed say that sometimes they turn up arrowheads spearheads broken javelins helmets and the like  farther south still or rather southeast on the road to doncaster stands shirbourn a pretty good town famous for a well endowed hospital erected by one hungate a protestant for the maintenance at bed board and clothing etc of children from seven till fifteen years old when according to their genius and capacity some are sent to the university or apprenticed out to trades for which there is a provision which including the maintenance of the hospital amounts to   0 l a year a noble and well chosen piece of charity  we turned east to selby situate on the south side of the ouse a small market town but very well inhabited and is famous for giving birth to our henry i the conqueror built an abbey here  we then fell down directly south and came to snath upon the air which is but an inconsiderable town but like selby has a pretty good trade i should have mentioned that there are several merchants that live at selby and that the ouse is navigable up to the town for large vessels and has a good share of trade that way  we fell down still lower south to thorn on the river dun an indifferent town of no other not than its situation within the marshes which is called marshland island for it is encompassed by the dun the air the ouse and another little river which parts it from the isle of axholm on the edge of lincolnshire already spoken of so that these two river islands are contiguous  being now come to the banks of the ouse near the influx of the trent into the humber i shall after reminding you that i have now accomplished another part of the proposition in my last letter cross over the ouse to howdon  howdon lies on the ouse north in the eastriding of yorkshire it is a pretty large town and is subject to great inundations from the river occasioned by the freshes which come down from the woulds and has been so it seems ever since    0 when a bishop of durham built a very tall steeple to the church that in case of a sudden inundation the people might save themselves in it and there have been within these few years several commissions for repairing the banks  the fair or mart held here for eight days together is very considerable for inland trade and several wholesale tradesmen come to it from london but the town is more famous for the birth or residence of one of our ancient historians roger of hoveden or howdon a monk of this abbey mr camdens continuator is mistaken in saying this town stands upon the derwent for it is above three miles southeast of it though the derwent was made navigable pursuant to act of parliament   annae to the ouse  the bishop of durham has a temporal jurisdiction in this part of the country which is called howdonshire  i found nothing in this low part of the country but a wonderful conflux of great rivers all pouring down into the humber which receiving the air the ouse the dun and the trent becomes rather a sea than a river  i observed that the middle of this division of yorkshire is very thin of towns and people being overspread with woulds which are plains and downs like those of salisbury which feed great numbers of sheep black cattle and horses and produce corn the northern part especially is more mountainous which makes part of the north riding but the east and west parts are populous and rich and full of towns the one lying on the sea coast and the other upon the river derwent as above the sea coast or southeast side is called holderness  from hence we traveled northeast up to wighton being but a very little out of the way to beverley it is a small but ancient market town seated on the banks of a little river called foulness here are some roman as well as british antiquities it is supposed to be the delgovitia station of the romans from the british word ddelw or delgive signifying image some have conjectured that here has been a temple of the druids and that their groves were in the wood of dierwald which they interpret as derived from the british word derwen an oak  on the northwest of wighton toward the derwent stands the market town of pocklington which we were told was so inconsiderable that it would not be worth our while to go so much out of our way to see it so keeping on east under the woulds we arrived at beverley which is situate just at the foot of them about a mile from the river hull it is a large populous corporate town under the government of a mayor aldermen etc it takes its name from the great number of beavers with which that river abounded it had formerly a considerable trade by means of a creek or cut commonly called beverleybeck of old made from the town to the river hull which runs into the humber for the passage of ships and boats keels wherries hoys etc to and from the said town and as it had likewise diverse staiths or landingplaces adjoining to the said beech for the lading and unlading of all sorts of merchandise the town was wont to receive no small advantage from this cut or river but there being no settled fund for keeping it open and cleansing it and the expense of doing it being beyond the ability of the corporation the said beck was in time choked up and the staiths grew out of repair whence an act passed anno      for cleansing deepening and widening the creek and for repairing the staiths and for mending the roads leading from the said cut to the town and at the same time providing for the cleansing of the town itself all which has had a very good effect for before the creek lying in the lower part of the town the filth dirt and soil of the town was washed into it which very much contributed to choke it up  beverley is the chief town of the east riding and began to be of great note from the time that john of beverly archbishop of york the first doctor of divinity in oxford and preceptor to venerable bede built a monastery here and afterward retired into it himself where he died a d     king athelstan having made a vow at the altar of st john before he proceeded against the scots in his return a d  0 instituted a new college of secular canons and granted to the town many immunities particularly to the freemen of it an exemption from all manner of tolls which was afterward confirmed by king henry i and by all or most of the kings and queens of this realm to this time as the mayors certificate expresses it which he gives to such freemen as apply for it in the form following villa de beverley in com ebor ss to all persons to whom these presents shall come a b esquire mayor of the aforesaid town of beverley sends greeting know ye that king athelstan of famous memory did grant and also king henry the first did grant and confirm to the men of the said town of beverley and afterward to them by the name of the governors or keepers and burgesses of beverley an exemption of all manner of imposts toll tallage stallage tunnage lastage pickage wharsage and of and from all and every the like exactions payments and duties throughout and in all places whatsoever by sea and land within all their dominions of england and wales which said grants were confirmed by all or most of the succeeding kings and queens to the time of queen elizabeth who confirmed the same to them by the name of the mayor governors and burgesses of beverley with several grants which have been also confirmed by all or most of the kings and queens of this realm till this time as by many and sundry charters under their great seals more at large may appear these are therefore to certify that c d is a burgess of the said town of beverley and is therefore discharged of and from all and every the said exactions payments and duties in testimony whereof the said mayor has hereunto subscribed his name and caused the common seal of the said town used in this behalf to be affixed this  day etc     by these and the like privileges the town keeps up its flourishing condition notwithstanding it is within six miles of so powerful a rival as hull it has all the advantage indeed of a good situation to invite gentlemen to reside in it and being the nearest town of note to the center of this riding the sessions are always held here in a spacious and beautiful hall which has a public garden and walks not inferior to any of their kind in england in this hallgarth as it is called is a handsome registeroffice for deeds and wills within this division which is the only county in england besides middlesex which has such a registry to the great reproach of the nation be it said especially when it shall be remembered that no less than two bills one for a registry for the county of surrey and another after that for a general registry over the whole kingdom were respectively opposed and miscarried very lately in parliament  here are two weekly markets one on wednesdays for cattle the other on saturdays for corn the marketplace is as large as most having a beautiful cross supported by eight freestone columns of one entire stone each erected at the charge of sir charles hotham and sir michael wharton upon which was this inscription haec seeds lapidea freedstoole dicitur i e pacis cathedra ad quam revs fvgiendo perveniens omnimodam habet secvritatem that is this stone seat is called freedstoole or chair of peace to which if any criminal flee he shall have full protection  the common gaol has been lately reedified at a considerable expense the windows well sashed and as if works of piety were more peculiarly adapted to this place there are seven almshouses in the town and legacies left for two more besides a workhouse which has cost  00 l it has a free school to the scholars of which are appropriated two fellowships at st johns college in cambridge and nine exhibitions  here were formerly four churches now only two but the largest and finest parochial ones in the kingdom viz the late collegiate church of st john the evangelist still called the minster and st marys the minster being very ruinous a brief was procured for the repair of it in the year    0 the produce of which and the subscription money being placed in the public funds was farther augmented by the rise of south sea stock which enabled the prudent managers to complete their pious design in the most beautiful manner assisted by the advice of that noted architect nicolas hawksmore esquire king george i encouraged this work not only by a liberal donation of money but of stone likewise from the dissolved monastery of st marys in york sir michael wharton gave in his lifetime  00 l and by will  000 l as a perpetual fund toward keeping it in repair  the choir is paved with marble of four different colors lozengewise appearing cubical to the eye over the altar is a large and magnificent wooden arch curiously engraven standing upon eight fluted columns of the corinthian order the altartable is one entire stone of white marble finely polished the gift of mr moyser the east window is of painted glass collected out of the several windows about the church but so artfully joined that they make throughout one regular and entire figure the screen between the choir and the nef has been lately rebuilt of rochabbey stone in the gothic style and is deservedly esteemed one of the chief ornaments of the church the body of the church is paved with the said stone intermixed with black marble the pulpit readingdesk and cover of the font are all new and of excellent workmanship the galleries also are new and beautifully finished supported by columns of the dorick order but not the least surprising thing in this pile is the north end wall of the great cross ayle which hung over three feet and a half but was screwed up to its proper level by the ingenious contrivance of mr thornton of york who prepared an admirable machine for the purpose  on the   th of september anno      upon opening a grave they met with a vault of square free stone    feet long and two feet broad within it was a sheet of lead four feet long and in that the ashes and six beads whereof three crumbled to dust with a touch of the three remaining two were supposed to be cornelian with three great brass pins and four large iron nails upon the sheet lay a leaden plate with this inscription in capital letters anno ab incarnatione domini mclxxxviii com fuit haec ecclesia in mense septembri in sequenti  post festum sancti matthaei apostoli et in anno mcxcvii sexto idus martii facta fuit inquisitio retiquiarum beati joannis in hoc loco et inventa sunt haec ossa in orientali part sepulchri et hic recondita et pulvis cemento mixtus ibidem inventus est et reconditus thus englished in the year of the lords incarnation      in september the night after the festival of st matthew the apostle this church was consumed by fire and in the year      on the  0th of march search was made for the relics of st john in this place and these bones were found in the eastern part of the sepulcher and here deposited and a mixture of dust and mortar was found in the same place and deposited  over this lay a box of lead about seven inches long six broad and five deep wherein were several pieces of bones mixed with a little dust and yielding a sweet smell all these things were carefully reinterred in the middle ayle of the body of the minster with this inscription added in capital letters reliquiae eaedem effossae et ibidem compositae fornice lateritio dignabantur xxvi die mensis martii anno domini mdccxxvi quando v tesselatum ecclesiae hujus pavimentum primo fuit instauratum thus englished the same relics which were dug up and replaced were adorned with an arch of brickwork on the   th day of march      when the fifth tesselated pavement of this church was first repaired  over it directly upon the roof is an inscription to show where the relics are interred  in this church are several monuments of the piercies earls of northumberland who have added a little chapel to the choir on the right side of the altarplace stands the freedstool mentioned above made of one entire stone and said to have been removed from dunbar in scotland with a well of water behind it at the upper end of the body of the church next the choir hangs an ancient table with the picture of st john the evangelist from whom the church is named and of king athelstan the founder of it and between them this distich als free make i thee as heart can wish or egh can see   in the body of the church stands an ancient monument which they call the virgins tomb because two virgin sisters lay buried there who gave the town a piece of land into which any freeman may put three milch kine from lady day to michaelmas at the lower end of the body of the church stands a fair large font of agat stone  the principal trade of the town is making malt oatmeal and tanned leather but the poor people mostly support themselves by working bonelace which of late has met with particular encouragement the children being maintained at school to learn to read and to work this sort of lace the clothingtrade was formerly followed in this town but leland tells us that even in his time it was very much decayed  they have several fairs but one more especially remarkable called the mart beginning about nine days before ascensionday and kept in a street leading to the minster garth called londonersstreet for the londoners bring down their wares and furnish the country tradesmen by wholesale  about a mile from beverly to the east in a pasture belonging to the town is a kind of spaw though they say it cannot be judged by the taste whether it comes from any mineral or not yet taken inwardly it is a great drier and bathed in dries scorbutic scurf and all sorts of scabs and also very much helps against the kings evil  from beverley i came to hull properly called kingston upon hull distance six miles if you would have an idea of hamburgh dantzick rotterdam or any of the second cities abroad which are famed for their commerce you may visit this town it is not indeed so large as those but in proportion to the dimensions of it i believe more business is done in hull than in any town in europe liverpoole of late comes very near it but it has not the advantage of a london trade which hull has  in the last war the fleets from hull to london were frequently  00 sail sometimes including the other creeks in the humber   0 sail at a time and to holland their trade was so considerable that the dutch always employed two men of war to convoy the merchantmen to and from hull and those were as many as they sent to london  in a word all the trade at leeds wakefield and halifax of which i have spoken so particularly is negotiated here all the lead trade of derbyshire and nottinghamshire from bautry wharf the butter of the east and north riding brought down the ouse to york the cheese down the trent from stafford warwick and cheshire and the corn from all the counties adjacent are shipped off here  so again they supply all these countries with foreign goods for which they trade to all parts of the known world nor have the merchants of any port in britain greater credit or a fairer character than the merchants of hull as well for the justice of their dealings as the greatness of their substance from norway and the baltic dantzick riga narva and petersburg they make large returns in iron copper hemp flax canvas muscovy linen and yarn and other things all which they get vend for in the country in prodigious quantities they have also a great importation of wine linen oil fruit etc from holland france and spain the trade of tobacco and sugars from the west indies they chiefly manage by the way of london but besides all this their export of corn as well to london as to holland and france exceeds all of the kind that is or can be at any port in england london excepted  their shipping is a great article in which they exceed all the towns and ports on that coast except yarmouth saving that their shipping consists chiefly in smaller vessels than the coaltrade is supplied with though they have a great many large vessels too which are employed in their foreign trade  the town is situated at the mouth of the river hull where it falls into the humber and where the humber opens into the german ocean so that one side of the town lies upon the sea the other upon the land this makes the situation naturally very strong and were there occasion it is capable of being made impregnable by reason of the low grounds round it  the advantages of this situation struck king edward i as he was riding a hunting after his return from the defeat of the scots in the year      upon which he immediately granted several privileges and immunities to those who would build and settle here erected a manorhall himself and fitted up an harbor from whence it received the name of kingstown it held out against king charles i who went in person to demand it when sir john hotham told his majesty he kept it for the parliament against him yet both the hothams viz father and son lost their heads by that very parliament  king charles ii on occasion of the frequent dutch wars in his reign had once resolved to appoint a station for a squadron of men of war here with a yard and dock for building ships and on this occasion resolved to make the place strong in proportion to what those affairs required upon which a large citadel was marked out on the other side of the river but it was never finished  the town is exceeding close built and populous even to an inconvenience having really no room to extend itself by buildings there are but two churches trinity and st marys the former is very large in which is a fine altarpiece by parmentier the latter is thought to have been once larger than it is king henry viii used it as his chapel royal and with the same freedom for this defender of the faith and protector of the church pulled down the steeple because it stood opposite to the place where he resided the inhabitants afterward built it up again at their own expense  they show us still in their town hall the figure of a northern fisherman supposed to be of greenland he was taken up at sea in a leathern boat which he sat in and was covered with skins which drew together about his waist so that the boat could not take in water and he could not sink the creature would neither feed nor speak and so died  they have a very handsome exchange here where the merchants from foreign countries and others from the different parts of the kingdom meet as at london the business arising from the navigation of all the great rivers which fall into the humber is transacted here there is also a fine free school founded by john alcock bishop of worcester afterward of ely who was born at beverley but chose to extend his liberality to this place over the school is the merchants hall  but the trinity house here is the glory of the town it is a corporation of itself composed of a society of merchants it was begun by voluntary contribution for relief of distressed and aged seamen and their wives or widows but was afterward improved by the government and incorporated they have a very good revenue which increases every day by charities  they maintain  0 sisters now actually in the house widows of seamen they have a government by    elder brethern and six assistants out of the    they choose annually two wardens but the whole    vote in electing them and two stewards these have a power to decide disputes between masters of ships and their crews in matters relating to sea affairs and with this limitation that their judgment be not contrary to the laws of the land but so great deference is paid to it that in trials at law in such affairs they are often called to give their opinions  here is a noble stone bridge over the river hull consisting of    arches a greenland fishery set up in this town went on with success for a while but it decayed in the time of the dutch wars and the house built by the greenland merchants is now turned into granaries for corn and warehouses for other goods  the old hospital called gods house stands near it with a chapel both which were pulled down in the civil wars      but were rebuilt in      and the arms of the de la poles being found among the ruins were placed over the door of the hospital with this inscription deo et pavperibvs posvit  this michael was the son of william de la pole sometime a merchant at ravenspurn formerly a flourishing town of trade at the mouth of the humber but being removed to this new town of kingston in the time of edward iii gave that king a magnificent entertainment when in the sixth year of his reign he came to take a view of the place upon which our merchant was knighted the king afterward going into flanders against the french met sir william at antwerp where he supplied him with several thousands of pounds and even mortgaged his estate for his royal masters use such services could not go unrewarded from so generous and so successful a prince he made him knight banneret in the field settled on him and his heirs lands at kingston to the value of  00 marks a year and upon his return into england increased them to  000 and advanced him in time to be chief baron of the exchequer  sir william died about      after he had begun a monastery here for the carthusians his son sir michael who   richard ii was made lord chancellor not only finished it but founded likewise the hospital called gods house abovementioned he built moreover a stately palace called the duke of suffolks which honor he obtained in right of his wife elizabeth eldest daughter of sir john wingfield who married the heiress of gilbert granville earl of suffolk but the happiness of him and his family being now arrived to the height set in misfortunes for in the year      he was impeached of high treason and fled for his life into france where he died william de la pole was prime minister to king henry vi and suspected to be too familiar with his heroic queen he was impeached by the commons anno    0 and banished but his head was struck off by the management of his enemies as soon as he set his foot on the french shore  john de la pole married the sister of king edward iv and so became allied to royal blood and by that means exposed to various misfortunes and the famous cardinal pole who flourished in the reign of queen mary i descended from that marriage  here are a great many other hospitals besides and likewise a workhouse and a good free school  though this town and a small adjacent territory be generally reckoned in yorkshire yet it is really a distinct liberty and county of itself governed by a mayor a sheriff    aldermen etc the corporation has two swords one a present from king richard ii and the other from king henry viii one of which is on public occasions carried before the mayor and a cap of maintenance and oar of lignumvitae as ensigns of honor the last being also a badge of his admiralty within the limits of the humber  farther east from hull is a little pleasant corporate and mayortown called heydon it is handsome well built and has a little haven from the sea which increases daily  the sea incroaches much upon the land on all the shore about this town and it is said that many large fields as well as towns which have been formerly known to have been there have been washed away and lost  history tells us that a town called ravensburgh stood somewhere this way and it is memorable for baliol king of scotland having set out thence to recover his kingdom against bruce and also for the landing of henry iv when duke of hereford and the reception he met with there from the english nobility against richard ii and yet there are no vestigia or traces of this town to be now met with  the spurn head a long promontory thrusting out into the sea and making the north point of humber is very remarkable but i leave that till i come to the description of the sea coasts i can only observe that there is nothing worth observation upon this side for above  0 miles together not a port not a gentlemans seat not a town of any note except patrington which is a very ancient corporate town and very pleasantly seated within the promontory and had likewise formerly a good harbor on one side it looks into the humber and on the other over sweet delicious green fields which renders its situation very agreeable it is supposed to be the praetorium of ptolemy the roman way from the picts wall ends here as indeed it can hardly go further unless it should extend to kelnsey a little village standing at the head of the promontory  spurnhead is likewise supposed to be the occellum of ptolemy derived from the british word yhell which signifies a high place on the east side of this promontory on the german sea the villages lie very thick but i met with nothing of note till we came up to hornsey which is almost surrounded with a little arm of the sea the steeple here is a notable seamark but is much fallen into ruin here was a whole street washed away by the sea as it is said a village called hide was a little to the north as well as many other villages on this coast  northwest of hornsey some distance from the sea stands kilham a market town in the woulds but of no note  we next come to burlington or birdlington a good large market town situate on a creek of the sea it is a place of good trade and has a safe harbor for ships and a good quay to load and unload them it is much frequented by the colliers the harbor is made still better and yet improving by virtue of several acts of parliament passed for repair of its piers the last of which enforcing the former and supplying defects was in      here william of newborough a village just by one of our historians was a canon regular and resided when he fell so violently upon geoffrey of monmouths history and treated him very abusively which leland blames him very much for as irreverent and uncharitable to a bishop after his death it seems there was a personal enmity between william and some of geoffreys family though the last is in no wise to be justified in some of his fictitious assertions no more than the other is for absolutely denying there was such a man as king arthur and that the ground at battle abbey where harold was slain in fighting against the conqueror always sweats blood after rain  the country people told us a story here of gypsies which visit them often in a surprising manner we were strangely amused with their discourse at first forming our ideas from the word which in ordinary signification with us denotes a sort of strlling vagabonds but we were soon made to understand that the people meant by them certain streams of water which at different seasons for none knows when they will happen gush out of the earth with great violence and noise spouting up to a great height being natural jette d eaux or fountains which afterward joining together form little rivers and so hasten to the sea i had not time to examine into the particulars and as the irruption was not just then to be seen we could say little to it that which was most observable to us was that the country people have a notion that whenever those gypsies or as some call them vipsies break out there will certainly ensue either famine or plague this puts me in mind that the very same thing is said to happen at swintham bottom in surrey beyond croydon and that the water gushing out of the chalky hills about eight miles from croydon on the road to ryegate fills the whole bottom and makes a large river running just to the towns end of croydon and then turning to the left runs into the river which rises in the town and so to cashalton i mention it because the country people here have exactly the same notion that this water never breaks out but against a famine and as i am sure it has not now broken out for more than  0 years it may for aught i know be true  near burlington stands flamboroughhead a little promontory which bends a little into the sea and forms the bay of burlington it takes its name from flam a british word for a firelight and not far from this promontory is a very large ditch which some of the ancient earls of holderness threw up as a boundary to their jurisdiction and estate it is called earls dyke  humanby stands next but is so inconsiderable that it has lost the privilege of its market if it ever had any  at lebberston a little village a small way from the sea the famous river derwent takes its rise and makes its way west instead of running into the sea here and here i take leave of the east riding which is in no wise so fruitful as the other two ridings by reason that the middle part of it is overrun with the woulds which are high grounds barren and moorish but are however wellstockd with sheep yet the eastern part upon the sea is fruitful and pleasant which as well as the southern part produces all sort of grain and grass but then if you take in its trade and traffic it excels both the other ridings  scarborough is the first town we come to upon the coast in the north riding it is a borough bailiwick town the situation of which is perfectly romantic bending in the form of a crescent to the main ocean of which you have almost an unbounded prospect from all parts it being built on a steep rock and the declivity of a lofty hill on the top of which stood an ancient castle founded by william le gros in the time of king stephen and repaired and enlarged afterward by king henry ii but demolished in the late civil wars the summit of this hill contains no less than    or  0 acres of meadowground the town is populous almost encompassed by the sea and walled where it joins not to the castle or is more strongly defended by the sea it has one of the best harbors in the kingdom especially since the passing of an act of parliament anno      to enlarge its piers and harbor by which they have gained   feet depth of water which enables the harbor to receive vessels of greater burden than it could do before and it is the best place between newcastle and the humber capable of receiving in distress of weather ships coming from the eastern seas along our northern coast  the spaw waters whose admirable virtues yearly occasion a great concourse of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom were first discovered by mrs ferrow about   0 years ago then an inhabitant of the place  they are reckoned cathartick and diuretic much in their nature like those of pyrmont in germany and are apparently tinged with a collection of mineral salts as of vitriol alum iron and perhaps sulphur but being deemed of the same nature as those of cheltenham in gloucestershire before described i refer to them  scarborough may be said even to rival the bath itself and on several accounts is more eligible and inviting to strangers it is well for the bath that its seasons interfere not with theirs for it is frequented chiefly in the hot months of the summer  there are many new buildings in it and more going forward so that there is now good accommodation for great numbers even of the highest quality and they have assemblies and public balls in long rooms built on purpose  the unfortunate accident that happened in december      whereby this famous spaw had like to have been lost deserves to be mentioned here take then the account as follows  the spaw as to its situation lay south from the town on the sands and fronting the sea to the east under a high cliff on the back of it west the top of the cliff being above the high water level    yards and all about a quarter of a mile from the town  the staith or wharf adjoining to the spawhouse was a large body of stone bound by timbers and was a fence against the sea for the security of the house it was    feet long and    feet high and in weight by computation      tons the house and buildings were upon a level with the staith at the north end of which and near adjoining to it upon a small rise above the level sands and at the foot of the stairs that lead up to the top of the said staith and to the house were the spaw wells  on wednesday december    in the morning a great crack was heard from the cellar of the spaw house and upon search the cellar was found rent but at the time no farther notice was taken of it  the night following another crack was heard and in the morning the inhabitants were surprised to see the strange posture it stood in and got several gentlemen to view it who being of opinion the house could not stand long advised them to get out their goods but they still continued in it  on thursday following between two and three in the afternoon another crack was heard and the top of the cliff behind it rent     yards in length and    in breadth and was all in motion slowly descending and so continued till dark the ground thus rent contained about an acre of pastureland and had cattle then feeding upon it and was on a level with the main land but sunk near    yards perpendicular the sides of the cliff nearest the spaw stood as before but were rent and broken in many places and forced forwards to the sea the ground when sunk lay upon a level and the cattle next morning were still feeding on it the main land being as a wall on the west and some part of the side of the cliff as a wall to the east but the whole to view gave such a confused prospect as could hardly be described  the rent of the top of the cliff aforesaid from the main land was     yards the rent continued from each end down the side of the cliff to the sands was measured on the sands from one end to the other     yards viz     south of the staith and spaw wells and  00 to the north of the spaw  as the ground sunk the earth or sand on which the people used to walk under the cliff rose upwards out of its natural position for above  00 yards in length on each side of the staith north and south and was in some places six and in others seven yards above its former level the spaw wells rose with it but as soon as it began to rise the water at the spaw well ceased running and was gone  the ground thus risen was    yards broad the staith which was computed at      tons rose entire and whole    feet higher than its former position but rent a little in the front and was forced forwards toward the sea  0 yards  the most reasonable account then given for this phenomenon and the occasion of the destruction of the staith and spaw house and the loss for some time of the spaw spring is as follows  when this staith or wharf was lately rebuilt it being thrown down by the violence of the sea mr vincent engineer for the building of the new pier at scarborough was desired to rebuild this staith at the spaw and digging a trench to lay the foundation thereof with great difficulty cleared it of water and when he had done it could at several parts thereof very easily thrust his stick or cane up to the handle from whence it is concluded that all the earth under the staith was of a porous spongy swampy nature and was much the same below the foundation of the spaw house and all under the sides of the cliff adjoining as well north as south  allowing this to be fact the solid earth sinking on the top of the cliff as aforementioned which was of so vast a weight as by computation to amount to       0 tons pressing gradually upon and into the swampy boggy earth beneath it would of course and did raise the earth and sands as before noticed and so effected the mischief we have particularized  but very luckily for the town after a diligent search and clearing away the ruins as we may say they found again the spaw spring and on trial had the pleasure to find the water rather bettered than impaired by the disaster and now the whole is in a more flourishing condition than ever  here is such plenty of all sorts of fish that i have hardly seen the like to describe the herring the cod the whiting is only to repeat what is said in other places and what we shall have occasion to repeat more than once now we begin to go far north  we traveled a long way from scarborough before we came to the next market town which is whitby situate at the influx of the little river esk into the sea it has an excellent harbor and a good trade by sea and it is said to have above  00 ships belonging to it here are built a great number of good ships for the coal trade it has a good customhouse the market is well furnished and supplied with all sorts of provisions  the harbor and piers being somewhat decayed they were repaired by virtue of two acts of parliament in the first and seventh years of queen anne and in      an act passed to preserve continue and keep the said piers in repair for ever  by means of these several acts of parliament the piers of whitby have been rebuilt and completed but yet for some years past the entrance into the port has been rendered very narrow and difficult by reason of a bank of sand which has been gathering about the head of the west pier insomuch that it bid fair to choke up the harbor nor could this inconvenience be redressed in the opinion of the best judges but by lengthening and extending the west pier and its head about  00 yards farther into the sea for this reason another act passed in the eighth of king george ii for lengthening the west pier and for improving the harbor  at the foot of some rocks at this town have been found stones naturally as round as a bullet which when broken stony serpents are found in them for the most part headless looked upon as a lusus naturae  this place was anciently called streanshall and oswy king of northumberland held a council here in     to determine the controversy between those who kept easter after the british manner and those who kept it after the roman manner which augustine the monk had lately introduced after the party for the first had spoken the other answering insisted they kept easter after the manner of st peter on whom christ promised to build his church and had the keys of heaven upon which the king asked if it was true that christ had spoken so to st peter which the adverse party allowing the king swore a great oath that he would not disoblige this porter of heaven lest when he came to the gates he should remember him and so established the celebration of easter after the roman manner  near this place are some alum mines belonging to her grace the duchess of bucks in which there is carried on a very considerable trade  we inquired as to that strange and wonderful phenomenon relating to the air here which as the wild geese fly over a piece of ground near this place in hard winters to the lakes in the southern countries makes them drop down all of a sudden to the ground and had it assured to us for truth though none could assign any reason for it  there are spaw waters at whitby which have had great reputation several curious and antique coins have been dug up in this neighborhood and a monastery was founded here by st hilda about the year   0 and being destroyed by the danes was afterward rebuilt the ruins of which very considerable are still to be seen in the month of november    0 such a dreadful storm happened here that the damage to the shipping etc was computed at  0000 l  here the coast inclines northwest and we followed it till we came to gisborough a market town pretty well built a little way from the sea upon a small nameless river it is a fine and delicious situation endued with such a grateful variety and advantages of nature as renders it most delightfully pleasant a fine scene of verdure overspreads all the grounds about it which are decked with plenty of fieldflowers almost all the year round some compare it to puteoli in italy but allow that it exceeds it in healthiness it stands high and would have been incommoded with cold breezes as it stands so northerly from the sea but that some hills conveniently interfere so as to qualify the cold  the behavior of the inhabitants too participates of the pleasantness of the place for they are very courteous wellbred and obliging and very neat and cleanly in their houses  here are likewise some alum mines but not so considerable and easy wrought as those of whitby which has taken off a great part of that trade from hence  this pleasant town is the last on the east side toward the sea in this north riding in our way to durham it made so delightful an impression on my mind that i left the whole county in general but this place and truly pleasurable country about it in particular with regret  and thus have i accomplished the third and last part of my proposition with respect to my circuit through this large and far extended county and though i have been not a little circumstantial in my accounts of it yet there are many curious matters that still remain untouched and could not be brought within the compass of an epistolary correspondence of this kind  but as i have given you only a description of the county above ground take the following memorandums of the treasures which are contained in its bowels  alum jet or black amber copperas marble pitcoal lead copper limestone and kelp  the first market town we come to in the bishopric of durham on the east side is stockton which lies on the northside of the teis it has risen at the expense of yarum from a poor pitiful village with clay walls and straw covering to the houses to a well built corporate town of great resort and business governed by a mayor etc it is famous for its ale and a good trade which it carries on in lead and butter by the teis with london which formerly was altogether at yarum but this town lying nearer the sea and consequently more convenient has almost engrossed the whole trade to itself  coasting along the seaside we come next to hartlepool which is a famous corporate mayortown and seated on a little promontory which juts out into the sea with which it is encompassed on all sides except the west the market was much more considerable formerly than now and its chief subsistence rises only from its good harbor which frequently receives the coalfleet from newcastle in bad weather  we turned from hence to the left northwest and came to durham next which is a fine city pretty large compact wellcontrivd and well situated high pleasant and healthy and surrounded almost with the river were over which are two good stone bridges the castle stands on an eminence with which the river incloses the city as the castle does also the cathedral the bishops palace and the fine houses of the clergy where they live in great splendour and magnificence all sorts of provisions and other necessaries and conveniences for life are very cheap as well as very good here though it has but one weekly market which is kept in a large spacious area in the town it is governed by a mayor aldermen recorder and sheriffs and has six parish churches besides the cathedral which is very noble and magnificent adorned with a high tower which rises from the midst of it and two spires at the west end  thus from a poor oratory of wreathen wands and hurdles with which the indigent monks of landisfarn had first built it it is become one of the most sumptuous buildings of the kind in england and was erected out of the offerings which were made by the superstitious multitude at the shrine of st cuthbert and yet notwithstanding the residence of so many dignified protestant clergy it is said there are still great numbers of roman catholics in this city  i need not tell you that the bishop of durham is a temporal prince that he keeps a court of equity and also courts of justice in ordinary causes within himself he is still earl of sadberg and takes place as bishop immediately after the bishop of london as the country about rome is called st peters patrimony so that about durham is st cuthberts to whom the church is dedicated as it is said it was founded by the monks of landisfarn david king of scots laying all waste with fire and sword while king edward iii was at calais zouch the valiant bishop fought the scots at nevils cross where they were cut in pieces and their king taken prisoner he was the sixth bishop of landisfarn or holy island from whence the sea was removed hither  the bishopric is esteemed one of the best in england and the prebends and other church livings in the gift of the bishop are the richest in the kingdom they told me there that the bishop had thirteen livings in his gift from  00 l to  00 l a year and the living of the little town of sedgfield a few miles south of the city is said to be worth  00 l a year besides the small tithes which maintain a curate or might do so  this church is very rich they have excellent music the old vestments which the clergy before the reformation wore are still used on sundays and other holy days by the residents they are so rich with embroidery and embossed work of silver as must needs make it uneasy for the wearers to sustain in this cathedral lies the body of the vrable bid  one of the old bishops of durham purchased for a round sum of money all the rights of the palatinate and other jurisdiction in this county from king richard i and by his last will left them to the succeeding bishops but king henry viii by act of parliament greatly abridged the temporal power and jurisdiction of this bishopric and king edward vi or rather his uncle somerset by act of parliament dissolved the bishopric entirely but it was restored by queen mary neither city nor county ever sent members to the house of commons till the vacancy of the sea by the death of bishop cosins anno      and since they return each of them two which is all that the county send  we took a trip from durham south to see bishops auckland which is a market town pleasantly seated upon a hill in a very good air and is noted for a most noble palace beautified with turrets belonging to the bishop and also a fine chapel founded and built by bishop cosins who reedified the palace after the enthusiastic rage of the late civil wars had ruined it  here we turned west and following the were passed through wolsingham a little town of no note to stanhop a little town also which had once a market but it is now discontinued it is only noted for a very good park which lies near it where king edward iii besieging the scots in their camp had like to have been surprised in his tent by one douglas an adventurous scot had not the kings chaplain defended him with the loss of his own life  these western parts of the county all to the upper part of it are very hilly and mountainous and the fields near them look naked and barren but the iron mines they produce within their bowels make ample amends for the barrenness of the surface  we returned from these inhospitable parts to durham from whence we kept the common road to chester in the street an old dirty thoroughfare town void of all remains of the greatness which antiquaries say were to be seen there when it was a roman colony here is a stone bridge but instead of riding over it we rode under it through one of the arches the stream not being over the horses hoofs in water yet on inquiry we found that sometimes they have use enough for it  lumleycastle belonging to the earl of scarborough is just on the other side of the road as you pass between durham and chester pleasantly seated in a fine park near the east bank of the river were the park besides the pleasantness of it has this much more valuable circumstance to recommend it that it is full of excellent veins of the best coal in the country for the lumley coals are known for their goodness at london as well as there this with a sometimes navigable river just at hand by which the coals are carried down to sunderland to the ships makes lumley park an inexhaustible treasure to the family  they tell us that king james i lodged in this castle at his entrance into england to take possession of the throne and seeing a fine picture of the ancient pedigree of the family which carried it very far beyond what his majesty thought credible turned this good jest upon it to the bishop of durham who showed it him that indeed he did not know that adam s surname was lumley before  here we turned from the road and crossing the were followed it east to sunderland a corporate seaport town in the county palatine of durham populous and well built with a very handsome church in it and though the river be not large it carries on a great trade in coals at high water it is a peninsula almost surrounded by the sea it has a very fine church and its rector the rev and worthy mr daniel newcome was the principal architect in the building of it this gentleman spent the greatest part of his income in beautifying and adorning it he began by building a dome adjoining to the east end into which he removed the altar placing it under a canopy of inlaid work supported in front by two fluted pillars of the corinthian order with proper capitals his benevolence and charity were equally extensive to all who were proper objects of them and he delighted in doing good this worthy man however lived not to see his new works to the church quite completed dying very much lamented on   jan       the eastern side of the county along the sea coast and indeed the southern side along the banks of the teis is very fertile and delightful thick of little towns and villages which are very populous and as the mountains on the west produce iron mines this side is full of those of coals which lie so very near the surface of the ground that the cart wheels press into them  and indeed from durham the road to newcastle gives a view of the inexhausted store of coals and coal pits from whence not london only but all the south part of england is continually supplied and though at london when we see the prodigious fleets of ships which come constantly in with coals we are apt to wonder how it is possible for them to be supplied and that they do not bring the whole coal country away yet when in this country we see the prodigious heaps i might say mountains of coals which are dug up at every pit and how many of those pits there are we are filled with equal wonder to consider where the people should live that consume them  at the mouth of the tyne which parts durham from northumberland stands the village of sheals the station of the sea coal fleets where there have been some marks of roman antiquity discovered not many years since  yarrow noted for the birthplace of the venerable bede stands a little higher upon the same river and upon the other side of the tyne stands gateshead the receptacle of the coalpit men just over against newcastle and is supposed to have been anciently part of it though divided by the river over which there is a stately stone bridge with an irongate in the middle which serves as a boundary between the bishopric and the county of northumberland  the air in this bishopric is pretty cold and piercing and it is well for the poor that nature has supplied them so abundantly with fuel for firing and indeed all other provisions and necessaries are very cheap here it seems as if the whole county had been originally appropriated to religion and war for it is full of the ruins of religious houses and castles  we are now entering into the large and extensive county of northumberland which for many ages was the bone of contention and seat of war between england and scotland  newcastle is a large and exceeding populous town under the government of a mayor aldermen recorder etc and is situate between the wall of severus and the tyne which becomes here a fine deep and noble river insomuch that ships of a middling burden may come safely up to the very town though the large colliery ships are stationd at sheals it may be considered as divided into two parts whereof gateshead before spoken of on durham side is one they are both joined by the bridge which consists of seven arches as large at least as those of london bridge and support a street of houses as that does  the liberty of the town as it is a corporation extends no farther than the gate upon the bridge which some years since was the preservation of it by stopping a terrible fire that otherwise had perhaps burnt the whole street of houses on the city side of the bridge as it did those beyond it on the east side of this gate the arms of the bishop of durham are carved as those of the town of newcastle are on the west side  there is also a very noble exchange here and the wall of the town runs parallel from it with the river leaving a spacious piece of ground before it between the water and the wall which being well wharfed up and faced with freestone makes the longest and largest quay for landing and lading goods that is to be seen in england except that at yarmouth in norfolk it being much longer than that at bristol  here is a large hospital built by contribution of the keel men by way of friendly society for the maintenance of the poor of their fraternity and which had it not met with discouragements from those who ought rather to have assisted so good a work might have been a noble provision for that numerous and laborious people the keel men are those who manage the lighters which they call keels by which the coals are taken from the staiths or wharfs and carried on board the ships at sheals to load them for london  here are several large public buildings also particularly a house of state for the mayor of the town for the time being to remove to and dwell in during his mayoralty here is also a hall for the surgeons to meet in where they have two skeletons of human bodies one a man and the other a woman and some other rarities  and since this work went to the press i am informed that the rev dr robert thomlinson rector of whickham in the county of durham and prebendary of st pauls gave to this corporation a valuable collection of books consisting of upwards of  000 volumes and also settled a rentcharge of five pounds per annum for ever for buying new books and walter blackett esquire one of their representatives in parliament has at his own expense built a handsome fabric for the reception of those books and settled in mortmain a rentcharge of    l per annum for ever for a librarian  the town is defended by an exceeding strong wall wherein are seven gates and as many turrets the castle though old and ruinous overlooks the whole town the worst is that the situation of the town bing on the declivity of two high hills and the buildings being very close and old render it incommodious to which the smoke of the coals contributes not a little and consequently excludes such who seek a residence of pleasure but then as the river which runs between the two hills makes it a place of great trade and business that inconvenience is abundantly recompensed  they have two articles of trade here which are particularly owing to the coals viz glasshouses and saltpans the first are in the town the last are at sheals seven miles below it but their coals are brought chiefly from the town prodigious are the quantities of coals which those salt works consume and the fires make such a smoke that we saw it ascend in huge clouds over the hills four miles before we came to durham which is at least    miles from the place in short the town is almost surrounded with coalpits and london is reckoned to take off upwards of  00000 chaldrons yearly at thirtysix bushels to the chaldron  here i met with a remark which was quite new to me and will be so i suppose to many others you well know we receive at london every year a great quantity of salmon pickled or cured and sent up in the pickle in kits or tubs which we call newcastle salmon in consequence of this when i came to newcastle i expected to see great plenty of salmon there but was surprised to find it on the contrary so scarce that a good large fresh salmon was not to be had under five or six shillings upon inquiry i learnt that really this salmon which we call newcastle salmon is taken as far off as the tweed which is near  0 miles further and is brought by land on horses to sheals where it is cured pickled and sent to london as above so that it is more properly berwick salmon than newcastle  there is but one parochial church called st nicolas built by st david king of scotland but several chapels as large as churches here are likewise some meeting houses and a great many wellendowed charityschools it is not only enriched by the coal trade but there are also very considerable merchants in it who carry on traffic to diverse parts of the world especially to holland hamburgh norway and the baltic  they build ships here to perfection as to strength and firmness and to bear the sea as the coal trade requires this gives an addition to the merchants business it requiring a supply of all sorts of naval stores to fit out those ships  here is also a considerable manufacture of hard ware or wrought iron of late years erected after the manner of sheffield which is very helpful for employing the poor of which the town has always a prodigious number  this town was taken and plundered by the scots in the beginning of the late civil wars and here it was to their eternal reproach be it remembered that the scots perfidiously sold their king for  000 l in hand and security for  000 l more after he had in confidence entrusted himself in their hands and without any conditions made for him a transaction equally detestable with that of cutting off his head or more if possible as those who did the last were his avowed and implacable enemies whereas the others received him as his friends and protectors  on the   th of january       part of the ancient gate leading to the castlegarth fell down and though several shops joined to it yet nobody received any hurt  the town was formerly fortified with a great castle the walls of which are still standing its ancient name was monkchester but on the building of a new castle in the time of william the conqueror it obtained its present name it enjoys great privileges by the favor of queen elizabeth and being one of those which are called countytowns governs itself independently of the lord lieutenant  west from newcastle lies the bailiwicktown of hexham the axelodunum of the romans a pass upon the tyne famous or rather infamous for having the first blood drawn near it in the late civil war and where a detachment of english though advantageously posted were scandalously defeated by the scots who gained the pass fought through the river and killed about  00 men the rest basely running away after which the town of newcastle was as easily seized upon without striking a stroke  the country round this town is vulgarly called hexhamshire it was formerly the seat of a bishop till henry viii annexed it to that of durham its cathedral was stately before the scots ruined the greatest part of it in one of their excursions on the other side of the tyne from hexhamshire you see a house very beautifully situated belonging to the family of errington called bifront and within two miles of hexham is a fine house built by the late unfortunate earl of derwentwater called dilston  i was greatly tempted here to trace the famous wall built by the romans or rather rebuilt by them from hence to carlisle the particulats of which and the remains of antiquity seen upon it our histories are full of i went to several places in the fields through which it passed where i saw the remains of it some almost lost and some very visible but of this more in another place  northumberland is a long coasting county lying chiefly on the sea to the east and bounded by the mountains of stainmore on the west which are in some places inaccessible but in many others unpassable  here is abundant business for an antiquary every place shows you ruined castles roman altars inscriptions monuments of battles of heroes killed armies routed and the like the towns of morpeth alnwick warkworth tickill and many others show their old castles and some of them still in tolerable repair alnwick in particular and warkworth others as bambrough norham chillingham horton dunstar wark and a great many more are sunk in their own ruins by mere length of time  we had cheviot hills so plain in view that we could not but inquire of the inhabitants everywhere whether they had heard of the fight at chevychace they not only told us they had heard of it but had all the account of it at their fingers end whereupon taking a guide at wooller a small town lying as it were under the hills he led us on toward the top of the hill for by the way although there are many hills and reachings for many miles which bear the name of cheviot hills yet there is one of them a great deal higher than the rest which at a distance looks like the picoteneriffe in the canaries and is so high that it is plainly seen from the rosemary top in the east riding of yorkshire which is near  0 miles off  we were preparing to clamber up this hill on foot when our guide told us he would find a way for us to get up on horseback he then very artfully led us round to a part of the hill where in the winterseason great streams of water come pouring down from it in several channels which were pretty broad and overgrown on each side with aldertrees so close and thick that we rode under them as in an arbor in one of these channels we mounted the hill as besiegers approach a fortified town by trenches and were got a great way up before we were well aware of it for we were already so far advanced that we could see some of the hills which before we thought very high lying under us as if they were a part of the plain below as we mounted higher we found the hill steeper than at first and our horses being very much fatigued we alighted and proceeded on foot when we had gained the top we were agreeably surprised to see a smooth and pleasant plain half a mile in diameter with a large pond in the middle of it for we had a notion when at bottom that the hill narrowd to a point and that when we came to the top we should be as upon a pinnacle with a precipice every way round us  the day to our great satisfaction happened to be very calm and so clear that we could plainly see the smoke of the saltpans at sheals at the mouth of the tyne which was about  0 miles south from this we saw likewise several hills which our guide told us were in england and others in the west of scotland the names of which i have forgot eastward we saw berwick and to the north the hills called soutra hills which are in sight of edinburgh in short we had a surprising view of the united kingdom and though all the country round us looked very well yet it must be owned the scots side seemed the pleasantest and had the best ground  satisfied with this prospect and not thinking our time or pains ill bestowed we came down the hill by the same rout we went up our guide afterward carried us to a single house called wooller haughhead a much better inn than we expected to meet with thereabouts  at this inn we inquired after the particulars of the famous story of chevy chase and found that the people had the following notion of it that it was an inroad of the earl of douglas into england in order to ravage burn and plunder the country as was usual in those days that piercy earl of northumberland marched with his friends and followers to meet the scots both parties encountered at the foot of cheviot hills and a bloody battle ensued wherein both the earls were slain desperately fighting at the head of their troops and so many fell on both sides that it could not be determined which had the victory  they showed us the place where this battle was fought which if their tradition does not mislead them is on the side of the hill near the road it is said the scots were mostly horse and therefore the english archers placed themselves on the side of a steep ascent that they might not be broken in upon by them the spots of ground where the two earls are said to have fallen are distinguished by two stones to this day the fight the scots call the battle of otterburn and make a very famous story of it to the honor of their nation  about six or seven miles from hence we saw the ever memorable floddenfield where james iv king of scotland invading england with a great army when henry viii was engaged abroad in the siege of tournay was met by the gallant earl of surrey in which after a bloody battle the scots were totally defeated and their king fighting valiantly at the head of his nobility was slain  the river till which our historians call a deep and swift river where many of the scots were drowned in their flight seemed to me everywhere passable with great ease but perhaps it might at that time be swelled with some sudden rain which the historians ought to have taken notice of  i must not quit northumberland without taking notice that the natives of this country of the ancient original race or families are distinguished by a shibboleth upon their tongues in pronouncing the letter r which they cannot utter without a hollow jarring in the throat by which they are as plainly known as a foreigner is in pronouncing the th this they call the northumberland r or wharle and the natives value themselves upon that imperfection because forsooth it shows the antiquity of their blood  from hence lay a road into scotland by the town of kelso which i afterward passed through but at present inclining to see berwick upon tweed we turned to the west and visited that old frontier where is a fine bridge over the tweed built by queen elizabeth a noble stately work consisting of    arches and joining as may be said the two kingdoms the chief trade i found here was in corn and salmon  i am now on the borders of scotland and must call to mind that i have not yet gone over the western coast of england viz lancaster westmorland and cumberland  i must needs own that since i entered upon the view of these northern counties i have many times regretted that my limits forbid me often to decline the delightful view of antiquity of which there is so great and so surprising a variety every day discovered for the religious as well as military remains of the britons romans saxons and normans like wounds hastily healed up appear presently when the callus which was spread over them is removed and though the earth has defaced the figures and inscriptions upon most of these curiosities yet they are beautiful even in their decay and the venerable face of antiquity has something so pleasing so surprising so satisfactory in it especially to those who have with any attention read the histories of past ages that i know nothing which renders traveling more pleasant and more agreeable  the description of the other three counties will be the subject of my next letter mean time i am  sir your most humble servant  letter iv containing a description of the counties of lancaster westmorland and cumberland sir i entered lancashire at the remotest western point of that county having been at west chester upon a particular occasion and from thence ferryd over from the cestrian chersonesus as i have already called it to liverpoole this narrow slip of land rich fertile and full of inhabitants though formerly as authors say a mere waste and desolate forest is called wirall or by some wirehall here is a ferry over the mersee which at full sea is more than two miles over you land on the flat shore on the other side and must be content to ride through the water for some length not on horseback but on the shoulders of some lancashire clown who comes kneedeep to the boats side to truss one up and then runs away more nimbly than one desires to ride unless his trot were easier  liverpoole is one of the wonders of britain because of its prodigious increase of trade and buildings within the compass of a very few years rivalling bristol in the trade to virginia and the english colonies in america they trade also round the whole island send ships to norway to hamburg and to the baltic as also to holland and flanders so that they are almost become like the londoners universal merchants  the trade of liverpoole consists not only in merchandising and correspondencies beyond seas but as they import almost all kinds of foreign goods they have consequently a large inland trade and a great correspondence with ireland and scotland for consumption of their goods exactly as it is with bristol and they really divide the trade with bristol upon very remarkable equalities  bristol lies upon the irish sea so does liverpoole bristol trades chiefly to the south and west parts of ireland from dublin in the east to galloway west liverpoole has all the trade of the east shore and the north from the harbor of dublin to londonderry bristol has the trade of south wales liverpoole great part of the trade of north wales bristol has the southwest counties of england and some north of it as high as bridgenorth and perhaps to shrewsbury liverpoole has all the northern counties and a large consumption of goods in cheshire and staffordshire is supplied from thence  ireland is also shared between both and for the northern coast of it if the liverpoole men have not the whole fishery or at least in company with the merchants of londonderry the fault is their own the situation of liverpoole is very advantageous toward improving its commerce and extending it into the northern inland counties of england particularly into cheshire and staffordshire by the new navigation of the rivers mersee the weaver and the dane by the last the merchants come so near the trent with their goods that they make no difficulty to carry them by land to burton and from thence correspond quite through the kingdom even to hull and they begin to be very sensible of the profit of such a commerce  it is some advantage to the growing commerce of this town that the freemen of it are in consequence of that freedom free also of bristol as they are of the corporations of waterford and wexford in the kingdom of ireland not that these corporation privileges are of any great value to liverpoole in its foreign trade but in particular cases it may be some advantage as in town duties in admitting them to set up trades in those corporations and the like  the town has no fortifications either to the land or the sea though when the late northern insurrection reached to preston the inhabitants would have been glad of walls and gates and indeed had the rebel party had time to have advanced to warrington seized the pass there and taken manchester as they would certainly have done in three days more it would have fared but very ill with liverpoole which could have made but little resistance against an armed and desperate body of men besides the rebels would have not only found the sweets of plunder here but arms ammunition powder and lead all which they extremely wanted they would have had ships also to have facilitated a communication with ireland from whence numbers would have landed if it had been only in hopes of plunder but happy for liverpoole as well as the whole kingdom the rebels were defeated before they proceeded so far  the situation of liverpoole being on the north bank of the river with the disadvantage of a flat shore the merchants were laid under great difficulties in their business for though the harbor was good and the ships rode well in the offing yet they were obliged to ride there as in a road rather than a harbor here was no mole or haven to bring in their ships and lay them up as the seamen call it for the winter nor any quay for the delivering their goods as at bristol biddiford newcastle hull and other sea ports upon this the inhabitants and merchants by the aid of an act of parliament passed in the eighth year of the reign of the late queen anne which was prolonged by another passed in the third year of his majesty king george i made a large basin or wet dock at the east end of the town where at a very great charge the place considered they have brought the tide from the mersee to flow up by an opening that looks to the south and the ships go in north so that the town shelters it from the westerly and northerly winds the hills from the easterly and the ships lie as in a millpond with the utmost safety and convenience as this is so great a benefit to the town the like of which is not to be seen in any place of england for the merchants service london excepted it is well worth the imitation of many other tradeing places in britain who for want of such a convenience lose their trade for indeed the inhabitants of liverpoole suffered not a little for want of it in the great storm anno   0  this dock is capable of holding  00 sail of ships  but though these new works have been of such advantage to this flourishing town yet something more appeared wanting to crown the work for it seems the entrance into the dock or basin from the open harbor was so straight that ships and vessels lying in the dock were often hindered from getting out to sea and those without the dock in the open harbor were frequently forced ashore and lost to remedy this inconvenience an act passed anno      for enlarging the said entrance and for erecting a pier in the open harbor on the north and south sides of the said entrance and as the lives of diverse persons were endangered and lost and goods often run and smuggled for want of keeping proper and sufficient lights in the nightime about the said wetdock or basin the same act impowers the corporation to set up such a number of lamps to enlighten the dock as they shall think requisite all which must be of the highest benefit to this fine town and a great furtherance to its trade and navigation  the customhouse adjoining to the dock is also but the work of a few years past and is not only a commodious but an elegant piece of building  liverpoole had formerly but one church dedicated to our lady and st nicolas and that dependent on the parish of walton but upon the increase of inhabitants and of new buildings in so extraordinary a manner an act of parliament passed in the tenth year of king william iii enabling the corporation to build and endow a new one and to make liverpoole independent of walton anno   0  the church of st peters on the east side of the town which had been built at the charge of the parish to which it was appropriated was consecrated but this being still not sufficient for this flourishing town her late majesty queen anne in the third year of her reign granted to the corporation for  0 years a lease of the site of liverpoole castle which had long lain in ruins whereon to erect a third church and other edifices under the yearly rent of   l    s   d together with liberty to use the materials of the old castle for that purpose and his late majesty king george i by act of parliament was pleased to make over to the corporation for ever on a reserve of the same annual rent the said site of the old castle whereon the inhabitants erected the said third church and in honor to that prince dedicated it to st george it was finished in the year      from the revenues arising from the corporationlands and the duty on merchandise which are estimated at  00 l per ann these churches are very handsome and capacious buildings that on the north of the town has in it a fine font of marble placed in the body of the church surrounded with a beautiful iron palisado the gift of the late mr heysham a merchant of london but considerably concerned in trade on this side and for many years member of parliament for lancaster there is a beautiful tower to this church and a new ring of eight bells  the townhouse is a fine modern building standing all upon pillars of freestone the place under it is their tolsey or exchange for the meeting of their merchants but they begin to want more room and talk of enlarging it or removing the exchange to the other part of the town where the ships and merchants business is nearer at hand  here is also a good free school well endowed and likewise a very noble charityschool which was built and is supported by the generous contributions of the inhabitants for  0 boys and    girls who are maintained with clothes meat and lodging and have proper education bestowed upon them  here are also several almshouses for the support of sailors widows and other old and indigent people and since the year    0 a workhouse for the poor has also been erected which by good management has reduced the poors rate from two shillings in the pound to tenpence and they made no doubt when i was there last that in a year or two it would be brought under sixpence in the pound  it is a corporate town governed by a mayor and aldermen the harbor is defended on the south side by a castle and the west by a tower on the river mersee  in a word there is no town in england except london that can equal liverpoole for the fineness of the streets and beauty of the buildings many of the houses are built of freestone and completely finished and all the rest of the new part i mean of brick as handsomely built as london itself  formerly liverpoole was but indifferently supplied with fresh water but they have been for many years well accommodated in that respect by virtue of an act of parliament passed for that purpose in the eighth year of the reign of her late majesty queen anne  i shall only add that some of the streets are named from their relation to the family of the mores of blankhall formerly chief lords and owners of the greatest part of liverpoole and who first began to beautify and adorn it with fine stone buildings  from hence the mersee opening into the irish sea we could see the great and famous road of hile lake remarkable for the shipping off or rather rendezvous of the army and fleet under king william for the conquest of ireland anno      for here the men of war rode as our ships do in the downs till the transports came to them from chester and this town  going east we passed through prescot a large market town but thinly inhabited and came to warrington  this is a large oldbuilt market town upon the river mersee over which is erected a stately stone bridge which is the only bridge of communication for the whole county with that of chester it is on the great road from london leading to carlisle and scotland and in case of war has always been esteemed a pass of the utmost importance it was found to be so upon several occasions in the time of the late civil war and had the rebel scots advanced thus far in the late preston affair so as to have made themselves masters of it it would have been so again and on that account the kings forces took special care by a speedy advance to secure it  warrington is populous and rich and full of good country tradesmen here is particularly a weekly market for linen as i saw at wrexham in wales a market for flanel the linen sold at this market is generally speaking a sort of table linen called hukabuk it is likewise noted for excellent malt i was told there are generally as many pieces of this linen sold here every market day as amount to  00 l sometimes much more and all made in the neighborhood of the place  not far off is the village of winick famed for its rectory worth about  00 l a year  from hence on the road to manchester we passed the great bog or waste called chatmoss the first of that kind that we saw in england from any of the south parts hither it extends on the leftside of the road for five or six miles east and west and they told us it was in some places seven or eight miles from north to south there are many of these mosses in this county take this for a description of all the rest  the surface at a distance looks black and dirty and is indeed frightful to think of for it will bear neither horse nor man unless in an exceeding dry season and then so as not to be traveled over with safety  the surface seems to be a collection of the small roots of innumerable vegetables matted together interwoven so thick as well the larger roots as the smaller fibers that it makes a substance hard enough to cut out into turf or peat which in some places the people pile up in the sun and dry for their fuel the roots i speak of are in general small and soft not unlike the roots of asparagus or of bearbind and have no earth among them except what they contract from the air and dust flying in it but the rain keeps them as it were always growing though not much increasing  in some places the surface of this is very thick in others less we saw it sometimes eight or nine feet thick and the water that drained from it looked clear but of a deep brown like stale beer what nature meant by such an useless production is hard to imagine but the land is entirely waste except as above for the poor cottagers fuel and the quantity used for that is very small  under the moss or rather in the very body of it and not here only but in several like places perhaps in all of them those ancient firtrees are found which are so unaccountable that much learning has been shown to very little purpose on this subject for after all whatever has been said must be mere conjecture and uncertainty but in my weak judgment it may be thus accounted for that nature whose works are all directed by a superior hand has been guided to produce trees here under ground as she does in other places above ground that as the trees above the surface grow erect and high these lie prone and horizontal those shoot forth branches and leaves these shoot forth none yet have a vegetation by methods directed by nature and particular to that kind and it is remarkable that if they lie buried they will grow and increase but if you take them up and plant them in the air they will wither and die  it is observable that these trees are a kind of fir and are very full of turpentine whether there is any tar in them i am not positive but i suppose there is and yet i do not see that for this reason they should not be a natural ordinary product as other vegetables are  as to their being brought hither by the general convulsion of the globe at the deluge the thought is so repugnant to common sense that i think it neither needs nor deserves any other notice  from hence we came on to manchester one of the greatest if not really the greatest mere village in england it is neither a town city nor corporation nor sends members to parliament the highest magistrate is a constable or headborough and yet it has a collegiate church takes up a large space of ground and including the suburbs or that part of the town on the other side of the bridge it is said to contain above  0000 people  the increase of buildings at manchester within these few years is a confirmation of the increase of people for here as at liverpoole and as at froom in somersetshire the town is extended in a surprising manner abundance of newbuilt streets are added as also a new church dedicated to st anne and they talk of founding another and a fine new square by which means the town is almost double to what it was some years ago  so that you have here an open village which is greater and more populous than many nay than most cities in england neither york lincoln chester salisbury winchester worcester gloucester nor norwich itself can come up to it and for lesser cities two or three put together would not equal it such as peterborough ely and carlisle or such as bath wells and litchfield and some others  the town of manchester boasts of four extraordinary foundations a college an hospital a freeschool and a library all very well supported  the college was the charity of thomas west lord delaware who being but the cadet of the family was bred a scholar took orders and became rector of the parish which he enjoyed many years but by the decease of his elder brother without heirs succeeding to his honor and estate he founded the college in the year      the pope in consideration that the family was likely to be extinct is said to have allowed him to marry on his performing so beneficial a penance it was dedicated to the virgin mary and the two patron saints of france and england st denis and st george  this foundation escaping the general ruin under henry viii was dissolved      in the first year of king edward vi after this it was refounded by queen mary and then anew by queen elizabeth anno      by the name of christs church in manchester and last of all it was refounded by king charles i anno      consisting then of one warden four fellows two chaplains four singing men and four choristers incorporating them as they were by queen elizabeth by the name of the wardens and fellows of christs church in manchester the statutes for the same being drawn up by archbishop laud  the visitor of this collegiate church is the bishop of chester and his late majesty king george i having made dr peploe bishop of chester who at the same time was warden of the church the visitatorial power and the wardenship being incompatible an act passed anno      impowering his majesty to be the visitor whenever the warden of manchester happened to be bishop of chester  the hospital was founded by humphrey chetham esquire and incorporated by king charles ii designed by the said bountiful benefactor for the maintenance of  0 poor boys out of the town and parish of manchester and some other neighboring parishes but it is enlarged since to the number of  0 by the governors of the said hospital who have improved the revenues of it  the said founder also erected a very fair and spacious library which is furnished with a competent stock of choice and valuable books and daily increasing with the income of     l per annum settled to buy books for ever and to afford a competent salary for a library keeper there is also a large school for the hospital boys where they are daily instructed and taught to read and write  the public school was founded a d      by hugh oldham d d bishop of exeter and the revenues left by him are of late very much increased and the school has been suitably improved from them  besides these public benefactions and endowments there have been several other considerable sums of money and annual revenues left and bequeathed to the poor of the said town who are thereby with the kindness and charity of the present inhabitants competently provided for without starving at home or being forced to seek relief abroad  as for the antiquity of the place it is the mancunium of the romans and what is now called knockcastle was the site of the roman castrum and many antiquities have been found here the foundation of the castle wall and ditch still remain in castlefield as some time called  the new church i have mentioned was finished about the year      by voluntary subscriptions the choir is alcovefashion and the pilasters painted of lapis lazuli color the old church is very large and has three rows of neat pillars they have looms that work    laces at a time an invention they borrowed from the dutch for the space of three miles upwards they have no less than  0 watermills the town stands chiefly on a rock and across the river the large town as it may be called is named salthorp  the antiquity of the manufacture is indeed worth taking notice of which though we cannot trace it by history we have reason to believe began something earlier than the woollen manufactures in other parts of england of which i have spoken so often because the cotton might itself come from the mediterranean and be known by correspondents in those counties when that of wool was not pushed at because our neighbors wrought the goods and though they bought the wool from england yet we did not want the goods whereas without making the cotton goods at home our people could not have them at all and that necessity which is the mother of invention might put them upon this and without such necessity ignorance and necessity prevented the other  the river irwell runs close by manchester and receives the little river irke just above on the north and northeast side there is a very firm but ancient stone bridge over the irwell which is built exceeding high because this river though not great yet coming from the mountainous part of the country swells sometimes so suddenly that in one nights time they told me waters would frequently rise four or five yards and the next day fall as hastily as they rose  about eight miles from manchester northwest lies bolton we saw nothing remarkable in it but that the cotton manufacture reached hither though the place did not like manchester seem increasing  here the old earl of derby was beheaded oct         for proclaiming king charles ii  as i have noted above we turned east here and came to bury a small market town on the river roch which is the utmost bound of the cotton manufacture which flourishes so well at manchester etc and here the woollen manufacture of coarse sorts called halfthicks and kersies begins which imploys this and all the villages about it  from thence we went to rochdale a market town of good traffic a larger and more populous town than bury it lies under the hills called blackstone edge which having mentioned at my entrance this way into yorkshire i must now go back again to the sea coast for i took my course that way up to preston and lancaster in this journey having traveled thus far from liverpoole in my former journey to halifax etc but must first observe that there are on this eastern side of the county northward of rochdale the towns of haslington burnley and coln which lie just under the mountains and likewise blackburn and clithero a little west of them all which being merely market towns and of no other note i shall say no more of them other than that clithero stands upon the ribble and is the most considerable and that at coln and burnley have been discovered a great many roman coins  i take wigan first in my way back to the sea coast it lies on the high postroad to lancaster this town has a good market and is noted for its manufacture in coverlids rugs blankets and other sort of bedding furniture and likewise for pitcoal and ironwork  between wigan and bolton in the estate of sir roger bradshaw is found great plenty of what they call canel or candle coal the like of which is not to be seen in britain or perhaps in the world by putting a lighted candle to them they are presently in a flame and yet hold fire as long as any coals whatever and burn more or less as they are placed in the grate flat or edgewise they are smooth and sleek when the pieces part from one another and will polish like alabaster a lady may take them up in a cambrick hankerchief and they will not soil it though they are as black as the deepest jet they are the most pleasant and agreeable fuel that can be found but are so remote from london that the carriage makes them too dear for common use we saw some of them at warrington too but all from the same pits  i must not pass over the burning well as it is called near wigan the account of which take in the words of mr camdens continuator within a mile and a half of wigan is a well which does not appear to be a spring but rather rainwater at first sight there is nothing about it that seems extraordinary but upon emptying it there presently breaks out a sulphurous vapor which makes the water bubble up as if it boiled a candle being put to it it presently takes fire and burns like brandy the flame in a calm season will continue a whole day by the heat whereof they can boil eggs meat etc though the water itself be cold by this bubbling the water does not increase but is only kept in motion by the sudden halitus of the vapors breaking out the same water taken out of the well will not burn as neither the mud upon which the halitus has beat    dr leigh in his natural history of lancashire not only describes it but accounts very judiciously for the thing itself and by it for the warmth of all hot baths  on the same road a little south stands newton which had once a market but is now difused it is only noted for a very eminent charityschool founded in   0  by one hornby a yeoman of the same place the poorer sort of children are taught to read write and cast accounts and have dinners every schoolday besides there are also ten boys and ten girls who lodge in an hospital contiguous to the school where they are provided with all other necessaries till    years old the fund for this charity was  000 l a large sum for a yeoman to give  from hence we passed to ormskirk west toward the seacoast it is a market town that has a good inlandtrade but we saw nothing remarkable here but the monuments of some of the ancient family of the stanleys before they were ennobled and here they still continue to bury the family whose seat is called latham not far from this town to which belongs a very large estate and a fine park latham house is noted for having been gallantly defended in the late civil wars by a woman the lady charlotte countess of derby who held it to the last extremity against the parliament forces which could never reduce her to capitulate but kept the place gloriously till she was relieved by prince rupert it was however ruined in a second siege and is now sold out of the family and in possession of thomas bootle esquire who is building a magnificent house there  fernby a village lies near the seaside in the marshy grounds where they dig turf that serves both for fire and candle these marshy grounds extend a great way north up beyond eccleston and almost up to preston on the edge of it eastward is marton mere which has been very large but much of it is now drained  eccleston is a market town where nothing remarkable is to be seen nor at charley a town of the same kind which lies a little northeast of it  preston stands next a corporate mayor town having three weekly markets well supplied and frequented it is a large fine town situated on the ribble it is pretty full of people but not like liverpoole or manchester for we now come beyond the trading part of the county but though there is no manufacture the town being honored with the court of chancery and the officers of justices for lancaster is full of gentlemen attorneys proctors and notaries the process of law being here of a different nature from that in other places by reason that it is a duchy and county palatine and has particular privileges of its own the people are gay here though not perhaps the richer for that but it has on this account obtained the name of proud preston here is a great deal of good company but not so much they say as was before the late bloody action with the northern rebels not that the battle hurt many of the immediate inhabitants but the consequences of it so severely affected many families thereabout that they still retain the remembrance of it  not far from preston is ribchester supposed to be the bretonomacum of the ancients a town which in its flourishing state was said to be the richest in christendom so many pieces of antiquity have been dug up in its neighborhood that it was most probably a place of great importance among the ancient romans  between the ribble and a little river some miles south of lancaster the land elbows out in the form of a semicircle into the sea and this tract they call the fieldlands in which is a small market town called kirkham only remarkable for a good free school which has three masters  poulton is another market town in the same tract very convenient in its situation for trade being near the mouth of the river wire we followed the postroad and passed through garstang which stands upon it about midway between preston and lancaster and is of no other note than having a market and so leaving wiredale forest on our right we arrived at  lancaster the county town situate near the mouth of the river lone or lune the town is ancient and has little else to recommend it than that and to have given title to many branches of the royal family of england it has a decayed castle and a more decayed port not capable of receiving ships of any considerable burden the bridge has five arches and is handsome and strong but here is little or no trade and few people it surprised me to hear that there are not above  0 parishes in all this large county but many of them are consequently very large and there are above   0 chapels of ease no less than    of which are in one parish  the castle of lancaster is now the county gaol and the assizes are held in it the town has only one parish church which is fair and spacious  it is governed by a mayor etc to whom edw iii granted the privilege that pleas and sessions in the county should be held nowhere but at lancaster it is the longovicum of the romans who have had a station here on the steepest side of the hill below the church hangs a piece of a roman wall called werywall derived as camden thinks from the british word caerwirdd a green city from the verdure of the hills  as we came along the seaside we observed a kind of strange crows whose bodies are blue and heads and wings black  not far from lancaster at the foot of a high hill called warton crag on the top of which is a beacon stands an agreeable little obscure town named warton upon the side of a lake where is a good grammar school with accommodations and a library for the benefit of the masters which together with an hospital for six poor men was founded and endowed by dr hutton then bishop of durham in      who was afterward translated to york which certainly must have been then a bishopric of very great value to have induced him to quit durham for it notwithstanding its being an archbishopric and the title of grace annexed to its prelate here is also a very neatbuilt church  higher up north toward the extremity of the county next westmorland is hornby castle upon the river ln which is an excellent building the seat of the lords of monteagle a branch of the stanleys and since of the parkers one of whom marrying into that family had in king james is time the same title conferred on him and twas this nobleman who discovered the powder plot  this part of the country seemed very strange and dismal to us after coming from the south side which is so rich and fertile that it is noted for showing the largest breed of cows and oxen in the kingdom whose bulk as well as horns are of such a magnitude as is very astonishing besides their fine spotted deer which are said to be peculiar to that part of the county  here among the mountains our curiosity was frequently moved to inquire what high hill this was or that and we soon were saluted with that old verse in camden ingleborough pendlehill and penigent are the highest hills between scotland and trent indeed they were all in my judgment of a stupendous height but in a country all mountainous and full of high hills it was not easy for a traveller to judge which was highest  as these hills were lofty so they had an aspect of terror here were no rich pleasant valleys between them as among the alps no lead mines and veins of rich ore as in the peak no coalpits as in the hills about halifax but all barren and wild and of no use either to man or beast indeed here were formerly as far back as the time of queen elizabeth some copper mines and they wrought them to good advantage but whether the vein of ore failed or what else was the reason we know not but they are all given over long since and this part of the country yields little or nothing at all  west of hornby castle is a considerable tract of ground which is part of this county and runs north parallel with the west side of westmorland and the west side of cumberland and on the south it runs out in a promontory into the sea it is called fourness we passed over the sands into it which are very dangerous and unpassable without guides who are kept here for that purpose at the expense of the government it contains besides villages four market towns called cartmel dalton ulverston and howkshead but are of no great note it is very mountainous and full of lakes or meres the largest is winander mere which makes the utmost northern bound of this tract of ground as of this shire it is famous for producing the charfish seldom found unless it be at ulleswater bordering on westmorland and in north wales as i have mentioned before it is a curious fish and as a dainty is potted and sent far and near by way of present it must needs be a great rarity since the quantity they take even here is but small mr camdens continuator calls it very happily the golden alpine trout this mere is    miles in circumference  0 in length and two in diameter and the bottom is paved as it were with one continued rock  lancashire as has been said is a county palatine and was wont to give title of duke to a branch of the royal family and till the two roses the white and red were united in the marriage of henry vii of the lancaster line with elizabeth heiress of the house of york these two branches of the royal family by their different pretensions to the crown gave occasion to the wars and confusions which for many years made england a scene of blood and desolation three successive princes hen iv v and vi were of the lancaster line and the latter lost his crown and life as did his princely son to edward iv of the house of york whose two sons being murdered by their uncle richard iii and he himself killed at bosworthfield the lancaster line was again restored in henry vii who married the heiress of the house of york as has been said  lancashire witches are so much a phrase that i have reserved to this place to mention that an act passed the  th of his present majesty king george ii to rescue those poor old creatures who by the ignorance and superstition of the rustic rabble were styled witches from the terror of the laws which though in some sort looked upon as obsolete were nevertheless in force against them and had given too much occasion till within these few years past that the trial and acquittal of jane wenman as i have mentioned in p     vol ii discouraged the wild fury and superstitious ignorance of the vulgar for persecuting poor wretches whose age and infirmities as well as miserable poverty were enough one would have thought to entitle them to pity rather than to the barbarous usage they were wont to meet with  this act repeals the statute made in the first year of the reign of that witchmaking prince it is well known that this act was ssed in compliment to the kings opinion of devils and witch and to the book he wrote entitled demonology  king james i who showed himself no more in this than in other actions of his life a conjurer entitled an act against conjuration witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits and also repeals an act of the parliament of scotland anents witchcrafts etc  and here we may be allowed to give a caution to many of our fair readers as well as to the lower class of fortunecasters by coffeegrounds etc for by this act persons pretending to tell fortunes and to discover lost or stolen goods by virtue of any occult art or science shall be imprisoned a year and once every quarter of that year be pilloryd and obliged to find security for their good behavior at the pleasure of the court in which conviction shall pass and here let me be further indulged to observe that certain married ladies who may incur the penalty of this act may be still worse off than maidens because perhaps their husbands can the least of all others be expected to be bound for their requisite good behavior  i now entered westmorland a county eminent only for being the wildest most barren and frightful of any that i have passed over in england or in wales the west side which borders on cumberland is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains which in the language of the country are called fells and these are called fourness fells from the promontory which i just mentioned and an abbey built also in ancient times called fourness the whole county is divided into the barony of kendal which is very mountainous and in the diocese of chester and the barony of westmorland a large champaign country in the diocese of carlisle  it must be owned however that here are some very pleasant manufacturing towns and consequently populous  the manufacture in which the people are employed are chiefly woollen cloths especially at kirkbylonsdale and kendal  kendal is a rich and populous town has a free school well endowed and drives a great trade in woollen cloth cottons druggets serges hats and stockens  over the river ken whereon kendal stands are two bridges of stone and another of wood at some small distance from the last are to be seen the ruins of a castle which was the birthplace of catharine parr the sixth wife of henry viii the church is fair and spacious and there are two chapels of ease to it near the churchyard stands a fair public school whence a certain number of scholars are elected to queenscollege oxon it gives title of duchess to erengard schulemberg a lady of prime consequence in the reign of king george i  lonsdale or kirkbylonsdale is a large town has a fair church stone bridge and a good trade for cloth and gives title of viscount to the noble family of louther  the upper or northern part of the county has two manufacturing towns called kirkbystephen and appleby the last is the capital of the county has a free school and hospital and is the only town in the county that sends members to parliament a great manufacture of yarn stockens is carried on at kirkbystephen  my lord lonsdale of the family of louther had a very noble and ancient seat at louther and upon the river louther which all together add a dignity to the family and are tests of its antiquity the house was beautiful but the stables were the wonder of england being esteemed the largest and finest that any nobleman or gentleman in britain is master of and his lordship breeds as good running horses and hunters as most in england but the house was of late unfortunately burnt down and all its fine pictures and furniture consumed and is not yet rebuilt  near the river louther is a spring which ebbs and flows several times in a day  in this county the noble family of wharton had their seat in a place of the same name  when we entered at the south part of this county i began indeed to think of merionethshire and the mountains of snowden in north wales seeing nothing round me in many places but unpassable hills whose tops covered with snow seemed to tell us all the pleasant part of england was at an end the great winander mere extending itself like a sea on the west side from north bridge on the south where it contracts itself again into a river up to gresemere north and is the boundary of the county as i have said on that side and the english apennines as mr camden calls the mountains of yorkshire north riding lie like a wall of brass on the other and indeed in the most literal sense they are so for it is the opinion of the most skilful and knowing people in the county that they are full of inexhaustible mines of copper which is convertible into brass and a quantity of gold in them also nay of late years they worked at some copper mines here but the ore lies so deep and is so hard to come at that they did not seem to go cheerfully on  but notwithstanding the terrible aspect of the hills when we had passed by kendal and descended from the frightful mountains the flat country began to show itself and we soon found the north and northeast part of the county to be pleasant rich fruitful and if compared to the other part may be said to be populous the river eden the last river of england on this side as the tyne is on the other rises in this part out of the side of a prodigious high mountain called mowill hill or wildbore fell which you please after which it runs through the middle of this vale which as i said before is a very agreeable and pleasant country or perhaps seems to be so the more in comparison with the horrid height and narrowness of the eastern and southern parts an act passed some years ago to make this river navigable in which the neighboring country find great advantage  in the vale and on the bank of this river stands appleby or apulby the abalaba of the ancients once a flourishing city now a scattering decayed and halfdemolished town the fatal effects of the ancient inroads of the scots who used to make frequent incursions on this county and became several times masters of this town and at length burnt it to the ground a blow it has not yet recovered  there are not many seats of the nobility in this part though several ancient families receive their names from hence as strickland from the lands of strickland wharton now extinct from whartonhall louther from the river louther warcop of warcop langdale of langdale musgrave from musgrave etc  the roman highway which i have so often mentioned and which in my last letter i left at leeminglane and peersbridge in the north riding of york enters this county from rearcross or reecross upon stanmore and crossing it almost due east and west goes through appleby passing the eden a little north from perith at an ancient roman station called brovoniacum where was a large and stately stone bridge but now the great road leads to the left hand to perith in going to which we first pass the eden at a very good stone bridge called louther bridge and then the elnot over another  perith or penrith called by the romans verterae is a handsome market town populous and well built and for an inland town has a very good share of trade it was unhappily possessed by the late party of scots highland rebels when they made that desperate push into england which ended at preston in the moor or heath on the north part of this town the militia of the county making a brave appearance and infinitely outnumbering the highlanders were drawn up yet with their usual bravery they ran away as soon as the scots began to advance to charge them and never fired a gun leaving the town at their mercy however to do justice to the rebels they offered no injury to the town only quartered in it one night took what arms and ammunition they could find and advanced toward kendal  in westmorland not far from the river louther is a row of pyramidal stones eight or nine feet high pitched directly in a row for a mile together and placed at equal distances from each other  from hence in one stage through a country full of castles for almost every gentlemans house is a castle we came to carlisle a small but well fortified city the frontier place and key of england on the west sea as berwick upon tweed is on the east in both which there have been for many years i might say ages strong garrisons kept to check the invading scots from below this town the famous picts wall began which crossed the whole island to newcastle upon tyne which was built upon the following occasion  when the romans settled here by force of arms they were always harassed by the picts on the side of scotland to stop their inroads the emperor adrian caused a wall of earth to be built extending from the german to the irish sea the space of  0 miles or    french leagues and caused it to be palisadod anno     severus the emperor built it up of stone with turrets from mile to mile and kept a garrison therein but the picts nevertheless broke in through this wall more than once at last aetius a roman general rebuilt it of brick in   0 but twas not long before it was pulled down by the picts it was eight feet thick and    feet high from the ground some part of it is still to be seen both in northumberland and cumberland  here also the great roman highway just before named has its end this being the utmost station of the roman soldiers on this side  but before i go on to speak of carlisle i must return to the sea coast which in this northern county is more remarkable than that of lancashire though the other is extended much farther in length for here are some towns of good trade whereas in lancashire liverpoole excepted there is nothing of trade to be seen upon the coast  the first place i shall mention is ravenglass in the south end of the county which runs between fourness and the sea it is a well built sea port and market town upon the river esk and on each side of it run down to the sea two other small rivers which together with the sea make a good harbor for ships and surrounds three parts of the town which occasions a pretty good trade to it  the cape or headland of st bees derived from st bega an irish female saint still preserves its name  in the town is a very good free school founded by archbishop grindal who was born here it was very well endowed by him and the charity much increased by the late dr lamplugh archbishop of york dr smith bishop of carlisle sir john louther and others  the library annexed to this foundation is very valuable and still increasing by several gifts daily added to it though the parish is vastly large the vicarage is very poorly endowed  near st bees stands a little market town called egremont noted only for its ancient castle and barons and for losing their privilege of returning members  under this shore higher up north and near the cape is the town of whitehaven grown up by the encouragement of the louther family from a small place to be very considerable by the coal trade which is so much increased of late that it is the most eminent port in england for it next newcastle for the city of dublin and all the towns of ireland on that coast and some parts of scotland and the isle of man are wholly supplied from hence it is frequent in time of war or upon occasion of cross winds to have  00 sail of ships at a time go from this place to dublin laden with coals and sir james louther particularly is said to send from hence to ireland annually as many coals as bring him in near  0000 l a year  this increase of shipping has led them on to merchandising but the town is but of few years standing in trade for mr camden does not so much as name the place and his continuator says very little of it  and indeed the town must be allowed to owe principally its flourishing condition to two acts of parliament one of the  th the other of the   th of queen anne by virtue of which the harbor was so considerably deepened and improved and such strong and substantial moles and bulwarks erected that ships which before were liable to be driven and cast away on the rocks and shoals on that coast could lie in safety and be secure from the violence of the sea the happy success of these works encouraged the town to apply to parliament for powers still farther to improve the good design that so by enlarging the moles and works and extending them to low water mark such depth might be obtained that the largest ships belonging to the town might sail in and out of the harbor at neap tides and that other ships frequenting these seas might sail in at halfflood and accordingly an act passed for this laudable purpose in the self      0 which will prebably effectuate these good ends and not only preserve the lives of many mariners but still further improve the trade and navigation of this already flourishing town the same act provides likewise for the repair of the roads about and leading to whitehaven which were become ruinous and bad by the great use made of them since the improvements made in the harbor for before that they were very narrow and seldom made use of by carts and wheelcarriages all these advantages and increase of trade have occasioned a new church to be lately built at whitehaven here is likewise a good trade for salt  still a little higher to the north is moresby where it is supposed has been a roman fort there appearing a great many ruins of fortifications along the sea coast and other antiquities  about ten miles northeast from whitehaven lies cockermouth between two hills upon the little river cocker just where it falls into the derwent and is almost encompassed by the two rivers the former runs through it and is joined again by two bridges it is a town of good trade and well built it has a castle on one hill and a fair church on the other it is about    miles from the sea and vessels of good burden may securely come up to it the derwent is famous for its springing out of those hills called derwent fells where the ancient copper mines were found in queen elizabeths time and in which it was said there was a large quantity of gold but they are discontinued since some say because gold being found among the ore the queen claimed the royalty and so nobody would work them but this is rather a reason why they should have applied to the search with more vigor therefore the more probable cause is that the charge of working them was too great for the profits  a little east of cockermouth stands keswick a little market town in decay inhabited chiefly by miners who have their smeltinghouses here there being near this place mines of blacklead which turn to very good account and i think are the only mines of the kind in britain  here we saw skiddaw which is there reported to be the highest hill in england it seems the higher because it is not surrounded with other mountains like most of other counties as at cheviot penigent and other places from the top of skiddaw one sees plainly into scotland and quite into dumfriesshire and farther  the duke of somerset is chief lord of cockermouth in right of his late duchess the only heiress of the ancient family of the piercies earls of northumberland  the castles and great houses of this estate fall to ruin as indeed all the castles in this county do for the two kingdoms being now united into one strong holds are of no more use here than in any other part of the kingdom i think they told us the duke has no less than    castles in this county and in northumberland  this derwent is noted for trout and also for very good salmon which from workington a fishingtown at the mouth of this river they carry fresh as they take them up to london upon horses which changing often go night and day without intermission and as they say outgo the post so that the fish come very sweet and good to london where the extraordinary price they yield from two shillings and sixpence to four shillings per pound pays very well for the carriage they do the same from carlisle  jerby now a considerable market town stands northeast of cockermouth it is supposed to be the arbeia of the ancients  from the mouth of the derwent to that of the elen is supposed to have been fortified by the romans to prevent the landing of the scots and irish who infested these coasts for here have been several ruins of fortifications discovered and some of them since camdens time at elenborough it is said the first cohort of dalmatians were garrisoned where are great remains of them still to be seen old vaults opened altars stones and statues with inscriptions dug up on them and at wigton a small market town further north in the forest of allerdale are several altars pitched which they say were brought from elenborough and old carlisle but if i was to dwell upon antiquities i should find work enough in this county and therefore must refer you to such writers as have treated of them  in whitfield park at the borders of this county they show you a hawthorn tree against which the heads of a stag and a dog were formerly nailed up in memory of a famous chase it seems the dog not a greyhound as mr camdens continuator calls it but a stanch buckhound singly chased a stag from this park as far as the red kirk in scotland which they say is sixty miles at least and back again to the same place where being both spent the stag exerting his last force leaped the park pales and died on the inside the hound attempting to leap after him had not strength enough to get over and fell back and died on the outside just opposite the heads of both were nailed upon the tree and underneath this distich on them the hounds name it seems was hercules hercules killed hartagreese and hartagreese killed hercules   in the same park were three oak trees which were called the three brether the least of which was    yards about but two of them being quite gone and only the stump of the other remaining i did not think it worth my time to visit such a decayed curiosity  west of the hawthorn tree and upon the old roman way is the famous column called the countess pillar the best and most beautiful piece of its kind in britain it is a fine column of freestone curiously wrought and enchasd and in some places painted it has an obelisk on the top several coats of arms and other ornaments in proper places all over it with dials also on every side and a brass plate with the following inscription in capital letters this pillar was erected anno      by the right honorable anne countess dowager of pembroke and sole heir of the right honorable george earl of cumberland etc for a memorial of her last parting in this place with her good and pious mother the right honorable margaret countess dowager of cumberland the second of april      in memory whereof she also left an annuity of four pounds to be distributed to the poor within this parish of brougham every second day of april for ever upon the stone table here by  this countess of pembroke had a noble and great estate in this county and a great many fine old seats all which she repaired and beautified and dwelt sometimes at one and sometimes at another for the benefit of her tenants and of the poor whom she always made desirous of her presence constantly relieving them by her bounty and hospitality but those estates are since that time gone into other families particularly into that of the earl of thanet who has great estates in westmorland  this lady was of the family of clifford she had no less than four castles in this county of which pendragon castle was the chief which is a fine building to this day  penrith is accounted the second town in the county for wealth and trade it is large and well built has a very good market for all sorts of commodities and beasts the markethouse is convenient and spacious the church is large and noble the west side was defended with a royal castle though now in ruins in the churchyard we saw two pillars    or    feet asunder and the lowest of them    feet high though they seem equal the people told us that they were the monument of sir owen caesar but there is no inscription upon them this sir owen they tell us was a champion of mighty strength and of gigantick stature and so he was to be sure if as they say he was as tall as one of the columns and could touch both pillars with his hands at the same time they relate no other great actions of him but that he killed robbers and destroyed wild boars  on the northside of the vestry of this church is erected in the wall an ancient square stone with a memorial intimating that in the year      there was a dreadful plague in those parts in which there died in kendal   00 persons in penrith      in richmond   00 in carlisle       by this account it should seem that every one of those towns had separately more people than the city of carlisle or else the distemper was not so pestilential there and that kendal which is the only manufacturing town of them was the most populous  we did not go into the grotto on the bank of the river eden of which mention is made by camdens continuator the people informing us that the passage was blocked up with earth so i must be content with telling you that it seems to have been a lurkingplace for robbers in old time a place of strength it could not be for its security seems to have consisted solely in its secrecy it had certainly been worth seeing had it been passable the entry is long and dark but whether strait or crooked i cannot say the iron gates leading to it are gone nor is there any sign of them or what they were hung to  higher up on the eden the east side of the county is kirkoswald an indifferent market town that has nothing of note and brampton stands n e of carlisle on the river itching about a mile beyond the picts wall which has likewise nothing worth remarking saving an hospital built by the lady carlisle grandmother to the present earl for six poor men and as many women  at burgh upon the sands a little distance from carlisle is the monument of our victorious prince edward i who having so far subdued the scots as to bring away the sacred stone at scone abbey whereon their kings used to be crowned died here in his camp on his march against them like a true soldier guarding his frontiers with his latest breath in memory of him there was afterward erected a fair square pillar nine yards and a half high with these inscriptions on three sides  on the west side memoriae aeternae edvardi i regis angliae long clarissimi qui in belli apparatu contra scotos occupatus hic in castris obiit   julii a d  0  on the south side nobilissimus princeps henricus howard dux norfolciae comes marshall angliae comes arund etc ab edvardo i rege angliae oriundus p      on the north side johannes aglionby j c f beneath tho langstone fecit       caerlisle the lugovallum or rather brovoniacum of the romans is situated exceedingly pleasant by the picts wall and guarded by three rivers by the eden on the north by the peterel on the east and on the west by the caude it is a place of great antiquity being first builtby an ancient british prince named luel and from him called caer luel i e luels town to which it retains an affinity of sound to this day it has suffered the fate of most frontier towns been taken retaken burnt and destroyed several times by the scots danes and norwegians and lay once in its ruins for near  00 years till william rufus rebuilt it who sent a colony of southern englishmen to it and who is said likewise to have built the castle henry i dignified it with an episcopal see and fortified it as a proper barrier against the scots  the cathedral church is a venerable old pile but seems to have been built at two different times or as it were rebuilt the upper part being much more modern than the lower a great part of it was built by st david king of scotland who held this county together with westmorland and northumberland in vassalage from the crown of england he and many of his successors were great benefactors to it and nominated several of the bishops but almost the whole nave or west part of it was demolished by the scots in the civil wars there is another church called st cuthberts  king henry viii fortified this city against the scots and built an additional castle to it on the east side which camden calls a citadel on the northwest is a garrison the city has three gates and the walls round it are so thick that three men may walk abreast on them within the parapet over the eden is a bridge which soon lets you into scotland the limits not being above six miles off for the south part of it on this side comes at least  0 miles farther into england than at berwick  carlisle is a wealthy and populous place and the houses are well built but it is not very large here flourishes a good trade in fustians  i made a trip when i was in these parts to parton in this county which i the rather mention because of the improvements made in its harbor of late years by virtue of acts of parliament made for that purpose  for in the fourth and fifth of the late queen anne an act had passed for enlarging the piers and harbor of that town but by the negligence or death of trustees the works intended by the act were not carried to effect this proving a great disappointment to the inhabitants who had built houses on a prospect of a considerable trade in exportation of coals and other commodities of the county in the year      another act passed for rebuilding the said piers and harbor in consequence of this act the pier was rebuilt and the harbor made capable of receiving several small ships and a trade for coals to ireland and other parts commenced this gave encouragement for another act which passed anno      to enlarge the term for    years after the expiration of the former in order to make the harbor still more complete for the reception of ships of greater burden and to enlarge the river cleanse the harbor and to bring into it a small brook called maresbybeck which runs near it all which will be of great use to the place as well as to trade and navigation in general  in this northern county are more noted roman antiquities found than almost in any other it has a lake called ulleswater noted for producing the excellent fish called char almost peculiar to it and to winandermere wrynose one of its highest hills is remarkable for its three shire stones a foot distance each one in cumberland one in westmorland and the third in lancashire  near salkeld in this county is a trophy erected vulgarly called long meg and her daughters consisting of    stones long meg    feet above ground and the rest but  0  this having been a frontier county the ancient houses of the nobility and gentry are built for the most part castlewise and are called castles thus greystock castle and drumbough castle belong to the duke of norfolk cockermouth castle to the duke of somerset naworth castle to the earl of carlisle dacre castle to the late earl of sussex corby castle mr howards and here i must be a little more particular on the last which deserves the observation of the curious corby castle is situated about four miles s e of carlisle and is the seat of the said mr howard a descendant from the duke of norfolks family the building is of stone neat but plain the entrance to this house is by a large square courtyard on the right hand are the gardens and on the left offices for the servants and stabling for horses it is plentifully watered by springs in several large reservoirs made about the house which stands on the precipice of a high rock which is in the backpart about  00 feet high in this rock is cut a regular pair of stairs of about six feet wide with all their ornaments down to the bottom as you descend these stairs you pass by several rooms hewn out of the rock of about    feet square which have no other furniture than tables and seats made out of the stone at the bottom of those stairs you ascend another pair about  0 feet high which leads to a terrace made in form of a semicircle by the side of which runs the river eden having a pair of stairs to take water at the terrace presents a fine view of another part of the rock of equal height with the former from the top of which is placed a cascade so wonderfully curious that i know nothing like it it is at least  00 feet high and the water is broken by the pointed ridges of the rock into so many various shapes and the springs fly about you in so delightfully rude a manner as to entertain you with a great instance of the power of art in imbellishing nature which is further heightened by a natural cascade effected by this artificial one of which you have a distinct prospect when you arrive at the landingstairs  from hence you have another view of half a mile long of the river on the right hand and a hanging grove of trees just as nature has placed them on the left as you pass along a gravelwalk you see several figures placed there for ornament at the end of the walk is a small banquetingroom with a portico in the front facing this walk it is called tempealter in this river is a weir wellstockd with salmon and other fish on the other side of the river over against the house are the remains of an old castle which is called weatheraltower under which is an hermits cave  westward of lancashire and cumberland lies the isle of man of which i shall take notice among the western isles of scotland see vol iv p      cumberland gives title of duke to his royal highness prince william his majestys second son as it did before to his royal highness george prince of denmark consort of the late queen anne  being now at the utmost extent of england this way i shall conclude my letter with a few observations upon the roads of this part of the united kingdom in general and first of the natural soil in many places where not mended by turnpikes  the soil of all the midland part of england even from sea to sea is of a deep stiff clay or marly earth and it carries a breadth of near  0 miles at least in some places much more nor is it possible to go from london to any part of britain north without crossing this clayey dirty part for example    suppose we had been to take the great northern post road from london to york and so into scotland you have tolerable good ways and hard ground till you reach royston about    miles and to kneesworth a mile farther but from thence you used to enter upon the clays which beginning at the famous arringtonlanes and going on to caxton huntingdon stilton stamford grantham newark tuxford called for its deepness tuxford in the clays hold on till we come almost to bautree which is the first town in yorkshire and there the country is naturally hard and sound being part of shirwood forest    suppose you had been to take the other northern road by st albans dunstable hockley newportpagnel northampton leicester and nottingham or derby after you are passed dunstable which is about  0 miles you used to enter the deep clays which were so surprisingly soft that it was perfectly frightful to travelers and had been the wonder of foreigners how considering the great numbers of carriages which are continually passing with heavy loads those ways have been made practicable from hockley to northampton thence to harborough and leicester and thence to the very banks of trent these terrible clays continue at nottingham you are past them and the forest of shirwood naturally yields a hard and pleasant road for  0 miles together    take the same road as it leads to coventry and from thence to westchester the deep clays reach through all the towns of brickhill fenny and stony stratford towcester daventry hillmorton or dunchurch coventry coleshill and even to birmingham for near  0 miles    if we took the road to worcester it used to be the same through the vale of ailesbury to buckingham and westward to banbury keynton and the vale of evesham where the clays reach with some intermissions even to the bank of severn as they do more northerly quite to westchester  this natural difficulty of the soil through all the midland country where the carriage at the same time was so prodigious and made some of the highways in a manner impassable necessarily brought the country to apply to parliament and the consequence has been that turnpikes or tollbars have been set up on the several great roads of england beginning at london and proceeding through almost all those dirty deep roads in the midland counties especially at which turnpikes all carriages droves of cattle and travelers on horseback are obliged to pay an easy toll which bears no comparison with the benefit reaped thereby and it is well worth recording for the honor of the present age that this work has been begun and is in an extraordinary manner carried on and perhaps may in a great measure be completed within our memory as to the worst and most dangerous roads in the kingdom and this is a work of so much general good that certainly no public edifice almshouse hospital or noblemans palace can be of equal value to the country with this nor at the same time more an honor and ornament to it  the benefit of these turnpikes appears now to be so great and the people in all places begin to be so sensible of it that it is incredible what effect it has already had upon trade in the counties where the roads are completely finished even the carriage of goods is abated in some places   d per hundred weight in others    d per hundred which is abundantly more advantage to commerce than the charge paid amounts to and yet at the same time the expense is paid by the carriers too who make the abatement so that the benefit in abating the rate of carriage is wholly and simply the tradesmens not the carriers  yet the advantage is evident to the latter also another way for they can bring more weight with the same number of horses nor are their horses so hardworkd and fatigued with their labor as they were before in which one particular it is acknowleged by the carriers they perform their work with more ease and the masters are at less expense  the advantage is also inexpressible to all other kinds of traveling such as the safety and ease to gentlemen journeying up to london on all occasions whether to the term to parliament to court or on any other necessary occasion  also the riding post as well for the ordinary carrying of the mails as for gentlemen when their occasions require speed is made extremely easy safe and pleasant by this alteration of the roads  the safety of traveling on this occasion is the more to be insisted on because the commissioners for these repairs of the highways do daily order bridges to be repaired and enlarged and new ones built where they find occasion which not only serve to carry the water off where it otherwise often spreads and lies as it were dammd up upon the road and spoils the way but where it rises sometimes by sudden rains to a dangerous height for it is to be observed that there is more hazard and more lives lost in passing or attempting to pass little brooks and streams which are swelled by sudden showers of rain and where passengers expect no stoppage than in passing great rivers where the danger is known and therefore more carefully avoided  in many of these places the commissioners have not only built large and substantial bridges but have set up sluices to stop and open channels to carry off the waters where they used to swell into the highway and i have been told years ago that the several commissioners in the respective districts where they are concerned had then built between  00 and  00 new bridges where there were none before or where the former were small and insufficient to carry the traveller safe over the waters many of these are within a few miles of london especially for example on the great road from london to edgeworth from london to enfield from london to st albans from london to croydon etc  besides the benefits accruing from this laudable method we may add the convenience to those who bring fat cattle especially sheep to london in the winter from the remoter counties of leicester and lincoln where they are bred for before the country graziers were obliged to sell their stocks off in september and october when the roads began to be bad and when they generally sell cheap and the butchers and farmers near london used to engross them and keep them till december and january and then sell them though not an ounce fatter than before for an advanced price to the citizens of london whereas now the roads are in a way to be made everywhere passable the city will be served with mutton almost as cheap in the winter as in the summer or the profit of the advance will be to the country graziers who are the original breeders and take all the pains  this is evidenced to a demonstration in the counties where the roads are already repaired from whence they bring their fat cattle and particularly their mutton in droves from sixty seventy or eighty miles without fatiguing harassing or sinking the flesh of the creatures even in the depth of winter  i might give examples of other branches of inland commerce which are and still will be further altered for the better by this repairing the roads and particularly that of carrying cheese a species of provision so considerable that nothing except that of live cattle can exceed it  this is chiefly made in the three northwest counties of england viz cheshire gloucestershire and warwickshire and the parts adjacent from whence the nation used to be very meanly supplied by reason of the great distance of the country where the cheese is made from those where it is chiefly expended  the cheshire men indeed carry great quantities about by long sea as they call it to london a terrible long and sometimes dangerous voyage being through the irish chanel round all wales cross the bristol chanel round the lands end of cornwall and up the english chanel to the mouth of the thames and so up to london or else by land to burton upon trent and so down that river to gainsborough and hull and so by sea to london  again the gloucestershire men carry all by landcarriage to lechlade and cricklade on the thames and so carry it down the river to london  but the warwickshire men have no watercarriage at all or at least not till they have carried it a long way by land to oxford but as their quantity is exceeding great and they supply not only the city of london but also the counties of essex suffolk norfolk cambridge huntingdon hertford bedford and northampton the gross of their carriage is by mere dead draught and they carry it either to london by land which is full  00 miles and so the london cheesemongers supply the said counties of essex suffolk and norfolk besides kent and sussex and surrey by sea and river navigation or the warwickshire men carry it by land once a year to sturbridge fair whence the shopkeepers of all the inland country abovenamed come to buy it in all which cases landcarriage being long when the ways were generally bad it made it very dear to the poor who are the chief consumers  i could also enlarge here upon the convenience that accrues to the trade in fresh fish from the sea coasts to the inner parts of the kingdom whither when the ways are bad they cannot carry them sweet this of course must greatly increase the consumption of fish in its season and employ a considerable number of horses and men as well as increase the shipping by that consumption  by this i do not only mean the carrying of herrings and mackerel to london as is practiced on the coasts of sussex and kent in particular and bringing salmon from the remote rivers of severn and trent but the carrying of herrings mackerel and sprats in their season and whitings and flat fish at other times from the coasts of yarmouth swole ipswich colchester malden etc and supplying all the inland counties with them sweet and good even as far as northampton and coventry etc  i might give examples where the herrings which are not the best fish to keep used even before these reparations were set on foot to be carried to those towns and up to warwick birmingham tamworth and stafford and though they frequently stunk before they got thither yet the people were so eager for them that they bought them up at a dear rate whereas when the roads are everywhere good they will come in less time by at least two days in six of what they used to do and  00 times the quantity will be consumed  these and many others are the advantages to our inland commerce which we may have room to hope for upon the general repair of the roads and which i shall have great occasion to speak of again in my northern circuit  nor are the laudable undertakings which have of late years been set on foot for rendering many of the inland rivers of this kingdom navigable a less profitable improvement to the public many of which have been completed and others are completing according to acts of parliament already passed for that purpose many of which i have taken notice of in the course of my letters and hardly a session passes but bills are still continued to be brought in for making others navigable all which must greatly tend with the repairing of the public roads as above to increase the trade of this nation  but it is time to conclude this letter which i shall do with the following transcription from the famous milton which not unsuitably to the subject i have just been upon thus enumerates the principal rivers of england with their distinguishing characters rivers arise whether thou be the son of utmost tweed or ouse or gulphy dun or trent who like some earthborn giant spreads his thirty arms along the indented meads or sullen mole that runs underneath or severn swift guilty of maidens death or rocky avon or of sgy lee or coaly tyne or anti hallowed dee or humber loud that keeps the scvthians name or medway smooth or royaltowerd them   i am sir your humble sant  letter v giving a brief account of the isles of jersey guernsey alderney and sarke sir that nothing may be wanting to complete this work i shall briefly in this place touch upon the isles of jersey guernsey alderney and sarke which are the only remains of the dukedom of normandy now in possession of the english crown and first of jersey  various names have been affixed to this island in the time of the romans it was named caesarea probably from the dictator who subdued several nations along this tract which conjecture is confirmed by the present name of one of its forts which is le fort de caesar in the north of the island at rosel is an intrenchment preserving the name of la petite cesaree that the romans were here is plain from the remains of an ancient camp near the manor of dilament as also from coins which have been found in different parts of the island particularly one of commodus and two of probus and posthumus all in the parish of st oven its modern appellation is no more than a corruption of its old one jer being a contraction of caesar and ey signifying island q d caesars island augia was a name still elder than the time when the romans were acquainted with the place and supposed to be the original one  the island has sustained several revolutions first by rollo duke of normandy   by the french   by the normans restored   by the uniting of it to the crown of england the inhabitants behaved very valiantly in defense of charles i and his son charles ii but were at last reduced by the irresistible power of the english parliament although they are supposed to have been the last who submitted to the common fate of the times by a capitulation equally advantageous and honorable  we shall now proceed to give as clear an account of the situation and remarkable places of this island as the narrowness of our limits will admit  jersey is computed to be     0 n l and    0 w l from the meridian of london its length is    miles its utmost breadth between six and seven its northside from its lofty cliffs is  0 or  0 fathoms perpendicular from the sea which renders it inaccessible that way but the south is much lower and almost level with the water its form seems to resemble a wedge or a rectangular triangle  the higher lands are diversified by gritty and gravelly stony and rocky fine and sweet mould the lower by heavy deep and rich soil all kinds of forest and fruit trees shrubs roots flowers and herbs flourish here with pulse and corn though their wheat is smaller than english  the decay of tillage so evident in this isle is owing to three causes   the increase of the stocken manufacture which naturally inclined the people to slight the more laborious employment of agriculture   the improvement of navigation and foreign traffic which had the same effect   the culture of cider by converting the arable lands into orchards for that purpose which commodity is the ordinary drink of the inhabitants who are now overstockd with it so that there is hope of their returning to the plough and to their former industry   the increase of enclosures and highways of the latter whereof here are three sorts the first called le chemin du roy or the kings highway sixteen feet in breadth the second le chemin de huit pieds or the eightfoot way which with its sides makes up    feet and the third le chemin de quatre pieds or the fourfoot way for horsecarriages  on the rocks about the island seaweed grows plentifully which is an equivalent for the deficiency of other things useful in husbandry and is the common manure of the land in jersey  here is plenty of good water from the inexhaustible stores of springs gushing from the numerous strata of rocks everywhere conspicuous meat also and butter are equally good and sweet here though the cattle are inferior in size to those elsewhere  the ewes of this isle had four horns but the rams six in camdens time though rarely now to be seen fowl of all kinds are here in great quantities but none of the volatile tribe exceed in beauty the jersey partridge having the bright eyes natural to that bird red legs and variegated feathers the flesh however is not much preferable to that of the common partridge  this island abounds with fish the species of which we may range thus   roughcoated fish such as rousses haus etc the coarsest of all   shell and rockfish among which is the ormer supposed peculiar to these parts and deriving its name which is french from its resemblance to a human ear the inside of the shell is made use of in inlaid works as mother of pearl to the bright color of which it approaches there is no undershell but the fish adheres to the rock with its back and is a solid mass of white pulp very grateful to the taste which it regales like the flesh of land animals in great spring tides at low water mark it is found   flatfish as rays thornbacks soles plaise large turbots etc   scalefish of these one draught of base has equaled a cartload besides which here is the mullet red and gray the vrac or seacarp and the bar an exquisite fish sometimes two feet in length other fish here are which for their singularity we cannot pass by in silence  the gronnard is so called from its grunting noise when taken its head is almost as big as the body and its color is a deep scarlet resembling blood  the lancon or little lance from its shape is never found in the water but in some moving sandbank deserted by the sea when the sand being moved with an iron hook the fish spring up and are caught by handfuls the young men and maids take great delight during the warm summer nights in this sport which is rendered easy to them by the glistering of the prey above the sand this they term aller au lancon it is prepared as an anchovy and welldressd gives an agreeable relish  another odd fish is the sirene which is furnished with teats like a womans  the ugly but harmless and perhaps wholesome animal the toad abounds here as do innoxious creatures of the serpentine kind particularly lizards which gaze on passengers as they lie basking in the sun but the worst of the reptile kind are moles which damage the corn and grass though they compensate that detriment by affording a freer passage to the rain through their latibula  the climate here is in general wholesome though as luxury has gained ground diseases unknown to former ages have been its constant attendants so that it cannot now boast of that character given it by camden that here was no room for the physicians  the rocks are vast and terrible the tides rapid and strong as an evidence of which here is no stillwater at any time as in other parts of the british chanel  the whole island consists of    parishes which are divided into vintaines from the  0 houses which formerly as is said constituted each parish though now some parishes vastly exceed that number cueillettes is the name for these divisions in the parish of st oven alone  but to be more particular   the parish just mentioned contains six cueillettes namely de vincheles des milles de leoville des grontes grande cueillette and petite cueillette the seigneur de st oven has a large pond in the west of the island containing about  0 acres of land wherein are carp of so extraordinary a size as scarce to be equalled in europe some of them being four feet four inches in length part of the great bay of st oven had been a rich vale which was swallowed up by the sea    st peter contains six vintaines which are des angueres du coin varin du doet de st nicolas de la vallee and grande vintaine    in st brelade are four vintaines called des quenves de la moye du coin and de noirmont in this parish stands the town of st aubin the second of the island and from it the bay adjoining derives its name which consists of white sand level and firm and thence the traveling from this town to st helier the capital is rendered smooth and easy and as the church is at a distance and intercepted by a bleak hill the inhabitants who are in plentiful circumstances were building when i was there a convenient chapel by way of contribution the port which is the best and most frequented in jersey has a strong pier carried into the sea which receives and affords a safe harbor for ships here a sixthrate just floats at a dead neap and a ship of  00 tons at all times at halfflood a vessel of   0 tons may find entrance larger ships indeed and men of war must remain in the road where is good anchorage the pier joins to the fort of st aubin which renders the place very defensible these advantages have brought hither many merchants and masters of ships and every monday is held what is improperly called a market for it is rather an exchange where merchants and others meet for transacting affairs of navigation and traffic the houses are mostly new    st mary has two vintaines du nord and du sud in this parish was discovered a spring strongly impregnated with a purging mineral the water of which was approved of by dr charleton an eminent english physician    st laurence contains four vintaines viz du coin motier du coin tourgis du coin es hastains and de la vallee    st john has three vintaines which are du nord du doet de herupe in this parish is a hill called montmado whereon is a rich quarry of excellent stone capable of being cut into regular squares like portland stone    in trinity are five vintaines namely de la ville a l evesque du rondin de rosel des augres and de la croizerie    st helier comprehends four vintaines which are du mont a l abbee du mont au pretre du mont cochon and de la ville the situation of st helier is pleasant as well as commodious having on the southwest the sea with a full prospect of elizabeth castle and of the road for ships to the north are hills which are an excellent defense against the cold and at their feet a flat of meadows inlivend by a pure stream which from hence enters the streets and even the houses so that the water is easily brought up by buckets let down through a trapdoor or from the reservoirs of wells and pumps another huge hill projects in a manner over the town and being a common affords to the cattle herbage and to gentlemen and ladies an agreeable walk with the advantage of an extensive prospect the usual name of this hill is le mont de la ville the unfortunate duke of somerset protector of the king and kingdom had probably intended to protect himself from the malice of his enemies by building a new town here as he did a citadel at alderney both which designs became abortive by his death in st helier at present are about  00 houses disposed into diverse wide and wellpavd streets la cohue royale or the seat of justice stands in a large quadrangle on each side of which are handsome structures here is held every saturday a market or rather a fair whither people flock from all parts of the island to enjoy their friends or transact business in the town live few landed gentlemen but many shopkeepers artificers and retailers of liquor scarce any thing is wanting to the uses of necessity or convenience la halle la boucherie or the shambles is a large room enclosed so that the sight and smell of carcases do not here annoy the eyes and nostrils of people as they do in most country towns the number of inhabitants exclusive of some hundreds in the outvintaines who are parishioners though not townsmen is supposed to amount to two thousand and the church though very capacious by the accession of galleries when i was there was crowded with them    st savior has six vintaines of the following denominations de maufant de sous la hogue des pigneaux de sous l eglise de le grande longueville and de la petite longueville   0 under st martin are comprehended these five vintaines de rosel de la queruee de sous l eglise du fief du roy and de faldoit     gronville comprises four vintaines de la rue des marais de longueville and de la roque     in st clement are three vintaines by name du mont roquier de samarez and grand vintaine in the canal called samarez are great numbers of carp and eel the only fresh water fish in the island  the cueillettes and vintaines are in all    the buildings are all of stone as may well be supposed in a country which is nothing but a huge rock covered with strata of earth the common sort is ragstone the stone on montmado mentioned above is of a reddish white the whiter the better of a fine grain and may be wrought almost as sleek as polished marble the churches and finest edifices are covered with blue slate the ordinary houses are thatched with long wheatstraw  the principal trade is that to newfoundland whither in the year      were sent    ships from thence to proceed to the mediterranean in order to dispose of their fish another branch of trade is that of knit hose or stockens which are every saturday sold at st helier to the merchants and many thousand pairs are made weekly in the island  the language as you may guess from the names of places is french though obsolete and thence to be esteemed barbarous this remark however is not to be extended to their religious worship judicatures or even the conversation of the more polite in all which the pure french is used though this is the original language yet one may observe a pretty good smattering of english even among the lower class of people owing to the intermixture of the soldiers in the garrison at st helier in the church of which town prayers are alternately in french and english  the chief officer who represents the kings person is the governor his excellency at the time when i was there was the right honorable the lord viscount cobham  harliston tower was so called from sir richard harliston governor of the island in the time of king henry vii who built it in mont orgueil castle the great sir walter ralegh bore this high office to which his name does honor  montorgueil is of so great antiquity that no record subsists old enough to determine its origin it is at present slighted and in a ruinous condition and what it was formerly elizabethcastle now is equal to any fortress within the british dominions it is named le chateau de l islet or simply l islet from its situation on a small island in circuit it is little less than a mile in      all the bells in jersey excepting one to each church were sold toward defraying the expense of the building in      the upper ward was erected which is properly queen elizabeths castle every house in the island furnishing four days work the lower ward is king charles is castle and was begun in      during the civil war charlesfort was added and in      the french threatening the place the green was enclosed within a wall  the fort of st aubin is of good use toward clearing the road and for a safeguard to ships within the pier which it secures by its cannon planted on the bastions though in ancient times it was no more than a great tower on a rock thence named la tour  there are five regiments of regular forces on the island which are reviewed every   th of may the anniversary of the restoration  the civil government is administered by a bailly assisted by    jurats  here are diverse monuments of the druidical superstitions which are flat ragstones of vast size and weight raised three or four feet from the ground and sustained by others of less bulk these the natives call poquelayes and are the altars on which sacrifices often human were immolated particularly in the parish of st helier three of them contiguous to each other and on the summit of a place called le rouge bouillon another besides one on st heliers hill another larger near montorgueil castle and near roselhaven on a cliff named le couperon an antiquity seeming to be a little temple of theirs at a place called les lands pallot in the parish of st savior was a rockingstone like that i shall mention in scotland destroyed by the cromwellians erected by the druids probably to awe the people into a belief of their miracles this also has been demolished  here are also monuments of the popish superstition two more particularly the first called la chapelle de notre dame des pas from the blessed virgin who is said to have left the print of her steps on the very spot of the rock whereon the chapel is erected and this too after her body was moulderd into dust the second is termed hoguebie a chapel over a tomb built according to tradition by the disconsolate widow of the seigneur de hambie a norman who fell by treachery in this island and whose loss was so afflicting to his lady that she erected it on purpose to have the melancholy pleasure of seeing the place where her lords corpse was interred from her window in normandy and to procure his soul the great benefit of masses afterward one mabon who had been a pilgrimage to jerusalem took a fancy to lengthen the chapel toward the east and to hollow a place under the altar in order to represent our lords sepulcher this place was made the chief seat of the popish delusion  notwithstanding the prevailing terrors of the papal empire in the days of queen mary the magistrates of jersey had the courage to put to death richard averty a priest and furious prosecutor of the married clergy for murdering his bastard child which he effected without the mothers knowledge  the mace borne before the bailly and magistrates at the convention of the states etc has this inscription  tali haud omnes dignatur honor carolus secundus magnae britanniae franciae and hiberniae rex serenissimus affectum regium erga insulam de jersey in qua bis habuit receptum dum caeteris ditionibus excluderetur hocce monumento vere regio posteris consecratum voluit jussitque ut deinceps balivis praeferatur in perpetuam memoriam fidei tum augustissimo parenti carolo i tum suae

are with such honor graced charles the second the most serene king of great britain france and ireland has resolved that his royal favor toward the isle of jersey in which he twice met with a place of refuge while he was excluded from the rest of his dominions should be consecrated to posterity by this truly royal monument and commanded that thenceforward it should be borne before the baillies in perpetual memory of the loyalty preserved both to his most august father charles i and to his majesty during the rage of the civil wars by the most excellent men sir philip and sir george de carteret knights baillies and chief governors of this island  st magloire the apostle of jersey lies buried in a little chapel near a free school corruptly called from him l ecole de st magloire and founded with another named st anastase by king henry vii who granted a charter for that useful purpose  this place gives title of earl to the lord viscount villiers the second who has enjoyed that dignity  ii the next isle i am to speak of is guernsey the ancient name of which was sarnia from jersey it is distant  0 miles to the northwest yet equals not the former either in point of fruitfulness or extent of territory for it has but  0 parishes this advantage however it enjoys above jersey that here no venomous creatures can subsist it is also naturally better fortified from invasion by craggy rocks and precipices on the contrary its situation compared with that of jersey renders this inferior for whereas the north of jersey is much higher than the south as we have said the south side of guernsey is high and the north low which produces a double obliquity of the sun and land and hence the difference in the soil and air of each notwithstanding this they both agree as to their original their productions and the civil military and ecclesiastical government among the circumjacent rocks is found the sharp and hard stone called smyris or emeril and used by glaziers for cutting glass as well as by jewellers for polishing their work  in trade it is superior to its neighbor jersey by having a more convenient port at its eastern extremity adjoining to the south where the shore retiring inward in the form of a crescent makes the place capable of holding large vessels the foundation of its pier was laid in the beginning of edward is reign by prodigious stones heaped on each other to a considerable height and regularly cemented the shipping here is not only safe and may be brought close up to the town which we shall presently mention but the pier itself is adorned with large smooth flags and guarded by parapets so that being of sufficient length and breadth it is used as the chief place for rendezvouses on parties of pleasure by the fashionable people of the town as well as for its noble prospect over the sea and adjacent isles  on the rightside of the port stands cornetcastle which at high tides is surrounded by the sea sir leonard chamberlan who was governor of guernsey in mary is time and his successor sir thomas leighton improved it with fortifications in the year      the governor lord viscount hatton lost his lady and himself escaped with great difficulty from a prodigious storm of lightning which catching the powderstore blew up the lofty tower with the standard so that the castle must have formerly made a much more grand appearance than at present however what it wants in beauty it makes up in real usefulness for it has the command of the town and harbor and its situation alone renders it strong being divided from the land by an arm of the sea about  00 yards wide except in great springtides when it is fordable  on the leftside too is a mean old castle  the only town is called st peters has a free trade which is however rendered ineffectual by privateering has a market is well stored with implements of war and consists of one long street which is narrow being confined between the sea and the impending hills the market is always plentifully supplied with fish  to the north joins a peninsula named le val where once was a priory and  to the west near the sea is a lake a mile and a half in circumference stocked with fish especially a kind of carp of extraordinary size and delicious to the taste  the governor of guernsey was when i was on the spot the late marquis of montandre and his lieutenant john graham esquire  from hence the second son of heneage late earl of nottingham and lord high chancellor by name heneage finch was promoted to the dignity of a peer of england by the style of baron of guernsey  in guernsey there are eight ministers to its ten parishes four of them being united  i cannot take leave of this island without a short recital of a flagrant instance of popish inhumanity which not content to roll in seas of blood all over england extended itself to this remote corner the fact was thus in the days of that firebrand of her country mary i a poor widow and her two daughters one the wife of perrotine massey a minister who had happily escaped the impending fate by leaving his native soil were sentenced to the stake for what was called heresy the married womans body during the execution bursting by the violence of the flames discharged the pledge of her conjugal affection a beautiful male infant which was hastily caught up by the ministers of justice and carried before the magistrates whose tender mercies commanded that it should be thrown in with the mother which was accordingly done hoc fera religio potuit suadere malorum how far the practices of this sect may have been changed by the illumination of truth instead of faggots notwithstanding their obstinate perseverance in their former principles i will not pretend to determine but sure i am that from bad principles to bad practices the transition is extremely easy and experience has more than once especially within the british dominions testified the truth of this observation i now proceed to mention though very briefly an isle dependent on the government of guernsey this is  iii alderney supposed by camden to be the arica of antoninus by others the ebodia or evodia of p diaconus it is situated about a league and a half from cape la hogue in normandy is in circumference about eight miles and contains one church with a town in which are about  00 houses which lodge to the number of  000 inhabitants the soil is good for pasture or arable and i was shown one field here of about  00 acres which as i was told had not once lain fallow for  00 years before their manure is seaweed called vraic of which we have taken notice above the land lies high and to the south is a harbor admitting only small vessels  the straight which divides this isle from france termed le ras de blanchart or the race of alderney is esteemed a dangerous passage in stormy weather when the winds happen to encounter with the strong currents in calm seasons it is very safe and the largest ships may ride here with ease nay in       part of the french fleet escaped this way after the blow they had met with at la hogue the last place i shall mention in this letter is the isle of  iv sarke which as well as alderney is dependent on the government of guernsey it is no more than two miles in length and is situated in the midst of all the others and guarded with steep rocks its corn is excellent the land very high which together with its situation renders it one of the strongest places in the world its water is very good formerly here was no way for draughts and carriages from the sea till philip de carteret seigneur ae st oven who had a grant of the island from queen elizabeth and in whose descendants the property is vested caused one to be cut through the impending cliff which for some space is carried on in subterranean darkness till it emerges within the island and is fortified with cannon and by a gate in the reign of edward iii was standing the convent of st magloire with a pension from the exchequer where that holy person is said to have resided  the island fell into the hands of the french but in the reign of queen mary i was recovered and the inhabitants have ever since enjoyed the mild influence of the british government equally approving of their present happy condition and detesting the fetters of french slavery their number amounts to about  00 and one minister performs their divine offices thus having completed what i promised i rest from my tour and am  sir your most humble servant  appendix we have purposely reserved the account of several material things and places to the conclusion of this volume for the sake of being more perfect in the description of them than we had opportunity to be at the time of printing the several letters and we shall now insert the following articles under this title but which however may be incorporated in their proper places in future editions of this work  we shall begin with a brief description of the famous gardens of the right hon the lord viscount cobham at stow in buckinghamshire  vol ii p  0  we entered on the south side of the garden between two square pavilions of the dorick order the work of sir john vanbrugh and were struck with the surprising grandeur and variety of the objects that presented themselves to our view of which i shall give a brief account in order as we passed them  first then in the middle of a large octagon piece of water stands an obelisk of near  0 feet which is designed for a jetd eau to cascade from the top of it at a good distance we beheld two beautiful rivers which join and enter the octagon in one stream over one of the rivers is a palladian bridge which is an agreeable object a gothic building  0 feet high presents itself on the summit of a fine hill which we were told is intended to be dedicated to liberty  here we had likewise a view of the south front of the house up an avenue of stately trees but great objections have been made to the narrowness of it which is no doubt an essential fault however since every tree may be deemed a sort of obelisk to the honor of the noble planter it makes a good excuse for their standing and the rather as if they were taken away it would create an evil which could not be remedied in  0 years  as the gothic building is on the right hand so on the lest appears an egyptian pyramid dedicated to the memory of sir john vanbrugh  in short here is such a scene of magnificence and nature displayed the fields abounding with cattle the trees and water so delightfully intermingled and such a charming verdure symmetry and proportion everywhere presenting to the eye that the judgment is agreeably puzzled which singly to prefer of so many collected beauties  leaving this point and on the left hand passing by three statues we came to the coldbath from whence we beheld a natural cascade falling down from the beforementioned octagon in three different sheets of water into a large lake one of the sheets glides through an arch or piece of ruin which is mostly hid by a clump of evergreens but his lordship as we are told designs to make a good deal of amendment to it though at present it has a very natural and agreeable appearance  from hence we proceeded to the hermitage which is agreeably situated in a rising wood and by the side of the lake and passing through the wood we came to the statues of cain and abel fronting the veneris hortus a very neat structure designed by mr kent the inside of it painted by mr sleats and on the frize is the following motto alluding to the painting in the cave nunc amet qui nondum amavit quique amavit nunc amet which is he who never loved a lover grow and he who has  continue so   here is likewise a sophia each way from the entrance of the room is a handsome colonnade leading to square tabernacles or pavilions here are also four venerable antique bustoes of vespasian nero cleopatra and faustina  hence to the head of the lake we had a pleasant view of the cascade and from hence to gibbss building or the belvidere which is placed on the top of the mount is a noble prospect of the house the church the effigies of his present majesty and the late queen the rotonda the castle which a farmer now inhabits and was built for that purpose but on account of its being seated on the side of a fine rising hill makes a beautiful appearance as well from hence as from many other places  in the garden is likewise the temple of friendship from which the pavilion at the entrance the cascade the lake one of the fields that is enclosed in the garden all together afford a scene truly charming  from hence to boycoat buildings passing through a pleasant wood with several agreeable prospects into the country we saw on our right hand a noble terrace one of the buildings is a very good habitable house the other stands on a square bottom in the garden and in the inside of it are four statues at full length in niches viz cicero faustina marcus aurelius and livia the buildings are both finished with pyramidical tops by gibbs betwixt them is a very handsome gateway which is the second entrance to the house from which leads up a noble avenue planted with double lines of thriving trees  from hence to the egyptian pyramid mentioned before which is  0 feet high and about half way up is this inscription in very large characters inter plurima hortorum horum aedificia a johanne vanbrugh equite designata hanc pyramidem illius memoriae sacram esse voluit cobham in english thus among a very great number of structures in these gardens designed by sir john vanbrugh knight cobham thought fit that this pyramid should be sacred to his memory  and in the inside of the building is the following inscription lusisti satis edisti satis atque bibisti tempus abire tibi est ne potum largius aequo rideat and pulset lasciva decentius aetas which may be thus translated enough you have sported quaffd the bowl and eat it is time that from the banquet you retreat lest youth more fitly frolicksome may join to push you reeling under loads of wine   from hence going along a sort of fortification walk on our left hand the wood on the other hand we entered the field which is enclosed in a military way with a staked fence at the first angle on the middle of the gravelwalk are the statues of hercules and anteus hence we proceeded to st augustines cave which is a building of roots of trees and moss and in it a straw couch with three inscriptions in monkish latin verse it is placed in a natural wood and from the oddness of the fabric and the agreeable simplicity which is round it makes a very entertaining variety  leaving this place we approached a building of a very different nature  the temple of bacchus built of brick with paintings in the inside alluding to the name here we had a fine distant prospect toward aylesbury and wendover hills etc in the garden we had in full view the temple of venus and between the two is an obelisk erected to the memory of a clergyman with this inscription to the memory of robin coucher  we proceeded from hence to the saxon temple which is a solemn grove with the seven saxon deities presiding over the several days of the week placed in niches and in the middle of them stands an altar as for sacrifice all the statues are extremely good and this scene agreeably strikes the mind with serenity and composure  our eye after being confined in the wood breaking at once out of it we were surprised with a fine open country on the north on the south the rotonda appears on the west the boycoat buildings on the east the equestrian statue of the late king which stands in the front of the house these objects present themselves from nelsons seat which is an oblong square recess in a clump of evergreens to the southeast is a view of the mansion house which is an extraordinary good one but his lordship annually adding to and improving it one may safely say that it will not be much inferior to the best house in england if his lordships design be finished  the offices on the northside are all enclosed within a most elegant wall with niches and grand gateways into the offices and gardens the house and offices when perfected will be about   0 feet in length fronting north and south as nelsons seat lies to the northwest from the portico of the house there is on the northeast a new bastion building to answer it and some grand walks are now making by the side of a fine lawn from which we see numerous herds of deer a semicircle of fine timber appears at some miles distance with an agreeable country between  on the south front of the house is a very handsome parterre decorated with apollo and the muses gilt vessels and two orangeries but it is likely this will be entirely altered for if the lower end is laid open there will appear a noble scene where nature and art are curiously blended  the next object of our view was a corinthian column on which is the statue of his present majesty with this inscription georgio avgvsto  here we had a most delightful prospect over the country and in the garden several of the buildings present themselves with great pomp the lake whose bounds are beautifully concealed adds much to the general agreeableness of the place  didos cave was the next subject of our attention this is a stone building in a wood and raised on a sort of amphitheatre with this inscription speluncam dido dux and trojanus eandem deveniunt  in english thus repairing to the same dark cave are seen the trojan hero and the tyrian queen   from hence we advanced to the rotonda which is a neat airy building by sir john vanbrugh the dome of it supported on ten dorick columns and in the center standing on a circular pedestal a venus a medicis from this place we had a view of part of the octagon the lake the fields and several of the buildings presenting themselves alternately as we turned ourselves round  as we went from hence to the late queens statue by the side of a canal we were delighted with an alteration of his lordships viz on each side the ground is broken and planted with clumps of various kinds of trees intermixed with statues which are promiscuously placed her late majestys effigies is erected on four ionick columns which are placed on a large pedestal with this inscription in golden letters honori laudi virtuti divae carolinae to the honor praise and virtue of the divine caroline  it is situated on a neat amphitheatre of slopes with pastoral figures each way from it nature and art here joining together make an agreeable contraste  next we were led into the sleeping parlour which is a square building placed in a wood with six walks centring in it within are painted the caesars heads with several festons of fruit etc on the frize is this inscription cum omnia sint in incerto save tibi which is since all things are uncertain indulge thyself  leaving this place and crossing the avenue beforementioned from the pavilions we came to the witchhouse a square building the inside of which is painted by my lords gentleman with several devices alluding to the name  we arrived next at the temple of ancient virtue a rotonda of the dorick order by mr kent and in four niches standing at full lengths are the four following statues viz  i epaminondas with this inscription over his head cujus a virtute prudentia verecundia that is from whose valor prudence and moderation the republic of thebes received both liberty and empire its military civil and domestic discipline and with him lost them  ii lycurgus with this qui summo cum consilio inventis legibus thus translated who having invented laws with the greatest wisdom and most excellently fenced them against all corruption as a father of his country instituted for his countrymen the firmest liberty and the soundest morality which endured for many ages he having together with riches banished avarice luxury and lust  iii socrates qui corruptissima in civitate innocens that is who being innocent in a most corrupt state an encourager of the good a worshipper of one only god as the wisest of men reduced philosophy from useless indolence and vain disputations to the duties of life and the advantages of society  iv homerus qui poetarum princeps idem and maximus thus rendered who being the first of poets as he was the greatest the herald of virtue and bestower of immortality known to all nations incites all in a divine poem honorably to dare and resolutely to suffer  over one door is this inscription charum esse civem been de republica mereri laudari coli diligi gloriosum est metui vero and in odio esse invidiosum detestabile imbecillum caducum which is to be dear to our country to deserve well of the state to be praised honored and beloved is glorious but to be dreaded and hated is matter of ill will detestable weak ruinous  over the other door this justitiam cole and pietatem quae cum sit magna in parentibus and propinquis tum in patria maxima est ea vita via est in coelum and in hunc coetum eorum qui jam vixerunt in english thus maintain justice and thy relative duty which as it is great when exercised toward our parents and kindred so is greatest toward our country that life is the way to heaven and to this assembly of those who have already lived  from this place we had no distant prospect but notwithstanding that it abounds with lasting beauties it is really placed in a sort of paradise and things rising adequate to that name you see friendship flourishing in immortal youth in the elysian fields are many great and virtuous mens names perpetuated who have distinguished themselves in this world by answering the end of their creation near this place also is a good emblem of those who have deviated from it in the ruin here are sweet purling streams resembling the melodious sounds of birds etc  we were now not far from the parish church which is so closely surrounded with a wood as not to be seen from hence we came to the side of a river where unpolished nature cannot boast a part for chance too regular too rude for art   and by its winding banks we were led up to a grotto which is to be decorated with shells pebbles and minerals here is likewise a shellpavilion the dome of which is supported by six wreathed columns the inside of it has several marks performed from shells and diverse other imbellishments on the opposite side is to be another of pebbles  hence we proceeded to the threearchd building which is a pleasant recess by the banks of the river and in passing we saw ancient virtue peeping on the south side of us the church we had in full view on the west to the east is situated the chinese house a building in the pond the outside of it painted very ingeniously in the chinese taste by the celebrated mr sleats the inside of it is indian japan  the shell bridge led us from hence into the elysian fields the most charming place that ever eyes beheld it may not be improper here to give the following lines which were left by an unknown gentleman on his entrance into them to lord cobham charmed with the sight my ravished breast is fired with hints like those which ancient bards inspired all the feigned tales by superstition told all the bright train of fabled nymphs of old the enthusiastic muse believes are true thinks the spot sacred and its genius you lost in wild rapture would she fain disclose how by degrees the pleasing wonder rose industrious in a faithful verse to trace the various beauties of the lovely place and while she keeps the glowing work in view through every maze your artful hand pursue etc   we are now come to the monuments of british worthies the first of which is mr pope with no inscription  the next is sir thomas gresham with this inscription who by the honorable profession of merchant having enriched himself and his country for carrying on the commerce of the world built the royal exchange  inigo jones who to adorn his country introduced and rivalled the greek and roman architecture  john milton whose sublime and unbounded genius equalled a subject that carried him beyond the limits of this world  william shakespeare whose excellent genius opened to him the whole heart of man all the stores of nature and gave him power beyond all other writers to move astonish and delight mankind  sir isaac newton whom the god of nature made to comprehend all his works and from simple principles to discover the laws never known and to explain the appearances never understood of this stupendous universe  sir francis bacon lord verulam who by the strength of a superior genius rejecting vain speculation and fallacious theory taught to pursue and improve philosophy by the certain method of experiment  in the niche of a pyramid is placed a mercury with these words subscribed  campos ducit ad elysios  leads to the elysian fields   and below this figure is fixed a square of black marble with the following lines hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi quique pii vates and phoebo digna locuti inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per arts quique sui memores alios fecere merendo thus translated here are the bands who for their country bled and bards whose pure and sacred verse is read those who by arts invented life improved and by their merits made their memries loved   king alfred the mildest justest most beneficent of kings who drove out the danes secured the seas supported learning established juries crushed corruption guarded liberty and was the founder of the english constitution  edward prince of wales the terror of europe and delight of england who preserved unaltered in the height of glory his natural gentleness and modesty  queen elizabeth who confounded the projects and destroyed the designs of spain who threatened to oppress the liberty of europe took off the yoke of ecclesiastical tyranny restored religion from the corruptions of popery and by a wise a moderate and a popular government gave wealth health security to england  king william the third who by his virtue and constancy having saved his country from a foreign master by a bold and generous enterprise preserved the liberty and religion of great britain  sir walter ralegh a valiant soldier and an able statesman who endeavoring to rouse the spirit of his master for the honor of his country against the ambition of spain fell a sacrifice to that court whose arms he had vanquished and whose designs he had opposed  sir francis drake who through many perils was the first of britons that adventured to sail round the globe and carry into unknown seas the knowledge and glory of the english name  john hampden who with great spirit and consummate ability began a noble opposition to an arbitrary court in defense of the liberties of his country supported them in parliament and died for them in the field  sir john barnard with no inscription  leaving this incomparably sweet place with great regret as every one who sees it must we came to a monument with this inscription  signor fido an italian of good extraction who came into england not to bite us like most of his countrymen but to gain an honorable livelihood he hunted not after fame yet acquired it regardless of the praise of his friends but most sensible of their love though he lived amongst the great he neither learnt nor flattered any vice he was no bigot nor doubted he of any of the xxxix articles and if to follow nature and respect the laws of society be philosophy he was a perfect philosopher a faithful friend and an agreeable companion a loving husband and distinguished by a numerous offspring all which he lived to see take good courses and in his old age retired to the house of a clergyman in the country where he finished his earthly race and died an honor and example to the whole species reader this stone is guiltless of flattery for he to whom it was inscribed was not a man but a   crossing the field to the gothic building before described we had a boundless prospect round the building from hence we descended a fine hill and on our left hand saw a plantation of evergreens on our right the well designed and rivers described from the pavilion this walk led us down to a very handsome bridge over one of the rivers the roof on the side facing the water is supported by ionick columns the backside of it by an altorelievo of the four quarters of the world bringing their products to britannia here are likewise painted by mr sleats sir walter ralegh with a map of virginia in his hand and sir william penn holding a book styled the laws of pensylvania here are besides a great many modern and antique bustoes of marble  we now visited the imperial closet which is a room very near the form of a cube and in it are the three following figures painted at full length by mr sleats imp titus caes vespasian with his saying over his head diem perdidi i have lost a day imp trajan caes with his saying pro me si merear in me for me but if i deserve it against me imp marcus aurelius caesar antoninus with his saying ita regas imperator ut privatus regi velis so govern when an emperor as if a private person you would desire to be governed   passing a noble iron gate at the end of a fine terrace of    0 feet in length and breadth proportionable which leads to the veneris hortus we came to the temple of friendship a lofty square building of the dorick order with three noble porticoes on the sides which appear to the garden the cave and ceiling are painted with historypieces by mr sleats at the bottom of the room are placed ten pedestals which are designed for the bustoes of his lordship and nine of his select friends those of his royal highness the prince of wales the earl of chesterfield lord cobham and mr william pit are already erected but who the other are to be is not yet known  the pebble alcove is a neat recess and very artfully imbellished with pebbles his lordships arms are performed with the same and displayed in proper colors  congreves monument is an urn which with great art expresses the genius of the man and at the top of it is placed a monkey beholding himself in a mirror and under him this writing vitae imitatio that is comedy is the imitation of life and the glass of fashion  the poets effigies lying in a careless posture has the following inscription ingenio hoc cobham thus translated in the year      cobham erected this poor consolation for as well as monument of his loss of the piercing elegant polished wit and civilized candid most unaffected manners of william congreve  we were now very near the pavilions and in going to them walked by the side of the river and octagon passing on our left hand three satyrs and a dancing venus  i have now gone round giving you a faint description of an unparalleled chain of artificial and natural beauty and to make use of mr popes lines here order in variety you see where all things differ yet where all agree   his lordships judgment and refined taste are not less conspicuous in his woods and park  vol ii p     instead of what is there said of the earl of burlingtons seat at chiswick insert the following  but i must not pass over so slightly the noble seat of the right honorable the earl of burlington which was a plain useful house with a number of good offices about it but as a part of the old house was destroyed some years ago by fire his lordship erected a most beautiful villa near to the old house which for elegance of taste surpasses every thing of its kind in england if not in europe the court in front of the house is of a proportionable size to the building which is gravelled and kept always very neat on each side are yew hedges in panels with termini placed at proper distance in front of which are planted two rows of cedars of libanus which at present have a fine effect to the eye at a small distance from the house for the dark shade of these solemn evergreen trees occasions a fine contraste with the elegant white building which appears between them  the ascent to the house is by a noble flight of stone steps on one side of which is the statue of inigo jones and on the other that of palladio the portico is supported by fine fluted pillars of the corinthian order and the cornice frize and architrave are as rich as possible so that the front of this building strikes every person though not a nice judge of architecture with uncommon pleasure  the other front toward the garden is plainer but yet is very bold and grand having a pleasing simplicity as has also the sidefront toward the serpentine river which is different from the other two  the inside of the house is finished in the highest taste the ceilings being richly gilt and painted and the rooms are filled with some of the best pictures in europe and though the house is small yet it would take up more room than can be allowed here to describe the particular beauties of it  the gardens are also laid out in an elegant taste when you descend from the house you enter on a lawn of grass planted with clumps of evergreen trees between which are two rows of large stone vases at the ends next the house are two fine wolves in stone cut by mr sceidmaker the famous statuary and at the farther end are two large lions and to terminate this view are three fine antique statues which were dug up in adrians garden at rome with stone seats between each and on the back of the statues is a close plantation of evergreens which terminates the prospect  on the right hand as you go from the house you look through an open grove of foresttrees to the orangery which is separated from the lawn by a faussee to secure the orange trees from being injured by persons who are admitted to walk in the garden so that they are seen as perfectly and when the orange trees are in flower the scent is diffused over the whole lawn to the house as if the trees were placed on the lawn  on the left hand you have an easy slope of grass down to the serpentine river on the side of which are clumps of evergreens which make agreeable breaks to the eye between which the water is seen and at the farther end is a peep into an enclosure where are an obelisk and a roman temple with grass slopes and a circular piece of water in the middle  from this lawn you are led to the wilderness through which are three strait avenues terminated by three different buildings and within the quarters are serpentine walks through which you may walk near a mile in constant shade  on each side the serpentine river is a grass walk which follow the turns of the river and on the right hand of the river is a building which is the exact model of the portico of covent garden church and on the left is a wilderness which is laid out in regular walks with clipped hedges on each side which is too mean for the other parts of the garden and it is much to be wondered his lordship should suffer them to remain in the present form  over the river in the middle part is a palladian bridge of wood which his lordship crosses in his coach to come round to the house for there is a coach road through the garden by which his lordship passes when he comes from london so that the earl seldom goes through the town of chiswick to his house  at the end of the river next the road is a fine cascade lately erected which by an engine to raise the water his lordship proposed to have a constant fall into the river but the engine failing it is but seldom the cascade can play and then but for a short time  next the road his lordship has raised a terrace with the earth which came out of the river from whence you have a prospect of the adjacent country and when the tide is up you see the water of the thames with the boats and barges passing which greatly enlivens the prospect in a word there is more variety in this garden than can be found in any other of the same size in england or perhaps in europe  to the preceding account of the lord burlingtons seat at chiswick i shall subjoin the following description of gunnersburyhouse  it is situated near ealing between the two great western roads and stands on an eminence the ground falling gradually from it to the brentford road so that from the portico in the backfront of the house you have an exceeding fine prospect of the county of surrey the river of thames and all the meadows on the borders for some miles as also a good prospect of london in clear weather this house was built by mr web who was soninlaw to the famous inigo jones and indeed the architecture shows it was contrived by him or at least by a scholar of his for although the building is as plain on the outside as possible yet there is a simple boldness in it which graces all the buildings of inigo jones rarely to be found in the works of other architects the apartments in the house are extremely convenient and well contrived the hall is very large having rows of columns on each side from thence you ascend by a noble flight of stairs to a salon which is a double cube of twentyfive feet this room the present possessor henry furness esquire is fitting up in a most elegant taste and he is possessed of a fine collection of capital pictures so he proposes to hang this room entirely with them which when finished will render it one of the finest rooms in england  from this room is the entrance to the portico on the backfront of the house which is supported by columns and is a delightful place to sit in in the afternoon during the summer season for as it faces the southeast so the sun is gone from it by two of the clock and shining on the country which is open to the view renders the prospect very delightful  upon going out of the house into the garden you come upon a noble terrace the whole width of the garden from whence you have a fine prospect of the neighboring country and on which you may walk dry after the greatest rains from this terrace you descend to the garden by a noble flight of stone steps the upper part of which is concave and the lower unequal with a noble stone balustrade on each side as also upon the coping of the wall the length of the house which makes a fine appearance from the road but the gardens are laid out too plain having the walls in view on every side and at present the offices are too mean for the house which i hear the present possessor intends to alter in a most elegant taste which will render it the finest seat near london  vol i p     at peckham is the seat of the late lord trevor which was built in the reign of king james ii by sir thomas bond who was deeply engaged with that unfortunate prince in his schemes and was obliged to quit the kingdom with him so the house was plundered by the populace and became a forfeit to the crown in the building and the gardens large sums of money were expended for the whole was executed according to the politest taste of those times the front of the house stands to the north having two rows of large elmtrees of a considerable length before it through which the tower of london appears as a termination to the prospect but on each side of this avenue you have a view of london from westminster to greenwich and at high water the masts of the vessels on the river of thames appear over the trees and houses like a wood which greatly improves the prospect the fields in front and on each side of the house being well cultivated render them very agreeable and the town of peckham lies on the backside of the gardens but is shut out from the view by plantations the wilderness indeed was planted too regular having diagonal walks intersecting each other with hedges on each side but this was the taste which prevailed when those gardens were laid out the kitchengarden and the walls were planted with the choicest fruit trees from france and an experienced fruitgardener was sent for from paris to have the management of them so that the collection of fruits in this garden has been accounted one of the best in england  a private gentleman purchased this seat soon after the death of the late lord trevor and had begun to make very great alterations particularly in cutting down hedges removing walls and buildings which intercepted the prospect of the neighboring fields and had the gentleman lived a few years longer he would have entirely altered it to the modern taste of gardening and rendered it a sweet retirement considering its vicinity to london  vol i p     after line   add as follows  in the year    0 on the promotion of dr gilbert dean of this church to the bishopric of llandaff his majesty was pleased to confer the deanery on dr alured clarke who was installed in the month of january in that year and if we may be allowed to judge from the pious acts he began with in that station a more worthy man could not have been preferred thereto  the house an ancient building belonging to that dignity had through the remissness of its former possessors been too long neglected wherefore his first work was to set about altering and repairing that which he did within nine months of his installment at an expense of about  00 l  before this was perfected viz in the spring      he drew up and published proposals for founding an hospital in this city for lodging dieting and curing the sick and lame poor thereof and of the county of devon on the like plan of that which he had before founded at winchester for the benefit of that city and county of hants a design so good recommended by the pious eloquence of a divine so learned and judicious on views so visibly disinterested and so clearly abstracted from all party schemes or intentions met with the general applause and assistance of the gentry and clergy of all parties sects and denominations who however different in religion and politics unanimously joined in this pious undertaking and a subscription being opened in march has already  november      brought in about  000 l of which near   00 l are annual engagements which it is highly probable will be not only continued but much augmented so that it is hoped that  00 patients at a time may be provided for john tuckfield of raddon esquire was pleased to accommodate the governors with a plot of ground near southernhay without the citywalls at a very moderate price and to give  00 l toward carrying on the building for the intended hospital the plan of which was commodiously designed by the direction of the dean and the first stone thereof laid by him assisted by the bishop of exon sir william courtenay knight of the shire sir henry northcote and humphry sydenham esquire the citizens in parliament the honorable henry roll and john tuckfield esquire attended by a great number of clergy and gentry that are subscribers and thousands of joyful spectators on the   th of august      the building contains upwards of  00 feet in length and is already in a good forwardness in digging the ground for the foundation the workmen found a roman coin of nerva and another of constantine  the charityschools founded here by the pious bishop blackall in the year   0  the good dean not only bountifully subscribed to but preached a sermon before a large assembly of governors and contributors and after the sermon at a court held for that purpose inspected the rules inquired into the causes of complaint and prevailed on the governors to visit the schools oftener and diligently endeavor to render that charity as useful as possible  vol i p     at painshill near cobham in surrey is the seat of the hon charles hamilton where is a great improvement making by enclosing a large tract of land designed for a park which was most of it so poor as not to produce any thing but heath and broom but by burning of the heath and spreading of the ashes on the ground a crop of turnips was obtained and by feeding sheep on the turnips their dung become a good manure to the land so that a good sward of grass is now upon the land where it was judged by most people impossible to get any herbage this is the sort of improvement which was mentioned in norfolk where land has been raised from five shillings an acre per ann to thirty or forty shillings and were this sort of husbandry practiced in many other parts of england it would be of great service to the public and greatly increase the value of the lands to the proprietor  and this leads me to a reflection on the present advanced price of butter and cheese  anno      which many people attribute entirely to the two last hard winters and the succeeding dry summers which must be allowed have greatly contributed toward it yet these are not the only causes of it but there has of late years been a great neglect of the dairyfarms either from the poverty of the farmers who could not keep up their stock of cows or by ploughing too much of their grassground for raising of corn and many landlords it is to be feared have permitted their tenants to break up too much of their land for corn because of the great demand there has been for it abroad of late years and this has enabled their tenants to pay their rent better than otherwise they could have done  but the consequence will be severely felt for some years for as the farmers stock of cattle has been reduced greatly by this alteration in the husbandry so it will be impossible for them to get manure enough to keep their land in heart and when this fresh ground is worn out by crops the yearly value of it will be reduced to less than one third of what it has produced so that it is greatly to be feared most of the estates in england will be lessened in their rent and unless the owners will be at some expense to lay down properly a proportion of their lands for grass they can hardly expect ever to see a proper sward on their estates for the farmers in general have not the least skill in this particular branch of husbandry  but to return from this digression the lands which mr hamilton has enclosed have fine inequalities for every  00 yards there are great hollows then rising grounds again so that the prospect is continually changing as you walk over it and if we may guess by what this gentleman has already done the whole will be laid out conformable to the natural situation of the ground and when the plantations which are already made are grown up it will be a delightful place and this upon a spot of ground which lay almost neglected before this gentleman became possessed of it so that whatever is here laid cut will be entirely an improvement since without it the land would have produced very little rent to the proprietor and would the gentlemen who enclose large tracts of land into parks follow this gentlemans method of enclosing such land as is of little value and improve it by making a good sward upon it their estates would be greatly benefited by it  the house which at present is on this spot is very small being what mr hamilton found built on it by his predecessor to which he has only added one handsome room on the backside which is elegantly fitted up and completely furnished with good pictures but as there are so many better situations for a house in the middle of the park so it is supposed this gentleman will erect a new mansion house answerable to the design of his plantations  the river mole which rises near darking passes along by the side of this park and in its course serpents about in so pretty a manner as that you frequently lose the sight of it and by its windings make the course almost four miles within the compass of this enclosure indeed this river is very narrow and in dry weather the current is exceeding slow and the water not well colored which it must be allowed takes off from its beauty yet there is room for great improvements by sloping off the banks so as to have a better view of the water and in many places by taking away some of the little projection of the banks it may be widened so as to appear considerable at some distance which if done will add much to the beauty of the place  near this place is the house of mr bridges which is built in a very singular taste something after the model of an italian villa but very plain on the outside the apartments within seem very commodious and the principal rooms are elegantly fitted up the ceilings being gilt and all the members are richly ornamented the offices below are very convenient and judiciously contrived to answer the purposes for which they were designed but what chiefly struck my curiosity on seeing it was a false story contrived on each side of the house taken from the difference in the height of the siderooms from those principal apartments and these are converted into long galleries with a small apartment at one end which affords a communication between them in the attick story there are very good lodgingrooms which are well laid together so that for the size of this house there is hardly any other near london which has more useful and elegant apartments  the situation of the house is on an eminence so that it commands the prospect of the adjacent fields which are kept in very exact order and there is a declivity from the house to the river mole which passes along by the side of this gentlemans garden and here it appears much more considerable than in any other part of its course for mr bridges has taken away so much of the earth of the banks as to make the river in some places four or five times broader than it was naturally so that it makes a handsome appearance and by the side of the water he has disposed the earth into a natural slope with a broad grasswalk planted with sweet shrubs on each side and at the end of the walk is a fine room which has a view of the water lengthwise and is a sweet retreat in hot weather being shaded by large elmtrees on the south side and having the water on the north and eastsides which renders it very cool and pleasant this house is situated about half a mile from the public road to portsmouth and is so much hid by the trees near it as not to be seen until you rise on the common or heath beyond cobham where in several parts of the road between that and ripley you have a fine view of it  vol i p  0  from blandford i took a turn to view one of the largest and most stately new fabrics in the kingdom i mean the house or rather palace belonging to the right hon george dodington esquire it is situated in the parish of gunville four miles from blandford and six from shaftesbury and cranborn the house gardens and park containing in all about eight miles in circumference are now named eastbury  it is a vast and magnificent structure its very offices at a distance resembling no inconsiderable parish you approach it through one of the most beautiful lawns which the imagination can conceive and passing through the grand court on each side of which the offices are ranged in treble rows from four bass courts a most stately portico presents itself supported by large and beautiful pillars here you ascend by many steps between the statues of two sphinxes and having passed the area of the portico you enter a most magnificent hall adorned with many statues and bustoes and its roof painted in a most delicate taste  hence you proceed to the salon one of the noblest rooms in europe and which with its fine proportion no less than the splendour of its gilding cannot but strike the most indifferent beholder  at one end of this salon is a princely apartment consisting of three large rooms furnished one with crimson another with flowered velvet and the third with satin all richly laced with gold at the other end of the salon is a drawing room and very large dining room both magnificently gilt as is indeed every room in this floor except only the hall  the first floor above stairs is distributed into several grand apartments but as it is not our intention nor have we room to describe it minutely we shall pass to the gardens which are laid out with surprising art but what is most remarkable in them is the vast collection of foreign trees of various kinds the beautiful verdure of the walks in the midst of a country whose turf is of another color especially in summer this house was begun by the late mr dodington and finished by the present the architect was sir john vanbrugh  the following
