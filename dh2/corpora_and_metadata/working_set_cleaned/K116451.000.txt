the farmers boy a rural poem    the farmers boy a rural poem in four books by robert bloomfield  a shepherds boyhe seeks no better name with ornaments engraved in wood by anderson  london printed by t bensley boltcourt fleet street for vernor and hood poultry tc rickman upper marylebonestreet ingram bury and booth norwich  mdccc  preface having the satisfaction of introducing to the public this very pleasing and characteristic poem the farmers boy i think it will be agreeable to preface it with a short account of the manner in which it came into my hands and which will be much more interesting to every reader a little history of the author which has been communicated to me by his brother and which i shall very nearly transcribe as it lies before me  in november last year i received a ms which i was requested to read and to give my opinion of it it had before been shown to some persons in london whose indifference toward it may probably be explained when it is considered that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation with some a person must be rich or titled or fashionable as a literary name or at least fashionable in some respect good or bad before any thing which he can offer will be thought worthy of notice  i had been a little accustomed to the effect of prejudices and i was determined to judge in the only just and reasonable way of the work by the work itself  at first i confess seeing it divided into the four seasons i had to encounter a prepossession not very advantageous to any writer that the author was treading in a path already so admirably trod by thomson and might be adding one more to an attempt already so often but so injudiciously and unhappily made of transmuting that noble poem from blank verse into rhymefrom its own pure native gold into an alloyed metal of incomparably less splendour permanence and worth  i had soon however the pleasure of finding myself relieved from that apprehension and of discovering that although the delineation of rural scenery naturally branches itself into these divisions there was little else except the general qualities of a musical car flowing numbers feeling piety poetic imagery and animation a taste for the picturesque a true sense of the natural and pathetic force of thought and liveliness of imagination which were in common between thomson and this author and these are qualities which whoever has the eye the heart the awakened and surrounding intellect and the diviner sense of the poet which alone can deserve the name must posses  but with these general characters of true poetry the farmers boy has as i have said a character of its own it is discriminated as much as the circumstances and habits and situation and ideas consequently associated which are so widely diverse in the two authors could make it different simplicity sweetness a natural tenderness that molle atque facetum which horace celebrates in the eclogues of virgil will be found to belong to it  i intend some farther and more particular critical remarks on this charming performance but i now pass to the account of the author himself as given me by his brothera man to whom also i was entirely a strangerbut whose candor good sense and brotherly affection appear in this narrative and of the justness of whose understanding and the goodness of his heart i have had many proofs in consequence of a correspondence with him on different occasions which have since arise when this had made me acquainted with him and interested me in his behalf  in writing to me mr george bloomfield who is a shoemaker also as his brother and lives at bury thus expresses himself  as i spent five years with the author from the time he was thirteen years and a half old till he was turned of eighteen the most interesting time of life i mean the time that instruction is acquired if acquired at all i think i am able to give a better account of him than any one can or than he can of himself for his modesty would not let him speak of his temper disposition or morals  robert was the younger child of george bloomfield a tailor at honington this village is between euston and troston and about nine miles ne of bury l his father died when he was an infant under a year old his mother elizabeth daughter of robert manby vide note at the end of this preface was a schoolmistress and instructed her own children with the others he thus learned to read as soon as he learned to speak  though the mother was left a widow with six small children yet with the help of friends she managed to give each of them a little schooling  robert was accordingly sent to mr rodwell this respectable men is senior clerk to the magistrates of the hundred of blackbourn in which honington is situated and has conducted himself with great propriety in this and other public employments l of ixworth to be improved in writing but he did not go to that school more than two or three months nor was ever sent to any other his mother again marrying when robert was about seven years old  by her second husband john glover she had another family  when robert was not above eleven years old the late mr w austin of sapiston this little village adjoins to hoington l took him and though it is customary for farmers to pay such boys only is  d per week yet he generously took him into the house this relieved his mother of any other expense than only of finding him a few things to wear and this was more than she well knew how to do  she wrote therefore mr g bloomfield continues to me and my brother not then in london to assist her mentioning that he robert was so small of his age that mr austin said he was not likely to be able to get his living by hard labor  mr g bloomfield on this informed his mother that if she would let him take the boy with him he would take him and teach him to make shoes and not promised to clothe him the mother upon this offer took coach and came to london to mr bloomfield with the boy for she said she never should have been happy if she had not put him herself into his hands  she charged me he adds as i valued a mothers blessing to watch over him to set good examples for him and never to forget that he had lost his father i religiously confine myself to mr g bloomfields own words and think i should wrong all the parties concerned if in mentioning this pathetic and successful admonition i were to use any other  mr g bloomfield then lived at mr simms no   tisherscourt bellalley colemanstreet it is customary he continues in such houses as are let to poor people in london to have light garrets fit for mechanics to work in in the garret where we had two turnup beds and five of us worked i received little robert  as we were all single men lodgers at a shilling per week each our beds were coarse and all things far from being clean and snug like what robert had left at sapiston robert was our man to fetch all things to hand at noon he fetched our dinners from the cooks shop and any one of our fellow workmen that wanted to have any thing fetched in would send him and assist in his work and teach him for a recompense for his trouble  every day when the boy from the publichouse came for the pewter pots and to hear what porter was wanted he always brought the yesterdays newspaper there was then neither as a resource for the exigencies of finance nor as a principle of supposed policy that unhappy check which prevails now on the circulation of newspapers and other means of popular information l the reading of the paper we had been used to take by turns but after robert came he mostly read for usbecause his time was of least value  he frequently met with words that he was unacquainted with of this he often complained i one day happened at a bookstall to see a small dictionary which had been very ill used i bought it for him for  d by the help of this he in little time could read and comprehend the long and beautiful speeches of burke fox or north  one sunday after an whole days stroll in the country we by accident went into a dissenting meeting house in the old jewry where a gentleman was lecturing this man filled little robert with astonishment the house was amazingly crowded with the most genteel people and though we were forced to stand still in the aisle and were much pressed yet robert always quickened his steps to get into the town on a sunday evening soon enough to attend this lecture  the preacher lived somewhere at the west end of the townhis name was fawcet his language says mr g bloomfield was just such as the rambler is written in his action like a person acting a tragedy his discourse rational and free from the cant of methodism  of him robert learned to accent what he called hard words and otherwise improved himself and gained the most enlarged notions of providence  he went sometimes with me to a debating society it is another of the constitutional refinements of these times to have fettered and as to every valuable purpose silenced these debating societies they were at least to say the lowest of them far better amusements than drunkenness gambling or fighting they were no useless schools to some of our very celebrated speakers at the bar and in parliament and what is of infinitely more importance they contributed to the diffusion of political knowledge and public sentiment l at coachmakershall but not often and a few times to covent garden theater these are all the opportunities he ever had to learn from public speakers as to books he had to wade through two or three folios an history of england british traveller and a geography but he always read them as a task or to oblige us who bought them and as they came in sixpenny numbers weekly he had about as many hours to read as other boys spend in play  i at that time proceeds his brother read the london magazine and in that work about two sheets were set apart for a reviewrobert seemed always eager to read this review here he could see what the literary men were doing and learn how to judge of the merits of the works that come out and i observed that he always looked at the poets corner and one day he repeated a song which he composed to an old tune i was much surprised that a boy of sixteen should make so smooth verses so i persuaded him to try whether the editor of our paper would give them a place in poels corner and he succeeded and they were printed and as i forget his other early productions i shall copy this  the milkmaid on the first of may i hail may lovely may how replenished my pails the young dawn overspreads the east streaked with gold my glad heart beats time to the laugh of the vale and colins voice rings through the woods from the sold ii the wood to the mountain submissively bends whose blue misty summits first glow with the sun see thence a gay train by the wild rill descends to join the glad sportshark the tumults begun iii be cloudless ye skiesbe my colin but there not the dewspangled bents on the wide level dale nor mornings first blush can more lovely appear than his looks since my wishes i could not conceal iv swift down the mad dance while blessed health prompts to move well count joys to come and exchange vows of truth and happily when age cools the transports of love decry like good folks the rain pleasures of youth v no no the remembrance shall ever be dear at no time love with innocence ceases to charm it is transport in youthand it smiles through the tear when they feel in their children it is first soft alarm the writer of this preface doubts whether he has been successful in adding the last stanza to this beautiful and simply expressive song but he imagined that some thought of this kind was in the mind of the author and he was willing to endeavor to express it the breast which has felt love justly shrinks from the idea of its total extinction as from annihilation itself and there is even an high social and moral use in that order of providence which exalts sensations into tender and benign passions those passions into habitual affections yet more tender and raises from those affections virtues the most permanent the most necessary and beneficent and the most endearing thus expanding the sentiment into all the charities of domestic and social life  i remember says mr g bloomfield continuing his narrative a little piece which he called the sailors return it is much to be wished that this may be discovered l in which he tried to describe the feelings of an honest tar who after a long absence saw his dear native village first rising into view this too obtained a place in the poets corner  and as he was so young his brother proceeds it shows some genius in him and some industry to have acquired so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time indeed at this time myself and my fellow workmen in the garret began to got instructions from him though not more than sixteen years old what simple magnanimity and benevolence in this remark l   about this time there came a man to lodge at our lodgings that was troubled with fits robert was so much hurt to see this poor creature drawn into such frightful forms and to hear his horrid screams that i was forced to leave the lodging we went to blue hartcourt bellalley in our new garret we found a singular character james kay a native of dundee he was a middleaged man of a good understanding and yet a furious calvinist he had many booksand some which he did not value such as the seasons paradise lost and some novels these books he lent to robert who spent all his leisure hours in reading the seasons which he was now capable of reading i never heard him give so much praise to any book as to that  i think it was in the year      that the question came to be decided between the journeymen shoemakers whether those who had learned without serving an apprenticeship could follow the trade that is as journeymen for there was no question that they could not as masters on their own account that a person may work as a journeyman without having served an apprenticeship had already been determined t   g   beach v turner burr mans      a person also who has not served an apprenticeship may be a partner contributing money or advice and attention to the accounts and general concerns of the trade provided that he does not actually exercise the trade and that the acting partner has served vide reynolds v chase m  0 g   burr mansf     burn jp apprent    l   the man by whom robert and i were employed mr chamberlayne of cheapside took an active part against the lawful journeymen and even went so far as to pay off every man that worked for him that had joined their clubs this so exasperated the men that their acting committee soon looked for unlawful men as they called them among chamberlaynes workmen  they found out little robert and threatened to prosccute chamberlayne for employing him and to prosecute his brother mr g bloomfield for teaching him chamberlayne requested of the brother to go on and bring it to a trial for that he would defend it and that neither george nor robert should be hurt  in the mean time george was much insulted for having refused to join upon this occasion those who called themselves exclusively the lawful crafts george who says he was never famed for patience it is not indeed so much as might be sometimes wished very often the lot of strong and acute minds to possess largely of this virtue took his pen and addressed a letter to one of the most active of their committee men a man of very bad character in this after stating that he took robert at his mothers request he made free as well with the private character of this man as with the views of the committee this says george was very foolish for it made things worse but i felt too much to refrain  what connects this episodical circumstance with the character of our author follows in his brothers words   robert naturally fond of peace and fearful for my personal safety begged to be suffered to retire from the storm  he came home and mr austin kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could return to me and here with his mind glowing with the fine descriptions of rural scenery which he found in thomsons seasons he again retraced the very fields where first he began to think here free from smoke but one word is altered in this description which reminds one of the  funm  stpitumee romae l the noise the contention of the city he imbibed that love of rural simplicity and rural innocence which fitted him in a great degree to be the writer of such a thing as the farmers boy  here he lived two monthsat length as the dispute in the trade still remained undecided mr dudbridge offered to take robert apprentice to secure him at all events from any consequences of the litigation  he was bound by mr ingram of bellalley to mr john dudbridge his brother george paid five shillings for robert by way of form as a premium dudbridge was their landlord and a freeman of the city of london he acted most honorably and took no advantage of the power which the indentures gave him george bloomfield staid with robert till he found he could work as expertly as his self  mr george bloomtield adds when i left london he was turned of eighteen and much of my happiness since has arisen from a constant correspondence which i have held with him  after i left him he studied music and was a good player on the violin  but as my brother nut had married a wooluich woman it happened that robert took a fancy to a comely young woman mary her surname before marriage is mentioned in the next page of that town whose father is a boatbuilder in the government yard there his name is church  soon after he married robert told me in a letter that he had sold his fiddle and got a wife like most poor men he got a wife first and had to get household stuff afterward it took him some years to get out of ready furnished lodgings at length by hard working etc he acquired a bed of his own and hired the room up one pair of stairs at    bellalley colemanstreet the landlord kindly gave him leave to sit and work in the light garret two pair of stairs higher  in this garret amid six or seven other workmen his active mind employed itself in composing the parmers boy  in my correspondence i have seen several poetical effusions of his all of them of a good moral tendency but which he very likely would think do him little credit on that account i have not preserved them  robert is a ladies shoemaker and works for davies lomlardstreet he is of a slender make of about   t   i high very dark complexionhis mother who is a very religious member of the church of england took all the pains she could in his infancy to make him pious and as his reason expanded his love of god and man increased with it i never knew his fellow for mildness of temper and goodness of disposition and since i left him universally is he praised by those who know him best for the best of husbands an indulgent father and quiet neighbor he is about thirtytwo years old and has three children  mr george bloomfield concludes this clear affectionate and interesting narrative by a very kind address to the writer of this preface but pleased as i am with the good opinion of a man like him i must not take praise to myself for not having neglected or suppressed such a work when it came into my hands and i have no farther merit than that of seeing what it was impossible for an unprejudiced mind not to see and of doing what it was impossible not to do  but i join with him cordially in his prayer that god the giver of thought may as mental light spreads raise up many who will turn a listening ear and will not despise the short and simple annals of the poor  very few words will complete what remains to be added  struck with the work but not less struck with the remark which is become a proverb of the roman satirist that  it is not easy hand facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat res augusta domi for those to emerge to notice whose circumstances obscure the observation of their merits i sent it to a friend whom i knew to be above these prejudices and who has deserved and is deserving well of the public in many other instances by his attention to literature and the elegant arts he immediately expressed an high satisfaction in it and communicated it to mesers vernor and hood they adopted in upon terms honorable to themselves and satisfactory to the author and to me in his behalf they have published it in a manner which speaks abundantly for itself both as to the typographical accuracy and beauty and the good taste and execution of the ornaments in wood  my part has been this and it has been a very pleasing one to revise the ms making occasionally corrections with respect to orthography and sometimes in the grammatical construction the corrections in point of grammar reduce themselves almost wholly to a circumstance of provincial usage which even well educated persons in suffolk and norfolk do not wholly avoid and which may be said as to general custom to have become in these counties almost an established dialectthat of adopting the plural for the singular termination of verbs so as to exclude the s but not a line is added or substantially altered through the whole poem i have requested the ms to be preserved for the satisfaction of those who may wish to be satisfied on this head  the proofs have gone through my bands it has been printed slowly because most carefully as it deserved to be printed  i have no doubt of its reception with the public i have none of its going down to posterity with honor which is not always the fate of productions which are popular in their day  thus much i knowthat the author with a spirit amiable at all times and which would have been revered by antiquity seems far less interested concerning any fame or advantage he may derive from it to himself than in the pleasure of giving a printed copy of it as a tribute of duty and affection to his mother in whose pleasure if it succeeds his filial heart places the gratification of which it is most desirous it is much to be a poet such as he will be foundit is more to be such a man  capel lofft  troston n bery surrolk    dec      elizabeth manby the mother of the author of this polm was sister to the wife of mr william austin i had written to mr george bloomfield to request the name before marriage of his mother this gained me an answer which i have great pleasure in adding the late mr austins wife was a manby my mothers sister and it may seem strange that in the farmers boy giles no where calls him uncle but masterthe treatment that my brother robert experienced from mr austin did not differ in any respect from the treatment that all the servant boys experienced who lived with him mr austin was father of fourteen children by my aunt he never had any other wife he left a decent provision for the five children that survived him so that it could not be expected he should have any thing to give to poor relations and i dont see a possibility of making a difference between giles and the boys that were not related to mr austin for he treated all his servants exactly as he did his sons they all worked hard all lived well the duke had not a better man tenant to him than the late mr austin i saw numbers of the husbandmen in tears when he was buried he was beloved by all who knew him but i imagine robert thought that when he was speaking of benevolence that was universal he had no occasion to mention the accidental circumstance of his being related to the good man of whom he sung     spring argument invocation etc seed time

for all the blessings of my infant days bear me through regions where gay fancy dwells but mould to truths fair form what memory tells live trifling incidents and grace my song that to the humblest menial belong to him whose drudgery unheeded goes his joys unreckond as his cares or woes though joys and cares in every path are sown and youthful minds have feelings of their own quick springing sorrows transient as the dew delights from trifles trifles ever new twas thus with giles meek fatherless and poor labor his portion but he felt no more no stripes no tyranny his steps pursued his life was constant cheerful servitude strange to the world he wore a bashful look the fields his study nature was his book and as revolving seasons changed the scene from heat to cold tempestuous to serene though every change still varied his employ yet each new duty brought its share of joy where noble grafton spreads his rich domains round eustons watered vale and sloping plains where woods and groves in solemn grandeur rise where the kite brooding unmolested flies the woodcock and the painted pheasent race and sculking foxes destined for the chase there giles untaught and unrepining strayed through every copse and grove and winding glade there his first thoughts to natures charms inclined that stamps devotion on the inquiring mind a little farm his generous master tilled who with peculiar grace his station filled by deeds of hospitality endeared served from affection for his worth revered a happy offspring blessed his plenteous board his fields were fruitful and his barns well stored and fourscore ewes he fed a sturdy team and lowing kine that grazed beside the stream unceasing industry he kept in view and never lacked a job for giles to do fled now the sullen murmurs of the north the splendied raiment of the spring peeps forth her universal green and the clear sky delight still more and more the gazing eye wide over the fields in rising moisture strong shoots up the simple flower or creeps along the mellowd soil imbibing as it goes fresh sweets from frequent showers and evening dews that summon from its shed the slumbering ploughs while health impregnates every breeze that blows no wheels support the diving pointed share no groaning ox is doomed to labor there no helpmates teach the docile steed his road alike unknown the plowboy and the goad but unassisted through each toilsome day with smiling brow the plowman cleaves his way draws his fresh parallels and widning still treads slow the heavy dale or climbs the hill strong on the wing his busy followers play where writhing earthworms meet the unwelcome day till all is changed and hill and level down assume a livery of sober brown again disturbed when giles with wearying strides from ridge to ridge the ponderous harrow guides his heels deep sinking every step he goes till dirt usurp the empire of his shoes welcome green headland firm beneath his feet welcome the friendly banks refreshing seat there warm with toil his panting horses browse their sheltering canopy of pendent boughs till rest delicious chase each transient pain and newborn vigor swell in every vein hour after hour and day to day succeeds till every clod and deepdrawn furrow spreads to crumbling mould a level surface clear and strewn with corn to crown the rising year and over the whole giles once transverse again in earths moist bosom buries up the grain the work is done no more to man is give the grateful farmer trusts the rest to heaven yet often with anxious heart he looks around and marks the first green blade that breaks the ground in fancy sees his trembling oats uprun his tufted barley yellow with the sun sees clouds propitious shed their timely store and all his harvest gathered round his door but still unsafe the big sowln grain below a favorite morsel with the rook and crow from field to field the flock increasing goes to level crops most formidable foes their danger well the wary plunderers know and place a watch on some conspicuous bough yet often the sculking gunner by surprise will scatter death amongst them as they rise these hung in triumph round the spacious field at best will but a shortlived terror yield nor guards of property not penal law but harmless riflemen of rags and straw familiarizd to these they boldly rove nor heed such sentinels that never move let then your birds lie prostrate on the earth in dying posture and with wings stretched forth shift them at eve or morn from place to place and death shall terrify the pilfering race in the mid air while circling round and round they will call their lifeless comrades from the ground with quickening wing and notes of loud alarm warn the whole flock to shun the impending harm this task had giles in fields remote from home often has he wished the rosy morn to come yet never famed was he nor foremost found to break the seal of sleep his sleep was sound but when at daybreak summoned from his bed light as the lark that carold over his head his sandy way deepworn by hasty showers oerarchd with oaks that formed fantastic bowers waving aloft their towering branches proud in borrowed tinges from the eastern cloud whence inspiration pure as ever flowed and genuine transport in his bosom glowed his own shrill matin joined the various notes of natures music from a thousand throats the blackbird strove with emulation sweet and echo answered from her close retreat the sporting whitethroat on some twigs end borne poured hymns to freedom and the rising morn stopped in her song perchance the starting thrush shook a white shower from the blackthorn bush where dewdrops thick as early blossoms hung and trembled as the minstrel sweetly sung across his path in either grove to hide the timid rabbit scouted by his side or bold cockpheasant stalked along the road whose gold and purple tints alternate glowed but groves no further fenced the devious way a wideextended heath before him lay where on the grass the stagnant shower had run and shone a mirror to the rising sun thus doubly seen lighting a distant wood giving new life to each expanding bud effacing quick the dewy footmarks found where prowling reynard trod his nightly round to shun whose thefts twas giless evening care his feathered victims to suspend in air high on the bough that nodded over his head and thus each morn to strew the field with dead his simple errand done he homeward hies another instantly its place supplies the clattring dairymaid immersed in steam singing and scrubbing midst her milk and cream bawls out go fetch the cows he hears no more for pigs and ducks and turkies throng the door and sitting hens for constant war prepared a concert strange to that which late he heard straight to the meadow then he whistling goes with wellknown halloo calls his lazy cows down the rich pasture heedlessly they graze or hear the summon with an idle gaze for well they know the cowyard yields no more its tempting fragrance nor its wintry store reluctance marks their steps sedate and slow the right of conquest all the law they know subordinate they one by one succeed and one among them always takes the lead is ever foremost wheresoeer they stray allowed precedence undisputed sway with jealous pride her station is maintained for many a broil that post of honor gained at home the yard affords a grateful scene for spring makes even a miry cowyard clean thence from its chalky bed behold conveyed the rich manure that drenching winter made which pild near home grows green with many a weed a promised nutriment for autumns seed forth comes the maid and like the morning smiles the mistress too and followed close by giles a friendly tripod forms their humble seat with pails bright scoured and delicately sweet where shadowing elms obstruct the morning ray begins their work begins the simple lay the fullchargd udder yields its willing streams while mary sings some lovers amorous dreams and crouching giles beneath a neighboring tree tugs over his pail and chants with equal glee whose hat with tattered brim of knap so bare from the cows side purloins a coat of hair a mottled ensign of his harmless trade an unambitious peaceable cockade as unambitious too that cheerful aid the mistress yields beside her rosy maid with joy she views her plenteous reeking store and bears a brimmer to the dairy door her cows dismissed the luscious mead to roam till eve again recall them loaded home and now the dairy claims her choicest care and half her household find employment there slow rolls the churn its load of clogging cream at once foregoes its quality and name from knotty particles first floating wide congealing butters dashed from side to side streams of new milk through flowing coolers stray and snowwhite curd abounds and wholesome whey due north the unglazed windows cold and clear for warning sunbeams are unwelcome here brisk goes the work beneath each busy hand and giles must trudge whoever gives command a gibeonite that serves them all by turns he drains the pump from him the faggot burns from him the noisy hogs demand their food while at his heels run many a chirping brood or down his path in expectation stand with equal claims upon his strewing hand thus wastes the morn till each still pleasure sees the bustle over and pressed the newmade cheese unrivaled stands thy country cheese o giles whose very name alone engenders smiles whose fame abroad by every tongue is spoke the wellknown butt of many a flinty joke that pass like current coin the nation through and ah experience proves the satire true provisions grave thou ever craving mart dependant huge metropolis where art her poring thousands stows in breathless rooms midst poisonous smokes and steams and rattling looms where grandeur revels in unbounded stores restraint as slighted stranger at their doors thou like a whirlpool drainst the countries round till london market london price resound through every town round every passing load and dairy produce throngs the eastern road delicous veal and butter every hour from essex lowlands and the banks of stour and further far where numerous herds repose from orwells brink from weveny or ouse hence suffolk dairywives run mad for cream and leave their milk with nothing but its name its name derision and reproach pursue and strangers tell of three times skimd skyblue to cheese converted what can be its boast what but the common virtues of a post if drought overtake if faster than the knife most fair it bids for stubborn length of life and like the oaken shelf whereon it is laid mocks the weak efforts of the bending blade or in the hogtrough rests in perfect spite too big to swallow and too hard to bite inglorious victory ye cheshire meads or

nectar into stone neglected now the early daisy lies nor thou pale primrose bloomst the only prize advancing spring profusely spreads abroad flowers of all hues with sweetest fragrance stored wherever she treads love gladdens every plain delight on tiptoe bears her lucid train sweet hope with conscious brow before her flies anticipating wealth from summer skies all nature feels her renovating sway the sheepfed pasture and the meadow gay and trees and shrubs no longer budding seen display the newgrown branch of lighter green on airy downs the shepherd idling lies and sees tomorrow in the marbled skies here then my soul thy darling theme pursue for every day was giles a shepherd too small was his charge no wilds had tay to roam but bright enclosures circling round their home nor yellowblossomd furze nor stubborn thorn the heaths rough produce had their fleeces torn yet ever roving ever seeking thee enchanting spirit dear variety o happy tenants prisoners of a day released to ease to pleasure and to play indulged through every field by turns to range and taste them all in one continual change for through luxuriant their grassy food sheep long confined but loathe the present good instinctively they haunt the homeward gate and starve and pine with plenty at their feet loosed from the winding lane a joyful throng see over yon pasture how they pour along giles round their boundaries takes his usual stroll sees every pass secured and fences whole high fences pround to charm the gazing eye where many a nestling first assays to fly where blows the woodbine faintly streaked with red and rests on every bough its tender head round the young ash its twining branches meet or crown the hawthorn with its odours sweet say ye that know ye who have felt and seen springs morning smiles and soulenlivning green say did you give the thrilling transport way did your eye brighten when young lambs at play leaped over your path with animated pride or gazed in merry clusters by your side ye who can smile to wisdom no disgrace at the arch meaning of a kittens face if spotless innocence and infant mirth excites to praise or gives reflection birth in shades like these pursue your favorite joy midst natures revels sports that never cloy a few begin a short but vigorous race and indolence abashed soon flies the place thus challenged forth see thither one by one from every side assembling playmates run a thousand wily anties mark their stay a starting crowd impatient of delay like the fond dove from fearful prison freed each seems to say come let us try our speed away they scour impetuous ardent strong the green turf trembling as they bound along adown the slope then up the hillock climb where every molehill is a bed of thyme there panting stop yet scarcely can refrain a bird a leaf will set them off again or if a gale with strength unusual blow scattering the wildbrier roses into snow their little limbs increasing efforts try like the torn flower the fair

heart though in the lap of plenty thoughtful still he looks beyond the present good or ill nor estimates alone one blessings worth from changeful seasons or capricious earth but views the future with the present hours and looks for failures as he looks for shower for casual as for certain want prepares and round his yard the reeking haystack rears or clover blossomed lovely to the sight his teams rich store through many a wintry night what though abundance round his dwelling spreads though ever moist his selfimproving meads supply his dairy with a copious flood and seem to promise unexhausted food that promise fails when buried deep in snow and vegetative juices cease to flow for this his plough turns up the destined lands whence stormy winter draws its full demands for this the seed minutely small he sows whence sound and sweet the hardy turnip grows but how unlike to aprils closing days high climbs the sun and darts his powerful rays whitens the freshdrawn mould and pierces through the cumbrous clods that tumble round the plough over heavens bright azure hence with joyful eyes the farmer sees dark clouds assembling rise borne over his fields a heavy torrent falls and strikes the earth in hasty driving squalls right welcome down ye precious drops he cries but soon too soon the partial blessing flies boy bring thy harrows try how deep the rain has fored its way he comes but comes in vain dry dust beneath the bubbling surface lurks and mocks his pains the more the more he works still midst huge clods he plunges on forlorn that laugh his harrows and the shower to scorn even thus the living clod the stubborn fool resists the stormy lectures of the school till tried with gentler means the dunce to please his head imbibes right reason by degrees as when from eve till mornings wakeful hour light constant rain evinces secret power and ere the day resume its wouted smiles presents a cheerful easy task for giles down with a touch the mellowd soil is laid and you tall crop next claims his timely aid thither well pleased he hies assured to find wild trackless haunts and objects to his mind shot up from broad rank blades that droop below the nodding wheatear forms a graceful bow with milky kernels starting full weighed down ere yet the sun has tinged its head with brown whilst thousands in a flock for every gay loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day and from the mazes of the leafy thorn drop one by one upon the bending corn giles with a pole assails their close retreats and round the grassgrown dewy border beats on either side completely overspread here branches bend there corn oertops his head green covert hail for through the varying year no hours so sweet no scene to him so dear here wisdoms placid eye delighted sees his frequent intervals of lonely case and with one ray his infant soul inspires just kindling there her neverdying fires whence solitude derives peculiar charms and heavendirected thought his bosom warms just where the parting boughs light shadows play scarce in the shade nor in the scorching day stretched on the turf he lies a peopled bed where swarming insects creep around his head the small dustcolourd beetle climbs with pain over the smooth plantainleaf a spacious plain thence higher still by countless steps conveyed he gains the summit of a shivering blade and flirts his filmy wings and looks around exulting in his distance from the ground the tender speckled moth here dancing seen the vaulting grasshopper of glossy green and all prolific summers sporting train their little lives by various powers sustain but what can unassisted vision do what but recoil where most it would pursue his patient gaze but finish with a sigh when music waking speaks the skylark nigh just starting from the corn she cheerly sings and trusts with conscious pride her downy wings still louder breathes and in the face of day mounts up and calls on giles to mark her way close to his eyes his hat he instant bends and forms a friendly telescope that lends just aid enough to dull the glaring light and place the wanding bird before his sight yet often beneath a cloud she sweeps along lost for awhile yet pours her varied song he views the spot and as the cloud moves by again she stretches up the clear blue sky her form her motion undistinguished quite save when she wheels direct from shade to light the fluttering songstress a mere speck became like fancys floating bubbles in a dream he sees her yet but yielding to repose unwittingly his jaded eyelids close delicious sleep from sleep who could forbear with no more guilt than giles and no more care peace over his slumbers waves her guardian wing nor conscience once disturbs him with a sting he wakes refreshed from every trivial pain and takes his pole and brushes round again its darkgreen hue its sicklier tints all fail and ripening harvest rustles in the gale a glorious sight if glory dwells below where heavens munificence makes all the show over every field and golden prospect found that glads the ploughmans sunday mornings round when on some eminence he takes his stand to judge the smiling produce of the land here vanity slinks back her head to hide what is there here to flatter human pride the towering fabric or the domes loud roar and steadfast columns may astonish more where the charmed gazer long delighted stays yet traced but to the architect the praise whilst here the veriest clown that treads the sod without one scruple gives the praise to god and twofold joys possess his raptured mind from gratitude and admiration joined here midst the boldest triumphs of her worth nature herself invites the reapers forth dares the keen sickle from its twelvemonths rest and gives that ardour which in every breast from infancy to age alike appears when the first sheaf its plumy top uprears no rake takes here what heaven to all bestows children of want for you the bounty flows and every cottage from the plenteous store receives a burden nightly at its door hark where the sweeping scythe now rips along each sturdy mower emulous and strong whose writhing form meridian heat defies bends over his work and every sinew tries prostrates the waving treasure at his feet but spares the rising clover short and sweet come health come jollity lightfooted come here hold your revels and make this your home each heart awaits and hails you as its own each moistened brow that scorns to wear a frown the unpeopled dwelling mourns its tenants strayed even the domestic laughing dairymaid hies to the field the general toil to share meanwhile the farmer quits his elbowchair his cool brickfloor his pitcher and his ease and braves the sultry beams and gladly sees his gates thrown open and his team abroad the ready group attendant on his word to turn the swarth the quivering load to rear or ply the busy rake the land to clear summers light garb itself now cumbrous grown each his thin doublet in the shade throws down where often the mastiff sculks with halfshut eye and rouses at the stranger passing by whilst unrestrained the social converse flows and every breast loves powerful impulse knows and rival wits with more than rustic grace confess the presence of a pretty face for lo encircled there the lovely maid in youths own bloom and native smiles arrayed her hat awry divested of her gown her creaking stays of leather stout and brown invidious barier why art thou so high when the slight covering of her neck slips by there half revealing to the eager sight her full ripe bosom exquisitely white in many a local tale of harmless mirth and many a jest of momentary birth she bears a part and as she stops to speak strokes back the ringlets from her glowing cheek now noon gone by and four declining hours the weary limbs relax their boasted powers thirst rages strong the fainting spirits fail and ask the sovereign cordial homebrewd ale beneath some sheltering heap of yellow corn rests the hoopd keg and friendly cooling horn that mocks alike the goblets brittle frame its costlier potions and its nobler name to mary first the brimming draught is given by toil made welcome as the dews of heaven and never lip that pressed its homely edge had kinder blessings or a heartier pledge of wholesome viands here a banquet smiles a common cheer for alleven humble giles who joys his trivial services to yield amidst the fragrance of the open field often doomed in suffocating heat to bear the cobwebd barns impure and dusty air to ride in murky state the panting steed destined aloft the unloaded grain to tread where in his path as heaps on heaps are thrown he rears and plunges the loose mountain down laborious task with what delight when done both horse and rider greet the unclouded sun yet by the unclouded sun are hourly bred the bold assailants that surround thine head poor patient ball and with insulting wing roar in thine ears and dart the piercing sting in thy behalf the crestwavd boughs avail more than thy shortclipt remnant of a tail a moving mockery a useless name a living proof of cruelty shame shame to the man whatever fame he bore who took from thee what man can never restore thy weapon of defense thy chiefest good when swarming flies contending suck thy blood nor thine alone the suffering thine the care the fretful ewe bemoans an equal share tormented into sores her head she hides or angry brushes from her newshorn sides penned in the yard even now at closing day unruly cows with marked impatience stay and vainly striving to escape their foes the pail kick down a piteous current flows is it not enough that plagues like these molest must still another foe annoy their rest he comes the pest and terror of the yard his fullfledgd progenys imperious guard the ganderspiteful insolent and bold at the colts footlock takes his daring hold there serpentlike escapes a dreadful blow and straight attacks a poor defenseless cow each booby goose the unworthy strife enjoys and hails his prowess with redoubled noise then back he stalks of selfimportance full seizes the shaggy foretop of the bull till whirled aloft he falls a timely check enough to dislocate his worthless neck for lo of old he boasts an honored wound behold that broken wing that trails the ground thus fools and bravoes kindred pranks pursue as savage quite and often as fatal too happy the man that foils an envious elf using the darts of spleen to serve himself as when by turns the strolling swine engage the utmost efforts of the bullys rage whose nibbling warfare on the grunters side is welcome pleasure to his bristly hide gently he stoops or lays himself along endures the insults of the gabbling throng that march exulting round his fallen head as human victors

laborers bless their sheltering homes when midnight and the frightful tempest comes the farmer wakes and sees with silent dread the angry shafts of heaven gleam round his bed the bursting cloud reiterated roars shakes his straw roof and jars his bolted doors the slowwingd storm along the troubled skies spreads its dark course the wind begins to rise and fullleavd elms his dwellings shade by day with mimic thunder give its fury way sounds in his chimney top a doleful peal midst pouring rain or gusts of rattling hail with tenfold danger low the tempest bends and quick and strong the sulphurous flame descends the frightned mastiff from his kennel flies and cringes at the door with piteous cries where now is the trifler where the child of pride these are the moments when the heart is tried nor lives the man with conscience ever so clear but feels a solemn reverential fear feels too a joy relieve his aching breast when the spent storm has howled itself to rest still welcome

adieu and winds blow keen where late the blossom grew the bustling day and jovial night must come the long accustomed feast of harvesthome no bloodstained victory in story bright can give the philosophic mind delight no triumph please whilst rage and death destroy reflection sickens at the monstrous joy and where the joy if rightly understood like cheerful praise for universal good the

the day from his strong hold blocked out perhaps to bleed or owe his life to fortune or to speed for now the pack impatient rushing on range through the darkest coverts one by one trace every spot whilst down each noble glade that guides the eye beneath a changeful shade the loitring sportsman feels the instinctive flame and checks his steed to mark the springing game midst intersecting cuts and winding ways the huntsman cheers his dogs and anxious strays where every narrow riding even shorn gives back the echo of his mellow horn till fresh and lightsome every power untried the starting fugitive leaps by his side his lifted finger to his ear he plies and the view halloo bids a chorus rise of dogs quickmouthd and shouts that mingle loud as bursting thunder rolls from cloud to cloud

many a log and rifted trunk conveys to heap the fire and to extend the blaze that quivering strong through every opening flies whilst smoaky columns unobstructed rise for the rude architect unknown to fame nor symmetry nor elegance his aim who spread his floors of solid oak on high on beams roughhewn from age to age that lie bade his wide fabric unimpaird sustain pomonas store and cheese and golden grain bade from its central base capacious laid the wellwrought chimney rear its lofty head where since has many a savoury ham been stored and tempests howled and christmas gambols roared flat on the hearth the glowing embers lie and flames reflected dance in every eye there the long billet forced at last to bend while frothing sap gushes at either end throws round its welcome heatthe ploughman smiles and often the joke runs hard on sheepish giles who sits joint tenant of the cornerstool the converse sharing though in dutys school for now attentively it is his to hear interrogations from the masters chair lift ye your bleating charge when daylight fled near where the haystack lifts its snowy head whose fence of bushy furze so close and warm may stop the slanting bullets of the storm for hark it blows a dark and dismal night heaven guide the travellers fearful steps aright now from the woods mistrustful and sharpeyd the fox in silent darkness seems to glide stealing around us listening as he goes if chance the cock or stammring capon crows or goose or nodding duck should darkling cry as if apprizd of lurking danger night destruction waits them giles if ever you fail to bolt their doors against the driving gale strewd you still mindful of the unshelterd head burdens of straw the cattles welcome bed thine heart should feel what thou may hourly see  that dutys basis is humanity of pains unsavory cup though thou may taste the wrath of winter from the bleak northeast  thine utmost sufferings in the coldest day a period terminates and joys repay perhaps even now whilst her those joys we boast full many a bark rides down the neighboring coast where the high northern waves tremendous roar drove down by blasts from norways icy shore the seaboy there less fortunate than thou feels all thy pains in all the gusts that blow his freezing hands now drenched now dry by turns now lost now seen the distant light that burns on some tall cliff upraisd a flaming guide that throws its friendly radiance over the tide his labors cease not with declining day but toils and perils mark his watery way and whilst in peaceful dreams secure we lie the ruthless whirlwinds rage along the sky round his head whistlingand shall thou repine whilst this protecting roof still shelters thine mild as the vernal shower his words prevail and aid the moral precept of his tale his wondering hearers learn and ever keep these first ideas of the reatless deep and as the opening mind a circuit tries present felicities in value rise increasing pleasures every hour they find the warmth more precious and he shelter kind warmth that long reigning bids the eyelids close as through the blood its balmy influence goes when the cheered heart forgets fatigues and cares and drowsiness alone dominion bears sweet then the ploughmans slumbers hale and young when the last topic dies upon his tongue sweet then the bliss his transient dreams inspire till chilblains wake him or the snapping fire he starts and ever thoughtful of his team along the glittering snow a feeble gleam shoots from his lantern as he yawning goes to add fresh comforts to their nights repose diffusing fragrance as their food he moves and pats the jolly sides of those he loves thus full replenished perfect ease possessed from might till morn alternate food and rest no rightful cheer withheld no sleep debarred their each days labor brings its sure reward yet when from plough or lumbring cart set free they taste awhile the sweets of liberty even sober dobbin lifts his clumsy heels and kicks disdainful of the dirty wheels but soon his frolic ended yields again to trudge the road and wear the clinking chain shortsighted dobbinthou can only see the trivial hardships that encompass thee thy chains were freedom and thy toils repose could the poor posthorse tell thee all his woes show thee his bleeding shoulders and unfold the dreadful anguish he endures for gold ird at each call of business lust or rage that prompt the traveller on from stage to stage still on his strength depends their boasted speed for them his limbs grow weak his bare ribs bleed and though he groaning quickens at command their extra shilling in the riders hand becomes his bitter scourgeit is he must feel the double efforts of the lash and steel till when uphill the destined inn he gains and trembling under complicated pains prone from his nostrils darting on the ground his breath emitted floats in clouds around drops chase each other down his chest and sides and spatterd mud his native color hides through his swollen veins the boiling torrent flows and every nerve a separate torture knows his harness loosed he welcomes eagereyed the pails full draught that quivers by his side and joys to see the wellknown stable door as the starved mariner the friendly shore ah well for him if here his sufferings ceased and ample hours of rest his pains appeased but roused again and sternly bade to rise and shake refreshing slumber from his eyes ere his exhausted spirits can return or through his frame reviving ardour burn come forth he must though limping maimed and sore he hears the whip the chaise is at the door the collar tightens and again he feels his halfheald wounds inflamed again the wheels with tiresome sameness in his ears resound over blinding dust or miles of flinty ground thus nightly robbed and injured day by day his piecemeal murdrers wear his life away what say thou dobbin what though hounds await with open jaws the moment of thy fate no better fate attends his public race his life is misery and his end disgrace then freely bear thy burden to the mill obey but one short lawthy drivers will affection to thy memory ever true shall boast of mighty loads that dobbin drew and back to childhood shall the mind with pride recount thy gentleness in many a ride to pond or field or village fair when thou heldst high thy braided mane and comely brow and often the tale shall rise to homely fame upon thy generous spirit and thy name though faithful to a proverb we regard the midnight chieftain of the farmers yard beneath whose guardianship all hearts rejoice woke by the echo of his hollow voice yet as the hound may faultring quit the pack snuff the foul scent and hasten yelping back and even the docile pointer know disgrace thwarting the general instinct of his race even so the mastiff or the meaner cur at times will from the path of duty err a pattern of fidelity by day by night a murderer lurking for his prey and round the pastures or the fold will creep and cowardlike attack the peaceful sheep alone the wanton mischief he pursues alone in reeking blood his jaws embrues chasing amain his frightned victims round till death in wild confusion strews the ground then wearied out to kennel sneaks away and licks his guilty paws till break of day the deed discovered and the news once spread vengeance hangs over the unknown culprits head and careful shepherds extra hours bestow in patient watchings for the common foe a foe most dreaded now when rest and peace should wait the season of the flocks increase in part these nightly terrors to dispel giles ere he sleeps his little flock must tell from the fireside with many a shrug he hies glad if the fullorbd moon salute his eyes and through the unbroken stillness of the night shed on his path her beams of cheering light with sauntring step he climbs the distant style whilst all around him wears a placid smile there views the whiterobd clouds in clusters driven and all the glorious pageantry of heaven low on the utmost boundry of the sight the rising vapors catch the silver light thence fancy measures as they parting fly which first will throw its shadow on they eye passing the source of light and thence away succeeded quick by brighter still than they for yet above these wafted clouds are seen in a remoter sky still more serene others detached in ranges through the air spotless as snow and countless as they are fair scattered immensely wide from east to west the beauteous semblance of a flock at rest these to the raptured mind aloud proclaim their mighty shepherds everlasting name whilst thus the loitrers utmost stretch of soul climbs the still clouds or passes those that roll and loosed imagination soaring goes high over his home and all his little woes time glides away neglected duty calls at once from plainss of light to earth he falls and down a narrow lane well known by day with all his speed pursues his sounding way in thought still half absorbed and chilled with cold when lo an object frightful to behold a grisly spectre clothed in silvergrey around whose feet the waving shadows play stands in his pathhe stops and not a breath heaves from his heart that sinks almost to death loud the owl halloos over his head unseen all else is silent dismally serene some prompt ejaculation whispered low yet bears him up against the threatening foe and thus poor giles though half inclined to fly mutters his doubts and strains his steadfast eye it is not my crimes thou come here to reprove no murders stain my soul no perjured love if you are indeed what here thou seem to be thy dreadful mission cannot reach to me by parents taught still to mistrust mine eyes still to approach each object of surprise lest fancys formful visions should deceive in moonlight paths or glooms of falling eve this then is the moment when my heart should try to scan thy motionless deformity but oh the fearful task yet well i know an aged ash with many a spreading bough beneath whose leaves i have found a summers bower beneath whose trunk i have weathered many a shower stands singly down this solitary way but far beyond where now my footsteps stay it is true thus far i have come with heedless haste no reckoning kept no passing objects traced and can i then have reached that very tree or is its reverend form assumed by thee the happy thought alleviates his pain he creeps another step then stops again till slowly as his noiseless feet draw near its perfect lineaments at once appear its crown of shivering ivy whispering peace and its white bark that fronts the moons pale face now whilst his blood mounts upward now he knows the solid gain that from conviction flows and strengthened confidence shall hence fulfill with conscious innocence more valued still the dreariest task that winter nights can bring by churchyard dark or grove or fairy ring still buoying up the timid mind of youth till loitring reason hoists the scale of truth with these blessed guardians giles his course pursues till numbering his heavysided ewes surrounding stillness tranquilize his breast and shape the dreams that wait his hours of rest as when retreating tempests we behold whose skirts at length the azure sky unfold and full of murmurings and mingled wrath slowly unshroud the smiling face of earth bringing the bosom joy so winter flies and see the source of life and light uprise a heightning arch over southern hills he bends warm on the cheek the slanting beam descends and gives the reeking mead a brighter hue and draws the modest primrose bud to view yet frosts succeed and winds impetuous rush and hailstorms rattle through the budding bush and nightfalln lambs require the shepherds care and teeming ewes that still their burdens bear beneath whose sides tomorrows dawn may see the milkwhite strangers bow the trembling knee at whose first birth the powerful instincts seen that fills with champions the daisied green for ewes that stood aloof with fearful eye with stamping foot now men and dogs defy and obstinately faithful to their young guard their first steps to join the bleating throng but casualties and death from damps and cold will still attend the wellconducted fold her tender offspring dead the dam aloud calls and runs wild amidst the unconscious crowd and orphand sucklings raise the piteous cry no wool to warm them no defenders nigh and must her streaming milk then flow in vain must unregarded innocence complain noere this strong solicitude subside maternal fondness may be fresh applied and the adopted stripling still may find a parent most assiduously kind for this he is doomed awhile disguised to range for fraud or force must work the wished for change for this his predecessors skin he wears till cheated into tenderness and cares the unsuspecting dam contented grown cherish and guard the fondling as her own thus all by turns to fair perfection rise thus twins are parted to increase their size thus instinct yields as interest points the way till the bright flock augmenting every day on sunny hills and vales of springing flowers with ceaseless clamor greet the vernal hours the humbler shepherd here with joy beholds the approved economy of crowded folds and in his small contracted round of cares adjusts the practice of each hint he hears for boys with emulation learn to glow and boast their pastures and their healthful show of wellgrown lambs the glory of the spring and field to field in competition bring even giles for all his cares and watchings past and all his contests with the wintry blast claims a full share of that sweet praise bestowed by gazing neighbors when along the road or village green his curlycoated throng suspends the chorus of the spinners song when admirations unaffected grace lisps from the tongue and beams in every face delightful momentssunshine health and joy play round and cheer the elevated boy  another spring his heart exulting cries

felicity of the nation as we might have supposed the simplicity of their whole life contributes to soften the appearance of distinctions and to reduce them to a level where the climate and the custom

necearies of life are within the reach of every individual at the expense of a trifting laboarambition and envy must in a great measure be unknown it is true the highest classes of people possess some dainty articles such as pork fish fowl and cloth almost exclusively but the desire of indulging the appetite in a few trg luxuries can at most render individuals and not whole nations unhappy absolute

the highest and the meanest man that subjecst in england between a reputable tradesman and a labors the affection of the otaheitans for their chiefs which they never failed to express upon all
