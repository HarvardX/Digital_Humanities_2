poems by william cowper esquire  vol ii  the task a poem in six books  by william cowper of the inner temple esquire  fit surculus arbor anonym to which are added by the same author an epistle to joseph hill esquire tirocinium or a review of schools and the history of john gilpin  london printed for j johnson no    st pauls churchyard       advertisement the history of the following production is briefly this a lady fond of blank verse demanded a poem of that kind from the author and gave him the sofa for a subject he obeyed and having much leisure connected another subject with it and pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of mind led him brought forth at length instead of the trifle which he at first intended a serious affair  a volume  in the poem on the subject of education he would be very sorry to stand suspected of having aimed his censure at any particular school his objections are such as naturally apply themselves to schools in general if there were not as for the most part there is wilful neglect in those who manage them and an omission even of such discipline as they are susceptible of the objects are yet too numerous for minute attention and the aching hearts of ten thousand parents mourning under the bitterest of all disappointments attest the truth of the allegation his quarrel therefore is with the mischief at large and not with any particular instance of it  argument of the first book historical deduction of seats from the stool to the sofa  a schoolboys ramble  a walk in the country  the scene described  rural sounds as well as sights delightful  another walk  mistake concerning the charms of solitude corrected  colonnades commended  alcove and the view from it  the wilderness  the grove  the thresher  the necessity and the benefits of exercise  the works of nature superior to and in some instances inimitable by art  the wearisomeness of what is commonly called a life of pleasure  change of scene sometimes expedient  a common described and the character of crazy kate introduced upou it  gypsies  the blessings of civilized life  that state most favorable to virtue  the south sea islanders compassionated but chiefly omai  his present state of mind supposed  civilized life friendly to virtue but not great cities  great cities and london in particular allowed their due praise but censured  fete champetre  the book concludes with a reflection on the fatal effects of dissipation and effeminacy upon our public measures  book i the sofa i sing the sofa i who lately sang truth hope and charity and touched with awe the solemn chords and with a trembling hand escaped with pain from that adventurous flight now seek repose upon an humbler theme the theme though humble yet august and proud the occasion  for the fair commands the song time was when clothing sumptuous or for use save their own painted skins our sires had none as yet black breeches were not satin smooth or velvet soft or plush with shaggy pile the hardy chief upon the rugged rock washed by the sea or on the gravly bank thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud fearless of wrong reposed his weary strength those barbarous ages past succeeded next the birthday of invention weak at first dull in design and clumsy to perform jointstools were then created on three legs upborne they stood three legs upholding firm a massy slab in fashion square or round on such a stool immortal alfred sat and swayed the scepter of his infant realms and such in ancient halls and mansions drear may still be seen but perforated sore and drilled in holes the solid oak is found by worms voracious eating through and through at length a generation more refined improved the simple plan made three legs four gave them a twisted form vermicular and over the seat with plenteous wadding stuffed induced a splendid cover green and blue yellow and red of tapestry richly wrought and woven close or needle work sublime there might ye see the pioney spread wide the fullblown rose the shepherd and his lass lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes and parrots with twin cherries in their beak now came the cane from india smooth and bright with natures varnish severed into stripes that interlaced each other these supplied of texture firm a lattice work that braced the new machine and it became a chair but restless was the chair the back erect distressed the weary loins that felt no ease the slippery seat betrayed the sliding part that pressed it and the feet hung dangling down anxious in vain to find the distant floor these for the rich the rest whom fate had placed in modest mediocrity content with base materials sat on well tanned hides obdurate and unyielding glassy smooth with here and there a tuft of crimson yarn or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixed if cushion might be called what harder seemed than the firm oak of which the frame was formed no want of timber then was felt or feared in albions happy isle the umber stood ponderous and fixed by its own massy weight but elbows still were wanting these some say an alderman of cripplegate contrived and some ascribe the invention to a priest burly and big and studious of his ease but rude at first and not with easy slope receding wide they pressed against the ribs and bruised the side and elevated high taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears long time elapsed or ever our rugged sires complained though incommodiously pent in and ill at ease behind the ladies first gan murmur as became the softer sex ingenious fancy never better pleased than when employed to accommodate the fair heard the sweet moan with pity and devised the soft settee one elbow at each end and in the midst an elbow it received united yet divided twain at once so sit two kings of brentford on one throne and so two citizens who take the air close packed and smiling in a chaise and one but relaxation of the languid frame by soft recumbency of outstretched limbs was bliss reserved for happier days so slow the growth of what is excellent so hard tattain perfection in this nether world thus first necessity invented stools convenience next suggested elbow chairs and luxury the accomplished sofa last the nurse sleeps sweetly hired to watch the sick whom snoring she disturbs as sweetly he who quits the coachbox at the midnight hour to sleep within the carriage more secure his legs depending at the open door sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk the tedious rector drawling over his head and sweet the clerk below but neither sleep of lazy nurse who snores the sick man dead nor his who quits the box at midnight hour to slumber in the carriage more secure nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet compared with the repose the sofa yields oh may i live exempted while i live guiltless of pampered appetite obscene from pangs arthritic that infest the toe of libertine excess the sofa suits the gouty limb it is true but gouty limb though on a sofa may i never feel for i have loved the rural walk through lanes of grassy swarth close cropped by nibbling sheep and skirted thick with intertexture firm of thorny boughs have loved the rural walk over hills through valleys and by rivers brink ever since a truant boy i passed my bounds to enjoy a ramble on the banks of thames and still remember nor without regret of hours that sorrow since has much endeared how often my slice of pocket store consumed still hungring pennyless and far from home i fed on scarlet hips and stoney haws or blushing crabs or berries that imboss the bramble black as jet or sloes austere hard fare but such as boyish appetite disdains not nor the palate undepraved by culinary arts unsavry deems no sofa then awaited my return nor sofa then i needed youth repairs his wasted spirits quickly by long toil incurring short fatigue and though our years as life declines speed rapidly away and not a year but pilfers as he goes some youthful grace that age would gladly keep a tooth or auburn lock and by degrees their length and color from the locks they spare the elastic spring of an unwearied foot that mounts the style with ease or leaps the fence that play of lungs inhaling and again respiring freely the fresh air that makes swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me mine have not pilferd yet nor yet impaired my relish of fair prospect scenes that soothed or charmed me young no longer young i find still soothing and of power to charm me still and witness dear companion of my walks whose arm this twentieth winter i perceive fast locked in mine with pleasure such as love confirmed by long experience of thy worth and welltried virtues could alone inspire  witness a joy that thou have doubled long thou know my praise of nature most sincere and that my raptures are not conjured up to serve occasions of poetic pomp but genuine and art partner of them all how often upon yon eminence our pace has slackened to a pause and we have borne the ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew while admiration feeding at the eye and still unsated dwelt upon the scene thence with what pleasure have we just discerned the distant plough slowmoving and beside his laboring team that swerved not from the track the sturdy swain diminished to a boy here ouse slow winding through a level plain of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled over conducts the eye along his sinuous course delighted there fast rooted in his bank stand never overlooked our favorite elms that screen the herdsmans solitary hut while far beyond and overthwart the stream that as with molten glass inlays the vale the sloping land recedes into the clouds displaying on its varied side the grace of hedgerow beauties numberless square tower tall spire from which the sound of cheerful bells just undulates upon the listening ear groves heaths and smoking villages remote scenes must be beautiful which daily viewed please daily and whose novelty survives long knowledge and the scrutiny of years praise justly due to those that i describe nor rural sights alone but rural sounds exhilarate the spirit and restore the tone of languid nature mighty winds that sweep the skirt of some farspreading wood of ancient growth make music not unlike the dash of ocean on his winding shore and lull the spirit while they fill the mind unnumberd branches waving in the blast and all their leaves fast fluttering all at once nor less composure waits upon the roar of distant floods or on the softer voice of neighboring fountain or of rills that slip through the cleft rock and chiming as they fall upon loose pebbles lose themselves at length in matted grass that with a livelier green betrays the secret of their silent course nature inanimate employs sweet sounds but animated nature sweeter still to sooth and satisfy the human ear ten thousand warblers cheer the day and one the livelong night nor these alone whose notes nicefingerd art must emulate in vain but cawing rooks and kites that swim sublime in still repeated circles screaming loud the jay the pie and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon have charms for me sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns and only there please highly for their sake peace to the artist whose ingenious thought devised the weatherhouse that useful toy fearless of humid air and gathering rains forth steps the man an emblem of myself more delicate his timorous mate retires when winter soaks the fields and female feet too weak to struggle with tenacious clay or ford the rivulets are best at home the task of new discovries falls on me at such a season and with such a charge once went i forth and found till then unknown a cottage whither often we since repair it is perched upon the greenhill top but close environed with a ring of branching elms that overhang the thatch itself unseen peeps at the vale below so thick beset with foliage of such dark redundant growth i called the lowroofd lodge the peasants nest and hidden as it is and far remote from such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear in village or in town the bay of curs incessant clinking hammers grinding wheels and infants clamorous whether pleased or pained often have i wished the peaceful covert mine here i have said at least i should possess the poets treasure silence and indulge the dreams of fancy tranquil and secure vain thought the dweller in that still retreat dearly obtains the refuge it affords its elevated site forbids the wretch yo drink sweet waters of the crystal well he dips his bowl into the weedy ditch and heavyladen brings his bevrage home farfetched and little worth nor seldom waits dependent on the bakers punctual call to hear his creaking panniers at the door angry and sad and his last crust consumed so farewell envy of the peasants nest if solitude make scant the means of life society for me thou seeming sweet be still a pleasing object in my view my visit still but never mine abode not distant far a length of colonade invites us monument of ancient taste now scorned but worthy of a better fate our fathers knew the value of a screen from sultry suns and in their shaded walks and longprotracted bowers enjoyed at noon the gloom and coolness of declining day we bear our shades about us self deprived of other screen the thin umbrella spread and range an indian waste without a tree thanks to john courtney throckmorton esquire of weston underwood benevolus  he spares me yet these chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines and though himself so polished still reprieves the obsolete prolixity of shade descending now but cautious lest too fast a sudden steep upon a rustic bridge we pass a gulf in which the willows dip their pendent boughs stooping as if to drink hence ancle deep in moss and flowery thyme we mount again and feel at every step our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft raised by the mole the miner of the soil he not unlike the great ones of mankind disfigures earth and plotting in the dark toils much to earn a monumental pile that may record the mischiefs he has done the summit gained behold the proud alcove that crowns it yet not all its pride secures the grand retreat from injuries impressed by rural carvers who with knives deface the pannels leaving an obscure rude name in characters uncouth and spelt amiss so strong the zeal to immortalize himself beats in the breast of man that even a few few transient years won from the abyss abhorred of blank oblivion seem a glorious prize and even to a clown now roves the eye and posted on this speculative height exults in its command the sheepfold here pours out its fleecy tenants over the glebe at first progressive as a stream they seek the middle field but scattered by degrees each to his choice soon whiten all the land there from the sunburned hayfield homeward creeps the loaded wain while lightened of its charge the wain that meets it passes swiftly by the boorish driver leaning over his team vocifrous and impatient of delay nor less attractive is the woodland scene diversified with trees of every growth alike yet various here the gray smooth trunks of ash or lime or beech distinctly shine within the twilight of their distant shades there lost behind a rising ground the wood seems sunk and shortened to its topmost boughs no tree in all the grove but has its charms though each its hue peculiar paler some and of a wannish gray the willow such and poplar that with silver lines his leaf and ash farstretching his umbrageous arm of deeper green the elm and deeper still lord of the woods the longsurviving oak some glossyleavd and shining in the sun the maple and the beech of oily nuts prolific and the lime at dewy eve diffusing odors nor unnoted pass the sycamore capricious in attire now green now tawny and ere autumn yet have changed the woods in scarlet honors bright over these but far beyond a spacious map of hill and valley interposed between the ouse dividing the well watered land now glitters in the sun and now retires as bashful yet impatient to be seen hence the declivity is sharp and short and such the reascent between them weeps a little naiad her impovrishd urn all summer long which winter fills again the folded gates would bar my progress now but that the sea the foregoing note lord of this enclosed demesne communicative of the good he owns admits me to a share the guiltless eye commits no wrong nor wastes what it enjoys refreshing change where now the blazing sun by short transition we have lost his glare and stepped at once into a cooler clime ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited once more rejoice that yet a remnant of your race survives how airy and how light the graceful arch yet awful as the consecrated roof reechoing pious anthems while beneath the checkered earth seems restless as a flood brushed by the wind so sportive is the light shot through the boughs it dances as they dance shadow and sunshine intermingling quick and darkning and enlightening as the leaves play wanton every moment every spot and now with nerves newbracd and spirits cheered we tread the wilderness whose wellrolld walks with curvature of slow and easy sweep deception innocent  give ample space to narrow bounds the grove receives us next between the upright shafts of whose tall elms we may discern the thresher at his task thump after thump resounds the constant flail that seems to swing uncertain and yet falls full on the destined ear wide flies the chaff the rustling straw sends up a frequent mist of atoms sparkling in the noonday beam come hither ye that press your beds of down and sleep not see him sweating over his bread before he eats it  it is the primal curse but softened into mercy made the pledge of cheerful days and nights without a groan by ceaseless action all that is subsists constant rotation of the unwearied wheel that nature rides upon maintains her health her beauty her fertility she dreads an instants pause and lives but while she moves its own revolvency upholds the world winds from all quarters agitate the air and fit the limpid element for use else noxious oceans rivers lakes and streams all feel the freshning impulse and are cleansed by restless undulation even the oak thrives by the rude concussion of the storm he seems indeed indignant and to feel the impression of the blast with proud disdain frowning as if in his unconscious arm he held the thunder but the monarch owes his firm stability to what he scorns more fixed below the more disturbed above the law by which all creatures else are bound binds man the lord of all himself derives no mean advantage from a kindred cause from strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease the sedentary stretch their lazy length when custom bids but no refreshment find for none they need the languid eye the cheek deserted of its bloom the flaccid shrunk and withered muscle and the vapid soul reproach their owner with that love of rest to which he forfeits even the rest he loves not such the alert and active measure life by its true worth the comforts it affords and theirs alone seems worthy of the name good health and its associate in the most good temper spirits prompt to undertake and not soon spent though in an arduous task the powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs even age itself seems privileged in them with clear exemption from its own defects a sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front the vetran shows and gracing a gray beard with youthful smiles descends toward the grave sprightly and old almost without decay like a coy maiden ease when courted most farthest retires  an idol at whose shrine who oftnest sacrifice are favored least the love of nature and the scenes she draws is natures dictate strange there should be found who selfimprisond in their proud saloons renounce the odors of the open field for the unscented fictions of the loom who satisfied with only pencild scenes prefer to the performance of a god the inferior wonders of an artists hand lovely indeed the mimic works of art but natures works far lovelier i admire  none more admires the painters magic skill who shows me that which i shall never see conveys a distant country into mine and throws italian light on english walls but imitative strokes can do no more than please the eye sweet nature every sense the air salubrious of her lofty hills the chearing fragrance of her dewy vales and music of her woods  no works of man may rival these these all bespeak a power peculiar and exclusively her own beneath the open sky she spreads the feast it is free to all  it is every day renewed who scorns it starves deservedly at home he does not scorn it who imprisoned long in some unwholesome dungeon and a prey to sallow sickness which the vapors dank and clammy of his dark abode have bred escapes at last to liberty and light his cheek recovers soon its healthful hue his eye relumines its extinguished fires he walks he leaps he runs  is winged with joy and riots in the sweets of every breeze he does not scorn it who has long endured a fevers agonies and fed on drugs nor yet the mariner his blood inflamed with acrid salts his very heart athirst to gaze at nature in her green array upon the ships tall side he stands possessed with visions prompted by intense desire fair fields appear below such as he left far distant such as he would die to find  he seeks them headlong and is seen no more the spleen is seldom felt where flora reigns the lowering eye the petulance the frown and sullen sadness that oershade distort and mar the face of beauty when no cause for such immeasurable woe appears these flora banishes and gives the fair sweet smiles and bloom less transient than her own it is the constant revolution stale and tasteless of the same repeated joys that palls and satiates and makes languid life a pedlars pack that bows the bearer down health suffers and the spirits ebb the heart recoils from its own choice  at the full feast is famished  finds no music in the song no smartness in the jest and wonders why yet thousands still desire to journey on though halt and weary of the path they tread the paralitic who can hold her cards but cannot play them borrows a friends hand to deal and shuffle to divide and sort her mingled suits and sequences and sits spectatress both and spectacle a sad and silent cipher while her proxy plays others are dragged into the crowded room between supporters and once seated sit through downright inability to rise till the stout bearers lift the corpse again these speak a loud memento yet even these themselves love life and cling to it as he that overhangs a torrent to a twig they love it and yet loath it fear to die yet scorn the purposes for which they live then wherefore not renounce them no  the dread the slavish dread of solitude that breeds reflection and remorse the fear of shame and their invetrate habits all forbid whom call we gay that honor has been long the boast of mere pretenders to the name the innocent are gay  the lark is gay that dries his feathers saturate with dew beneath the rosy cloud while yet the beams of dayspring overshoot his humble nest the peasant too a witness of his song himself a songster is as gay as he but save me from the gaiety of those whose headaches nail them to a noonday bed and save me too from theirs whose haggard eyes flash desperation and betray their pangs for property stripped off by cruel chance from gaiety that fills the bones with pain the mouth with blasphemy the heart with woe the earth was made so various that the mind of desultory man studious of change and pleased with novelty might be indulged prospects however lovely may be seen till half their beauties fade the weary sight too well acquainted with their smiles slides off fastidious seeking less familiar scenes then snug enclosures in the sheltered vale where frequent hedges intercept the eye delight us happy to renounce a while not senseless of its charms what still we love that such short absence may endear it more then forests or the savage rock may please that hides the seamew in his hollow clefts above the reach of man his hoary head conspicuous many a league the mariner bound homeward and in hope already there greets with three cheers exulting at his waist a girdle of halfwitherd shrubs he shows and at his feet the baffled billows die the common overgrown with fern and rough with prickly goss that shapeless and deform and dangerous to the touch has yet its bloom and decks itself with ornaments of gold yields no unpleasing ramble there the turf smells fresh and rich in odorifrous herbs and fungous fruits of earth regales the sense with luxury of unexpected sweets there often wanders one whom better days saw better clad in cloak of satin trimmed with lace and hat with splendid ribband bound a serving maid was she and fell in love with one who left her went to sea and died her fancy followed him through foaming waves to distant shores and she would sit and weep at what a sailor suffers fancy too delusive most where warmest wishes are would often anticipate his glad return and dream of transports she was not to know she heard the doleful tidings of his death and never smiled again and now she roams the dreary waste there spends the livelong day and there unless when charity forbids the livelong night a tattered apron hides worn as a cloak and hardly hides a gown more tattered still and both but ill conceal a bosom heaved with neverceasing sighs she begs an idle pin of all she meets and hoards them in her sleeve but needful food though pressed with hunger often or comelier clothes though pinched with cold asks never  kate is crazed i see a column of slowrising smoke oertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild a vagabond and useless tribe there eat their miserable meal a kettle slung between two poles upon a stick transverse receives the morsel flesh obscene of dog or vermin or at best of cock purloind from his accustomed perch hardfaring race they pick their fuel out of every hedge which kindled with dry leaves just saves unquenchd the spark of life the sportive wind blows wide their fluttering rags and shows a tawny skin the vellum of the pedigree they claim great skill have they in palmistry and more to conjure clean away the gold they touch conveying worthless dross into its place loud when they beg dumb only when they steal strange that a creature rational and cast in human mould should brutalize by choice his nature and though capable of arts by which the world might profit and himself selfbanishd from fociety prefer such squalid sloth to honorable toil yet even these though feigning sickness often they swathe the forehead drag the limping limb and vex their flesh with artificial sores can change their whine into a mirthful note when safe occasion offers and with dance and music of the bladder and the bag beguile their woes and make the woods resound such health and gaiety of heart enjoy the houseless rovers of the sylvan world and breathing wholesome air and wandering much need other physic none to heal the effects of loathfome diet penury and cold blessed he though undistinguished from the crowd by wealth or dignity who dwells secure where man by nature fierce has laid aside his fierceness having learnt though slow to learn the manners and the arts of civil life his wants indeed are many but supply is obvious placed within the easy reach of temperate wishes and industrious hands here virtue thrives as in her proper soil not rude and surly and beset with thorns and terrible to sight as when she springs if ever she spring spontaneous in remote and barbarous climes where violence prevails and strength is lord of all but gentle kind by culture tamed by liberty refreshed and all her fruits by radiant truth maturd war and the chase engross the savage whole war followed for revenge or to supplant the envied tenants of some happier spot the chase for sustenance precarious trust his hard condition with severe constraint binds all his faculties forbids all growth of wisdom proves a school in which he learns sly circumvention unrelenting hate mean selfattachment and scarce aught beside thus fare the shivering natives of the north and thus the rangers of the western world where it advances far into the deep toward the antarctic even the favored isles so lately found although the constant sun cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile can boast but little virtue and inert through plenty lose in morals what they gain in manners victims of luxurious ease these therefore i can pity placed remote from all that science traces art invents or inspiration teaches and enclosed in boundless oceans never to be passed by navigators uninformed as they or ploughd perhaps by british bark again but far beyond the rest and with most cause thee gentle omia savage whom no love of thee or thine but curiosity perhaps or else vain glory prompted us to draw forth from thy native bowers to show thee here with what superior skill we can abuse the gifts of providence and squander life the dream is past and thou have found again thy cocoas and bananas palms and yams and homestall thatched with leaves but have thou found their former charms and having seen our state our palaces our ladies and our pomp of equipage our gardens and our sports and heard our music are thy simple friends thy simple fare and all thy plain delights as dear to thee as once and have thy joys lost nothing by comparison with ours rude as thou art for we returned thee rude and ignorant except of outward show i cannot think thee yet so dull of heart and spiritless as never to regret sweets tasted here and left as soon as known methinks i see thee straying on the beach and asking of the surge that bathes thy foot if ever it has washed our distant shore i see thee weep and thine are honest tears a patriots for his country thou art sad at thought of her forlorn and abject state from which no power of thine can raise her up thus fancy paints thee and though apt to err perhaps errs little when she paints thee thus she tells me too that duly every morn thou climbst the mountain top with eager eye exploring far and wide the watery waste for sight of ship from england every speck seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale with conflict of contending hopes and fears but comes at last the dull and dusky eve and sends thee to thy cabin wellprepard to dream all night of what the day denied alas expect it not we found no bait to tempt us in thy country doing good disinterested good is not our trade we travel far it is true but not for naught and must be bribed to compass earth again by other hopes and richer fruits than yours but though true worth and virtue in the mild and genial soil of cultivated life thrive most and may perhaps thrive only there yet not in cities often in proud and gay and gain devoted cities thither flow as to a common and most noisome sewer the dregs and faeculence of every land in cities foul example on most minds begets its likeness rank abundance breeds in gross and pampered cities sloth and lust and wantonness and gluttonous excess in cities vice is hidden with most ease or seen with least reproach and virtue taught by frequent lapse can hope no triumph there beyond the achievement of successful flight i do confess them nursries of the arts in which they flourish most where in the beams of warm encouragement and in the eye of public note they reach their perfect size such london is by taste and wealth proclaimed the fairest capital of all the world by riot and incontinence the worst there touched by reynolds a dull blank becomes a lucid mirror in which nature sees all her reflected features bacon there gives more than female beauty to a stone and chathams eloquence to marble lips nor does the chissel occupy alone the powers of sculpture but the style as much each province of her art her equal care with nice incision of her guided steel she ploughs a brazen field and clothes a soil so sterile with what charms soever she will the richest scenry and the loveliest forms where finds philosophy her eagle eye with which she gazes at yon burning disk undazzled and detects and counts his spots in london where her implements exact with which she calculates computes and scans all distance motion magnitude and now measures an atom and now girds a world in london where has commerce such a mart so rich so thronged so drained and so supplied as london opulent enlarged and still increasing london babylon of old not more the glory of the earth than she a more accomplished worlds chief glory now she has her praise now mark a spot or two that so much beauty would do well to purge and show this queen of cities that so fair may yet be foul so witty yet not wise it is not seemly nor of good report that she is slack in discipline more prompt tavenge than to prevent the breach of law that she is rigid in denouncing death on petty robbers and indulges life and liberty and ofttimes honor too to peculators of the public gold that thieves at home must hang but he that puts into his overgorged and bloated purse the wealth of indian provinces escapes nor is it well nor can it come to good that through profane and infidel contempt of holy writ she has presumed tannul and abrogate as roundly as she may the total ordonance and will of god advancing fashion to the post of truth and centring all authority in modes and customs of her own till sabbath rites have dwindled into unrespected forms and knees and hassocks are wellnigh divorced god made the country and man made the town what wonder then that health and virtue gifts that can alone make sweet the bitter draught that life holds out to all should most abound and least be threatened in the fields and groves possess ye therefore ye who borne about in chariots and sedans know no fatigue but that of idleness and taste no scenes but such as art contrives possess ye still your element there only ye can shine there only minds like yours can do no harm our groves were planted to console at noon the pensive wanderer in their shades at eve the moonbeam sliding softly in between the sleeping leaves is all the light they wish birds warbling all the music we can spare the splendour of your lamps they but eclipse our softer satellite your songs confound our more harmonious notes the thrush departs scared and the offended nightingale is mute there is a public mischief in your mirth it plagues your country folly such as yours graced with a sword and worthier of

a lodge in some vast wilderness some boundless continguity of shade where rumor of oppression and deceit of unsuccessful or successful war might never reach me more my ear is pained my soul is sick with every days report of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled there is no flesh in mans obdurate heart it does not feel for man the natural bond of brotherhood is severed as the flax that falls asunder at the touch of fire he finds his fellow guilty of a skin not colored like his own and having power to enforce the wrong sor such a worthy cause dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey lands intersected by a narrow frith abhor each other mountains interposed make enemies of nations who had else like kindred drops been mingled into one thus man devotes his brother and destroys and worse than all and most to be deplored as human natures broadest foulest blot chains him and tasks him and exacts his sweat with stripes that mercy with a bleeding heart weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast then what is man and what man seeing this and having human feelings does not blush and hang his head to think himself a man i would not have a slave to till my ground to carry me to fan me while i sleep and tremble when i wake for all the wealth that sinews bought and sold have ever earned no dear as freedom is and in my hearts just estimation prized above all price i had much rather be myself the slave and wear the bonds than fasten them on him we have no slaves at home  then why abroad and they themselves once ferried over the wave that parts us are emancipate and loosed slaves cannot breathe in england if their lungs receive our air that moment they are free they touch our country and their shackles fall that is noble and bespeaks a nation proud and jealous of the blessing spread it then and let it circulate through every vein of all your empire that where britains power is felt mankind may feel her mercy too sure there is need of social intercourse benevolence and peace and mutual aid between the nations in a world that seems to toll the deathbell of its own decease and by the voice of all its elements to preach the general doom alluding to the late calamities at jamaica when were the winds let slip with such a warrant to destroy when did the waves so haughtily oerleap their ancient barriers deluging the dry fires from beneath and meteors august         from above portentous unexampled unexplained have kindled beacons in the skies and the old and crazy earth has had her shaking fits more frequent and foregone her usual rest is it a time to wrangle when the props and pillars of our planet seem to fail and nature alluding to the fog that covered both europe and asia during the whole summer of      with a dim and sickly eye to wait the close of all but grant her end more distant and that prophecy demands a longer respite unaccomplished yet still they are frowning signals and bespeak displeasure in his breast who smites the earth or heals it makes it languish or rejoice and it is but seemly that where all deserve and stand exposed by common peccancy to what no few have felt there should be peace and brethren in calamity should love alas for sicily rude fragments now lie scattered where the shapely column stood her palaces are dust in all her streets the voice of singing and the sprightly chord are silent revelry and dance and show

busy and his frown is felt the rocks fall headlong and the valleys rise the rivers die into offensive pools and charged with putrid verdure breathe a gross and mortal nuisance into all the air what solid was by transformation strange grows fluid and the fixed and rooted earth tormented into billows heaves and swells or with vortiginous and hideous whirl sucks down its prey insatiable immense the tumult and the overthrow the pangs and agonies of human and of brute multitudes fugitive on every side and fugitive in vain the sylvan scene migrates uplifted and with all its soil alighting in far distant fields finds out a new possessor and survives the change ocean has caught the frenzy and upwrought to an enormous and oerbearing height not by a mighty wind but by that voice which winds and waves obey invades the shore resistless never such a sudden flood upridged so high and sent on such a charge possessed an inland scene where now the throng that pressed the beach and hasty to depart looked to the sea for safety they are gone gone with the refluent wave into the deep a prince with half his people ancient towers and roofs embattled high the gloomy scenes where beauty often and lettered worth consume life in the unproductive shades of death fall prone the pale inhabitants come forth and happy in their unforeseen release from all the rigors of restraint enjoy the terrors of the day that sets them free who then that has thee would not hold thee fast freedom whom they that lose thee so regret that even a judgment making way for thee seems in their eyes a mercy for thy sake such evil sin has wrought and such a flame kindled in heaven that it burns down to earth and in the furious inquest that it makes on gods behalf lays waste his fairest works the very elements though each be meant the minister of man to serve his wants conspire against him with his breath he draws a plague into his blood and cannot use lifes necessary means but he must die storms rise to overwhelm him or if stormy winds rise not the waters of the deep shall rise and needing none assistance of the storm shall roll themselves ashore and reach him there the earth shall shake him out of all his holds or make his house his grave nor so content shall counterfeit the motions of the flood and drown him in her dry and dusty gulphs what then  were they the wicked above all and we the righteous whose fastanchord isle moved not while theirs was rocked like a light skiff the sport of every wave no none are clear and none than we more guilty but where all stand chargeable with guilt and to the shafts of wrath obnoxious god may choose his mark may punish if he please the less to warn the more malignant if he spared not them tremble and be amazed at thine escape far guiltier england lest he spare not thee happy the man who sees a god employed in all the good and ill that checquer life resolving all events with their effects and manifold results into the will and arbitration wise of the supreme did not his eye rule all things and intend the least of our concerns since from the least the greatest often originate could chance find place in his dominion or dispose one lawless particle to thwart his plan then god might be surprised and unforeseen contingence might alarm him and disturb the smooth and equal course of his affairs this truth philosophy though eagleeyed in natures tendencies often overlooks and having found his instrument forgets or disregards or more presumptuous still denies the power that wields it god proclaims his hot displeasure against foolish men that live an atheist life involves the heaven in tempests quits his grasp upon the winds and gives them all their fury bids a plague kindle a fiery boil upon the skin and putrify the breath of blooming health he calls for famine and the meagre fiend blows mildew from between his shriveld lips and taints the golden ear he springs his mines and desolates a nation at a blast forth steps the spruce philosopher and tells of homogeneal and discordant springs and principles of causes how they work by necessary laws their sure effects of action and reaction he has found the source of the disease that nature feels and bids the world take heart and banish fear thou fool will thy discovry of the cause suspend the effect or heal it has not god still wrought by means since first he made the world and did he not of old employ his means to drown it what is his creation less than a capacious reservoir of means formed for his use and ready at his will go dress thine eyes with eye salve ask of him or ask of whomsoever he has taught and learn though late the genuine cause of all england with all thy faults i love thee still my country and while yet a nook is left where english minds and manners may be found shall be constrained to love thee though thy clime be fickle and thy year most part deformed with dripping rains or withered by a frost i would not yet exchange thy sullen skies and fields without a flower for warmer france with all her vines nor for ausonias groves of golden fruitage and her myrtle bowers to shake thy senate and from heights sublime of patriot eloquence to flash down fire upon thy foes was never meant my task but i can feel thy fortunes and partake thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart as any thundrer there and i can feel thy follies too and with a just disdain frown at effeminates whose very looks reflect dishonor on the land i love how in the name of soldiership and sense should england prosper when such things as smooth and tender as a girl all essenced over with odors and as profligate as sweet who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath and love when they should fight when such as these presume to lay their hand upon the ark of her magnificent and awful cause time was when it was praise and boast enough in every clime and travel where we might that we were born her children praise enough to fill the ambition of a private man that chathams language was his mother tongue and wolfes great name compatriot with his own farewell those honors and farewell with them the hope of such hereafter they have fallen each in his field of glory one in arms and one in council wolf upon the lap of smiling victory that moment won and chatham heartsick of his countrys shame they made us many soldiers chatham still consulting englands happiness at home secured it by an unforgiving frown if any wronged her wolf wherever he fought put so much of his heart into his act that his example had a magnets force and all were swift to follow whom all loved those suns are set oh rise some other such or all that we have left is empty talk of old achievements and despair of new now hoist the sail and let the streamers float upon the wanton breezes strew the deck with lavender and sprinkle liquid sweets that no rude savor maritime invade the nose of nice nobility breathe soft ye clarionets and softer still ye flutes that winds and waters lulled by magic sounds may bear us smoothly to the gallic shore true we have lost an empire  let it pass true we may thank the perfidy of france that picked the jewel out of englands crown with all the cunning of an envious shrew and let that pass  twas but a trick of state a brave man knows no malice but at once forgets in peace the injuries of war and gives his direst foe a friends embrace and shamed as we have been to the very beard braved and defied and in our own sea proved too weak for those decisive blows that once insured us mastry there we yet retain some small preeminence we justly boast at least superior jockeyship and claim the honors of the turf as all our own go then well worthy of the praise ye seek and show the shame ye might conceal at home in foreign eyes  be grooms and win the plate where once your nobler fathers won a crown  it is generous to communicate your skill to those that need it folly is soon learned and under such preceptors who can fail there is a pleasure in poetic pains which only poets know the shifts and turns the expedients and inventions multiform to which the mind resorts in chase of terms though apt yet coy and difficult to win  to arrest the fleeting images that fill the mirror of the mind and hold them fast and force them sit till he has pencild off a faithful likeness of the forms he views then to dispofe his copies with such art that each may find its most propitious light and shine by situation hardly less than by the labor and the skill it cost are occupations of the poets mind so pleasing and that steal away the thought with such address from themes of sad import that lost in his own musings happy man he feels the anxieties of life denied their wonted entertainment all retire such joys has he that sings but ah not such or seldom such the hearers of his song fastidious or else listless or perhaps aware of nothing arduous in a task they never undertook they little note his dangers or escapes and happily find there least amusement where he found the most but is amusement all studious of song and yet ambitious not to sing in vain i would not trifle merely though the world be loudest in their praise who do no more yet what can satire whether grave or gay it may correct a foible may chastise the freaks of fashion regulate the dress retrench a swordblade or displace a patch but where are its sublimer trophies found what vice has it subdued whose heart reclaimed by rigor or whom laughed into reform alas leviathan is not so tamed laughed at he laughs again and stricken hard turns to the stroke his adamantine scales that fear no discipline of human hands the pulpit therefore and i name it filled with solemn awe that bids me well beware with what intent i touch that holy thing the pulpit when the satrist has at last strutting and vapring in an empty school spent all his force and made no proselyte i say the pulpit in the sober use of its legitimate peculiar powers must stand acknowledged while the world shall stand the most important and effectual guard support and ornament of virtues cause there stands the messenger of truth there stands the legate of the skies his theme divine his office sacred his credentials clear by him the violated law speaks out its thunders and by him in strains as sweet as angels use the gospel whispers peace he stablishes the strong restores the weak reclaims the wanderer binds the broken heart and armed himself in panoply complete of heavenly temper furnishes with arms bright as his own and trains by every rule of holy discipline to glorious war the sacramental host of gods elect are all such teachers would to heaven all were but hark  the doctors voice  fast wedged between two empirics he stands and with swollen cheeks inspires the news his trumpet keener far than all invective is his bold harrangue while through that public organ of report he hails the clergy and defying shame announces to the world his own and theirs he teaches those to read whom schools dismissed and colleges untaught sells accent tone and emphasis in score and gives to prayer the adagio and andante it demands he grinds divinity of other days down into modern use transforms old print to zigzag manuscript and cheats the eyes of gallry critics by a thousand arts  are there who purchase of the doctors ware oh name it not in gath  it cannot be that grave and learned clerks should need such aid he doubtless is in sport and does but droll assuming thus a rank unknown before grand caterer and drynurse of the church i venerate the man whose heart is warm whose hands are pure whose doctrine and whose life coincident exhibit lucid proof that he is honest in the sacred cause to such i render more than mere respect whose actions say that they respect themselves but loose in morals and in manners vain in conversation frivolous in dress extreme at once rapacious and profuse frequent in park with lady at his side ambling and prattling scandal as he goes but rare at home and never at his books or with his pen save when he scrawls a card constant at routs familiar with a round of ladyships a stranger to the poor ambitious of preferment for its gold and well prepared by ignorance and sloth by infidelity and love of the world to make gods work a sinecure a slave to his own pleasures and his patrons pride  from such apostles oh ye mitred heads preserve the church and lay not careless hands on sculls that cannot teach and will not learn would i describe a preacher such as paul were he on earth would hear approve and own paul should himself direct me i would trace his masterstrokes and draw from his design i would express him simple grave sincere in doctrine incorrupt in language plain and plain in manner decent solemn chaste and natural in gesture much impressed himself as conscious of his awful charge and anxious mainly that the flock he feeds may feel it too affectionate in look and tender in address as well becomes a messenger of grace to guilty men behold the picture  is it like  like whom the things that mount the rostrum with a skip and then skip down again pronounce a text cry hem and reading what they never wrote just fifteen minutes huddle up their work and with a well bred whisper close the scene in man or woman but far most in man and most of all in man that ministers and serves the altar in my soul i loath all affectation it is my perfect scorn object of my implacable disgust what  will a man play tricks will he indulge a silly fond conceit of his fair form and just proportion fashionable mien and pretty face in presence of his god or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes as with the dimond on his lily hand and play his brilliant parts before my eyes when i am hungry for the bread of life he mocks his maker prostitutes and shames his noble office and instead of truth displaying his own beauty starves his flock therefore avaunt all attitude and stare and start theatric practiced at the glass i seek divine simplicity in him who handles things divine and all beside though learned with labor and though much admired by curious eyes and judgments illinformd to me is odious as the nasal twang at conventicle heard where worthy men misled by custom strain celestial themes through the pressed nostril spectaclebestrid some decent in demeanor while they preach that task performed relapse into themselves and having spoken wisely at the close grow wanton and give proof to every eye  whoever was edified themselves were not forth comes the pocket mirror first we stroke an eyebrow next compose a straggling lock then with an air most gracefully performed fall back into our seat extend an arm and lay it at its ease with gentle care with handkerchief in hand depending low the better hand more busy gives the nose its bergamot or aids the indebted eye with opra glass to watch the moving scene and recognize the slowretiring fair now this is fulsome and offends me more than in a churchman slovenly neglect and rustic coarseness would an heavenly mind may be indiffrent to her house of clay and slight the hovel as beneath her care but how a body so fantastic trim and queint in its deportment and attire can lodge an heavenly mind  demands a doubt he that negotiates between god and man as gods ambassador the grand concerns of judgment and of mercy should beware of lightness in his speech it is pitiful to court a grin when you should woo a soul to break a jest when pity would inspire pathetic exhortation and to address the skittish fancy with facetious tales when sent with gods commission to the heart so did not paul direct me to a quip or merry turn in all he ever wrote and i consent you take it for your text your only one till sides and benches fail no he was serious in a serious cause and understood too well the weighty terms that he had taken in charge he would not stoop to conquer those by jocular exploits whom truth and soberness assailed in vain oh popular applause what heart of man is proof against thy sweet seducing charms the wisest and the best feel urgent need of all their caution in thy gentlest gales but swelled into a gust  who then alas with all his canvass set and inexpert and therefore heedless can withstand thy power praise from the riveld lips of toothless bald decrepitude and in the looks of lean and craving poverty and in the bow respectful of the smutchd artificer is often too welcome and may much disturb the bias of the purpose how much more poured forth by beauty splendid and polite in language soft as adoration breathes ah spare your idol think him human still charms he may have but he has frailties too dote not too much nor spoil what ye admire all truth is from the sempiternal source of light divine but egypt greece and rome drew from the stream below more favored we drink when we choose it at the fountain head to them it flowed much mingled and defiled with hurtful error prejudice and dreams illusive of philosophy so called but falsely sages after sages strove in vain to filter off a crystal draught pure from the lees which often more enhanced the thirst than slaked it and not seldom bred intoxication and delirium wild in vain they pushed enquiry to the birth and springtime of the world asked whence is man why formed at all and wherefore as he is where must he find his maker with what rites adore him will he hear accept and bless or does he sit regardless of his works has man within him an immortal seed or does the tomb take all if he survive his ashes where and in what weal or woe knots worthy of solution which alone a deity could solve their answers vague and all at random fabulous and dark left them as dark themselves their rules of life defective and unsanctiond proved too weak to bind the roving appetite and lead blind nature to a god not yet revealed it is revelation satisfies all doubts explains all mysteries except her own and so illuminates the path of life that fools discover it and stray no more now tell me dignified and sapient sir my man of morals nurtured in the shades of academus is this false or true is christ the abler teacher or the schools if christ then why resort at every turn to athens or to rome for wisdom short of mans occasions when in him reside grace knowledge comfort an unfathomed store how often when paul has served us with a text has epictetus plato tully preached men that if now alive would sit content and humble learners of a saviors worth preach it who might such was their love of truth their thirst of knowledge and their candor too and thus it is the pastor either vain by nature or by flattery made so taught to gaze at his own splendour and to exalt absurdly not his office but himself or unenlightend and too proud to learn or vicious and not therefore apt to teach perverting often by the stress of lewd and loose example whom he should instruct exposes and holds up to broad disgrace the noblest function and discredits much the brightest truths that man has ever seen for ghostly counsel if it either fall below the exigence or be not backed with show of love at least with hopeful proof of some sincerity on the givers part or be dishonored in the exterior form and mode of its conveyance by such tricks as move derision or by foppish airs and histrionic mummry that let down the pulpit to the level of the stage drops from the lips a disregarded thing the weak perhaps are moved but are not taught while prejudice in men of stronger minds takes deeper root confirmed by what they see a relaxation of religions hold upon the roving and untutored heart soon follows and the curb of conscience snapt the laity run wild  but do they now note their extravagance and be convinced as nations ignorant of god contrive a wooden one so we no longer taught by monitors that mother church supplies now make our own posterity will ask if ever posterity see verse of mine some fifty or an hundred lustrums hence what was a monitor in georges days my very gentle reader yet unborn of whom i needs must augur better things since heaven would sure grow weary of a world productive only of a race like us a monitor is wood plank shaven thin we wear it at our backs there closely braced and neatly fitted it compresses hard the prominent and most unsightly bones and binds the shoulders flat we prove its use sovereign and most effectual to secure a form not now gymnastic as of yore from rickets and distortion else our lot but thus admonished we can walk erect one proof at least of manhood while the friend sticks close a mentor worthy of his charge our habits costlier than lucullus wore and by caprice as multiplied as his just please us while the fashion is at full but change with every moon the sycophant that waits to dress us arbitrates their date surveys his fair reversion with keen eye finds one ill made another obsolete this fits not nicely that is ill conceived and making prize of all that he condemns with our expenditure defrays his own varietys the very spice of life that gives it all its flavor we have run through every change that fancy at the loom exhausted has had genius to supply and studious of mutation still discard a real elegance a little used for monstrous novelty and strange disguise we sacrifice to dress till household joys and comforts cease dress drains our cellar dry and keeps our larder lean puts out our fires and introduces hunger frost and woe where peace and hospitality might reign what man that lives and that knows how to live would fail to exhibit at the public shows a form as splendid as the proudest there though appetite raise outcries at the cost a man of the town dines late but soon enough with reasonable forecast and dispatch to insure a sidebox station at half price you think perhaps so delicate his dress his daily fare as delicate alas he picks clean teeth and busy as he seems with an old tavern quill is hungry yet the rout is follys circle which she draws with magic wand so potent is the spell that none decoyed into that fatal ring unless by heavens peculiar grace escape there we grow early gray but never wise there form connexions and acquire no friend solicit pleasure hopeless of success waste youth in occupations only fit for second childhood and devote old age to sports which only childhood could excuse there they are happiest who dissemble best their weariness and they the most polite who squander time and treasure with a smile though at their own destruction she that asks her dear five hundred friends contemns them all and hates their coming they what can they less make just reprisals and with cringe and shrug and bow obsequious hide their hate of her all catch the frenzy downward from her grace whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies and gild our chamber cielings as they pass to her who frugal only that her thrift may feed excesses she can ill afford is hackneyd home unlacqueyd who in haste alighting turns the key in her own door and at the watchmans lantern borrowing light finds a cold bed her only comfort left wives beggar husbands husbands starve their wives on fortunes velvet altar offering up their last poor pittance fortune most severe of goddesses yet known and costlier far than all that held their routs in heathen heaven  so fare we in this prisonhouse the world and it is a fearful spectacle to see so many maniacs dancing in their chains they gaze upon the links that hold them fast with eyes of anguish execrate their lot then shake them in despair and dance again now basket up the family of plagues that waste our vitals peculation sale of honor perjury corruption frauds by forgery by subterfuge of law by tricks and lies as numerous and as keen as the necessities their authors feel then cast them closely bundled every brat at the right door profusion is its sire profusion unrestrained with all that is base in character has litterd all the land and bred within the memory of no few a priesthood such as baals was of old a people such as never was till now it is a hungry vice  it eats up all that gives society its beauty strength convenience and security and use makes men mere vermin worthy to be trappd and gibbetted as fast as catchpole claws can seize the slippery prey unties the knot of union and converts the sacred band that holds mankind together to a scourge profusion deluging a state with lusts of grossest nature and of worst effects prepares it for its ruin hardens blinds and warps the consciences of public men till they can laugh at virtue mock the fools that trust them and in the end disclose a face that would have shocked credulity herself unmasked vouchsafing this their sole excuse since all alike are selfish  why not they this does profusion and the accursed cause of such deep mischief has itself a cause in colleges and halls in ancient days when learning virtue piety and truth were precious and inculcated with care there dwelt a sage called discipline his head not yet by time completely silvered over bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth but strong for service still and unimpaird his eye was meek and gentle and a smile played on his lips and in his speech was heard paternal sweetness dignity and love the occupation dearest to his heart was to encourage goodness he would stroke the head of modest and ingenuous worth that blushed at its own praise and press the youth close to his side that pleased him learning grew beneath his care a thriving vigorous plant the mind was well informed the passions held subordinate and diligence was choice if ever it chanced as sometimes chance it must that one among so many overleapd the limits of control his gentle eye grew stern and darted a severe rebuke his frown was full of terror and his voice shook the delinquent with such fits of awe as left him not till penitence had won lost favor back again and closed the breach but discipline a faithful servant long declined at length into the vale of years a palsy struck his arm his sparkling eye was quenched in rheums of age his voice unstrung grew tremulous and moved derision more than reverence in perverse rebellious youth so colleges and halls neglected much their good old friend and discipline at length oerlookd and unemployd fell sick and died then study languishd emulation slept and virtue fled the schools became a scene of solemn farce where ignorance in stilts his cap well lined with logic not his own with parrot tongue performed the scholars part proceeding soon a graduated dunce then compromise had place and scrutiny became stoneblind precedence went in truck and he was competent whose purse was so a dissolution of all bonds ensued the curbs invented for the muleish mouth of headstrong youth were broken bars and bolts grew rusty by disuse and massy gates forgot their office opening with a touch till gowns at length are found mere masquerade the tasselld cap and the spruce band a jest a mockry of the world what need of these for gamesters jockies brothellers impure spendthrifts and booted sportsmen oftner seen with belted waist and pointers at their heels than in the bounds of duty what was learned if aught was learned in childhood is forgot and such expense as pinches parents blue and mortifies the liberal hand of love is squandered in pursuit of idle sports and vicious pleasures buys the boy a name that sits a stigma on his fathers house and cleaves through life inseparably close to him that wears it what can attergames of riper joys and commerce with the world the lewd vain world that must receive him soon add to such erudition thus acquired where science and where virtue are professed they may confirm his habits rivet fast his folly but to spoil him is a task that bids defiance to the united powers of fashion dissipation taverns stews now blame we most the nurselings or the nurse the children crookd and twisted and deformed through want of care or her whose winking eye and slumbering oscitancy marrs the brood the nurse no doubt regardless of her charge she needs herself correction needs to learn that it is dangerous sporting with the world with things so sacred as a nations trust the nurture of her youth her dearest pledge all are not such i had a brother once  peace to the memory of a man of worth a man of

loved and wept by more than one themselves conspicuous there some minds are tempered happily and mixed with such ingredients of good sense and taste of what is excellent in man they thirst with such a zeal to be what they approve that no restraints can circumscribe them more than they themselves by choice for wisdoms sake nor can example hurt them what they see of vice in others but enhancing more the charms of virtue in their just esteem if such escape contagion and emerge pure from so foul a pool to shine abroad and give the world their talents and themselves small thanks to those whose negligence or sloth exposed their inexperience to the snare and left them to an undirected choice see then the quiver broken and decayed in which are kept our arrows rusting there in wild disorder and unfit for use what wonder if discharged into the world they shame their shooters with a random flight their points obtuse and feathers drunk with wine well may the church wage unsuccessful war with such artillry armed vice parries wide the undreaded volley with a sword of straw and stands an impudent and fearless mark have we not trackd the felon home and found his birthplace and his dam the

that feels for injured love but i disdain the nauseous task to paint her as she is cruel abandoned glorying in her shame no let her pass and chariotted along in guilty splendour shake the public ways the frequency of crimes has washed them white and verse of mine shall never brand the wretch whom matrons now of character unsmirchd and chaste themselves are not ashamed to own virtue and vice had boundries in old time not to be passed and she that had renounced her sexs honor was renounced herself by all that prized it not for prudrys sake but dignitys resentful of the wrong twas hard perhaps on here and there a waif desirous to return and not received but was an wholesome rigor in the main and taught the unblemished to preserve with care that purity whose loss was loss of all men too were nice in honor in those days and judged offenders well and he that sharpd and pocketted a prize by fraud obtained was marked and shunned as odious he that sold his country or was slack when she required his every nerve in action and at stretch paid with the blood that he had basely spared the price of his default but now yes now we are become so candid and so fair so liberal in construction and so rich in christian charity a goodnatured age that they are safe sinners of either sex transgress what laws they may well dressed well bred well equipaged is ticket good enough to pass us readily through every door hypocrisy detest her as we may and no mans hatred ever wronged her yet may claim this merit still that she admits the worth of what she mimics with such care and thus gives virtue indirect applause but she has burnt her mask not needed here where vice has such allowance that her shifts and specious semblances have lost their use i was a stricken deer that left the herd long since with many an arrow deep infixt my panting side was charged when i withdrew to seek a tranquil death in distant shades there was i found by one who had himself been hurt by the archers in his side he bore and in his hands and feet the cruel scars with gentle force soliciting the darts he drew them forth and healed and bade me live since then with few associates in remote and silent woods i wander far from those my former partners of the peopled scene with few associates and not wishing more here much i ruminate as much i may with other views of men and manners now than once and others of a life to come i see that all are wandrers gone astray each in his own delusions they are lost in chase of fancied happiness still wooed and never won dream after dream ensues and still they dream that they shall still succeed and still are disappointed rings the world with the vain stir i sum up half mankind and add twothirds of the remainder half and find the total of their hopes and fears dreams empty dreams the million flit as gay as if created only like the fly that spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon to sport their season and be seen no more the rest are sober dreamers grave and wise and pregnant with discovries new and rare some write a narrative of wars and feats of heroes little known and call the rant an history describe the man of whom his own cooevals took but little note and paint his person character and views as they had known him from his mothers womb they disentangle from the puzzled skein in which obscurity has wrapped them up the threads of politic and shrewd design that ran through all his purposes and charge his mind with meanings that he never had or having kept concealed some drill and bore the solid earth and from the strata there extract a

trifling in their own is it not a pity now that tickling rheums should ever teaze the iungs and blear the sight of oracles like these great pity too that having wielded the elements and built a thousand systems each in his own way they should go out in fume and be forgot ah what is life thus spent and what are they but frantic who thus spend it all for smoke  eternity for bubbles proves at last a senseless bargain when i see such games played by the creatures of a power who swears that he will judge the earth and call the fool to a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain and when i weigh this seeming wisdom well and prove it in the infallible result so hollow and so false  i feel my heart dissolve in pity and account the learned if this be learning most of all deceived great crimes

should i and any man that lives be strangers to each other pierce my vein take of the crimson stream meandring there and catechize it well apply your glass search it and prove now if it be not blood congenial with thine own and if it be what edge of subtlety can thou suppose keen enough wise and skilful as thou art to cut the link of brotherhood by which one common maker bound me to the kind true i am no proficient i confess in arts like yours i cannot call the swift and perilous lightnings from the angry clouds and bid them hide themselves in the earth beneath i cannot analyze the air nor catch the parallax of yonder luminous point that seems half quenched in the immense abyss such powers i boast not  neither can i rest a silent witness of the headlong rage or heedless folly by which thousands die bone of my bone and kindred souls to mine god never meant that man should scale the heavens by strides of human wisdom in his works though wondrous he commands us in his word to seek him rather where his mercy shines the mind indeed enlightened from above views him in all ascribes to the grand cause the grand effect acknowledges with joy his manner and with rapture tastes his style but never yet did philosophic tube that brings the planets home into the eye of observation and discovers else not visible his family of worlds discover him that rules them such a veil hangs over mortal eyes blind from the birth and dark in things divine full often too our wayward intellect the more we learn of nature overlooks her author more from instrumental causes proud to draw conclusions retrograde and mad mistake but if his word once teach us shoot a ray through all the hearts dark chambers and reveal truths undiscerned but by that holy light then all is plain philosophy baptized in the pure fountain of eternal love has eyes indeed and viewing all she sees as meant to indicate a god to man gives him his praise and forfeits not her own learning has borne such fruit in other days on all her branches piety has found friends in the friends of science and true prayer has flowed from lips wet with castalian dews such was thy wisdom newton childlike sage sagacious reader of the works of god and in his word sagacious such too thine milton whose genius had angelic wings and fed on manna and such thine in whom our british themis gloried with just cause immortal hale for deep discernment praised and sound integrity not more than famed for sanctity of manners undefiled all flesh is grass and all its glory fades like the fair flower dishevelled in the wind riches have wings and grandeur is a dream the man we celebrate must find a tomb and we that worship him ignoble graves nothing is proof against the general curse of vanity that seizes all below the only amaranthine flower on earth is virtue the only lasting treasure truth but what is truth twas pilates question put to truth itself that deigned him no reply and wherefore will not god impart his light to them that ask it  freely  it is his joy his glory and his nature to impart but to the proud uncandid insincere or negligent enquirer not a spark what is that which brings contempt upon a book and him that writes it though the style be neat the method clear and argument exact that makes a minister in holy things the joy of many and the dread of more his name a theme for praise and for reproach  that while it gives us worth in gods account depreciates and undoes us in our own what pearl is it that rich men cannot buy that learning is too proud to gather up but which the poor and the despised of all seek and obtain and often find unsought tell me and i will tell thee what is truth oh friendly to the best pursuits of man friendly to thought to virtue and to peace domestic life in rural leisure passed few know thy value and few taste thy sweets though many boast thy favors and affect to understand and choose thee for their own but foolish man foregoes his proper bliss even as his first progenitor and quits though placed in paradise for earth has still some traces of her youthful beauty left substantial happiness for transient joy scenes formed for contemplation and to nurse the growing seeds of wisdom that suggest by every pleasing image they present reflections such as meliorate the heart compose the passions and exalt the mind scenes such as these it is his supreme delight to fill with riot and defile with blood should some contagion kind to the poor brutes we persecute annihilate the tribes that draw the sportsman over hill and dale fearless and rapt away from all his cares should never gamefowl hatch her eggs again nor baited hook deceive the fishes eye could pageantry and dance and feast and song be quelled in all our summermonth retreats how many selfdeluded nymphs and swains who dream they have a taste for fields and groves would find them hideous nursries of the spleen and crowd the roads impatient for the town they love the country and none else who seek for their own sake its silence and its shade delights which who would leave that has a heart susceptible of pity or a mind cultured and capable of sober thought for all the savage din of the swift pack and clamours of the field detested sport that owes its pleasures to anothers pain that feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks of harmless nature dumb but yet endued with eloquence that agonies inspire of silent tears and heartdistending sighs vain tears alas and sighs that never find a corresponding tone in jovial souls well  one at least is safe one sheltered hare has never heard the sanguinary yell of cruel man exulting in her woes innocent partner of my peaceful home whom ten long years experience of my care has made at last familiar she has lost much of her vigilant instinctive dread not needful here beneath a roof like mine yes  thou may eat thy bread and lick the hand that feeds thee thou may frolic on the floor at evening and at night retire secure to thy strawcouch and slumber unalarmd for i have gained thy confidence have pledged all that is human in me to protect thine unsuspecting gratitude and love if i survive thee i will dig thy grave and when i place thee in it sighing say i knew at least one hare that had a friend how various his employments whom the world calls idle and who justly in return esteems that busy world an idler too friends

who has much to enjoy me therefore studious of laborious ease not slothful happy to deceive the time not waste it and aware that human life is but a loan to be repaid with use when he shall call his debtors to account from whom are all our blessings business finds even here while sedulous i seek to improve at least neglect not or leave unemployd the mind he gave me driving it though slack too often and much impeded in its work by causes not to be divulged in vain to its just point the service of mankind he that attends to his interior self that has a heart and keeps it has a mind that hungers and supplies it and who seeks a social not a dissipated life has business feels himself engaged to atchieve no unimportant though a silent task a life all turbulence and noise may seem to him that leads it wise and to be praised but wisdom is a pearl with most success sought in still water and beneath clear skies he that is ever occupied in storms or dives not for it or brings up instead vainly industrious a disgraceful prize the morning finds the selfsequesterd man fresh for his task intend what task he may whether inclement seasons recommend his warm but simple home where he enjoys with her who shares his pleasures and his heart sweet converse sipping calm the fragrant lymph which neatly she prepares then to his book well chosen and not sullenly perused in selfish silence but imparted often as aught occurs that she may smile to hear or turn to nourishment digested well or if the garden with its many cares all well repaid demand him he attends the welcome call conscious how much the hand of lubbard labor needs his watchful eye often loitring lazily if not oerseen or misapplying his unskilful strength nor does he govern only or direct but much performs himself no works indeed that ask robust tough sinews bred to toil servile employ  but such as may amuse not tire demanding rather skill than force proud of his well spread walls he views his trees that meet no barren interval between with pleasure more than even their fruits afford which save himself who trains them none can feel these therefore are his own peculiar charge no meaner hand may discipline the shoots none but his steel approach them what is weak distempered or has lost prolific powers impaired by age his unrelenting hand dooms to the knife nor does he spare the soft and succulent that feeds its giant growth but barren at the expense of neighboring twigs less ostentatious and yet studded thick with hopeful gems the rest no portion left that may disgrace his art or disappoint large expectation he disposes neat at measured distances that air and sun admitted freely may afford their aid and ventilate and warm the swelling buds hence summer has her riches autumn hence and hence even winter

makes needful still whose spring is but the child of churlish winter in her froward moods discovring much the temper of her sire for often as if in her the stteam of mild maternal nature had reversed its course she brings her infants forth with many smiles but once delivered kills them with a frown he therefore timely warned himself supplies her want of care screening and keeping warm the plenteous bloom that no rough blast may sweep his garlands from the boughs again as often as the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild the fence withdrawn he gives them every beam and spreads his hopes before the blaze of day to raise the prickly and greencoated gourd so grateful to the palate and when rare so coveted else base and disesteemd  food for the vulgar merely  is an art that toiling ages have but just matured and at this moment unassayd in song yet gnats have had and frogs and mice long since their eulogy those sang the mantuan bard and these the grecian in ennobling strains and

resist the freezing blast for ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf deciduous and when now november dark checks vegetation in the torpid plant exposed to his cold breath the task begins warily therefore and with prudent heed he seeks a favored spot that where he builds the agglomerated pile his frame may front the suns meridian disk and at the back enjoy close shelter wall or reeds or hedge

straw what longest binds the closest forms secure the shapely side that as it rises takes by just degrees an overhanging breadth sheltering the base with its projected eaves the uplifted frame compact

and the first labor ends thrice must the voluble and restless earth spin round upon her axle ere the warmth slow gathering in the midst through the square mass diffused attain the surface when behold a pestilent and most corrosive steam like a gross fog boeotian rising fast and fast condensed upon the dewy sash asks egress which obtained the overcharged and drenched conservatory breathes abroad in volumes wheeling slow the vapor dank and purified rejoices to have lost its foul inhabitant but to assuage the impatient fervor which it first conceives within its reeking bosom threatening death to his young hopes requires discreet delay experience slow preceptress teaching often the way to glory by miscarriage foul must prompt him and admonish how to catch the auspicious moment when the tempered heat friendly to vital motion may afford soft somentation and invite the seed the seed selected wisely plump and smooth and glossy he commits to pots of size diminutive well filled with well prepared and fruitful soil that has been treasured long and drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds these on the warm and genial earth that hides the smoking manure and oerspreads it all he places lightly and as time subdues the rage of fermentation plunges deep in the soft medium till they stand immersed then rise the tender germs upstarting quick and spreading wide their spongy lobes at first pale wan and livid but assuming soon if fanned by balmy and nutritious air strained through the friendly mats a vivid green two leaves produced two rough indented leaves cautious he pinches from the

contriving delicates for you grudge not the cost ye little know the cares the vigilance the labor and the skill that day and night are exercised and hang upon the ticklish balance of suspense that ye may garnish your profuse regales with summer fruits brought forth by wintry suns ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart the process heat and cold and wind and steam moisture and drought mice worms and swarming flies minute as dust and numberless often work dire disappointment that admits no cure and which no care can obviate it were long too long to tell the expedients and the shifts which he that fights a season so severe devises while he guards his tender trust and often at last in vain the learned and wise sarcastic would exclaim and judge the song cold as its theme and like its theme the fruit of too much labor worthless when produced who loves a garden loves a greenhouse too unconscious of a less propitious clime there blooms exotic beauty warm and snug while the winds whistle and the snows descend the spiry myrtle with unwithring leaf shines there and flourishes the golden boast of portugal and western india there the ruddier orange and the paler lime peep through their

nor taste alone and well contrived display suffice to give the marshalled ranks the grace of their complete effect much yet remains unsung and many cares are yet behind and more laborious cares on which depends their vigor injured soon not soon restored the soil must be renewed which often washed loses its treasure of salubrious salts and disappoints the roots the slender roots close interwoven

odorifrous leaf each opening blossom freely breathes abroad its gratitude and thanks him with its sweets so manifold all pleasing in their kind all healthful are the employs of rural life reiterated as the wheel of time runs round still ending and beginning still nor are these all to deck the shapely knoll that softly swelled and gayly dressed appears a flowery island from the dark green lawn emerging must be deemed a labor due to no mean hand and asks the touch of taste here also grateful mixture of well matched and sorted hues each giving each relief and by contrasted beauty shining more is needful strength may wield the ponderous spade may turn the clod and wheel the compost home but elegance chief grace the garden shows and most attractive is the fair result of thought the creature of a polished mind without it all is gothic as the scene to which the insipid citizen resorts near yonder heath where industry misspent but proud of his uncouth illchosen task has made a heaven on earth with suns and moons of closerammd stones has charged the encumbered soil and fairly laid the zodiac in the dust he therefore who would see his flowers disposed sightly and in just order ere he gives the beds the trusted treasure of their seeds forecasts the future whole that when the scene shall break into its preconceived display each for itself and all as with one voice conspiring may attest his bright design nor even then dismissing as performed his pleasant work may he suppose it done few selfsupported flowers endure the wind uninjured but expect the upholding aid of the smoothshaven prop and neatly tied are wedded thus like beauty to old age for interest sake the living to the dead some cloth the soil that feeds them far diffused and lowly creeping modest and yet fair like virtue thriving most where little seen some more aspiring catch the neighbor shrub with clasping tendrils and invest his branch else unadorned with many a gay festoon and fragrant chaplet recompensing well the strength they borrow with the grace they lend all hate the rank society of weeds noisome and ever greedy to exhaust the improvrishd earth an overbearing race that like the multitude made factionmad disturb good order and degrade true worth oh blessed seclusion from a jarring world which he thus occupied enjoys retreat cannot indeed to guilty man restore lost innocence or cancel sollies past but it has peace and much secures the mind from all assaults of evil proving still a faithful barrier not oerleapd with ease by vicious custom raging uncontrolled abroad and desolating public life when fierce temptation seconded within by traitor appetite and armed with darts tempered in hell invades the throbbing breast to combat may be glorious and success perhaps may crown us but to fly is safe had i the choice of sublunary good what could i wish that i possess not here health leisure means to improve it friendship peace no loose or wanton though a wandering muse and constant occupation without care thus blessed i draw a picture of that bliss hopeless indeed that dissipated minds and profligate abusers of a world created fair so much in vain for them should seek the guiltless joys that i describe allured by my report but sure no less that selfcondemned they must neglect the prize and what they will not taste must yet approve what we admire we praise and when we praise advance it into notice that its worth acknowledged others may admire it too i therefore recommend though at the risk of popular disgust yet boldly still the cause of piety and sacred truth and virtue and those scenes which god ordained should best secure them and promote them most scenes that i love and with regret perceive forsaken or through folly not enjoyed pure is the nymph though liberal of her smiles and chaste though unconfined whom i extol not as the prince in sushan when he called vainglorious of her charms his vashti forth to grace the full pavilion hi design was but to boast his own peculiar good which all might view with envy none partake my charmer is not mine alone my sweets and she that sweetens all my bitters too nature enchanting nature in whose form and lineaments divine i trace a hand that errs not and find raptures still renewed is free to all men universal prize strange that so fair a creature should yet want admirers and be destined to divide with meaner objects even the few she finds stripped of her ornaments her leaves and flowers she loses all her influence cities then attract us and neglected nature pines abandoned as unworthy of our love but are not wholesome airs though unperfumed by roses and clear suns though scarcely felt and groves if unharmonious yet secure from clamor and whose very silence charms to be preferred to smoke to the eclipse that metropolitan volcanos make whose stygian throats breathe darkness all day long and to the stir of commerce driving slow and thundering loud with his ten thousand wheels they would be were not madness in the head and folly in the heart were england now what england was plain hospitable kind and undebauchd but we have bid farewell to all the virtues of those better days and all their honest pleasures mansions once knew their own masters and laborious hinds that had survived the father served the son now the legitimate and rightful lord is but a transient guest newly arrived and soon to be supplanted he that saw his patrimonial timber cast its leaf sells the last scantling and transfers the price to some shrewd sharper ere it buds again estates are landscapes gazed upon awhile then advertised and auctioneerd away the country starves and they that feed the oercharged and surfeited lewd town with her fair dues by a just judgment strip and starve themselves the wings

roaring in cascades even as he bids the enraptured owner smiles it is finished and yet finished as it seems still wants a grace the loveliest it could show a mine to satisfy the enormous cost drained to the last poor item of his wealth he sighs departs and leaves the accomplished plan that he has touched retouchd many a long day labored and many a night pursued in dreams just when it meets his hopes and proves the heaven he wanted for a wealthier to enjoy and now perhaps the glorious hour is come when having no stake left no pledge to indear her interests or that gives her sacred cause a moments operation on his love he burns with most intense and flagrant zeal to serve his country ministerial grace deals him out money from the public chest or if that mine be shut some private purse supplies his need with an usurious loan to be refunded duly when his vote wellmanaged shall have earned its worthy price oh innocent compared with arts like these crape and cocked pistol and the whistling ball sent through the travllers temples he that finds one drop of heavens sweet mercy in his cup can dig beg rot and perish wellcontent so he may wrap himself in honest rags at his last gasp

while fancy like the finger of a clock runs the great circuit and is still at home oh winter ruler of the inverted year thy scattered hair with sleet like ashes filled thy breath congealed upon thy lips thy cheeks fringed with a beard made white with other snows than those of age thy forehead wrapped in clouds a leafless branch thy scepter and thy throne a sliding car indebted to no wheels but urged by storms along its slippery way i love thee all unlovely as thou seem and dreaded as thou art thou holdst the sun a prisoner in the yet undawning east shortning his journey between morn and

delicious when her patriots of high note perhaps by moonlight at their humble doors and under an old oaks domestic shade enjoyed spare feast a radish and an egg discourse ensues not trivial yet not dull nor such as with a frown forbids the play of fancy or proscribes the sound of mirth nor do we madly like an impious world who deem religion frenzy and the god that made them an intruder on their joys start at his awful name or deem his praise a jarring note themes of a graver tone exciting often our gratitude and love while we retrace with memrys pointing wand that calls the past to our exact review the dangers we have escaped the broken snare the disappointed foe deliverance found unlooked for life preserved and peace restored fruits of omnipotent eternal love oh evenings worthy of the gods exclaimed the sabine bard oh evenings i reply more to be prized and coveted than yours as more illumined and with nobler truths that i and mine and those we love enjoy is winter hideous in a garb like this needs he the tragic fur the smoke of lamps the pentup breath of an unsavry throng to thaw him into feeling or the smart and snappish dialogue that flippant wits call comedy to prompt him with a smile the selfcomplacent actor when he views stealing a side long glance at a full house the slope of faces from the floor to the roof as if one masterspring controlled them all relaxed into an universal grin sees not a countenance there that speaks a joy half so refined or so sincere as ours cards were superfluous here with all the tricks that idleness has ever yet contrived to fill the void of an unfurnished brain to palliate dullness and give time a shove time as he passes us has a doves wing unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound but the worlds time is time in masquerade theirs should i paint him has his pinions fledged with motley plumes and where the peacock shows his azure eyes is tinctured black and red with spots quadrangular of dimond form ensanguind hearts clubs typical of strife and spades the emblem of untimely graves what should be and what was an hourglass once becomes a dicebox and a billiard mast well does the work of his destructive scythe thus decked he charms a world whom fashion blinds to his true worth most pleased when idle most whose only happy are their wasted hours even misses at whose age their mothers wore the backstring and the bib

censure roving as i rove where shall i find an end or how proceed as he that travels far often turns aside to view some rugged rock or mouldering tower which seen delights him not then coming home describes and prints it that the world may know how far he went for what was nothing worth so i with brush in hand and pallet spread with colors mixed for a far different use paint cards and dolls and every idle thing that fancy finds in her excursive flights come evening once again season of peace return sweet evening and continue long methinks i see thee in the streaky west with matronstep slowmoving while the night treads on thy sweeping train one hand employed in letting fall the curtain of repose on bird and beast the other charged for man with sweet oblivion of the cares of day not sumptuously adorned nor needing aid like homely featured night of clustring gems a star or two just twinkling on thy brow suffices thee save that the moon is thine no less than hers not worn indeed on high with ostentatious pageantry but set with modest grandeur in thy purple zone resplendent less but of an ampler round come then and thou shall find thy vottry calm or make me so composure is thy gift and whether i devote thy gentle hours to books to music or the poets toil to weaving nets for birdalluring fruit or twining silken threads round ivory reels when they command whom man was born to please i slight thee not but make thee welcome still just when our drawingrooms begin to blaze with lights by clear reflection multiplied from many a mirror in which he of gath goliath might have seen his giant bulk whole without stooping towering crest and all my pleasures too begin but me perhaps the glowing hearth may satisfy awhile with faint illumination that uplifts the shadow to the cieling there by fits dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame not undelightful is an hour to me so spent in parlour twilight such a gloom suits well the thoughtfull or unthinking mind the mind contemplative with some new theme pregnant or indisposed alike to all laugh ye who boast your more mercurial powers that never feel a stupor know no pause nor need one i am conscious and confess fearless a soul that does not always think me often has fancy ludicrous and wild soothed with a waking dream of houses towers trees churches and strange visages expressed in the red cinders while with poring eye i gazed myself creating what i saw nor less amused have i quiescent watched the sooty films that play upon the bars pendulous and foreboding in the view of superstition prophesying still though still deceived some strangers near approach it is thus the understanding takes repose in indolent vacuity of thought and sleeps and is refreshed meanwhile the face conceals the mood lethargic with a mask of deep deliberation as the man were taskd to his full strength absorbed and lost thus often reclined at ease i lose an hour at evening till at length the freezing blast that sweeps the bolted shutter summons home the recollected powers and snapping short the glassy threads with which the fancy weaves her brittle toys restores me to myself how calm is my recess and how the frost raging abroad and the rough wind endear the silence and the warmth enjoyed within i saw the woods and fields at close of day a variegated show the meadows green though faded and the lands where lately waved the golden harvest of a mellow brown upturnd so lately by the forceful share i saw far off the weedy fallows smile with verdure not unprofitable grazed by flocks fast feeding and selecting each his favorite herb while all the leafless groves that skirt the horizon wore a sable hue scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve tomorrow brings a change a total change which even now though silently performed and slowly and by most unfelt the face of universal nature undergoes fast falls a fleecy shower the downy flakes descending and with neverceasing lapse softly alighting upon all below assimilate all objects earth receives gladly the thickning mantle and the green and tender blade that feared the chilling blast escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil in such a world so thorny and where none finds happiness unblighted or if sound without some thistly sorrow at its side it seems the part of wisdom and no sin against the law of love to measure lots with less distinguished than ourselves that thus we may with patience bear our moderate ills and sympathize with others suffering more ill fares the travller now and he that stalks in ponderous boots beside his reeking team the wain goes heavily impeded sore by congregated loads adhering close to the clogged wheels and in its sluggish pace noiseless appears a moving hill of snow the toiling steeds expand the nostril wide while every breath by respiration strong forced downward is consolidated soon upon their jutting chests he formed to bear the pelting brunt of the tempestuous night with halfshut eyes and puckerd cheeks and teeth presented bare against the storm plods on one hand secures his hat save when with both he brandishes his pliant length of whip resounding often and never heard in vain on happy and in my account denied that sensibility of pain with which refinement is endued thrice happy thou thy frame robust and hardy feels indeed the piercing cold but feels it unimpaird the learned finger never need explore thy vigorous pulse and the unhealthful east that breathes the spleen and searches every bone of the infirm is wholesome air to thee thy days roll on exempt from household care thy wagon is thy wife and the poor beasts that drag the dull companion to and fro thine helpless charge dependent on thy care ah treat them kindly rude as thou appearst yet show that thou have mercy which the great with needless hurry whirled from place to place humane as they would seem not always show poor yet industrious modest quiet neat such claim compassion in a night like this and have a friend in every feeling heart warmed while it lasts by labor all day long they brave the season and yet find at eve ill clad and fed but sparely time to cool the frugal housewife trembles when she lights her scanty stock of brushwood blazing clear but dying soon like all terrestrial joys the few small embers left she nurses well and while her infant race with outspread hands and crowded knees sit cowring over the sparks retires content to quake so they be warmed the man feels least as more inured than she to winter and the current in his veins more briskly moved by his severer toil yet he too finds his own distress in theirs the taper soon extinguished which i saw dangled along at the cold fingers end just when the day declined and the brown loaf lodged on the shelf halfeaten without sauce of savry cheese or butter costlier still sleep seems their only refuge for alas where penury is felt the thought is chained and sweet colloquial pleasures are but few with all this thrift they thrive not all the care ingenious parsimony takes but just saves the small inventory bed and stool skillet and old carved chest from public sale they live and live without extorted alms from grudging hands but other boast have none to sooth their honest pride that scorns to beg nor comfort else but in their mutual love i praise you much ye meek and patient pair for ye are worthy choosing rather far a dry but independent crust hardearnd and eaten with a sigh than to endure the rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs of knaves in office partial in the work of distribution liberal of their aid to clamorous importunity in rags but ofttimes deaf to suppliants who would blush to wear a tattered garb however coarse whom famine cannot reconcile to filth these ask with painful shyness and refused because deserving silently retire but be ye of good courage time itself shall much befriend you time shall give increase and all your numerous progeny well trained but helpless in few years shall find their hands and labor too meanwhile ye shall not want what conscious of your virtues we can spare nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send i mean the man who when the distant poor need help denies them nothing but his name but poverty with most who whimper forth their long complaints is self inflicted woe the effect of laziness or sottish waste now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad for plunder much solicitous how best he may compensate for a day of sloth by works of darkness and nocturnal wrong woe to the gardners pale the farmers hedge plashd neatly and secured with driven stakes deep in the loamy bank uptorn by strength resistless in so bad a cause but lame to better deeds he bundles up the spoil an asses burden and when laden most and heaviest light of foot steals fast away nor does the boarded hovel better guard the well stackd pile of riven logs and roots from his pernicious force nor will he leave unwrenchd the door however well secured where chanticleer amidst his haram sleeps in unsuspecting pomp twitched from the perch he gives the princely bird with all his wives to his voracious bag struggling in vain and loudly wondering at the sudden change nor this to feed his own twere some excuse did pity of their sufferings warp aside his principle and tempt him into sin for their support so destitute but they neglected pine at home themselves as more exposed than others with less scruple made his victims robbed of their defenseless all cruel is all he does it is quenchless thirst of ruinous ebriety that prompts his every action and imbrutes the man oh for a law to noose the villains neck who starves his own who persecutes the blood he gave them in his childrens veins and hates and wrongs the woman he has sworn to love pass where we may through city or through town village or hamlet of this merry land though lean and beggared every twentieth pace conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff of stale debauch forthissuing from the styes that law has licensed

harmony unheard fierce the dispute whatever the theme while she fell discord arbitress of such debate perched on the signpost holds with even hand her undecisive scales in this she lays a weight of ignorance in that of pride and smiles delighted with the eternal poise dire is the frequent curse and its twin sound the cheekdistending oath not to be praised as ornamental musical polite like those which modern senators employ whose oath is rhetric and who swear for fame behold the schools in which plebeian minds once simple are initiated in arts which some may practice with politer grace but none with readier skill it is here they learn the road that leads from competence and peace to indigence and rapine till at last society grown weary of the load shakes her encumbered lap and casts them out but censure profits little vain the attempt to advertize in verse a public pest that like the filth with which the peasant feeds his hungry acres stinks and is of use the excise is fattend with the rich result of all this riot and ten thousand casks for ever dribbling out their base contents touched by the midas finger of the state bleed gold for ministers to sport away drink and be mad then it is your country bids gloriously drunk obey the important call her cause demands the assistance of your throats ye all can swallow and she asks no more would i had fallen upon those happier days that poets celebrate those golden times and those arcadian scenes that maro sings and sydney warbler of poetic prose nymphs were dianas then and swains had hearts that felt their virtues innocence it seems from courts dismissed found shelter in the groves the footsteps of simplicity impressed upon the yielding herbage so they sing then were not all effaced then speech profane and manners profligate were rarely found observed as prodigies and soon reclaimed vain wish those days were never airy dreams sat for the picture and the poets hand imparting substance to an empty shade imposed a gay delirium for a truth grant it i still must envy them an age that favored such a dream in days like these impossible when virtue is so scarce that to suppose a scene where she presides is tramontane and stumbles all belief no we are polished now the rural lass whom once her virgin modesty and grace her artless manners and her neat attire so dignified that she was hardly less than the fair shepherdess of old romance is seen no more the character is lost her head adorned with lappets pinned aloft and ribbands streaming gay superbly raised and magnified beyond all human size indebted to some smart wigweavers hand for more than half the tresses it sustains her elbows ruffled and her tottering form ill proppd upon french heels she might be deemed but that the basket dangling on her arm interprets her more truly of a rank too proud for dairywork or sale of eggs expect her soon with footboy at her heels no longer blushing for her awkward load her train and her umbrella all her care the town has tinged the country and the stain appears a spot upon a vestals robe the worse for what it soils the fashion runs down into scenes still rural but alas scenes rarely graced with rural manners now time was when in the pastoral retreat the unguarded door was safe men did not watch to invade anothers right or guard their own then sleep was undisturbed by fear unscared by drunken howlings and the chilling tale of midnight murder was a wonder heard with doubtful credit told to frighten babes but farewell now to unsuspicious nights and slumbers unalarmd now ere you sleep see that your polished arms be primd with care and drop the nightbolt ruffians are abroad and the first larum of the cocks shrill throat may prove a trumpet summoning your ear to horrid sounds of hostile feet within even daylight has its dangers and the walk through pathless wastes and woods unconscious once of other tenants than melodious birds or harmless flocks is hazardous and bold lamented change to which full many a cause invetrate hopeless of a cure conspires the course of human things from good to ill from ill to worse is fatal never fails increase of power begets increase of wealth wealth luxury and luxury excess excess the scrophulous and itchy plague that seizes first the opulent descends to the next rank contagious and in time taints downward all the graduated scale of order from the chariot to the plough the rich and they that have an arm to check the license of the lowest in degree desert their office and themselves intent on pleasure haunt the capital and thus to all the violence of lawless hands resign the scenes their presence might protect authority herself not seldom sleeps though resident and witness of the wrong the plump convivial parson often bears the magisterial sword in vain and lays his reverence and his worship both to rest on the same cushion of habitual sloth perhaps timidity restrains his arm when he should strike he trembles and sets free himself enslaved by terror of the band the audacious convict whom he dares not bind perhaps though by profession ghostly pure he too may have his vice and sometimes prove less dainty than becomes his grave outside in lucrative concerns examine well his milkwhite hand the palm is hardly clean  but here and there an ugly smutch appears foh twas a bribe that left it he has touched corruption whosoever seeks an audit here propitious pays his tribute game or fish wildfowl or venson and his errand speeds but faster far and more than all the rest a noble cause which none who bears a spark of public virtue ever wished removed works the deplored and mischievous effect it is universal soldiership has stabbed the heart of merit in the meaner class arms through the vanity and brainless rage of those that bear them in whatever cause seem most at variance with all moral good and incompatible with serious thought the clown the child of nature without guile blessed with an insants ignorance of all but his own simple pleasures now and then a wrestling match a footrace or a fair is ballotted and trembles at the news sheepish he doffs his hat and mumbling swears a bibleoath to be whatever they please to do he knows not what the task performed that instant he becomes the serjeants care his pupil and his torment and his jest his awkward gait his introverted toes bent knees round shoulders and dejected looks procure him many a curse by slow degrees unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff he yet by slow degrees puts off himself grows conscious of a change and likes it well he stands erect his slouch becomes a walk he steps right onward martial in his air his form and movement is as smart above as meal and larded locks can make him wears his hat or his plumed helmet with a grace and his three years of heroship expired returns indignant to the slighted plough he hates the field in which no fife or drum attends him drives his cattle to a march and sighs for the smart comrades he has left twere well if his exterior change were all  but with his clumsy port the wretch has lost his ignorance and harmless manners too to swear to game to drink to show at home by lewdness idleness and sabbathbreach the great proficiency he made abroad to astonish and to grieve his gazing friends to break some maidens and his mothers heart to be a pest where he was useful once are his sole aim and all his glory now man in society is like a flower bown in its native bed it is there alone his faculties expanded in full bloom shine out there only reach their proper use but man associated and leagued with man by regal warrant or selfjoined by bond for interestsake or swarming into clans beneath one head for purposes of war like flowers selected from the rest and bound and bundled close to fill some crowded vase fades rapidly and by compression marred contracts defilement not to be endured hence charterd boroughs are such public plagues and burghers men immaculate perhaps in all their private functions once combined become a loathsome body only fit for dissolution hurtful to the main hence merchants unimpeachable of sin against the charities of domestic life incorporated seem at once to iose their nature and disclaiming all regard for mercy and the common rights of man build factories with blood conducting trade at the swords point and dying the white robe of innocent commercial justice red hence too the field of glory as the world misdeems it dazzled by its bright array with all the majesty of its thundering pomp enchanting music and immortal wreaths is but a school where thoughtlessness is taught on principle where foppery atones for folly gallantry for every vice but slighted as it is and by the great abandoned and which still i more

his hand with so much art diversified that two were never found twins at all points  yet this obtains in all that all discern a beauty in his works and all can taste them minds that have been formed

the livry she delights to wear though sickly samples of the exubrant whole what are the casements lined with creeping herbs the prouder sashes fronted with a range of orange myrtle or the fragrant weed the frenchmans mignonette darling are they not all proofs that man immured in cities still retains his inborn inextinguishable thirst of rural scenes compensating his loss by supplemental shifts

the plain lies buried deep beneath the dazzling deluge and the bents and coarser grass upspearing over the rest of late unsightly and unseen now shine conspicuous and in bright apparel clad and fledged with icy feathers nod superb the cattle mourn in corners where the fence screens them and seem half petrified to sleep in unrecumbent sadness there they wait their wonted fodder not like

knife into the solid mass smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands with such undeviating and even force he severs it away no needless care lest storms should overset the leaning pile deciduous or its own unbalanced weight forth goes the woodman leaving unconcerned the cheerful haunts of man to wield the axe and drive the wedge in yonder forest drear from morn to eve his solitary task shaggy and lean and shrewd with pointed ears and tail croppd short half lurcher and half cur his dog attends him close behind his heel now creeps he slow and now with many a frisk widescampering snatches up the drifted snow with ivory teeth or ploughs it with his snout then shakes his powdered coat and barks for joy heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl moves right toward the mark nor stops for aught but now and then with pressure of his thumb to adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube that fumes beneath his nose the trailing cloud streams far behind him scenting all the air now from the roost or from the neighboring pale where diligent to catch the first faint gleam of smiling day they gossippd side by side come trooping at the housewifes wellknown call the feathered tribes domestic half on wing and half on foot they brush the fleecy flood conscious and fearful of too deep a plunge the sparrows peep and quit the sheltering eaves to seize the fair occasion well they eye the scattered grain and thievishly resolved to escape the impending famine often scared as often return a pert voracious kind clean riddance quickly made one only care remains to each the search of sunny nook or shed impervious to the blast resigned to sad necessity the cock foregoes his wonted strut and wading at their head with wellconsidered steps seems to resent his altered gait and stateliness retrenched how find the myriads that in summer cheer the hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs due sustenance or where subsist they now earth yields them naught the imprisoned worm is safe beneath the frozen clod all seeds of herbs lie covered close and berrybearing thorns that feed the thrush whatever some suppose afford the smaller minstrels no supply the long protracted rigor of the year thins all their numerous flocks in chinks and holes ten thousand seek an unmolested end as instinct prompts self buried ere they die the very rooks and daws forsake the fields where neither grub nor root nor earthnut now repays their labor more and perched aloft by the wayside or stalking in the path lean pensioners upon the travllers track pick up their nauscous dole though sweet to them of voided pulse or half digested grain the streams are lost amid the splendid blank oerwhelming all distinction on the flood indurated and fixed the snowy weight lies undissolved while silently beneath and unperceived the current steals away not so where scornful of a check it leaps the milldam dashes on the wrestless wheel and wantons in the pebbly gulf below no frost can bind it there its utmost force can but arrest the light and smokey mist that in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide and see where it has hung the embroidered banks with forms so various that no powers of art the pencil or the pen may trace the scene here glittering turrets rise upbearing high fantastic misarrangement on the roof large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees and shrubs of fairy land the crystal drops that trickle down the branches fast congealed shoot into pillars of pellucid length and prop the pile they but adorned before here grotto within grotto safe defies the sunbeam there imbossd and fretted wild the growing wonder takes a thousand shapes capricious in which fancy seeks in vain the likeness of some object seen before thus nature works as if to mock at art and in defiance of her rival powers by these fortuitous and random strokes performing such inimitable feats as she with all her rules can never reach less worthy of applause though more admired because a novelty the work of man imperial mistress of the furclad russ thy most magnificent and mighty freak the wonder of the north no forest fell when thou would build no quarry sent its stores to enrich thy walls but thou did

for use long wavy wreaths of flowers that feared no enemy but warmth blushed on the pannels mirror needed none where all was vitreous but in order due convivial table and commodious seat what seemed at least commodious seat were there sofa and couch and highbuilt throne august the same lubricity was found in all and all was moist to the warm touch a scene of evanescent glory once a stream and soon to slide into a stream again alas it was but a mortifying stroke of undesigned severity that glanced made by a monarch on her own estate on human grandeur and the courts of kings twas transient in its nature as in show twas durable as worthless as it seemed intrinsically precious to the foot treacherous and false it smiled and it was cold great princes have great playthings some have played at hewing mountains into men and some at building human wonders mountainhigh some have amused the dull sad years of life life spent in indolence and therefore sad with schemes of monumental fame and sought by pyramids and mausolaean pomp shortlived themselves to immortalize their bones some seek diversion in the tented field and make the sorrows of mankind their sport but wars a game which were their subjects wise kings should not play at nations would do well to extort their truncheons from the puny hands of heroes whose infirm and baby minds are gratified with mischief and who spoil because men suffer it their toy the world when babel was confounded and the great confedracy of projectors wild and vain was split into diversity of tongues then as a shepherd separates his flock these to the upland to the valley those god drove asunder and assigned their lot to all the nations ample was the boon he gave them in its distribution fair and equal and he bade them dwell in peace peace was awhile their care they ploughd and sowed and reaped their plenty without grudge or strife but violence can never longer sleep than human passions please in every heart are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war occasion needs but fan them and they blaze cain had already shed a brothers blood the deluge washed it out but left unquenched the seeds of murder in the breast of man soon by a righteous judgment in the line of his descending progeny was found the first artificer of death the shrewd contriver who first sweated at the forge and forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel to a keen edge and made it bright for war him tubal named the vulcan of old times the sword and faulchion their inventor claim and the first smith was the first murdrers son his art survived the waters and ere long when man was multiplied and spread abroad in tribes and clans and had begun to call these meadows and that range of hills his own the tasted sweets of property begat desire of more and industry in some to improve and cultivate their just demesne made others covet what they saw so fair thus wars began on earth these fought for spoil and those in selfdefence savage at first the onset and irregular at length one eminent above the rest for strength for stratagem or courage or for all was chosen leader him they served in war and him in peace for sake of warlike deeds revrenced no less who could with him compare or who so worthy to control themselves as he whose prowess had subdued their foes thus war affording field for the display of virtue made one chief whom times of peace which have their exigencies too and call for skill in government at length made king king was a name too proud for man to wear with modesty and meekness and the crown so dazzling in their eyes who set it on was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound it is the abject property of most that being parcel of the common mass and destitute of means to raise themselves they sink and settle lower than they need they know not what it is to feel within a comprehensive faculty that grasps great purposes with ease that turns and wields almost without an effort plans too vast for their conception which they cannot move conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk with gazing when they see an able man step forth to notice and besotted thus build him a pedestal and say stand there and be our admiration and our praise they roll themselves before him in the dust then most deserving in their own account when most extravagant in his applause as if exalting him they raised themselves thus by degrees selfcheated of their found and sober judgment that he is but man they demideify and fume him so that in due season he forgets it too inflated and astrut with selfconceit he gulps the windy diet and ere long adopting their mistake profoundly thinks the world was made in vain if not for him thenceforth they are his cattle drudges born to bear his burdens drawing in his gears and sweating in his service his caprice becomes the soul that animates them all he deems a thousand or ten thousand lives spent in the purchase of renown for him an easy reckoning and they think the same thus kings were first invented and thus kings were burnished into heroes and became the arbiters of this terraqueous swamp storks among frogs that have but croakd and died strange that such folly as lifts bloated man to eminence fit only for a god should ever drivel out of human lips even in the cradled weakness of the world still stranger much that when at length mankind had reached the sinewy firmness of their youth and could discriminate and argue well on subjects more mysterious they were yet babes in the cause of freedom and should fear and quake before the gods themselves had made but above measure strange that neither proof of sad experience nor examples set by some whose patriot virtue has prevailed can even now when they are grown matute in wisdom and with philosophic deeps familiar serve to emancipate the rest such dupes are men to custom and so prone to reverence what is ancient and can plead a course of long observance for its use that even servitude the worst of ills because delivered down from sire to son is kept and guarded as a sacred thing but is it fit or can it bear the shock of rational discussion that a man compounded and made up like other men of elements tumultuous in whom lust and folly in as ample measure meet as in the bosoms of the slaves he rules should be a despot absolute and boast himself the only freeman of his land should when he pleases and on whom he will wage war with any or with no pretense of provocation given or wrong sustained and force the beggarly last doit by means that his own humor dictates from the clutch of poverty that thus he may procure his thousands weary of penurious life a splendid opportunity to die say ye who with less prudence than of old jotham ascribed to his assembled trees in politic convention put your trust in the shadow of a bramble and reclined in fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch rejoice in him and celebrate his sway where find ye passive fortitude whence springs your selfdenying zeal that holds it good to stroke the prickly grievance and to hang his thorns with streamers of continual praise we too are friends to loyalty we love the king who loves the law respects his bounds and reigns content within them him we serve freely and with delight who leaves us free but recollecting still that he is man we trust him not too far king though he be and king in england too he may be weak and vain enough to be ambitious still may exercise amiss his proper powers or covet more than freemen choose to grant beyond that mark is treason he is ours to administer to guard to adorn the state but not to warp or change it we are his to serve him nobly in the common cause true to the death but not to be his slaves mark now the difference ye that boast your love of kings between your loyalty and ours we love the man the paultry pageant you we the chief patron of the commonwealth you the regardless author of its woes we for the sake of liberty a king you chains and bondage for a tyrants sake our love is principle and has its root in reason is judicious manly free yours a blind instinct crouches to the rod and licks the foot that treads it in the dust were kingship as true treasure as it seems sterling and worthy of a wise mans wish i would not be a king to be beloved causeless and daubed with undiscerning praise where love is mere attachment to the throne not to the man who fills it as he ought whose freedom is by suffrance and at will of a superior he is never free who lives and is not weary of a life exposed to manacles deserves them well the state that strives for liberty though foiled and forced to abandon what she bravely sought deserves at least applause for her attempt and pity for her loss but that is a cause not often unsuccessful power usurped is weakness when opposed conscious of wrong it is pusillanimous and prone to flight but slaves that once conceive the glowing thought of freedom in that hope itself possess all that the contest calls for spirit strength the scorn of danger and united hearts the surest presage of the good they seek the author hopes that he shall not be censured for unnecessary warmth upon so interesting a subject he is aware that it is become almost fashionable to stigmatize such sentiments as no better than empty declamation but it is an ill symptom and peculiar to modern times  then shame to manhood and opprobrious more to france than all her losses and defeats old or of later date by sea or land her house of bondage worse than that of old which god avenged on pharaoh  the bastile ye horrid towers the abode of broken hearts ye dungeons and ye cages of despair that monarchs have supplied from age to age with music such as suits their sovereign ears the sighs and groans of miserable men there is not an english heart that would not leap to hear that ye were fallen at last to know that even our enemies so often employed in forging chains for us themselves were free for he that values liberty confines his zeal for her predominance within no narrow bounds her cause engages him wherever pleaded it is the cause of man there dwell the most forlorn of human kind immured though unaccused condemned untried cruelly spared and hopeless of escape there like the visionary emblem seen by him of babylon life stands a stump and filletted about with hoops of brass still lives though all its pleasant boughs are gone to count the hourbell and expect no change and ever as the sullen sound is heard still to reflect that though a joyless note to him whose moments all have one dull pace ten thousand rovers in the world at large account it music that it summons some to theater or jocund feast or ball the wearied hireling finds it a release from labor and the lover that has chid its long delay feels every welcome stroke upon his heart strings trembliug with delight  to fly for refuge from distracting thought to such amusements as ingenious woe contrives hardshifting and without her tools  to read engraven on the moldy walls in staggring types his predecessors tale a sad memorial and subjoin his own  to turn purveyor to an overgorged and bloated spider till the pampered pest is made familiar watches his approach comes at his call and serves him for a friend  to wear out time in numbring to and fro the studs that thick emboss his iron door then downward and then upward then aflant and then alternate with a sickly hope by dint of change to give his tasteless task some relish till the sum exactly found in all directions he begins again  oh comfortless existence hemmed around with woes which who that suffers would not kneel and beg for exile or the pangs of death that man should thus encroach on fellow man abridge him of his just and native rights eradicate him tear him from his hold upon the endearments of domestic life and social nip his fruitfulness and use and doom him for perhaps an heedless word to barrenness and solitude and tears moves indignation makes the name of king of king whom such prerogative can please as dreadful as the manichean god adored through fear strong only to destroy it is liberty alone that gives the flower of fleeting life its luster and perfume and we are weeds without it all constraint except what wisdom lays on evil men is evil hurts the faculties impedes their progress in the road of science blinds the eye sight of discovry and begets in those that suffer it a sordid mind bestial a meagre intellect unfit to to be the tenant of mans noble form thee therefore still blameworthy as thou art with all thy lose of empire and though squeezed by public exigence till annual food fails for the craving hunger of the state thee i account still happy and the chief among the nations seeing thou art free my native nook of earth thy clime is rude replete with vapors and disposes much all hearts to sadness and none more than mine thine unadultrate manners are less soft and plausible than social life requires and thou have need of discipline and art to give thee what politer france receives from natures bounty  that humane address and sweetness without which no pleasure is in converse either starved by cold reserve or flushed with fierce dispute a senseless brawl yet being free i love thee for the sake of that one feature can be well content disgraced as thou have been poor as thou art to seek no sublunary rest beside but once enslaved farewell i could endure chains no where patiently and chains at home where i am free by birthright not at all then what were left of roughness in the grain of british natures wanting its excuse that it belongs to freemen would disgust and shock me i should then with double pain feel all the rigor of thy fickle clime and if i must bewail the blessing lost for which our hampdens and our sidneys bled i would at least bewail it under skies milder among a people less austere in scenes which having never known me free would not reproach me with the loss i felt do i forebode impossible events and tremble at vain dreams heaven grant i may but the age of virtuous politics is past and we are deep in that of cold pretense patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere and we too wise to trust them he that takes deep in his soft credulity the stamp designed by loud declaimers on the part of liberty themselves the slaves of lust incurs derision for his easy faith and lack of knowledge and with cause enough for when was public virtue to be found where private was not can he love the whole who loves no part he be a nations friend who is in truth the friend of no man there can he be strenuous in his countrys cause who slights the charities for whose dear sake that country if at all must be beloved it is therefore sober and good men are sad for englands glory seeing it wax pale and sickly while her champions wear their hearts so loose to private duty that no brain healthful and undisturbed by factious fumes can dream them trusty to the general weal such were not they of old whose tempered blades dispersed the shackles of usurped control and hewed them link from link then albions sons were sons indeed they felt a filial heart beat high within them at a mothers wrongs and shining each in his domestic sphere shone brighter still once called to public view it is therefore many whose sequestered lot forbids their interference looking on anticipate perforce some dire event and seeing the old castle of the state that promised once more firmness so assailed that all its tempestbeaten turrets shake stand motionless expectants of its fall all has its date below the fatal hour was registered in heaven ere time began we turn to dust and all our mightiest works die too the deep foundations that we lay time ploughs them up and not a trace remains we build with what we deem eternal rock a distant age asks where the fabric stood and in the dust sifted and searched in vain the undiscoverable secret sleeps but there is yet a liberty unsung by poets and by senators unpraised which monarchs cannot grant nor all the power of earth and hell confedrate take away a liberty which persecution fraud oppression prisons have no power to bind which whosoever tastes can be enslaved no more it is liberty of heart derived from heaven bought with his blood who gave it to mankind and sealed with the same token it is held by charter and that charter sanctiond sure by the unimpeachable and awful oath and promise of a god his other gifts all bear the royal stamp that speaks them his and are august but this transcends them all his other works this visible display of allcreating energy and might are grand no doubt and worthy of the word that finding an interminable space unoccupied has filled the void so well and made so sparkling what was dark before but these are not his glory man it is true smit with the beauty of so fair a scene might well suppose the artificer divine meant it eternal had he not himself pronounced it transient glorious as it is and still designing a more glorious far doomed it as insufficient for his praise these therefore are occasional and pass formed for the confutation of the fool whose lying heart disputes against a god that office served they must be swept away not so the labors of his love they shine in other heavens than these that we behold and fade not there is paradise that fears no forfeiture and of its fruits he sends large prelibation often to saints below of these the first in order and the pledge and confident assurance of the rest is liberty a flight into his arms ere yet mortalitys fine threads give way a clear escape from tyrannizing lust and full immunity from penal woe chains are the portion of revolted man stripes and a dungeon and his body serves the triple purpose in that sickly foul opprobrious residence he finds them all propense his heart to idols he is held in silly dotage on created things careless of their creator and that low and sordid gravitation of his powers to a vile clod so draws him with such force resistless from the center he should seek that he at last forgets it all his hopes tend downward his ambition is to sink to reach a depth profounder still and still profounder in the fathomless abyss of folly plunging in pursuit of death but ere he gain the comfortless repose he seeks an acquiescence of his soul in heavnrenouncing exile he endures  what does he not from lusts opposed in vain and selfreproaching conscience he foresees the fatal issue to his health fame peace fortune and dignity the loss of all that can enoble man and make frail life short as it is supportable still worse far worse than all the plagues with which his sins infect his happiest moments he forebodes ages of hopeless misery future death and death still future not an hasty stroke like that which sends him to the dusty grave but unrepealable enduring death scripture is still a trumpet to his fears what none can prove a forgry may be true what none but bad men wish exploded must that scruple checks him riot is not loud nor drunk enough to drown it in the midst of laughter his compunctions are sincere and he abhors the jest by which he shines remorse begets reform his masterlust falls first before his resolute rebuke and seems dethroned and vanquished peace ensues but spurious and shortlived the puny child of selfcongratulating pride begot on fancied innocence again he falls and fights again but finds his best essay a presage ominous portending still its own dishonor by a worse relapse till nature unavailing nature foiled so often and wearied in the vain attempt scoffs at her own performance reason now takes part with appetite and pleads the cause perversely which of late she so condemned with shallow shifts and old devices worn and tattered in the service of debauch covering his shame from his offended sight has god indeed given appetites to man and stored the earth so plenteously with means to gratify the hunger of his wish and does he reprobate and will he damn the use of his own bounty making first so frail a kind and then enacting laws so strict that less than perfect must despair falsehood which whosoever but suspects of truth dishonors god and makes a slave of man do they themselves who undertake for hire the teachers office and dispense at large their weekly dole of edifying strains attend to their own music have they faith in what with such solemnity of tone and gesture they propound to our belief nay  conduct has the loudest tongue the voice is but an instrument on which the priest may play what tune he pleases in the deed the unequivocal authentic deed we find sound argument we read the heart such reasnings if that name must needs belong to excuses in which reason has no part serve to compose a spirit well inclined to live on terms of amity with vice and sin without disturbance often urged as often as libidinous discourse exhausted he resorts to solemn themes of theological and grave import they gain at last his unreserved assent till hardened his hearts temper in the forge of lust and on the anvil of despair he slights the strokes of conscience nothing moves or nothing much his constancy in ill vain tampring has but fostered his disease it is desperate and he sleeps the sleep of death haste now philosopher and set him free charm the deaf serpent wisely make him hear of rectitude and fitness moral truth how lovely and the moralsense how sure consulted and obeyed to guide his steps directly to the first and only fair spare not in such a cause spend all the powers of rant and rhapsody in virtues praise be most sublimely good verbosely grand and with poetic trappings grace thy prose till it outmantle all the pride of verse  ah tinkling cymbal and highsounding brass smitten in vain such music cannot charm the eclipse that intercepts truths heavenly beam and chills and darkens a widewandring soul the still small voice is wanted he must speak whose word leaps forth at once to its effect who calls for things that are not and they come grace makes the slave a freeman it is a change that turns to ridicule the turgid speech and stately tone of moralists who boast as if like him of fabulous renown they had indeed ability to smooth the shag of savage nature and were each an orpheus and omnipotent in song but transformation of apostate man from fool to wise from earthly to divine is work for him that made him he alone and he by means in philosophic eyes trivial and worthy of disdain atchieves the wonder humanizing what is brute in the lost kind extracting from the lips of asps their venom overpowring strength by weakness and hostility by love patriots have toiled and in their countrys cause bled nobly and their deeds as they deserve receive proud recompense we give in charge their names to the sweet lyre the historic muse proud of the treasure marches with it down to latest times and sculpture in her turn gives bond in stone and everduring brass to guard them and to immortalize her trust but fairer wreaths are due though never paid to those who posted at the shrine of truth have fallen in her defense a patriots blood well spent in such a strife may earn indeed and for a time insure to his loved land the sweets of liberty and equal laws but martyrs struggle for a brighter prize and win it with more pain their blood is shed in confirmation of the noblest claim our claim to feed upon immortal truth to walk with god to be divinely free to soar and to anticipate the skies yet few remember them they lived unknown till persecution dragged them into fame and chased them up to heaven their ashes flew  no marble tells us whither with their names no bard embalms and sanctifies his song and history so warm on meaner themes is cold on this she execrates indeed the tyranny that doomed them to the fire but gives the glorious suffrers little praise see hume  he is the freeman whom the truth makes free and all are slaves beside there is not a chain that hellish foes confedrate for his harm can wind around him but he casts it off with as much ease as samson his green wyths he looks abroad into the varied field of nature and though poor perhaps compared with those whose mansions glitter in his sight calls the delightful scenry all his own his are the mountains and the valleys his and the resplendent rivers his to enjoy with a propriety that none can feel but who with filial confidence inspired can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye and smiling say  my father made them all are they not his by a peculiar right and by an emphasis of interest his whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy whose heart with praise and whose exalted mind with worthy thoughts of that unwearied love that planned and built and still upholds a world so clothed with beauty for rebellious man yes  ye may fill your garners ye that reap the loaded soil and ye may waste much good in senseless riot but ye will not find in feast or in the chase in song or dance a liberty like his who unimpeachd of usurpation and to no mans wrong appropriates nature as his fathers work and has a richer use of yours than you he is indeed a freeman free by birth of no mean city planned or ere the hills were built the fountains opened or the sea with all his roaring multitude of waves his freedom is the same in every state and no condition of this changeful life so manifold in cares whose every day brings its own evil with it makes it less for he has wings that neither sickness pain nor penury can cripple or confine no nook so narrow but he spreads them there with ease and is at large the oppressor holds his body bound but knows not what a range his spirit takes unconscious of a chain and that to bind him is a vain attempt whom god delights in and in whom he dwells acquaint thyself with god if thou would taste his works admitted once to his embrace thou shall perceive that thou wast blind before thine eye shall be instructed and thine heart made pure shall relish with divine delight till then unfelt what hands divine have wrought brutes graze the mountaintop with faces prone and eyes intent upon the scanty herb it yields them or recumbent on its brow ruminate heedless of the scene outspread beneath beyond and stretching far away from inland regions to the distant main man views it and admires but rests content with what he views the landscape has his praise but not its author unconcerned who formed the paradise he sees he finds it such and such wellpleased to find it asks no more not so the mind that has been touched from heaven and in the school of sacred wisdom taught to read his wonders in whose thought the world fair as it is existed ere it was not for its own sake merely but for his much more who fashioned it he gives it praise praise that from earth resulting as it ought to earths acknowledged sovereign finds at once its only just proprietor in him the soul that sees him or receives sublimed new faculties or learns at least to employ more worthily the powers she owned before discerns in all things what with stupid gaze of ignorance till then she overlooked a ray of heavenly light gilding all forms terrestrial in the vast and the minute the unambiguous sootsteps of the god who gives its luster to an insects wing and wheels his throne upon the rolling worlds much conversant with heaven she often holds with those fair ministers of light to man that fill the skies nightly with silent pomp sweet conference enquires what strains were they with which heaven rang when every star in haste to gratulate the newcreated earth sent forth a voice and all the sons of god shouted for joy  tell me ye shining hosts that navigate a sea that knows no storms beneath a vault unsullied with a cloud if from your elevation whence ye view distinctly scenes invisible to man and systems of whose birth no tidings yet have reached this nether world ye spy a race favored as ours transgressors from the womb and hasting to a grave yet doomed to rise and to possefs a brighter heaven than yours as one who long detained on foreign shores pants to return and when he sees afar his countrys weatherbleachd and battered rocks from the green wave emerging darts an eye radiant with joy toward the happy land so i with animated hopes behold and many an aching wish your beamy fires that show like beacons in the blue abyss ordained to guide the embodied spirit home from toilsome life to neverending rest love kindles as i gaze i feel desires that give assurance of their own success and that infused from heaven must thither tend so reads he nature whom the lamp of truth illuminates thy lamp mysterious word which whosoever sees no longer wanders lost with intellects bemazed in endless doubt but runs the road of wisdom thou have built with means that were not till by thee employed worlds that had never been had thou in strength been less or less benevolent than strong they are thy witnesses who speak thy power and goodness infinite but speak in ears that hear not or receive not their report in vain thy creatures testify of thee till thou proclaim thyself theirs is indeed a teaching voice but it is the praise of thine that whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn and with the boon gives talents for its use till thou art heard imaginations vain possess the heart and fables false as hell yet deemed oracular lure down to death the uninformd and heedless souls of men we give to chance blind chance ourselves as blind the glory of thy work which yet appears perfect and unimpeachable of blame challenging human scrutiny and proved then skilful most when most severely judged but chance is not or is not where thou reignst thy providence forbids that fickle power if power she be that works but to confound to mix her wild vagaries with thy laws yet thus we dote refusing while we can instruction and inventing to ourselves gods such as guilt makes welcome gods that sleep or disregard our follies or that sit amused spectators of this bustling stage thee we reject unable to abide thy purity till pure as thou art pure made such by thee we love thee for that cause for which we shunned and hated thee before then we are free then liberty like day breaks on the soul and by a flash from heaven fires all the faculties with glorious joy a voice is heard that mortal ears hear not till thou have touched them it is the voice of song a loud hosanna sent from all thy works which he that hears it with a shout repeats and adds his rapture to the general praise in that blessed moment nature throwing wide her veil opaque discloses with a smile the author of her beauties who retired behind his own creation works unseen by the impure and hears his power denied thou art the source and center of all minds their only point of rest eternal word from thee departing they are lost and rove at random without honor hope or peace from thee is all that sooths the life of man his high endeavor and his glad success his strength to suffer and his will to serve but oh thou bounteous giver of all good thou art of all thy gifts thyself the crown give what thou can without thee we are poor and with thee rich take what thou will away argument of the sixth book bells at a distance  their effect  a fine noon in winter  a sheltered walk  meditation better than books  our familiarity with the course of nature makes it appear less

from the charge of uselessness  conclusion  book vi the winter walk at noon there is in souls a sympathy with sounds and as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased with melting airs or martial brisk or grave some chord in unison with what we hear is touched within us and the heart replies how soft the music of those village bells falling at intervals upon the ear in cadence sweet now dying all away now pealing loud again and louder still clear and sonorous as the gale comes on with easy force it opens all the cells where memory slept wherever i have heard a kindred melody the scene recurs and with it all its pleasures and its pains such comprehensive views the spirit takes that in a few short moments i retrace as in a map the voyager his course the windings of my way through many years short as in retrospect the journey seems it seemed not always short the rugged path and prospect often so dreary and forlorn moved many a sigh at its disheartning length yet feeling present evils while the past faintly impress the mind or not at all how readily we wish time spent revoked that we might try the ground again where once through inexperience as we now perceive we missed that happiness we might have found some friend is gone perhaps his sons best friend a father whose authority in show when most severe and mustring all its force was but the graver countenance of love whose favor like the clouds of spring might lower and utter now and then an awful voice but had a blessing in its darkest frown threatening at once and nourishing the plant we loved but not enough the gentle hand that reared us at a thoughtless age allured by every gilded folly we renounced his sheltering side and wilfully forewent that converse which we now in vain regret how gladly would the man recall to life the boys neglected sire a mother too that softer friend perhaps more gladly still might he demand them at the gates of death sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed the playful humor he could now endure himself grown sober in the vale of tears and feel a parents presence no restraint but not to understand a treasures worth till time has stolen away the slighted good is cause of half the poverty we feel and makes the world the wilderness it is the few that pray at all pray often amiss and seeking grace to improve the prize they hold would urge a wiser suit than asking more the night was winter in his roughest mood the morning sharp and clear but now at noon upon the southern side of the slant hills and where the woods fence off the northern blast the season smiles resigning all its rage and has the warmth of may the vault is blue without a cloud and white without a speck the dazzling splendor of the scene below again the harmony comes over the vale and through the trees i view the embattled tower whence all the music i again perceive the soothing influence of the wafted strains and settle in soft musings as i tread the walk still verdant under oaks and elms whose outspread branches overarch the glade the roof though moveable through all its length as the wind sways it has yet well sufficed and intercepting in their silent fall the frequent flakes has kept a path for me no noise is here or none that hinders thought the redbreast warbles still but is content with slender notes and more than half suppressed pleased with his solitude and flitting light from spray to spray wherever he rests he shakes from many a twig the pendent drops of ice that tinkle in the withered leaves below stillness accompanied with sounds so soft charms more than silence meditation here may think down hours to moments here the heart may give an useful lesson to the head and learning wiser grow without his books knowledge and wisdom far from being one have often times no connection knowledge dwells in heads replete with thoughts of other men wisdom in minds attentive to their own knowledge a rude unprofitable mass the mere materials with which wisdom builds till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place does but incumber whom it seems to enrich knowledge is proud that he has learned so much wisdom is humble that he knows no more books are not seldom talismans and spells by which the magic art of shrewder wits holds an unthinking multitude enthralled some to the fascination of a name surrender judgment hoodwinked some the style infatuates and through labyrinths and wilds of error leads them by a tune entranced while sloth seduces more too weak to bear the insupportable fatigue of thought and swallowing therefore without pause or choice the total grist unsifted husks and all but trees and rivulets whose rapid course defies the check of winter haunts of deer and sheepwalks populous with bleating lambs and lanes in which the primrose ere her time peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root deceive no student wisdom there and truth not shy as in the world and to be won by slow solicitation seize at once the roving thought and fix it on themselves what prodigies can power divine perform more grand than it produces year by year and all in sight of inattentive man familiar with the effect we slight the cause and in the constancy of natures course the regular return of genial months and renovation of a faded world see naught to wonder at should god again as once in gibeon interrupt the race of the undeviating and punctual sun how would the world admire but speaks it less an agency divine to make him know his moment when to sink and when to rise age after age than to arrest his course all we behold is miracle but seen so duly all is miracle in vain where now the vital energy that moved while summer was the pure and subtle lymph through the imperceptible maeandring veins of leaf and flower it sleeps and the icy touch of unprolific winter has impressed a cold stagnation on the intestine tide but let the months go round a few short months and all shall be restored these naked shoots barren as lances among which the wind makes wintry music sighing as it goes shall put their graceful foliage on again and more aspiring and with ampler spread shall boast new charms and more than they have lost then each in

copious of flowers the woodbine pale and wan but well compensating their sickly looks with nevercloying odours early and late hypericum all bloom so thick a swarm of flowers like flies clothing her slender rods that scarce a leaf appears mezerion too though leafless well attired and thick beset with blushing wreaths investing every spray althaea with the purple eye the broom yellow and bright as bullion unalloyd her blossoms and luxuriant above all the jasmine throwing wide her elegant sweets the deep dark green of whose unvarnishd leaf makes more conspicuous and illumines more the bright profusion of her scattered stars  these have been and these shall be in their day and all this uniform uncoloured scene shall be dismantled of its fleecy load and flush into variety again from dearth to plenty and from death to life is natures progress when she lectures man in heavenly truth evincing as she makes the grand transition that there lives and works a soul in all things and that soul is god the beauties of the wilderness are his that make so gay the solitary place where no eye sees them and the fairer forms that cultivation glories in are his he sets the bright procession on its way and marshals all the order of the year he marks the bounds which winter may not pass and blunts his pointed fury in its case russet and rude folds up the tender germ uninjured with inimitable art and ere one flowery season fades and dies designs the blooming wonders of the next some say that in the origin of things when all creation started into birth the infant elements received a law from which they swerve not since that under force of that controuling ordinance they move and need not his immediate hand who first prescribed their course to regulate it now thus dream they and contrive to save

sustains and is the life of all that lives nature is but a name for an effect whose cause is god he feeds the secret fire by which the mighty process is maintained who sleeps not is not weary in whose sight slowcircling ages are as transient days whose work is without labor whose design no flaw deforms no difficulty thwarts and whose beneficence no charge exhausts him blind antiquity profaned not served with selftaught rites and under various names female and male pomona pales pan and flora and vertumnus peopling earth with tutelary goddesses and gods that were not and commending as they would to each some province garden field or grove but all are under one one spirit  his who wore the platted thorns with bleeding brows rules universal nature not a flower but shows some touch in freckle streak or stain of his unrivaled pencil he inspires their balmy odors and imparts their hues and bathes their eyes with nectar and includes in grains as countless as the seaside sands the forms with which he sprinkles all the earth happy who walks with him whom what he finds of flavor or of scent in fruit or flower or what he views of beautiful or grand in nature from the broad majestic oak to the green blade that twinkles in the fun prompts with remembrance of a present god his presence who made all so fair perceived makes all still fairer as with him no scene is dreary so with him all seasons please though winter had been none had man been true and earth be punished for its tenants sake yet not in vengeance as this smiling sky so soon succeeding such an angry night and these dissolving snows and this clear stream recovring fast its liquid music prove who then that has a mind well strung and tuned to contemplation and within his reach a scene so friendly to his favorite task would waste attention at the checkered board his host of wooden warriors to and fro marching and countermarching with an eye as fixed as marble with a forehead ridged and furrowed into storms and with a hand trembling as if eternity were hung in balance on his conduct of a pin nor envies he aught more their idle sport who pant with application misapplied to trivial toys and pushing ivory balls across the velvet level feel a joy akin to rapture when the bawble finds its destined goal of difficult access nor deems he wiser him who gives his noon to miss the mercers plague from shop to shop wandering and littring with unfolded silks the polished counter and approving none or promising with smiles to call again nor him who by his vanity seduced and soothed into a dream that he discerns the difference of a guido from a daub frequents the crowded auction stationd there as duly as the langford of the show with glass at eye and catalogue in hand and tongue accomplished in the fulsome cant and pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease often as the pricedeciding hammer falls he notes it in his book then raps his box swears it is a bargain rails at his hard fate that he has let it pass  but never bids here unmolefted through whatever sign the sun proceeds i wander neither mist nor freezing sky nor sultry checking me nor stranger intermeddling with my joy even in the spring and playtime of the year that calls the unwonted villager abroad with all her little ones a sportive train to gather kingcups in the yellow mead and prink their hair with daisies or to pick a cheap but wholesome sallad from the brook these shades are all my own the timorous hare grown so familiar with her frequent guest scarce shuns me and the stock dove unalarmd sits cooing in the pine tree nor suspends his long loveditty for my near approach drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm that age or injury has hollowed deep where on his bed of wool and matted leaves he has outslept the winter ventures forth to frisk awhile and bask in the warm sun the squirrel flippant pert and full of play he sees me and at once swift as a bird ascends the neighboring beech there whisks his brush and perks his ears and stamps and scolds aloud with all the prettiness of feigned alarm and anger insignificantly fierce the heart is hard in nature and unfit for human fellowship as being void of sympathy and therefore dead alike to love and friendship both that is not pleased with sight of animals enjoying life nor feels their happiness augment his own the bounding fawn that darts across the glade when none pursues through mere delight of heart and spirits buoyant with excess of glee the horse as wanton and almost as fleet that skims the spacious meadow at full speed then stops and snorts and throwing high his heels starts to the voluntary race again the very kine that gambol at high noon the total herd receiving first from one that leads the dance a summons to be gay though wild their strange vagaries and uncouth their efforts yet resolved with one consent to give such act and uttrance as they may to ecstasy too big to be suppressed  these and a thousand images of bliss with which kind nature graces every scene where cruel man defeats not her design impart to the benevolent who wish all that are capable of pleasure pleased a far superior happiness to theirs the comfort of a reasonable joy man scarce had risen obedient to his call who formed him from the dust his future grave when he was crowned as never king was since god set the diadem upon his head and angel choirs attended wondering stood the newmade monarch while before him passed all happy and all perfect in their kind the creatures summoned from their various haunts to see their sovereign and confess his sway vast was his empire absolute his power or bounded only by a law whose force twas his sublimest privilege to feel and own the law of universal love he ruled with meekness they obeyed with joy no cruel purpose lurked within his heart and no distrust of his intent in theirs so eden was a scene of harmless sport where kindness on his part who ruled the whole begat a tranquil confidence in all and fear as yet was not nor cause for fear but sin marred all and the revolt of man that source of evils not exhausted yet was punished with revolt of his from him garden of god how terrible the change thy groves and lawns then witnessed every heart each animal of every name conceived a jealousy and an instinctive fear and conscious of some danger either fled precipitate the loathed abode of man or growld defiance in such angry sort as taught him too to tremble in his turn thus harmony and family accord were driven from paradise and in that hour the seeds of cruelty that since have swelled to such gigantic and enormous growth were sown in human natures fruitful soil hence date the persecution and the pain that man inflicts on all inferior kinds regardless of their plaints to make him sport to gratify the frenzy of his wrath or his base gluttony are causes good and just in his account why bird and beast should suffer torture and the streams be dyed with blood of their inhabitants impaled earth groans beneath the burden of a war waged with defenseless innocence while he not satisfied to prey on all around adds tenfold bitterness to death by pangs needless and first torments ere he devours now happiest they that occupy the scenes the most remote from his abhorred resort whom once as delegate of god on earth they feared and as his perfect image loved the wilderness is theirs with all its caves its hollow glenns its thickets and its plains unvisited by man there they are free and howl and roar as likes them uncontrolled nor ask his leave to slumber or to play woe to the tyrant if he dare intrude within the confines of their wild domain the lion tells him  i am monarch here  and if he spare him spares him on the terms of royal mercy and through generous scorn to rend a victim trembling at his foot in measure as by force of instinct drawn or by necessity constrained they live dependent upon man those in his fields these at his crib and some beneath his roof they prove too often at how dear a rate he sells protection witness at his foot the spaniel dying for some venial fault under dissection of the knotted scourge witness the patient ox with stripes and yells driven to the slaughter goaded as he runs to madness while the savage at his heels laughs at the frantic suffrers fury spent upon the guiltless passenger overthrown he too is

life to the fardistant goal arrives and dies so little mercy shows who needs so much does law so jealous in the cause of man denounce no doom on the delinquent none he lives and over his brimming beaker boasts as if barbarity were high desert the inglorious feat and clamorous in praise of the poor brute seems wisely to suppose the honors of his matchless horse his own but many a crime deemed innocent on earth is registered in heaven and these no doubt have each their record with a curse annexed man may dismiss compassion from his heart but god will never when he charged the jew to assist his foes downfallen beast to rise and when the bushexploring boy that seized the young to let the parent bird go free proved he not plainly that his meaner works are yet his care and have an interest all all in the universal fathers love on noah and in him on all mankind the charter was conferred by which we hold the flesh of animals in fee and claim over all we feed on power of life and death but read the instrument and mark it well the oppression of a tyrannous control can find no warrant there feed then and yield thanks for thy food carnivorous through sin feed on the slain but spare the living brute the governor of all himself to all so bountiful in whose attentive ear the unfledged raven and the lions whelp plead not in vain for pity on the pangs of hunger unassuaged has interposed not seldom his avenging arm to smite the injurious trampler upon natures law that claims forbearance even for a brute he hates the hardness of a balaams heart and prophet as he was he might not strike the blameless animal without rebuke on which he rode her opportune offense saved him or the unrelenting seer had died he sees that human equity is slack to interfere though in so just a cause and makes the task his own inspiring dumb and helpless victims with a sense so keen of injury with such knowledge of their strength and such sagacity to take revenge that often the beast has seemed to judge the man an ancient not a legendary tale by one of sound intelligence rehearsed if such who plead for providence may seem in modern eyes shall make the doctrine clear where england stretched toward the setting sun narrow and long oerlooks the western wave dwelt young misagathus a scorner he of god and goodness atheist in ostent vicious in act in temper savagefierce he journeyd and his chance was as he went to join a travller of far different note evander famed for piety for years deserving honor but for wisdom more fame had not left the venerable man a stranger to the manners of the youth whose face too was familiar to his view their way was on the margin of the land over the green summit of the rocks whose base beats back the roaring surge scarce heard so high the charity that warmed his heart was moved at sight of the manmonster with a smile gentle and affable and full of grace as fearful of offending whom he wished much to persuade he plied his ear with truths not harshly thundered forth or rudely pressed but like his purpose gracious kind and sweet and do thou dream the impenetrable man exclaimed that me the lullabies of age and fantasies of dotards such as thou can cheat or move a moments fear in me mark now the proof i give thee that the brave need no such aids as superstition lends to steel their hearts against the dread of death he spoke and to the precipice at hand pushed with a madmans fury fancy shrinks and the blood thrills and curdles at the thought of such a gulf as he designed his grave but though the felon on his back could dare the dreadful leap more rational his steed declined the death and wheeling swiftly round or ere his hoof had pressed the crumbling verge baffled his rider saved against his will the frenzy of the brain may be redressed by medicine well applied but without grace the hearts insanity admits no cure enraged the more by what might have reformed his horrible intent again he sought destruction with a zeal to be destroyed with sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood but still in vain the providence that meant a longer date to the far nobler beast spared yet again the ignobler for his sake and now his prowess proved and his sincere incurable obduracy evinced his rage grew cool and pleased perhaps to have earned so cheaply the renown of that attempt with looks of some complacence he resumed his road deriding much the blank amaze of good evander still where he was left fixed motionless and petrified with dread so on they fared discourse on other themes ensuing seemed to obliterate the past and tamer far for so much fury shown as is the course of rash and fiery men the rude companion smiled as if transformed but twas a transient calm a storm was near an unsuspected storm his hour was come the impious challenger of power divine was now to learn that heaven though slow to wrath is never with impunity defied his horse as he had caught his masters mood snorting and starting into sudden rage unbidden and not now to be controlled rushed to the cliff and having reached it stood at once the shock unseated him he flew sheer over the craggy barrier and immersed deep in the flood found when he sought it not the death he had deserved and died alone so god wrought double justice made the fool the victim of his own tremendous choice and taught a brute the way to safe revenge i would not enter on my list of friends though graced with polished manners and fine sense yet wanting sensibility the man who needlessly sets foot upon a worm an inadvertent step may crush the snail that crawls at evening in the public path but he that has humanity forewarned will tread aside and let the reptile live the creeping vermin loathsome to the sight and charged perhaps with venom that intrudes a visitor unwelcome into scenes sacred to neatness and repose the alcove the chamber or refectory may die a necessary act incurs no blame not so when held within their proper bounds and guiltless of offense they range the air or take their pastime in the spacious field there they are privileged and he that hunts or harms them there is guilty of a wrong disturbs the economy of natures realm who when she formed designed them an abode the sum is this if mans convenience health or safety interfere his rights and claims are paramount and must extinguish theirs else they are all  the meanest things that are as free to live and to enjoy that life as god was free to form them at the first who in his sovereign wisdom made them all ye therefore who love mercy teach your sons to love it too the springtime of our years is soon dishonored and defiled in most by budding ills that ask a prudent hand to check them but alas none sooner shoots if unrestrained into luxuriant growth than cruelty most devilish of them all mercy to him that shows it is the rule and righteous limitation of its act by which heaven moves in pardning guilty man and he that shows none being ripe in years and conscious of the outrage he commits shall seek it and not find it in his turn distinguished much by reason and still more by our capacity of grace divine from creatures that exist but for our sake which having served us perish we are held accountable and god some future day will reckon with us roundly for the abuse of what he deems no mean or trivial trust superior as we are they yet depend not more on human help than we on theirs their strength or speed or vigilance were giv in aid of our defects in some are found such teachable and apprehensive parts that mans seize in his own concerns matched with the expertness of the brutes in theirs are ofttimes vanquished and thrown far behind some show that nice sagacity of smell and read with such discernment in the ports and figure of the man his secret aim that often we owe our safety to a skill we could not teach and must despair to learn but learn we might if not too proud to stoop to quadrupede instructors many a good and useful quality and virtue too rarely exemplified among ourselves attachment never to be weaned or changed by any change of fortune proof alike against unkindness absence and neglect fidelity that neither bribe nor threat can move or warp and gratitude for small and trivial favors lasting as the life and glistning even in the dying eye man praises man desert in arts or arms wins public honor and ten thousand sit patiently present at a sacred song commemorationmad content to hear oh wonderful effect of musics power mussiahs eulogy for handels sake but less methinks than sacrilege might serve  for was it less what heathen would have dared to strip joves statue of his oaken wreath and hang it up in honor of a man much less might serve when all that we design is but to gratify an itching ear and give the day to a musicians praise remember handel who that was not born deaf as the dead to harmony forgets or can the more than homer of his age yes  we remember him and while we praise a talent so divine remember too that his most holy book from whom it came was never meant was never used before to buckram out the memory of a man but hush  the muse perhaps is too severe and with a gravity beyond the size and measure of the offense rebukes a deed less impious than absurd and owing more to want of judgment than to wrong design so in the chapel of old ely house when wandering charles who meant to be the third had fled from william and the news was fresh the simple clerk but loyal did announce and eke did rear right merrily two staves sung to the praise and glory of king george  man praises man and garricks memory next when time has somewhat mellowd it and made the idol of our worship while he lived the god of our idolatry once more shall have its altar and the world shall go in pilgrimage to bow before his shrine the theater too small shall suffocate its squeezed contents and more than it admits shall sigh at their exclusion and return ungratified for there some noble lord shall stuff his shoulders with king richards bunch or wrap himself in hamlets inky cloak and strut and storm and straddle stamp and stare the show the world how garrick did not act for garrick was a worshipper himself he drew the liturgy and framed the rites and solemn ceremonial of the day and called the world to worship on the banks of avon famed in song ah pleasant proof that piety has still in human hearts some place a spark or two not yet extinct the mulbry tree was hung with blooming wreaths the mulbry tree stood center of the dance the mulbry tree was hymnd with dulcet airs and from his touchwood trunk the mulbry tree supplied such relics as devotion holds still sacred and preserves with pious care so twas an hallowed time decorum reigned and mirth without offense no few returned doubtless much edified and all refreshed  man praises man the rabble all alive from tiplingbenches cellars stalls and styes swarm in the streets the statesman of the day a pompous and slowmoving pageant comes some shout him and some hang upon his car to gaze ins eyes and bless him maidens wave their kerchiefs and old women weep for joy while others not so satisfied unhorse the gilded equipage and turning loose his streeds usurp a place they well deserve why what has charmed them has he saved the state no does he purpose its salvation no enchanting novelty that moon at full that finds out every crevice of the head that is not sound and perfect has in theirs wrought this disturbance but the wane is near and his own cattle must suffice him soon thus idly do we waste the breath of praise and dedicate a tribute in its use and just direction sacred to a thing doomed to the dust or lodged already there encomium in old time was poets work but poets having lavishly long since exhausted all materials of the art the task now falls into the public hand and i contented with an humble theme have poured my stream of panegyric down the vale of nature where it creeps and winds among her lovely works with a secure and unambitious course reflecting clear if not the virtues yet the worth of brutes and i am recompensed and deem the toils of poetry not lost if verse of mine may stand between an animal and woe and teach one tyrant pity for his drudge the groans of nature in this nether world which heaven has heard for ages have an end foretold by prophets and by poets sung whose fire was kindled at the prophets lamp the time of rest the promised sabbath comes six thousand years of sorrow have wellnigh fulfilled their tardy and disastrous course over a sinful world and what remains of this tempestuous state of human things is merely as the working of a sea before a calm that rocks itself to rest for he whose car the winds are and the clouds the dust that waits upon his sultry march when sin has moved him and his wrath is hot shall visit earth in mercy shall descend propitious in his chariot paved with love and what his storms have blasted and defaced for mans revolt shall with a smile repair sweet is the harp of prophesy too sweet not to be wronged by a mere mortal touch nor can the wonders it records be sung to meaner music and not suffer loss but when a poet or when one like me happy to rove among poetic flowers though poor in skill to rear them lights at last on some sair theme some theme divinely fair such is the impulse and the spur he feels to give it praise proportioned to its worth that not to attempt it arduous as he deems the labor were a task more arduous still oh scenes surpassing fable and yet true scenes of accomplished bliss which who can see though but in distant prospect and not feel his soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy rivers of gladness water all the earth and clothe all climes with beauty the reproach of barreness is past the fruitful field laughs with abundance and the land once lean or fertile only in its own disgrace exults to see its thistly curse repealed the various seasons woven into one and that one season an eternal spring the garden fears no blight and needs no fence for there is none to covet all are full the lion and the libbard and the bear graze with the fearless siocks all bask at noon together or all gambol in the shade of the same grove and drink one common stream antipathies are none no foe to man lurks in the serpent now the mother sees and smiles to see her infants playful hand stretched forth to dally with the crested worm to stroke his azure neck or to receive the lambent homage of his arrowy tongue all creatures worship man and all mankind one lord one father error has no place that creeping pestilence is driven away the breath of heaven has chased it in the heart no passion touches a discordant string but all is harmony and love disease is not the pure and uncontaminate blood holds its due course nor fears the frost of age one song employs all nations and all cry worthy the lamb for he was slain for us the dwellers in the vales and on the rocks shout to each other and the mountain tops from distant mountains catch the flying joy till nation after nation taught the strain earth rolls the rapturous hosanna round behold the measure of the promise filled see salem built the labor of a god bright as a sun the sacred city shines all kingdoms and all princes of the earth flock to that light the glory of all lands flows into her unbounded is her joy and endless her increase thy rams are there nebaioth and kedar the sons of ishamael and progenitors of the arabs in the prophetic scripture here alluded to may be reasonably considered as representatives of the gentiles at large nebaioth and the flocks of kedar there the looms of ormus and the mines of ind and sabas spicey groves pay tribute there praise is in all her gates upon her walls and in her streets and in her spacious courts is heard salvation eastern java there kneels with the native of the farthest west and aethiopia spreads abroad the hand and worships her report has traveled forth into all lands from every clime they come to see thy beauty and to share thy joy o sion an assembly such as earth saw never such as heaven stoops down to see thus heavnward all things tend for all were once perfect and all must be at length restored so god has greatly purposed who would else in his dishonored works himself endure dishonor and be wronged without redress haste then and wheel away a shattered world ye slowrevolving seasons we would see a sight to which our eyes are strangers yet a world that does not dread and hate his laws and suffer for its crime would learn how fair the creature is that god pronounces good how pleasant in itself what pleases him here every drop of honey hides a sting worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers and even the joy that happily some poor heart derives from heaven pure as the fountain is is sullied in the stream taking a taint from touch of human lips at best impure oh for a world in principle as chaste as this is gross and selfish over which custom and prejudice shall bear no sway that govern all things here shouldring aside the meek and modest truth and forcing her to seek a refuge from the tongue of strife in nooks obscure far from the ways of men where violence shall never lift the sword nor cunning justify the proud mans wrong leaving the poor no remedy but tears where he that fills an office shall esteem the occasion it presents of doing good more than the perquisite where law shall speak seldom and never but as wisdom prompts and equity not jealous more to guard a worthless form than to decide aright where fashion shall not sanctify abuse nor smooth goodbreeding supplemental grace with lean performance ape the work of love come then and added to thy many crowns receive yet one the crown of all the earth thou who alone art worthy it was thine by ancient covenant ere natures birth and thou have made it thine by purchase since and overpaid its value with thy blood thy saints proclaim thee king and in their hearts thy title is engraven with a pen dipped in the fountain of eternal love thy saints proclaim thee king and thy delay gives courage to their foes who could they see the dawn of thy last advent longdesired would creep into the bowels of the hills and flee for safety to the falling rocks the very spirit of the world is tired of its own taunting question asked so long where is the promise of your lords approach the infidel has shot his bolts away till his exhausted quiver yielding none he gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled and aims them at the shield of truth again the veil is rent rent too by priestly hands that hides divinity from mortal eyes and all the mysteries to faith proposed insulted and traduced are cast aside as useless to the moles and to the bats they now are deemed the faithful and are praised who constant only in rejecting thee deny thy godhead with a martyrs zeal and quit their office for their errors sake blind and in love with darkness yet even these worthy compared with sycophants who knee thy name adoring and then preach thee man so fares thy church but how thy church may fare the world takes little thought who will may preach and what they will all pastors are alike to wandering sheep resolved to follow none two gods divide them all pleasure and gain for these they live they sacrifice to these and in their service wage perpetual war with conscience and with thee lust in their hearts and mischief in their hands they roam the earth to prey upon each other stubborn fierce highminded foaming out their own disgrace thy prophets speak of such and noting down the features of the last degenerate times exhibit every lineament of these come then and added to thy many crowns receive yet one as radiant as the rest due to thy last and most effectual work thy word fulfilled the conquest of a world he is the happy man whose life even now shows somewhat of that happier life to come who doomed to an obscure but tranquil state is pleased with it and were he free to choose would make his fate his choice whom peace the fruit of virtue and whom virtue fruit of faith prepare for happiness bespeak him one content indeed to sojourn while he must below the skies but having there his home the world oerlooks him in her busy search of objects more illustrious in her view and occupied as earnestly as she though more sublimely he oerlooks the world she scorns his pleasures for she knows them not he seeks not hers for he has proved them vain he cannot skim the ground like summer birds pursuing gilded flies and such he deems her honors her emoluments her joys therefore in contemplation is his bliss whose power is such that whom she lifts from earth she makes familiar with a heaven unseen and shows him glories yet to be revealed not slothful he though seeming unemployed and censured often as useless stillest streams often water fairest meadows and the bird that flutters least is longest on the wing ask him indeed what trophies he has raised or what achievements of immortal fame he purposes and he shall answer  none his warfare is within there unfatigued his fervent spirit labors there he fights and there obtains fresh triumphs over himself and neverwithring wreaths compared with which the laurels that a caesar reaps are weeds perhaps the selfapproving haughty world that as she sweeps him with her whistling silks scarce deigns to notice him or if she see deems him a cipher in the works of god receives advantage from his noiseless hours of which she little dreams perhaps she owes her sunshine and her rain her blooming spring and plenteous harvest to the prayer he makes when isaac like the solitary saint walks forth to meditate at eventide and think on her who thinks not for herself forgive him then thou bustler in concerns of little worth and idler in the best if author of no mischief and some good he seek his proper happiness by means that may advance but cannot hinder thine nor though he tread the secret path of life engage no notice and enjoy much ease account him an encumbrance on the state receiving benefits and rendring none his sphere though humble if that humble sphere shine with his fair example and though small his influence if that influence all be spent in soothing sorrow and in quenching strife in aiding helpless indigence in works from which at least a grateful few derive some taste of comfort in a world of woe then let the supercilious great confess he serves his country recompenses well the state beneath the shadow of whose vine he sits secure and in the scale of life holds no ignoble though a slighted place the man whose virtues are more felt than seen must drop indeed the hope of public praise but he may boast what few that win it can that if his country stand not by his skill at least his follies have not wrought her fall polite refinement offers him in vain her golden tube through which a sensual world draws gross impurity and likes it well the neat conveyance hiding all the offense not that he peevishly rejects a mode because that world adopts it if it bear the stamp and clear impression of good sense and be not costly more than of true worth he puts it on and for decorum sake can wear it even as gracefully as she she judges of refinement by the eye he by the test of conscience and a heart not soon deceived aware that what is base no polish can make sterling and that vice though well perfumed and elegantly dressed like an unburied carcass tricked with flowers is but a garnished nuisance fitter far for cleanly riddance than for fair attire so life glides smoothly and by stealth away more golden than that age of fabled gold renowned in ancient song not vexed with care or stained with guilt beneficent approved of god and man and peaceful in its end so glide my life away and so at last my share of duties decently fulfilled may some disease not tardy to perform its destined office yet with gentle stroke dismiss me weary to a safe retreat beneath the turf that i have often trod it shall not grieve me then that once when called to dress a sofa with the flowers of verse i played awhile obedient to the fair with that light task but soon to please her more whom flowers alone i knew would little please let fall the unfinished wreath and roved for fruit roved far and gathered much some harsh it is true picked from the thorns and briars of reproof but wholesome welldigested grateful some to palates that can taste immortal truth insipid else and sure to be despised but all is in his hand whose praise i seek in vain

the night be raw i will see him too  the first i ever saw i knew the man and knew his nature mild and was his plaything often when a child but somewhat at that moment pinched him close else he was seldom bitter or morose perhaps his confidence just then betrayed his grief might prompt him with the speech he made perhaps twas mere good humor gave it birth the harmless play of pleasantry and mirth however it was his language in my mind bespoke at least a man that knew mankind but not to moralize too much and strain to prove an evil of which all complain i hate long arguments verbosely

bringing forth undoubted scholarship and genuine worth and in the firmament of fame still shines a glory bright as that of all the signs of poets raised by you and statesmen and divines peace to them all those brilliant times are fled and no such lights are kindling in their stead our striplings shine indeed but with such rays as set the midnight riot in a blaze and seem if judged by their expressive looks deeper in none than in their surgeons books say muse for education made the song no muse can hesitate or linger long what causes move us knowing as we must that these menageries all fail their trust to send our sons to scout and scamper there while colts and puppies cost us so much care be it a weakness it deserves some praise we love the playplace of our early days the scene is touching and the heart is stone that feels not at that sight and feels at none the wall on which we tried our graving skill the very name we carved subsisting still the bench on which we sat while deepemployd though mangled hacked and hewed not yet destroyed the little ones unbuttond glowing hot playing our games and on the very spot as happy as we once to kneel and draw the chalky ring and knuckle down at taw to pitch the ball into the grounded hat or drive it devious with a dextrous pat the pleasing spectacle at once excites such recollection of our own delights that viewing it we seem almost to obtain our innocent sweet simple years again this fond attachment to the wellknown place whence first we started into lifes long race maintains its hold with such unfailing sway we feel it even in age and at our latest day hark how the sire of chits whose future share of classic food begins to be his care with his own likeness placed on either knee indulges all a fathers heartfelt glee and tells them as he strokes their silver locks that they must soon learn latin and to box then turning he regales his listening wife with all the adventures of his early life his skill in coachmanship or driving chaise in bilking tavern bills and spouting plays what shifts he used detected in a scrape how he was floggd or had the luck to escape what sums he lost at play and how he sold watch seals and all till all his pranks are told retracing thus his frolics it is a name that palliates deeds of folly and of shame he gives the local biass all its sway resolves that where he played his sons shall play and destines their bright genius to be shown just in the scene where he displayed his own the meek and bashful boy will soon be taught to be as bold and forward as he ought the rude will scuffle through with ease enough great schools suit best the sturdy and the rough ah happy designation prudent choice the event is sure expect it and rejoice soon see your wish fulfilled in either child the pert made perter and the tame made wild the great indeed by titles riches birth excused the encumbrance of more solid worth are best disposed of where with most success they may acquire that confident address those habits of profuse and lewd expense that scorn of all delights but those of sense which though in plain plebeians we condemn with so much reason all expect from them but families of less illustrious fame whose chief distinction is their spotless name whose heirs their honors none their income small must shine by true desert or not at all what dream they of that with so little care they risk their hopes their dearest treasure there they dream of little charles or william graced with wig prolix downflowing to his waist they see the attentive crowds his talents draw they hear him speak  the oracle of law the father who designs his babe a priest dreams him episcopally such at least and while the playful jockey scowrs the room briskly astride upon the parlour broom in fancy sees him more superbly ride in coach with purple lined and mitres on its side events improbable and strange as these which only a parental eye foresees a public school shall bring to pass with ease but how resides such virtue in that air as must create an appetite for prayer and will it breathe into him all the zeal that candidates for such a prize should feel to take the lead and be the foremost still in all true worth and literary skill ah blind to bright futurity untaught the knowledge of the world and dull of thought churchladders are not always mounted best by learned clerks and latinists professed the exalted prize demands an upward look not to be found by poring on a book small skill in latin and still less in greek is more than adequate to all i seek let erudition grace him or not grace i give the bawble but the second place his wealth fame honors all that i intend subsist and center in one point  a friend a friend whatever he studies or neglects shall give him consequence heal all defects his intercourse with peers and sons of peers  there dawns the splendor of his future years in that bright quarter his propitious skies shall blush betimes and there his glory rise  your lordship and your grace what school can teach a rhetric equal to those parts of speech what need of homers verse or tullys prose sweet interjections if he learn but those let reverend churls his ignorance rebuke who starve upon a dogseard pentateuch the parson knows enough who knows a duke  egregious purpose worthily begun in barbarous prostitution of your son pressed on his part by means that would disgrace a scrivners clerk or footman out of place and ending if at last its end be gained in sacrilege in gods own house profaned it may succeed and if his sins should call for more than common punishment it shall the wretch shall rise and be the thing on earth least qualified in honor learning worth to occupy a sacred awful post in which the best and worthiest tremble most the royal letters are a thing of course a king that would might recommend his horse and deans no doubt and chapters with one voice as bound in duty would confirm the choice behold your bishop well he plays his part christian in name and infidel in heart ghostly in office earthly in his plan a slave at court elsewhere a ladys man dumb as a senator and as a priest a piece of mere churchfurniture at best to live estranged from god his total scope and his end sure without one glimpse of hope but fair although and feasible it seem depend not much upon your golden dream for providence that seems concerned to exempt the hallowed bench from absolute contempt in spite of all the wrigglers into place still keeps a seat or two for worth and grace and therefore it is that though the sight be rare we sometimes see a lowth or bagot there besides schoolfriendships are not always found though fair in promise permanent and sound the most disintrested and virtuous minds in early years connected time unbinds new situations give a different cast of habit inclination temper taste and he that seemed our counterpart at first soon shows the strong similitude reversed young heads are giddy and young hearts are warm and make mistakes for manhood to reform boys are at best but pretty buds unblown whose scent and hues are rather guessed than known each dreams that each is just what he appears but learns his error in maturer years when disposition like a sail unfurled shows all its rents and patches to the world if therefore even when honest in design a boyish friendship may so soon decline twere wiser sure to inspire a little heart with just abhorrence of so mean a part than set your son to work at a vile trade for wages so unlikely to be paid our public hives of puerile resort that are of chief and most approved report to such base hopes in many a sordid soul owe their repute in part but not the whole a principle whose proud pretensions pass unquestioned though the jewel be but glass that with a world not often overnice ranks as a virtue and is yet a vice or rather a gross compound justly tried of envy hatred jealousy and pride contributes most perhaps to inhance their fame and emulation is its specious name boys once on fire with that contentious zeal feel all the rage that female rivals feel the prize of beauty in a womans eyes not brighter than in theirs the scholars prize the spirit of that competition burns with all varieties of ill by turns each vainly magnifies his own success resents his fellows wishes it were less exults in his miscarriage if he fail deems his reward too great if he prevail and labors to surpass him day and night less for improvement than to tickle spite the spur is powerful and i grant its force it pricks the genius forward in its course allows short time for play and none sor sloth and felt alike by each advances both but judge where so much evil intervenes the end though plausible not worth the means weigh for a moment classical desert against an heart depraved and temper hurt hurt too perhaps for life for early wrong done to the nobler part affects it long and you are staunch indeed in learnings cause if you can crown a discipline that draws such mischiefs after it with much applause connection formed for interest and endeared by selfish views thus censured and cashiered and emulation as engendring hate doomed to a no less ignominious fate the props of such proud seminaries fall the jachin and the boaz of them all great schools rejected then as those that swell beyond a size that can be managed well shall royal institutions miss the bays and small academies win all the praise force not my drift beyond its just intent i praise a school as pope a government so take my judgment in his language dressed whatever is best administered is best few boys are born with talents that excel but all are capable of living well then ask not whether limited or large but watch they strictly or neglect their charge if anxious only that their boys may learn while morals languish a despised concern the great and small deserve one common blame different in size but in effect the same much zeal in virtues cause all teachers boast though motives of mere lucre sway the most therefore in towns and cities they abound for there the game they seek is easiest found though there in spite of all that care can do traps to catch youth are most abundant too if shrewd and of a wellconstructed brain keen in pursuit and vigorous to retain your son come forth a prodigy of skill as wheresoever taught so formed he will the paedagogue with selfcomplacent air claims more than half the praise as his due share but if with all his genius he betray not more intelligent than loose and gay such vicious habits as disgrace his name threaten his health his fortune and his fame though want of due restraint alone have bred the symptoms that you see with so much dread unenvied there he may sustain alone the whole reproach the fault was all his own oh it is a sight to be with joy perused by all whom sentiment has not abused newfangled sentiment the boasted grace of those who never feel in the right place a sight surpassed by none that we can show though vestris on one leg still shine below a father blessed with an ingenuous son father and friend and tutour all in one how turn again to tales long since forgot aesop and phaedrus and the rest  why not he will not blush that has a fathers heart to take in childish plays a childish part but bends his sturdy back to any toy that youth takes pleasure in to please his boy then why resign into a strangers hand a task as much within your own command that god and nature and your interest too seem with one voice to delegate to you why hire a lodging in a house unknown for one whose tenderest thoughts all hover round your own this second weaning needless as it is how does it lacerate both your heart and his the indented stick that loses day by day notch after notch till all are smoothed away bears witness long ere his dismission come with what intense desire he wants his home but though the joys he hopes beneath your roof bid fair enough to answer in the proof harmless and safe and natural as they are a disappointment waits him even there arrived he feels an unexpected change he blushes hangs his head is shy and strange no longer takes as once with fearless ease his favorite stand between his fathers knees but seeks the corner of some distant seat and eyes the door and watches a retreat and least familiar where he should be most feels all his happiest privileges lost alas poor boy  the natural effect of love by absence chilled into respect say what accomplishments at school acquired brings he to sweeten fruits so undesired thou well deserve an alienated son unless thy conscious heart acknowledge  none none that in thy domestic snug recess he had not made his own with more address though some perhaps that shock thy feeling mind and better never learned or left behind add too that thus estranged thou can obtain by no kind arts his confidence again that here begins with most that long complaint of filial frankness lost and love grown faint which often neglected in lifes waning years a parent pours into regardless ears like caterpillars dangling under trees by slender threads and swinging in the breeze which filthily bewray and sore disgrace the boughs in which are bred the unseemly race while every worm industriously weaves and winds his web about the rivelld leaves so numerous are the follies that annoy the mind and heart of every sprightly boy imaginations noxious and perverse which admonition can alone disperse the encroaching nuisance asks a faithful hand patient affectionate of high command to check the procreation of a breed sure to exhaust the plant on which they feed it is not enough that greek or roman page at stated hours his freakish thoughts engage even in his pastimes he requires a friend to warn and teach him safely to unbend over all his pleasures gently to preside watch his emotions and control their tide and levying thus and with an easy sway a tax of profit from his very play to impress a value not to be erasd on moments squandered else and running all to waste and seems it nothing in a fathers eye that unimproved those many moments fly and is he well content his son should find no nourishment to feed his growing mind but conjugated verbs and nouns declined for such is all the mental food purveyd by public hacknies in the schooling trade who feed a pupils intellect with store of syntax truly but with little more dismiss their cares when they dismiss their flock machines themselves and governed by a clock perhaps a father blessed with any brains would deem it no abuse or waste of pains to improve this diet at no great expense with savry truth and wholesome common sense to lead his son for prospects of delight to some not steep though philosophic height thence to exhibit to his wondering eyes yon circling worlds their distance and their size the moons of jove and saturns belted ball and the harmonious order of them all to show him in an insect or a flower such microscopic proofs of skill and power as hid from ages passed god now displays to combat atheists with in modern days to spread the earth before him and commend with designation of the fingers end its various parts to his attentive note thus bringing home to him the most remote to teach his heart to glow with generous flame caught from the deeds of men of ancient fame and more than all with commendation due to set some living worthy in his view whose fair example may at once inspire a wish to copy what he must admire such knowledge gained betimes and which appears though solid not too weighty for his years sweet in itself and not forbidding sport when health demands it of athletic sort would make him what some lovely boys have been and more than one perhaps that i have seen an evidence and reprehension both of the mere schoolboys lean and tardy growth art thou a man professionally tied with all thy faculties elsewhere applied too busy to intend a meaner care than how to enrich thyself and next thine heir or art thou as though rich perhaps thou art but poor in knowledge having none to impart  behold that figure neat though plainly clad his sprightly mingled with a shade of sad not of a nimble tongue though now and then heard to articulate like other men no jester and yet lively in discourse his phrase well chosen clear and full of force and his address if not quite french in ease not english stiff but frank and formed to please low in the world because he scorns its arts a man of letters manners morals parts unpatronized and therefore little known wise for himself and his few friends alone in him thy well appointed proxy see armed for a work too difficult for thee prepared by taste by learning and true worth to form thy son to strike his genius forth beneath thy roof beneath thine eye to prove the force of discipline when backed by love to double all thy pleasure in thy child his mind informed his morals undefiled safe under such a wing the boy shall show no spots contracted among grooms below nor taint his speech with meannesses designed by footman tom for witty and refined there  in his commerce with the liveried herd lurks the contagion chiefly to be feared for since so fashion dictates all who claim an higher than a mere plebeian fame find it expedient come what mischief may to entertain a thief or two in pay and they that can afford the expense of more some half a dozen and some half a score great cause occurs to save him from a band so sure to spoil him and so near at hand a point secured if once he be supplied with some such mentor always at his side are such men rare perhaps they would abound were occupation easier to be found were education else so sure to fail conducted on a manageable scale and schools that have outlived all just esteem exchanged for the secure domestie scheme but having found him be thou duke or earl show thou have sense enough to prize the pearl and as thou would the advancement of thine heir in all good faculties beneath his care respect as is but rational and just a man deemed worthy of so dear a trust despised by thee what more can he expect from youthful folly than the same neglect a flat and fatal negative obtains that instant upon all his future pains his lessons tire his mild rebukes offend and all the instructions of thy sons best friend are a stream choked or trickling to no end doom him not then to solitary meals but recollect that he has sense and feels and that possessor of a soul refined an upright heart and cultivated mind his post not mean his talents not unknown he deems it hard to vegetate alone and if admitted at thy board he sit account him no just mark for idle wit offend not him whom modesty restrains from repartee with jokes that he disdains much less transfix his feelings with an oath nor frown unless he vanish with the cloth  and trust me his utility may reach to more than he is hired or bound to teach much trash unutterd and some ills undone through reverence of the censor of thy son but if thy table be indeed unclean foul with excess and with discourse obscene and thou a wretch whom following her old plan the world accounts an honorable man because forsooth thy courage has been tried and stood the test perhaps on the wrong side though thou had never grace enough to prove that any thing but vice could win thy love or have thou a polite cardplaying wife chained to the routs that she frequents for life who just when industry begins to snore flies winged with joy to some coachcrouded door and thrice in every winter throngs thine own with half the chariots and sedans in town thyself meanwhile even shifting as thou may not very sober though nor very chaste or is thine house though less superb thy rank if not a scene of pleasure a mere blank and thou at best and in thy sobrest mood a trifler vain and empty of all good though mercy for thyself thou can have none hear nature plead show mercy to thy son saved from his home where every day brings forth some mischief fatal to his future worth find him a better in a distant spot within some pious pastors humble cot where vile example yours i chiefly mean the most seducing and the oftnest seen may never more be stamped upon his breast not yet perhaps incurably impressed where early rest makes early rising sure disease or comes not or finds easy cure prevented much by diet neat and plain or if it enter soon starved out again where all the attention of his faithful host discreetly limited to two at most may raise such fruits as shall reward his care and not at last evaporate in air where stillness aiding study and his mind serene and to his duties much inclined not occupied in daydreams as at home of pleasures past or follies yet to come his virtuous toil may terminate at last in settled habit and decided taste but whom do i advise the fashionled the incorrigibly wrong the deaf the dead whom care and cool deliberation suit not better much than spectacles a brute who if their sons some slight tuition share deem it of no great moment whose or where too proud to adopt the thoughts of one unknown and much too gay to have any of their own but courage man methought the muse replied mankind are various and the world is wide the ostrich silliest of the feathered kind and formed of god without a parents mind commits her eggs incautious to the dust forgetful that the foot may crush the trust and while on public nursries they rely not knowing and too often not caring why irrational in what they thus prefer no few that would seem wise resemble her but all are not alike thy warning voice may here and there prevent erroneous choice and some perhaps who busy as they are yet make their progeny their dearest care whose hearts will ache once told what ills may reach their offspring left upon so wild a beach will need no stress of argument to enforce the expedience of a less adventurous course the rest will slight thy counsel or condemn but they have human feelings turn to them to you then tenants of lifes middle state securely placed between the small and great whose character yet undebauchd retains two thirds of all the virtue that remains who wise yourselves desire your sons should learn your wisdom and your ways  to you i turn look round you on a world perversely blind see what contempt is fallen on human kind see wealth abused and dignities misplaced great titles offices and trusts disgraced long lines of ancestry renowned of old their noble qualities all quenched and cold see bedlams closetted and handcuffd charge surpassed in frenzy by the mad at large see great commanders making war a trade great lawyers lawyers without study made churchmen in whose esteem their blessed employ is odious and their wages all their joy who far enough from furnishing their shelves with gospel lore turn infidels themselves see womanhood despised and manhood shamed with infamy too nauseous to be named fops at all corners ladylike in mien civetted fellows smelt ere they are seen else coarse and rude in manners and their tongue on fire with curses and with nonsense hung now flushed with drunkness now with whoredom pale their breath a sample of last nights regale see volunteers in all the vilest arts men well endowed of honorable parts designed by nature wise but selfmade fools all these and more like these were bred at schools and if it chance as sometimes chance it will that though schoolbred the boy be virtuous still such rare exceptions shining in the dark prove rather than impeach the just remark as here and there a twinkling star descried serves but to show how black is all beside now look on him whose very voice in tone just echos thine whose features are thine own and stroke his polished cheek of purest red and lay thine hand upon his flaxen head and say my boy the unwelcome hour is come when thou transplanted from thy genial home must find a colder soil and bleaker air and trust for safety to a strangers care what character what turn thou will assume from constant converse with i know not whom who there will court thy friendship with what views and artless as thou art whom thou will choose though much depends on what thy choice shall be is all chancemedley and unknown to me can thou the tear just trembling on thy lids and while the dreadful risque foreseen forbids free too and under no constraining force unless the sway of custom warp thy course lay such a stake upon the losing side merely to gratify so blind a guide thou can not nature pulling at thine heart condemns the unfatherly the imprudent part thou would not deaf to natures tenderest plea turn him adrift upon a rolling sea nor say go thither conscious that there lay a brood of asps or quicksands in his way then only governed by the selfsame rule of natural pity send him not to school no  guard him better is he not thine own thyself in miniature thy flesh thy bone and hopest thou not it is every fathers hope that since thy strength must with thy years elope and thou will need some comfort to assuage healths last farewell a staff of thine old age that then in recompense of all thy cares thy child shall show respect to thy gray hairs befriend thee of all other friends bereft and give thy life its only cordial left aware then how much danger intervenes to compass that good end forecast the means his heart now passive yields to thy command secure it thine its key is in thine hand if thou desert thy charge and throw it wide nor heed what guests there enter and abide complain not if attachments lewd and base supplant thee in it and usurp thy place but if thou guard its sacred chambers sure from vicious inmates and delights impure either his gratitude shall hold him fast and keep him warm and filial to the last or if he prove unkind as who can say but being man and therefore frail he may one comfort yet shall cheer thine aged heart however he slight thee thou have done thy part oh barbarous would thou with a gothic hand pull down the schools  what  all the schools in the land or throw them up to livrynags and grooms or turn them into shops and auctionrooms a captious question sir and yours is one deserves an answer similar or none would thou possessor of a flock employ apprized that he is such a careless boy and feed him well and give him handsome pay merely to sleep and let them run astray survey our schools and colleges and see a sight not much unlike my simile from education as the leading cause the public character its color draws thence the prevailing manners take their cast extravagant or sober loose or chaste and though i would not advertize them yet nor write on each  this building to be let unless the world were all prepared to embrace a plan wellworthy to supply their place yet backward as they are and long have been to cultivate and keep the morals clean forgive the crime i wish them i confess or better managed or encouraged less the diverting history of john gilpin showing how he went farther than he intended and came safe home again john gilpin was a citizen of credit and renown a trainband captain eke was he of famous london town john gilpins spouse said to her dear though wedded we have been these twice ten tedious years yet we no holiday have seen tomorrow is our wedding day and we will then repair unto the bell at edmonton all in a chaise and pair my sister and my sisters child my self and children three will fill the chaise so you must ride on horseback after we he soon replied i do admire of womankind but one and you are she my dearest dear therefore it shall be done i am a linnendraper bold as all the world does know and my good friend the callender will lend his horse to go quoth mrs gilpin that is well said and for that wine is dear we will be furnished with our own which is both bright and clear john gilpin kissed his loving wife oerjoyd was he to find that though on pleasure she was bent she had a frugal mind the morning came the chaise was brought but yet was not allowed to drive up to the door lest all should say that she was proud so three doors off the chaise was stayed where they did all get in six precious souls and all agog to dash through thick and thin smack went the whip round went the  were never folk so glad the stones did rattle underneath as if cheapside were mad john gilpin at his horses side seized fast the flowing main and up he got in haste to ride but soon came down again for saddletree scarce reached had he his journey to begin when turning round his head he saw three customers come in so down he came for loss of time although it grieved him sore yet loss of pence full well he knew would trouble him much more twas long before the customers were suited to their mind when betty screaming came down stairs the wine is left behind good lack quoth he yet bring it me my leathern belt likewise in which i bear my trusty sword when i do exercise now mistress gilpin careful soul had two stone bottles found to hold the liquor that she loved and keep it safe and sound each bottle had a curling ear through which the belt he drew and hung a bottle on each side to make his balance true then over all that he might be equipped from top to toe his long red cloak well brushed and neat he manfully did throw now see him mounted once again upon his nimble steed full slowly pacing over the stones with caution and good heed but finding soon a smoother road beneath his wellshod feet the snorting beast began to trot which galled him in his seat so fair and softly john he cried but john he cried in vain that trot became a gallop soon in spite of curb and rein so stooping down as needs he must who cannot sit upright he grasped the mane with both his hands and eke with all his might his horse who never in that sort had handled been before what thing upon his back had got did wonder more and more away went gilpin neck or naught away went hat and wig he little dreamt when he set out of running such a rig the wind did blow the cloak did fly like streamer long and gay till loop and button failing both at last it flew away then might all people well discern the bottles he had slung a bottle swinging at each side as has been said or sung the dogs did bark the children screamd up flew the windows all and every soul cried out well done as loud as he could bawl away went gilpin  who but he his fame soon spread around  he carries weight he rides a race it is for a thousand pound and still as fast as he drew near twas wonderful to view how in a trice the turnpikemen their gates wide open threw and now as he went bowing down his reeking head full low the bottles twain behind his back were shattered at a blow down ran the wine into the road most piteous to be seen which made his horses flanks to smoke as they had basted been but still he seemed to carry weight with leathern girdle braced for all might see the bottle necks still dangling at his waist thus all through merry islington these gambols he did play and till he came unto the wash of edmonton so gay and there he threw the wash about on both sides of the way just like unto a trundling mop or a wildgoose at play at edmonton his loving wife from the balcony spied her tender husband wondering much to see how he did ride stop stop john gilpin  here is the house  they all at once did cry the dinner waits and we are tired said gilpin  so am i but yet his horse was not a whit inclined to tarry there for why his owner had a house full ten miles off at ware so like an arrow swift he flew shot by an archer strong so did he fly  which brings me to the middle of my song away went gilpin out of breath and sore against his will till at his friends the callenders his horse at last stood still the callender amazed to see his neighbor in such trim laid down his pipe flew to the gate and thus accosted him what news what news your tidings tell tell me you must and shall  say why bare headed you are come or why you come at all now gilpin had a pleasant wit and loved a timely joke and thus unto the callender in merry guise he spoke i came because your horse would come and if i well forebode my hat and wig will soon be here they are upon the road the callender right glad to find his friend in merry pin returned him not a single word but to the house went in whence strait he came with hat and wig a wig that flowed behind a hat not much the worse for wear each comely in its kind he held them up and in his turn thus showed his ready wit my head is twice as big as yours they therefore needs must fit but let me scrape the dirt away that hangs upon your face and stop and eat for well you may be in a hungry case said john it is my wedding day and all the world would stare if wife should dine at edmonton and i should dine at ware so turning to his horse he said i am in haste to dine twas for your pleasure you came here you shall go back for mine ah luckless speech and bootless boast for which he paid full dear for while he spoke a braying ass did sing most loud and clear whereat his horse did snort as he had heard a lion roar and galloped off with all his might as he had done before away went gilpin and away went gilpins hat and wig he lost them sooner than at first for why they were too big now mistress gilpin when she saw her husband posting down into the country far away she pulled out half a crown and thus unto the youth she said that drove them to the bell this shall be yours when you bring back my husband safe and well the youth did ride and soon did meet john coming back amain whom in a trice he tried to stop by catching at his rein but not performing what he meant and gladly would have done the frighted steed he frighted more and made him faster run away went gilpin and away went postboy at his heels the postboys horse right glad to miss the lumbring of the wheels six gentlemen upon the road thus seeing gilpin fly with postboy scampring in the rear they raised the hue and cry stop thief stop thief  a highwayman not one of them was mute and all and each that passed that way did join in the pursuit and now the turnpike gates again flew open in short space the tollmen thinking as before that gilpin rode a race and so he did and won it too for he got first to town nor stopped till where he had got up he did again get down now let us sing long live the king and gilpin long live he and when he next does ride abroad may i be there to see finis lately published by the same author
