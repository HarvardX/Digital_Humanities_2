remarks on dr boerhaaves theory of the attrition of the blood in the lungs  by samuel musgrave m a of corpuschristi college oxford  london printed in the year mdcclix  the celebrated dr boerhaave in his institutiones medicae lays it down as a fundamental principle that the blood in passing through the lungs undergoes a degree of attrition considerably greater than in any other part of the body this attrition according to his system eminently increases the heat of the blood at the same time that it unites the elementary parts of it more intimately and makes the whole mass more dense and compact  i am so far from assenting to this theory that i cannot but apprehend it is abundantly confuted by the texture and appearance of the parts themselves is it to be supposed for instance that the right ventricle of the heart which is thinner and apparently weaker than the left can communicate a greater impulse to the blood this however is one of the first requisites in producing a greater degree of attrition there is still a more remarkable difference between the pulmonary artery and the aorta the one being loose and flaccid the other of so dense and compact a nature as to resemble in some measure a cartilage if we go on to examine the texture of the parts through which these circulations are respectively performed and observe how tender and spungy the lungs are in comparison of the muscular parts of the body we cannot avoid coming to the same conclusion unless we would suppose that nature made the stronger substance to resist the weaker impression which surely would be interpreting its meaning very perversely  neither is it material to say that the blood may suffer considerable attrition by the alternate motion of the lungs in respiration either when expanded by the air or compressed by the thorax for action and reaction being equal it makes no difference in the effect whether the lungs be every moment pressed upon the blood or the stream of blood forced against the lungs should we therefore admit the sum of the attritions produced by these two causes in the lungs to be greater than that which subsists in the corresponding arteries of the body the same objection would still remain in regard to the structure of the parts it would still be impossible to comprehend how the author of nature could proportion his work so ill as to make the power of resistance greatest where the impression was least to give an unnecessary degree of strength to one system of arteries or an insufficient one to the other  the difficulties that attend this theory are not more extraordinary than the proofs by which it is supported are defective in regard to the velocity of the two circulations dr haller expresses himself thus cum sanguinis tantum per pulmones transeat in dato tempore quantum per universum corpus humanum sequitur ut sanguis per pulmonem in eadem ratione fluat celerius qua ipse pulmo minor est  in boerhaav praelection acad vol ii p     it is hard to say whether the doctor is more unfortunate here in his premises or his conclusion in the first place that equal quantities of blood pass in equal times through the lungs and through the larger circuit of the body is asserted as far as i can inform myself without any manner of foundation either in reason or experiment and secondly admitting it to be true the consequence would be just the contrary of what the doctor supposes namely that the motion of the blood through the lungs must be slower and in the very same proportion too that he assigns for its being quicker in a late edition of the commentary on boerhaaves institutions i find the following note by which it appears that the doctor begins to suspect at least the justness and force of his reasoning haec omnia expedita sunt unum superest an velocius trajicitur per pulmones sanguis videtur etiam lentius trajici quia sanguis per corpus trajectus viam multo majorem eodem tempore absolvit  and video hanc rationem fuse and ornate proponi a cl krugero in physiologia germanice scripta vol ii p   0 ed gotting       it has indeed been observed by dr hales  haemastat p    that in the lungs of a frog the blood moves with greater velocity than in any other part of the body we are not however to make any general inferences from this phenomenon which seems to depend upon the peculiar structure of the frog and some other small animals the heart of which having only one ventricle must of necessity give the same impulse to all the circulating blood we cannot i say conclude from instances of this kind that the relative velocity of the two circulations is exactly the same in larger animals where the heart having two ventricles may possibly impel the blood with different degrees of force  but to consider this experiment in another light it appears that the power exerted at the origin of the pulmonary artery and the aorta being equal the blood moves with greater velocity through the lungs than through any other part of the body what are we to conclude from this but that the blood vessels of the lungs are larger allowing the blood to pass through them with greater freedom which being once admitted dr boerhaaves theory is directly overthrown in the very instance that dr haller refers to in support of it vol ii p   0 and still more clearly with respect to larger animals where the force impelling the blood into the lungs is with good reason supposed to be less than that which throws it into the aorta  finis
