honoria or the day of all souls a poem with other poetical pieces  london printed for j robson bookseller in new bond street m dcc lxxxii  advertisement the scene of the following little poem is supposed to be in the great church of st ambrose at milan the second of november on which day the most solemn office is performed for the repose of the dead  honoria ye hallowed bells whose voices through the air the awful summons of affliction bear ye slowlywaving banners of the dead that over yon altar your dark horrors spread ye curtaind lamps whose mitigated ray casts round the fane a pale reluctant day ye walls ye shrines by melancholy dressed well do ye suit the fashion of my breast have i not lost what language cannot unfold the form of valor cast in beautys mould th intrepid youth the path of battle tried and foremost in the hour of peril died nor was i present to bewail his fate with pitys lenient voice to soothe his state to watch his looks to read while death stood by the last expression of his parting eye but other duties other cares impend cares that beyond the mournful grave extend now now i view convened the pious train whose bosom sorrows at anothers pain while recollection pleasingly severe wakes for the awful dead the silent tear and pictures as to each her sway extends the sacred forms of lovers parents friends now charity a fiery seraph stands beside yon altar with uplifted hands yet can this high solemnity of grief yield to the youth i love the wished relief these rites of death  ah what can they avail honorius died beyond the hallowed pale plungd in the gulf of fear  distressful state my anxious mind dares not enquire his fate yet why despond could one slight error roll a flood of poison over the healthful soul had not thy virtues full sufficing power to clear thee in the dread recording hour did they before the judge abashed remain did they weak advocates all plead in vain by love by piety by reason taught my soul revolts at the blaspheming thought sure in the breast to pure religion true where virtues templed god is templed too then while the august procession moves along midst swelling organs and the pomp of song while the dread chaunt still true to natures laws is deepend by the terrourbreathing pause while midst encircling clouds of incense lost the trembling priest upholds the sacred host amid these scenes shall i forget my suit amid these scenes shall i alone be mute nor to the footsteps of the throne above breathe the warm requiem to the youth i love now silence reigns along the gloomy fane and wraps in dread repose the pausing strain when next it bursts my humble voice i will join disclose my trembling wish at mercys shrine unveil my anguish to the throne above and sigh the requiem to the youth i love   does fancy mock me with a false delight or does some hallowed vision cheer my sight methinks emerging from the gloom below th immortal spirits leave the house of woe inshrind in glorys beams they reach the sky while choral songs of triumph burst from high see at the voice of my accorded prayer the radiant youth ascend the fields of air behold  he mounts unutterably bright cloathd in the sunrobe of unfading light applauding seraphs hail him on his way and lead him to the gates of everlasting day the soldiers farewell on the eve of a battle night expecting the dread morrow hovered over the martial train beauteous alice led by sorrow hurried to the silent plain give the watchword the guard uttered loudly from his destined place lo it is i fair alice muttered hastning to his fond embrace ever beauteous faithful ever quick the gallant youth rejoined cruel death can only sever hearts in loves strong links entwined soon shall we be torn asunder therefore welcome art thou come till morn wakes the battles thunder rest thee on that broken drum she sat down in mind reviewing ills the morning might behold tears still other tears pursuing down her cheek in silence rolled thoughts to other thoughts succeeding over her mind incessant flow she like meekness inlybleeding broods in stillness over her woe wherefore alice do thou ponder evils that are fancys brood sure our parting might be fonder than beseems this silent mood yet continue still to ponder things thy voice wants power to say thy dumb grief to me seems fonder than words decked in bright array she replied her tears still gushing what avails it to be brave thou amidst the battle rushing here perchance may meet a grave shoudst thou perish in the action wheres the peace to soothe my care all my life would be distraction madness wailing and despair still thou were of gentlest carriage still affectionately true and a lover still in marriage and a friend and parent too cheer thee cheer thee best of women trust to the great power above when i rush amidst the foemen heavn may think on her i love saving is the misers pleasure spending is the soldiers thrift take this guinea all my treasure take it as a parting gift here end we this mournful meeting catch from my lips this fond sigh if this be our last last greeting know that i was born to die see the dayspring gilds the streamers waving over the martial train now the hoarse drum wakes the dreamers neer perchance to dream again hark i hear the trumpets clangor bid the british youth excel now now glows the battles anger lovely alice fare thee well to the memory of a young lady endowed with all that fortune could bestow with brilliancy of wit and beautys glow francisca rising to her fifteenth year stood mid the virgin train without a peer her conscious bosom throbbd to virtue warm while diffidence still heightened every charm but heavens decree forbad this beautys queen to act her part through beautys shortlived scene a gradual illness on her figure
