modern times or the adventures of gabriel outcast  supposed to be written by himself  in imitation of gil blas  qui capit ille facit prove in three volumes volume ii  london printed for the author by the literary society at the logographic press and sold by j walter printinghousesquare blackfryars  mdcclxxxv  modern times chapter xvii miss wildman having opened herself so much to her maid respecting me and which he conceiving could said only with a view of my hearing it again i took an opportunity one morning when she came into charlottes room to request her private ear for five minutes with great and amiable goodnature she sent her maid into her room to adjust her toilet when i addressed her in the following manner if it be not an act of the highest presumption madam for one in my humble station in life to declare an attachment to a young lady of your rank and fortune if it be not an offense against propriety and duty to solicit your attention to any tale of mine i would venture to represent to you that thought you see me here as your fathers valet i am a gentleman both by birth and education and am not a great way removed from a very considerable landed property there is an estate of four thousand pounds a year in the family and my hopes of one day inheriting it are not wild and romantic i mention this only to induce your favorable hearing  mr gabriel said she interrupting me from the time i first saw you i was convinced that though wearing a livery you had been bred to better expectations  but as you have been the preserver of my honor and have risked your life in my defense whether servant or master you are equally entitled to my regard and gratitude  talk not of gratitude my dear miss wildman exclaimed i for her sweet condescension gave me greater confidence talk not of gratitude what i did was a duty due from my sex to yours and if it merits your simple thanks i am overpaid my humble character in life will not suffer me to make advances but should fortune at any future period put us nearer on an equality may i hope for something more than your regard  i am of too selfish a nature returns miss wildman not to acknowledge that were i mistress of worlds you have deserved them all i have a heart it is true to give again but what is my poor heart without my hand that is at my fathers disposal was it at my command i would enter further into the subject a thousand blessings on you my dear miss wildman for this generous declaration cried i in rapture taking her hand which she readily gave me let me extort but one declaration more and poor as i am i shall be the happiest of men your good sense mr gabriel returned she will i am persuaded prevent your urging me to say any thing i ought not to say what i am mistress of you may command what i have not to give you cannot expect i have too high a veneration for you my dear miss wildman replied i still holding her by the hand to urge the least impropriety you have frankly confessed your heart is still at liberty but not your hand i ask not your hand at present but solicit only your heart and that you will give me a chance by time of possessing the former at least that you will promise me not to bestow the one where you cannot yield the other this she solemnly promised her heart she said i had won and it was mine she had only to lament that she could not give her hand as readily charlotte that instant entering the room she left me but said she would take the first opportunity of seeing me again  she kept her word the next morning and brought me an enamelled ring of no great value in deed otherwise than as a proof of having reconsidered the matter and thus ratifying her determination take my dear gabriel says she this ring as a pledge of my sincerity that while you are living as i have thought proper to present you my heart no man else shall have my hand  i take it my dear miss wildman returned i pressing it with her hand to my lips as the best gift below heaven has to give and if i prove unworthy of the gift may i never know bliss hereafter i call you the most generous of women as the difference of my situation in life from yours puts me at too great a distance to have any expectations situation my dear gabriel replied she is an idle term on the footing of nature we are all equal and if there are any circumstances in the eye of the world that raise one person above another or distinguish individuals it is a greater share of moral virtue or of mental or corporal endowments given us by providence and improved by art you have to boast of these and of course are far before half the gentlemen i have the honor to know in alliances for life to secure a competency without which happiness is merely ideal it may be necessary to consult interest and pay some regard to fortune but where there is sufficient property on one side to ensure that competency to look for it on the other is mercenary and covetous my father is able to give me a fortune adequate to my utmost wishes and whenever the time shall come that i am in possession of that or you be in a situation not to want it you shall command my hand as you do now my heart  thus in an endearing enjoyment of a reciprocity of affection through the confidence of charlotte and the convenience of her room did many days glide smoothly on but after i had been in the family about six weeks with a kind of terror in her countenance miss wildman brought me the following letter which she had received from lord b  thou most cruel of women i have been long at loss to account for your indifference but the cause i am now acquainted with that of having a rival among your fathers servants i have too much pride to acquaint mr wildman with the fact but i shall watch the scoundrels motions and remove him from you  your injured b    i smiled at the threat and requested her to make herself easy under it for as fear was no part of my composition i should be always upon my guard but if at any time i was betrayed by any of my fellow servants and prevented a night from sleeping at home she should hear immediately from me she assured me her alarm was not very great upon the occasion as she conceived the letter to be a menace only her greatest unhappiness was that if any information had been given to him through a suspicion of the servants it might reach her fathers ears through the same channel and occasion a great deal of unhappiness for though no man was more warm in his friendships no one was more violent in his resentments should such a thing take place i told her whether i was in the house or out of it she had my consent to disown it and if i was called upon i would do the same  the alarm however caused me many an unquiet moment i had too good an opinion of charlotte to think she would betray me and i was not conscious it was known to any other part of the family lord b might possibly have heard that i was taken into the house and his jealousy might lead him to form a thousand conceptions and he might fix on this in order to mortify miss wildmans pride however from the tenor of the letter and from what i heard at mrs duplexs i was determined to be prepared for any violent attack and therefore never went out afterward but with a tuck cane and a brace of pistols loaded  the third day after miss wildman had shown me lord bs letter i was going out in the evening about six oclock in the month of october and it was then just at the close of day i had on a blue surtoutcoat with a red cape and plain hat with gilt button and loop and scarce had the porter opened the outer door but i heard a voice say that is he at this i rather drew back and a man in a chairmans coat ran up the steps toward me and with a tuck in his hand made an attempt to seize me i struck him upon the arm with my cane and with my foot thrust him down off the steps at that instant i saw two men more making up to me armed with bludgeons one had nearly reached me on which i took out one of my pistols and fired it and as i believe killed him on the spot i then turned round in order to take shelter within the house and found that the porter tried all he could to shut the door against me i overpowered him however with strength forced my way in bolted the door upon my enemy and with the but end of my pistol laid the porter flat upon the floor all this took place in less time than i have been telling it finding myself so far safe i ran backwards toward the stables pulled off my surtout coat that i might not be known tore the button and loop from my hat and made my escape into the meuse in which our stables stood as soon as i found myself at liberty i pushed away to a neighboring stand of coaches got into one and bid the coachman drive me toward st giless church when i was out of the reach of any pursuit i began to consider what was proper to be done perfectly convinced from the porters endeavoring to shut me out that he must be a party concerned i determined to write to my master and beg him to stand my friend and least a warrant should be issued to apprehend me to get off the next morning to some distance from london when i was near the end of oxford road i ordered the coachman to set me down walked on about half a mile went into a tavern and wrote a letter of which the following is a copy  sir i will not preface this letter with its cause ere this you are too well acquainted with it i am safe at present from any fear of danger or of being apprehended from a declaration of lord bs at mrs duplexs since i had the honor of being useful to miss wildman that he would take an opportunity to be revenged of me and from some other circumstances i have reason to believe that he waylaid me at your door for on my going out a fellow in a chairmans coat with a tuck in his hand endeavored to lay hold of me i beat his arm down with my cane and with my foot thrust him from the steps at this instant two more fellows with bludgeons endeavored to lay violent hands on me the foremost i fired at and possibly may have killed for i saw him fall attempting to return into the house john your porter did all he could to prevent it by forcing the door against me i succeeded however contrary to his wishes and from a conviction that he must from such conduct have been privy to the design against me i knocked the scoundrel down with my pistol if he lived to rise again you will probably by having him before a magistrate come at the bottom of this dark affair i trust you will do it not only in justice to yourself and the world but to your unfortunate but respectful humble servant  gabriel outcast ps part of the fifty pounds you was pleased to give me is in my trunk in my room which i beg leave to commit to your disposal having sufficient money for my present occasions     i thought of writing to miss wildman according to my promise but dropped it lest my letter should have been intercepted by her father and as i knew she would be made acquainted with my situation from what i had written to him i walked into the strand with this letter and thence dispatched a chairman with it to berkley square this done i found my mind at ease went into a coffeehouse got me some refreshment reconnoitred the depth of my purse which contained rather better than three guineas and went out about ten oclock in quest of a lodging which in order to elude all search i determined should be in one of those houses in the narrow part of st giless where vagrants are taken in at twopence a night i soon found out such a lodging and that my dress might create no suspicion i turned my coat wrong side outward loosened the knees of my breeches slouched my hat rolled myself in the kennel and affected to be in liquor it answered all the purposes i wished and i was shown up to a bed without sheets where some poor wretch was already lain and fast sleep i was no sooner in the room than the man who showed me upstairs asked me for twopence for my lodging locked the door upon me and told me when i rose and chose to be let out to ring the bell he left me no candle and all the light i had was from a lamp on the staircase that gave light within the room by a little window over the door i could not find out by that light what kind of a person my bedfellow was but i examined his clothes and by the best conjecture i could make supposed him to be a laboring man his breeches were leather but exceedingly greasy and neither strings nor buckles at the knees his waistcoat had been scarlet but it had but one flap and four buttons and his coat was originally what is called a thickset but out at the elbows his hat round but grown brown with age and his stockings blue worsted but full of darns they were however tolerably well mended and pretty clean i tried on the coat and waistcoat and found they fitted me well enough the reader will perhaps wonder at all this but when i tell him my design he will wonder no longer my plan was to rise before he waked and change clothes with him that i might get into the country in such disguise without fear of interruption as i was not much disposed for sleep i surveyed my room and found the furniture consisted of a broken chair or two a table with three legs an old stove in the fireplace with a shovel and poker chained to the chimney perhaps lest a lodger should be pleased to make free with them and lest we should carry away the blankets was the reason i presume of our being locked in bad as the bed was i laid me down upon it but could not get a wink of sleep therefore when i heard the watchman cry four my companion being still snoring i dressed myself in his clothes except his shoes and instead of four pence half penny and a little tobacco which i found in his pocket i left the poor devil half a crown and flattered myself he would not be unhappy at the change for though distressed at my own situation i could not but feel for his i next cut my hair short in the poll with a knife i had in my pocket and pulled it over my forehead and could i have seen myself i have no doubt but i should have started at my own figure when completely dressed i rung the bell and was let out the chamberlain turning the key upon the man i had left asleep the fellow said nothing to me nor i to him and i walked off as composed as if i had nothing to trouble me  it being rather a cold morning i walked hastily toward hydepark corner without any thing about me of value except my pistols my cane my buckles my ring my shirt and my pocket handkerchief and about three pounds in money i was presently overtaken by the exeter coach and got up into the basket  chap x it being very cold upon the road i found the want of a great coat much and at the inn where the coach breakfasted i got luckily equipped with one on my saying in the kitchen i felt the weather cold and would gladly give my shoe buckles which were silver and fashionable in exchange for a great coat a gentlemans servant by the fireside embraced the proposal said he had a good livery coat to dispose of blue with a white cape which he thought would fit me and if i liked it he would swap with me he fetched down the coat from above being a lodger in the house the bargain was immediately struck and he gave me the coat and his metal buckles in exchange for mine i put it on an instantly forgot my situation so much happiness does a little degree of comfort create the only thing i noticed worth remarking at this house was that some of the coach gentry had found fault with the tea and desired fresh might be brought but the girl put the fame into a fresh cannister and carried it in again at which they were pleased on my smiling at this she told me she often did so for travelers seldom knew good tea from bad or good wine from bad that they found fault frequently for the sake of finding fault and thought by calling about them to give themselves consequence that she had lived long enough in an inn to know their trim and always turned the tables upon them and if at any time they disliked the tea or the wine she carried in the same again in a fresh cannister or changed the other for a fresh bottle of the same wine and it was immediately praised with a this is something like why had not you brought us this before the ridiculousness of such conduct will be better displayed by the following anecdote to which i was a witness at a place of entertainment in the neighborhood of london three or four military gentlemen who affected to be judges of wine had called for a bottle of lisbon the first who tasted it said it was pricked and asked the opinion of the rest one who boasted in a superior knowledge of wines said let me taste it and having taken half a glass worked it about in his mouth and spit it out on the floor with a pricked zounds it is sour in short they all agreed it was dmned bad and not fit to be drank the waiter was called and asserting it to be lisbon and such as no gentleman had ever disliked he was ordered to send his master the waiter having told his master the complaint the master assured the gentlemen that it was good lisbon that he gave the best price for his wines and was sorry they disapproved of it zounds fellow says one do you suppose we have neither taste nor judgment taste it yourself the master tasted it  told the gentlemen he was sorry for the accident  it was a mistake of the waiter who had brought them old hock instead of lisbon but he would change it for them immediately they looked round upon each other with a ridiculous surprise at their own ignorance and replied  hock is it  well if it be hock you may leave it and were thus contented to pay seven shillings for what they would not give half a crown for before  but to pursue the thread of my story  at the end of the first days journey i quitted the coach and determined to travel on foot having loaded my pistols in order to secure the little money i had i the next day broke out of the high road to cross a part of the new forest in hampshire as undetermined as when i first set out which way to proceed and i had scarce walked a mile from the town where i lay but i was accosted by two men in tattered garments having clubbed sticks in their hands with which way are you going my boy my beard was of four days growth and i looked as rough and as uncouth as either of them i told them i was a stranger to the country and hardly knew which way i was going come then says one of them let us see what you are made of turn out your pockets on this i threw open my great coat and took one of my pistols in my hand and they started back not expecting i apprehend to find me armed harkee my friends says i presenting the pistol at them i am one of the desperate ones and have more need of protection than to be rifled i am flying from the world and if you can point out to me any haunt in this forest where i can be concealed for some time you will render yourselves of use to me and you may possibly find your account in it but if you act treacherously and attempt to deceive me i will by the l  d lodge the contents of these pistols within you will you be one of us say he who accosted me first what are you relied i we are returned he part of a company who dwell in this forest and lead a very easy undisturbed life  we are sworn friends to each other and live by marauding that is to say retorted i you are a gang of rascals but checking myself for the asperity of the term for there are rascals in every walk of life from the first minister of state to the beggar in st giless and to upbraid them with their conduct is but to wage war with mankind besides its the polite only and the witty that can bear raillery come said i my lads i dont mean to affront you you may be as great in your way as the best of men are in theirs you perhaps act but as the rest of the world that is do no right take no wrong keep what you get and get what you can plunder those only who have not heart to give live an independent life upon the fat of the land and kill your own mutton come lead on i will see your company  but we must know says one of them what likelihood there is of your continuing with us and that you will not betray us my poverty replied i is the best security for my not quitting an easy independent life and as i shall be but one among many if i prove treacherous pistol me agreed  said they give us your hand and dmn me says one of these fellows to the other if our ruler wont be glad to have him among us with that he pulled out of his pocket a small bottle of gin and asked me if i would have a sup i drank with them as a ratification of the covenant between us and then followed them they informed me that their company consisted of seventeen stout men between twenty years of age and fifty and that it was of many years standing that sometimes they have been more in number sometimes less as now and then one of them died and now and then would one of them fall into the hands of justice and they lost him that they were well known throughout the whole forest and were considered by the inhabiants as a necessary evil as for one lawless crime they committed they prevented many not putting the greatest confidence in these my new friends i made them rather walk before me telling them that as we became better acquainted i probably should not be so mistrustful they took what i said in good part and told me they thought we should reach their place of rendezvous by the hour of meeting which was eleven oclock they led me through many intricate and bypath and i observed that though we passed several foresters none took any more notice of us than merely looking back upon us after we had passed them one person we met indeed stopped and told us his henroost had been robbed the night before and asked the man whose name was nim whether he had heard any thing of it he assured him he had not for i found on conversing with them that they suffered no plunder in the place if they could help it but what they committed themselves as for ourselves says nim we act with generosity and never take but from those who can afford to lose i observed to them it would be happy for this country if all men could boast the same for it was the misfortune of the wretched ever to be the prey of the rapacious by gd nim says trig for that was the name of the other honorable scoundrel i had been pleased to take by the hand this seems to be a good fellow he must be our ruler next year and to this mark of their approbation i made a bow of acknowledgement they told me that one of the company was annually chosen ruler by a majority of the rest  as we traveled on they were very desirous of knowing my history and what led me to withdraw myself from the world such adventurous parts of my story as i thought would raise me in their opinion i made them acquainted with under a feigned name but every other circumstance i carefully concealed when i had ended my own story i begged to know theirs  nim told me he had been rider to a notorious smuggler in the county of sussex who amassed a considerable sum of money by leaguing with the customhouse officers for says he though these men are appointed by government to look after and guard the revenue they are the greatest villains in the world they betray their trust and serve themselves at the expense of the state  but herein returned i they do no more than other great men of the age are accustomed to  true continued he i dont at all blame them every man for himself and god for us all on my desiring to know some of the methods he pursued nim gave me the following account  smugglers fin it their interest to bring such articles into this country as bear a heavy duty tobaccostalks for example says he are a fine article of commerce in this way the first cost of a ton weight of these stalks at dunkirk is not more than about forty shillings and the duty being near fortyeight pounds they will sell to he spanish cutters in london who convert them into snuff for fifty pounds a ton here then is a fine profit if we can dispose of them for forty pounds admit the first cost and expenses amount to five pounds the smuggler gains thirtyfive pounds now this thirtyfive pounds enables him to bribe the customhouse officers in the neighborhood where they are landed they are made up in half hundred bags for the convenience of carriage by the coaches and machines and the officers will pass forty of these packages that is a ton weight for forty shillings  if the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time than one or two tons and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing he sometimes gets an officer to seize them and mark them with the broad r and if under this false seizure the goods reach the destined place unobserved the officer has so much percent if they are noticed in their way by any other officer not in the confederacy they are carried to the customhouse and the officer gives to the smuggling importer that moiety of their value that falls to his lot for seizing them  so that admitting a ton weight of such tobacco stalks at the customhouse sale shall fetch no more than forty pounds twenty of this is the property of the seizer and being by him transferred to the smuggler he gets twenty pounds for what cost him perhaps less than five was this discovered the officer would lose his place but what is his place thirtyfive or forty pounds a year which a man can earn at daylabour in competition with the sums they hazard such a place for it is the same with tea and other articles  brandy is smuggled in small tubs of four or five gallons each and tea in oilskin bags of fiftysix pounds weight per bag twenty thirty or forty of these tubs or bags are strung together by cords with stones fixed to them in order to sink them  thus prepared the smuggler runs this boat up into a creek or river and having noticed the place by land and other marks throws the goods overboard where they lie concealed from sight and ready to be grappled up again at a more convenient time  i have been at this word often and was thought as complete a smuggler as any in the country many a time have i left dunkirk in an open boat of three or four tons burden and been off the essex kent or sussex coasts in the middle of a dark night waiting for signals from the shore to give notice for landing but this has been when we chose to save the money to tidewaiters and customhouse officers  i followed this way of life a long time but being afterward outlawed i offered myself to the society to which i now belong who subsist in a great measure by warring against the smugglers and as i was thought acquainted with their practices and of course a good acquisition they accepted my services and i have been in the brotherhood these four years  on my inquiring what he meant by being rider to a smuggler he told me that a body of daring resolute men were appointed by the importers to transport the articles they landed from one town to another that they rode in troops from sixty to one hundred in number bidding defiance to all law and opposition that they conveyed their tea and brandy with them openly in the face of day each horse carrying his rider and three hundred pounds weight that for this hazardous enterprise they were paid one guinea a week each and seven shillings a day traveling expenses and that it was no wonder the revenue suffered so much as two millions of pounds annually when smuggling had arrived to such a pitch as that ships of force carrying twenty guns were employed to bring merchandise from flanders and such bodies of men were hired to covey it from place to place when on shore  as we were now so near the place of rendezvous trig had not time to let me into his history but promised it at a future opportunity a very short time brought us up with the company having traveled as i conceived about seven miles from the high road they seemed to be all met and such a set of banditti i had never seen assembled before they were seated on the ground in a ring within a glade in the thickest part of the forest and as a circular trench was dug out within this ring to let down their legs as they sat the ground before them served them for a table which was raised above the level of their seats by the earth thrown out of the trench before each man were placed his wallet and his weapons of defense among which i diseovered a carbine or two two or three pair of rusty pistols a few old cutlasses and each man had a bludgeon besides on my arrival at this place my companions introduced me to the ruler as one that wished to be of the company whose honor and attachment for these were their own words they could venture to answer for gentlemen says i addressing myself to the body you see here before you a man who though young in life has seen enough of the world to be sick of it and who will be happy to find a retreat among you i am a stranger to fear and equal to any thing consistent with prudence i presume you are governed by some laws of your own and you will find me a strict observer of them what the majority of this company dare propose i think i dare undertake and if conducted with spirit will almost answer for the event this speech seemed to meet with general applause and i took my seat at the board among the rest on enquiry i found they were a parcel of villains that deserved a halter and as i passed by a fictitious name and did not boast of greater virtue than the rest i was considered in no better light  as soon as i was seated the ruler who did not want for sense addressed me in the following terms you have been introduced here by our noble and worthy friends nim and trig and i trust you are not insensible of the dignity of a seat among us  whatever opinion you may entertain of this company i venture to assert that we are all honorable men  men above any abject meanness like the nobles and rulers of the land we live indeed by plunder but it is the plunder of the villain and such as are enemies to the community we belong to is it not just to take from the oppressor and make him refund the wages of peculation does not the state benefit by forfeits and escheats by sines and confiscations and if it be lawful to take from a villain his property in any case it is equally lawful to do it in all cases for necessity cannot justify a bad act the lower a scoundrel is kept the less power he has of doing harm if therefore we confine our plunder and depredations to the griping the usurious and the lawless far from acting wrong we are doing what is right we live here my friend secluded from a wicked world happy in a well regulated society protectors of the distressed and a terror only to the man of rapacity and the smuggler if we now and then break in upon the equitable doctrine of mine and thine it arises only from an error in judgment of false information as it frequently happens at the boards of custom and excise where they too frequently authorize oppression upon fimilar pleas of excuse often has a customhouse officer seized a mans property that has paid the legal duties merely because the time of the permit by which he is allowed to remove it has expired a few hours and what is this better than robbing on the highway at the worst we act but in conformity with the rest of the world where the longest arm ever puts in a claim for the largest share it is the custom of state rulers to enrich themselves at the expense of the community and to stick at nothing that will add either to their pleasure or convenience but i disclaim such conduct i enjoy no privilegus but in commonwith the rest except that of leading them on occasionally in desperate adventures and as to exclusive benefits i have none nor do i wish for any the plunder i acquire is ever shared among the company more happy in having acquired it than in any division that may fall to my share  in short my friend whilst you think proper to continue with us you will partake equally in every thing we possess and if you now and then get some hard blows you will have the statisfaction of suffering in a noble cause  such was our superiors introductory address to me and it was not without its influence  i am almost ashamed to own it but i continued in this society near two years and gave such universal satisfaction that in three months after my joining it i was unanimously chosen their ruler and i persuade myself from some falutary regulations i proposed and carried that i placed the company on a more respectable footing than it had ever been before we acted sometimes in a body and sometimes by detachments and so scoured the whole forest as to keep it tolerably honest we were at constant war with the smugglers robbed them whenever we had an opportunity and in so doing became useful members to the state it was a rule of mine and which i believe was invariably attended to never to commit any depredations but on suspected people on the griping and avaritious and such persons as studied to be troublesome to us if we had notice of any robbery committed within the forest we never rested till we had ferreted the villain out or given him into the hands of justice so that we had often presents for such services and if we were at any time charged with picking up a bag of tea an anchor of brandy a straggling sheep or a wild turkey that might have been the property of a smuggler a griping farmer or the like it was generally winked at and thought no more than what they deserved to lose a present from any of the inhabitants of a toothless sheep an old sow a keg of gin or beer or a cast suit of clothes was sure to be rewarded with protection for some months afterward so that in fact we had the whole forest under contribution we lived almost in the open air we had indeed two or three mud cabins in one part of the forest but in the summer we stepped chiefly under hay stacks dry banks cartlodges and such other shelter and in winter the farmers upon asking leave would through fear suffer us to sleep a night or two in their empty outhouses or barns and very often give us refreshment in the morning before i joined the party i believe they would occasionally take a purse upon a byeroad witness the attempt that was made upon me and would sometimes stretch to other enormities but there was no money collected during my time except perhaps in the way of deceit such as feigning distress and exciting the compassion of traveling strangers nor do i believe that any of the party proceeded to lengths that would have amounted to more than a petty larceny  chap xi our captain or ruler being the cleverst and best informed fellow of the whole gang and having a genteel carriage i was desirous of knowing his history and one day when the party was upon the scout and we two left alone at my request he gave me the following account of himself  who my mother was i cannot say but the person who called himself my father was a sheriffs officer who got pretty snugly into life by plundering the wretched and preying upon the oppressed when i was at an age to remember any thing concerning him he had a woman lived with him who passed for my motherinlaw but it is a doubt with me whether every they were married however be that as it may they lived together as man and wife the common public room of our house was a miserable dungeon under ground calculated to convey an idea of horror that men who had lived tolerably in the world and who on an action for debt were unfortunate enough to fall into his hands might loath the very sight of the place and be glad to give him five shillings a week to be admitted into a better room we had one upstairs that would contain twenty perssons and it was generally full at five shillings a head this with half a guinea a week for half a bed and two shillings and sixpence a day from each for a wretched breakfast and a worse dinner put a considerable deal of money into my fathers pocket but this was not the only mode he had of gaining money sheriffs officers give security always for their trust so that if they serve a writ and let the prisoner go at large after he is once arrested they are liable to pay the debt it is on this account they will make fifty excuses rather than serve a writ in the presence of the attorney or the plaintiff but when there is no prying eye upon their conduct they will often on receiving a present of a guinea or two suffer their prisoners to go and look for their bail themselves and should they when at liberty not keep their word and attend the officer at the time appointed he will tell the paintiff or his attorney that he never was able to meet with the defendant in this school the receptacle of a variety of wretchedness was i brought up till i was nineteen years old and if i was born with any natural feelings they were here quite eradicated i was taught to load an unhappy wretch with additional misery and rob him of every little degree of comfort he might possess in order to make him pine for relief which relief was never afforded but at an exorbitant price we had a license for selling wine but that wine was so poor and so sour that it required something stronger always to qualify it and if a prisoner wished to send out for brandy or strong beer we always exacted as much for fetching it as the liquor was worth i should have continued with my father he designing me to be one of his followers but my motherinlaw led me such a weary life that one day when my father was out i opened his bureau made free with about twenty pounds of his illgotten wealth and decamped and of course never durst see his face again  i had sense enough with these twenty pounds to equip myself with necessary clothes and by an application to a registeroffice got me a place a character for which cost me no less than a guinea as a sheriffs officer has always bail at hand to give security to an action at a price proportionable to the debt the prisoner is arrested for so these keepers of registeroffices have always a housekeeper or two ready to give a character to those who want one and are enabled to purchase it the price of a written character is a crown that of a verbal one by one of these friends a guinea it was a guinea however well laid out and i did not grudge it it procured me a place at a teadealers in bondstreet to open and shut up shop carray out parcels and do other things my master from dealing with women of fashion had acquired a smoothness of tongue sufficient to deceive the devil and he found it of great use to him if any woman came to his shop in a coach or on foot with a servant behind her whether titled or not she was always a lady and during her stay the word ladyship was seldom out of his mouth he would stand all day dressed at his shop door when he had no customers within and bow to every carriage that passed and whilst he was at dinner he expected me to be dressed and to bow for him why didnt you bow to that coach said he to me one day warmly i told him it was empty  what is that to the purpose you blockhead returns he always bow to a coronet full or empty and he profited by this plan for he had a world of business and was supposed to be a monied man i was in the shop one day when a lady accustomed to drink twenty shilling tea came in and asked to see some of his best hyson he showed her a cannister at eighteen shillings a pound she took it to the light smelt it tasted it rubbed it in the palm of her hand smelt it again and enquired if he had no better he assured her ladyship there was no better to be bounght and perhaps he spoke the truth for all teadealers mix their teas as wine merchants adulterate their wine and spirits they make hyson of all prices from ten shillings to eighteen by mixing it with what is called bloom or common green then again they dye it and scent it a few drops of bergamot etc thrown into a pound of souchong is sold for cowslip or a tea of a superior nature and as i generally had a hand in these adulterations i can take upon me to say i believe the tea my master showed this lady was as genuine as any she could have met with but it would not do better says she mr congo is certainly to be bought for i drink better every day though it is true i give more money for it if you have no better i am sorry for the trouble i have given you on her leaving the shop he replied if your ladyship does not object to price i have a peculiar kind at thirtysix shillings a pound which i defy the whole town to equal thirtysix shillings exclaimed she returning i never heard of such a price  it must be a curiosity  pray let me see it he then reached down another cannister of the same tea and she examining it with some attention cries this to be sure is considerably better but the price amazes me  why did not you show me this at first weigh me out two pounds and if i like it i will send for more thus did this fanciful woman pay thirtysix shillings a pound for tea which she might have had for eighteen but it is the way with these ladies not knowing the value or price of commodities they are taken in by almost every tradesman they deal with so that with all the parade of prying looking over examining enquiring cheapening and so on they will give fifty per cent more than other people knowing nothing beyond the line of life they are in they rate the goodness of every thing by its price and conceive a lowpriced article to be naught but trash goods within their knowledge they will go far afoot to purchase city traders unused to deal with such persons will not often take advantage of their ignorance they will not ask fifteen shillings for a purse at a coach door which they will sell for half the money to a customer on foot there are some ladies shrewd enough to know this and yet these instead of going in their own carriage will pay four shillings for a hackney coach to save twopence a yard on a dozen yards of ribband in a word they owe all this to their pride their vanity and parade they will go a shopping as they call it morning after morning tumble over a great variety of goods give a great deal of trouble and not buy and often when they do buy they will not pay for years were persons of fortune to act consistently they would soon find their account in it but whilst they go on as they do they must not be surprised at any thing they meet with  i told the captain that i had not only heard that winemerchants adulterated their wines but absolutely made them  there is not the least doubt of it returns he three fourths of the white wine drank in this kingdom are compositions put together here and made palatable by a liquor they call flavor and as to port what is generally drank is a mixture of maltspirits red wine and turnipjuice for the benefit of economical readers the following are the proportions fortyeight gallons of liquor pressed from turnips eight gallons of malt spirits and eight gallons of good port wine colored with cochineal and roughened with elder tops it should stand two years in casks and one in bottles if rough cider is substituted for turnipjuice and coniacbrandy for malt spirits the wine will be the better   for the whole kingdom of portugal could not furnish half the quantity here consumed but to return says he to my story  i should have continued with mr congo longer but i happened one day to let the cat out of the bag by telling my master inadvertently before the exciseman who happened to be in the shop that a bag of tea which he had stowed away in the cellar was burst and a good deal of the tea shed for there is not a teadealer in town or country but what smuggles more or less they are to conceal no exciseable goods from the inspection of the exciseman and this idle expression of mine not only cost him a silencing fee of twenty guineas to steer clear of the exchequer but it lost me my place  i applied again to a registeroffice and was next in the service of mr porcelain a chinaman in st jamess street this master like my last had little to do but with women of fashion and gave me an opportunity of seeing a little more of their folly he had originally been a welsh drover was a man of low cunning and where he picked up his knowledge in china i know not but he was reckoned a connoisseur and became the standard of taste in this branch of trade possessed of the most beautiful and valuable collection in town his shop was the morning saunter of thoseladies whose fancy took that turn his mode of keeping up this collection was by culling the china closets of women of quality in a very artful and designing way his plan was to find out what ladies had the best collection and whenever they came to his shop he gave them to understand that he took china in exchange and possibly they might have a few odd articles of little value to them but which when assorted with other pieces which he might find amongst his lumber might be worth something this generally procured him access to the closet besides there are few collectors of china but like collectors of natural curiosities are fond of displaying their collections before those who are esteemed virtuosos  he was one day in lady betty softs closet when a pair of old vases of uncommon beauty struck him but he was silent she showed him every thing in turn and asked his opinion of it he did not fail to praise most things of little value and depreciate many of intrinsic worth but declared he had not seen upon the whole a more valuable collection any where and that her ladyship showed herself a woman of uncommon taste there was nothing he said throughout the closet that arraigned that taste but those vulgar vases in the corner which he would advise her ladyship to put upon the mantlepiece in her nursery nursery says she mr porcelain they will soon be of no value there and they cost me a great deal of money then your ladyship was imposed on returned he you had better take them then replied lady betty with these odd articles we have picked out they were of little worth he said by themselves but along with other things he would allow her ladyship something for them he accordingly took them away with him and was no sooner gone than her ladyships maid was rung for and made acquainted with the business of the morning porcelain the chinaman says she has been here and those vases which you and others have so much admired i find are trumpery things who told your ladyship so replies the maid porcelain himself returns she he declared they were the most paltry things in nature and a disgrace to my closet and he has taken them away taken them away exclaims bridget sure my lady you would not suffer yourself to be cheated in that style he has undervalued them merely to get them into his own clutches and will sell them as great rarities  aye says lady betty then send thomas after him immediately and let him bring them back thomas was instantly dispatched but porcelain on his reaching home ordered me to carry them up to the top of the house and on being told the mans errand cried out how very unfortunate i had no sooner brought them and set them down upon my counter but a gentleman who came in at that instand asked the price of that ordinary pair of vases and i have sold them to him for a song run will says he to me down that street you may possibly overtake him  in a scarlet goldlaced waistcoat  he has not been out of the shop five minutes i set off as he ordered me  but the vases were irrecoverable and three months afterward with some additional painted ornaments to disguise them they added to his stock of china and were rated as antiques  on my smiling at the idea of his painting it afresh he told me it was a practice with him he had been known to sell a whole service of white china painted and varnished over for that which is burnt in and when a dinner has been served up in it the steam of the dishes has obliterated the painting and all the figures have vanished he used to survey his customers from head to foot and ask a price according to their appearance what shall i give you says a lady one day to him for that set of dresden china it was chelsea but as she took it for dresden he asked a dresden price twenty guineas and it was purchased in a few weeks afterward her friends infomed her it was chelsea she accordingly flew to him and wondered how he could presume to sell her that set of chelsea china for dresden i never sold it for dresden returns he your ladyship asked me what i would have for that set of dresden china i thought you had been a judge of china by your buying it up so had it been dresden it should not have gone for forty pieces but if your ladyship dislikes it you are welcome to change it for any thing else disappointed she looked round and fixed upon a couple of jars worth about ten pounds which he valued at thirty but to make her ladyship amends he would only take of her five guineas besides the breakfast set the bargain was struck the jars put into the coach and her ladyship no sooner from the door than he turned round to me hugging himself in his adroitness with a by gd one of the jars is cracked  this puts me in mind of a story i have some where met with a caneseller in london sold a gentleman a cane for five guineas and to a second the same kind of cane for ten telling him it was a unique and there was not such another in the kingdom these two happiening to meet and the last upon an examination of the two canes conceiving himself imposed on went to the person of whom he bought it and rated him upon the subject but he had sufficient address to reconcile his customer to the purchase who implicitly believed what the seller told him it is a great misfortune sir says he that you are unacquainted with the great value of that cane i have been looking out for you every day expecting you would have called to have thanked me for letting you into so good a purchase on such easy terms i have examined the two canes replied the gentleman and see no difference difference exclaimed the seller  all the difference in the world  the one i sold for five guineas is merely jam be whereas yours is a jam beau  such a man was my second master and you may suppose that under the roof of two such artful instructors i must certainly have improved i learned a good deal before i left home but acquired a further degree of knowledge under mr congo and mr porcelain i fell in so much with my masters natural disposition that he began to like me but an accident here also deprived me of my place our shop was seldom kept open after five oclock so that i had a good deal of time upon my hands  some of my evenings i used to spend at a spouting club in the neighborhood where though a very bad speaker i got such a rage for declamation that i was always repeating some passages or other whenever i had opportunity when i spent my evenings at home i used to entertain the maids with my theatrical abilities one of these susan a simple country wench was mightily taken with my speeches i have ranted away hotspur till she has with her mouth open been as stiff and as motionless as a statue but one evening when i was in spirits i gave them a few passages out of alexander the great and i had worked myself up to such a pitch in the scene with clytus that when i was to kill him in a paroxism of rage i kicked down the table forgetting that my master was overhead this made such a clatter that the bell was rung and susan went up scarce recovered from that frigidity of horror my murderous tongue at first had thrown her into what is all that d  mned racked below says my master  nothing sir says she but alexander has just killed clyphus if he goes on in this way returns my master i shall have him in one of his fits dealing death among the china and do me twenty pounds worth of mischief  upon this i was discharged  i gave him to understand that i was quite entertained with his manner of telling his story as it fell in with my notions that of making remarks on life as i passed along and begged him to proceed  he replied from what he could learn from his acquaintance who were in the service of others that tradesmen show their worst goods and oldest patterns first particularly silkmercers linen and woollendrapers haberdashers and the like that they have particular lights in their shops to give them a false appearance that they pretend to examine the goods narrowly to make the buyer suppose they would not deceive him ask more than the thing is worth to allow for abating crib a little in the quantity or measure and then reach their scales to weight the money they receive in short that there is not a trade or profession but what has its mysteries and arts of defrauding that men open their shops set out their goods every morning to impose upon their customers and cheerfully shut them up again at night after having cheated all the day like the woman who after talking all the scandal she can wipes her mouth and says she has done no harm  since then continued he as whatever is is right and these men with whom i had lived were doing so well in the world by a little artifice and finesse i was unhappy i could not strike out into some way of life myself that would raise me above the situation of a servant however thought i as there is a tide in the fortune of all men i will wait with patience something may turn up unexpectedly  chap xii i presently continued he got another place which was to wait upon a young gentleman who lived upon an allowance from his father the old man was a widower had been very low bred but was fortunately in the possession of a good estate which he squandered away in a very extraordinary manner he was immoderately fond of farming and fancied he had a talent which few men possessed that of improving land to the highest degree of luxuriancy he was of opinion that of all men he who made two blades of grass grow where only one grew before was the most useful in society under this idea he took farms in most parts of the kingdom though he had not sufficient to stock them he neither ploughed nor sowed but laid down all the land he could in grass and what he could not lay down properly he suffered nature to lay down for him with scutch grass thistles and docks though he was a sensible and shrewd man in other respects he was a madman in farming and would almost deprive himself of necessaries to lay it out upon land which yielded him little or no return the finest crops of grass and clover he has suffered to rot on the ground under a notion of feeding the land nay he has been known to sow his grass lands with carrot and turnip seed and on being asked his reason for it replied grass land could not be too full of seeds he has filled a barn with potatoes washed and piled away at a great expense and suffered them to stand there and grow through the thatch i mention all this to convince you there could be no harm in robbing such a man for the sake of his son whom he had brought up a gentleman and whom whilst possessing a large fortune he would scarce allow sufficient to exist on i really pitied my young master who was an only child from my heart and used to plead his cause with the old gentleman often but could seldom extort any thing from him however one day when i had been about a year in the family i contrived to get a little of his cash he had just received a debt of four hundred pounds and was coming into the room where i and my master were  i gave my master the wink and he left us and the old gentleman having the bag in his hand shut to the door but did not see that i was in the room this is a strange age we live in said he to himself i know not what to make of it never was there a greater fondness for money nor so much difficulty in getting ones own debts nowadays are like children begot with pleasure but brought forth with pain however i have no need to complain having just received four hundred pounds that has been owing to me two years and it will go a great way toward stocking littlecot farm  so mr rascal continues he seeing me and hurrying the bag into his coatpocket  rascal sir returns i i am sure i dont deserve that name yes rascal says he you are the ruin of my son you may tell him i am very angry with him with my master sir replies i indeed you are not the only one who complains of him his conduct is grown so abominable of late that it drives me beyond all patience indeed says the old man why i thought you and he were perfectly agreed me sir returns i affecting unhappiness at his sons conduct far from it i preach to him too much for that i am sure i am always putting him in mind of the duty he owes to you and to himself why we are every moment at daggers drawing  he cannot bear i should tell him how ill he behaves to you and do you quarrel with him for this says he that i do and pretty handsomely too returned i i have been under a great mistake then says he for i always understood that you encouraged him in his extravagance and disobedience ah sir exclaimed i see how innocence is often slandered and oppressed sir if i may be believed was you to pay me for being his governor i could not say more to him than i do to make him behave more soberly and discreetly sir says i to him very often in the name of goodness dont be carried away thus with every wind that blows observe a more prudent carriage and consider the worthy gentleman your father who is depriving himself of necessaries to save and get money for you the old man seemed to chuckle at this and coming up to me i made an attempt to pick his pocket of the bag but not succeeding i went on  and no longer break his poor heart with your behavior but take up and live as he does with reputation and honor here i made another attempt and succeeded why that was well said replied the old gentleman and what answer does he make answer says i a pack of stuff that almost makes me mad not but to say the truth he retains in his heart the seeds of honor and virtue you have there sown but alas his reason has no longer any power over him however sir i hope i shall be able to bring him over at last do so my good lad returns the old man altering his voice to a softer tone than when he called me rascal do and you will find me your friend  when you see him next  be sure you say as many fine things of me as you can let me alone sir says i for that i will do the business never fear at this he was going to quit the room but returned as recollecting himself with lord lord how forgetful i am i protest i was going away without so much as thanking you for your good services stay  i will give thee something to remember me and began to feel for his bag frighted out of my wits lest he should miss it i caught hold of his hand with not a farthing sir he on the contrary seeming determined to gratify men cried out i insist upon it but i would not quit my hold and declared he should not saying i was not one of those selfish persons who act only from interest i know that says he but still  carrying his hand toward his pocket but as i had not quitted him i pulled it rather forcibly the other way and addressed him warmly with i must desire sir you will desist i am a man of honor and any farther offers of this nature will affront me at this he gave it up but suppose says he you was to carry my son a little present perhaps that may lead him to think you his friend by no means sir returned i still frightened lest he should miss his bag keep your money it will look too much like a bribe  if i see occasion i can but ask you well then says he be it so  but be sure ply him well and leave no stone unturned to bring him over and i shall ever value you at this he left the room and me almost out of breath for fear as soon as he was gone i took fifty guineas out of the bag for myself for i think i deserved it and carried the rest to my young master telling him how i got it he seemed very thankful and gave me ten pieces for my cleverness for said he he was sure it was no sin to take it from him as it would otherwise have been thrown away upon a barren soil  a few hours after whilst my young master and i were together the old gentleman joined us and seemed to be in a very surly mood what are you two laying your heads together about  no good i warrant you and i hope no harm sir says his son that is more returns he than i know i am sorry says i to see you so much out of humor sir peace rascal cries he or i will lay my cane over you  sorrows but poor comfort to a man that is lost his purse have you really lost it says my young master yes blockhead returns his father i have really lost it  have you found it i wish i had says the son the devil doubts you returns the father if you had i should never see it again had it fallen into my masters hands says i i will be answerable it would have been returned untouched yes yes replies he rogues are always ready to answer for one another i wish you would answer for yourself it was whilst i was listening to you scoundrel or soon after that i lost it it was picked out of my coatpocket or i must have pulled it out with my handkerchief pulled it out with your handkerchief most likely sir returned i what kind of purse was it that i suppose says he you would be glad to know no no i have no other mark to claim it by on my telling him it might fall in my way to recover it for him if he would describe it to me he seemed to listen to me and desired his son to leave us together as soon as he was gone he began to address me in softer terms and said his bastards extravagant course of life often put him out of humor and led him to say things he did not wish to say upon the whole says he my good fellow i have secretly considered you as a faithful honest lad and would a few hours ago have given you a small testimony of my good opinion but your confounded scruples would not suffer me i beg i may do it now at this he gave me a couple of guineas and if you can says he by any means recover my money for me i will be a friend to you as long as i live you are sensible sir replied i if it is possible to be recovered it cannot be done without great trouble and some expense what reward are you willing to give the finder hah reward says he starting at the very idea  suppose you offer a few guineas  you may go as far as five  i asked him what was the sum he lost four hundred pounds says he and can you think cried i of offering so small a reward that would undo us quite the meanness of the offer would prevent its being returned in order to punish you  five indeed in hand as a part of fifty more if returned  nothing like generosity in these cases was it not a canvas bag at the word canvas he seemed transported i thought he would have kissed me yes a canvas bag i see my dear fellow says he you do know something of it i told him that i did hear such a bag was found by a poorish man but little imagined it was his so probably if this man could be found what with persuasions threats promises and good words it might be recovered nothing more likely says he  do then my good lad set about it immediately for no time should be lost  but sir returned i the search of this man will be attended with some expense and you know sir i am not in a situation to give you credit upon which he gave me three guineas three guineas exclaimed i what is three guineas i cannot think of looking mean in this affair purely for your sake this drew from him two pieces more then sir there is drinkmoney that got another guinea  messengers to one place  this a guinea more  dispatches to another  bribes to one  hushmoney to another gods death says the old man who gave me more and more for every purpose i will give no more unless its brought me but sir says i you forget the five pieces as a reward in hand zounds says he at this rate you will pick my pocket of every guinea i have  well having got about twenty guineas from him i promised him to do my best but on my leaving him he directed me to count the money and see the gold was all weight and that none of it was changed  i asked him if he returned the bag of money not a shilling says he the fifty i took i had too many uses for and the remainder which i gave my young master i believe did not continue with him long enough even to know how much he had he never counted his money he judged of the quantity only by the time if lasted  chap xiii with this fifty pounds i determined to set up for myself accordingly i quitted my place and hearing of an orphan young lady of seventeen years of age who was heiress to a fortune of six thousand a year one thousand of which she enjoyed durher minority and who lived with an aunt at the west end of the town i determined to make a bold push and try if i could not carry her with this view i equipped myself with a suit or two of genteel clothes and passed for a gentleman having found out the house where she lived i frequently walked under the window with the hopes of seeing her and at last i saw one whom i took to be her and she was as pretty as she was rich my next step was if possible to get access to her for this purpose i went to a publichouse in the neighborhood addressed myself to a chairman i there found and made many enquiries respecting the family particularly where they visited and where they resided in the country all this i learnt this done i contrived to get to the ear of some of the servants which i likewise effected the chairman to whom i first applied told me that the footman and coachman used that house and were generally there in an evening between teatime and supper at this hour i went and was introduced to them i took the footman apart gave him to understand i was a gentleman and a man of family and fortune that accident had thrown me into the way of his young mistress and i wished to be better acquainted with her and if he would assist me in so doing i would endeavor to be his friend and as an earnest of that friendship i tipped him half a guinea he promised me all the assistance in his power and told me that both she and her aunt were to be at the play the next day having a couple of box tickets for a benefit this intelligence was every thing i could wish i was at the theater the same night procured admission into the same box and had the happiness to be particularly noticed by her for i set close by her side when the play was over i handed her to her carriage and politely took my leave the day following i found out the footman again and made enquiries respecting the ladys maid he assured me she was an openhearted girl and did not doubt but she would favor my views i wished very much to see her and he promised to ask her to give me a meeting an opportunity soon occurred for that purpose the footman brought me word the next day that his young mistress and her aunt went out an airing every morning about twelve and that if i would go to the house in their absence he had made their porter acquainted with my wishes and he would let misss maid know when i was there i took the first opportunity of going and saw the coach drive from the door a teteatete soon took place between me and the maid whom i made also my friend by a present of five guineas she promised to plead my cause with her young mistress and did it effectually an interview was appointed and i was to meet her in kensington gardens on the day fixed she promised to be there with her maid who on my coming up retired i had now an opportunity of pressing my suit and i did it with as much warmth as if i had been really in love i told her a thousand lies so passionately that the poor little credulous thing believed them all and at parting promised to meet me again the first opportunity the ice being now broken through the means of this servant we carried on a correspondence for near a month when i was given to understand that the family was retiring to their seat in hampshire  this business was expensive but thinking myself sure of my prize i obtained goods upon credit and pawned them as soon as delivered by this means i was enabled to keep up appearances i followed miss into the country where under a pretense of taking a walk i had frequent opportunities of being with her unnoticed by her aunt the servants i took care to keep in my interest she agreed at last to give me her hand and it was proposed that we should set off for scotland and that her maid should accompany us having thus brought things to a crisis and finding she was possessed of some very valuable diamonds i advised her by all means to take those with her as she could not think of returning home and it was impossible to make a proper appearance without them she acquiesced with this proposal and the day was fixed for her elopement but as the devil would have it and accident happened that overthrew all i had been about  there being at the house i was at an evening club where the neighbors used to meet smoke their pipes and fettle the affairs of administration having been admitted among them i passed my time rather agreeably than otherwise one of the party was an elderly tradesman lately married to a smart young woman whom i had once or twice seen and was much taken with but he was so much under petticoat government that she used to fetch him home at night at a regular hour he had been often rallied on this head and was so greatly ashamed of it that under a promise not to stay longer than eleven she agreed to go to bed before him like other babblers who often lay open their own affairs unasked and frequently to their prejudice he gave us to understand she was too jealous to suffer the maid to fit up for him and that as the door would not unlock on the outside it was left upon the latch on being asked whether she left a light a light says he no  our house is not so large but i can find my way up into my room without a light we lay but on the one pair of stairs over the shop i was determined he should one day pay dear for this communication and concerted it with the rest of the company to keep him from home beyond his usual hour to see whether his wife would come the next night to fetch him accordingly in the course of conversation talking of the uxoriousness of husbands i put my gentleman upon the metal and offered to lay him a bet of two guineas that he durst not stay out that night till half after twelve from an opinion that his wife would be asleep and not know the hour of his return he took the bet and when the clock struck eleven was exceeding good company about twenty minutes after i took a french leave went over to his house lifted the latch and without much difficulty found my way into the chamber over the shop all was quiet and the fair one asleep having undressed myself at the stair head without the door i stole into the room and the reader may suppose i was not long before i was between the sheets i had but little time and was determined to make the best use of it she soon waked and spoke to me but found me not disposed to answer however whether she was able in the dark to distinguish between her husband and me or any way discovered the cheat i know not but this i know she was as kind to me as i could wish  when i found her composed i began to retire but she soon missed me from the bed and hearing me fumbling at the door and i not answering her when she spoke suspecting i suppose some trick had been played her she rose with great anger seized me by the arm before i could get away alarmed the house and i was unfortunately discovered i was however suffered to dress myself and return to my quarters  this affair made a great noise in the village and presently reached the mansion the young lady i was to accompany to scotland took offense at my conduct and i could never get to see her again other reasons might cooperate against me but i could not learn what they were i wrote one or two letters to her but all to no purpose the family presently left the country and i heard of her no more it was a fortunate event for her but a d  nd unlucky one for me  the injured husband determined to prosecute me for violating the honor of hs wife but the lawyers could not well advise him how to proceed some proposed indicting me capitally for burglary lifting a latch and entering a dwelling house by night if done with a felonious intent being a species of that crime but as the wife was consenting to the act it could not be felony of course not burglary the same argument prevented its being deemed a rape others were for indicting me for grand larcency or stealing privately from the person but what did i steal nothing but her consent this not being any thing that could in fact be carried away the idea of proceeding on that statute fell to the ground actions of trespass seduction etc were then proposed but the whole centered at last in a prosecution for crim con  but this being more than i could stand i thought it better to decamp and wishing as you did to hide myself for a while i made a proposal to this company to join them and they admitted me among them  in this savage state though i could boast of few indulgencies the life i led was orderly and free from embarrassments there was a strict discipline kept up among us and a dread of being impeached kept the unruly in awe for had an information been laid by any individual of the gang against his comrades the neighboring magistrates would never have noticed it whereas an impeachment by the whole gang of any individual would have been sufficient to have called out a warrant against him so much was our company considered as a necessary evil at our general meetings each of us by turns was the cook for the day till the last year of my time when we took in three young women among us one of whom by the general voice as ruler was to be sacred to me and the other two were in common among us all they all proved pregnant before i quitted the company and though i did not continue long enough to see how they got over the difficulty i understood they meant either to drop their bastards in some distant parish lay them at the doors of some gentlemens houses or swear them to persons that had been their common disturbers however as i doubted the fidelity of my lady i was not very uneasy about what became of her burden an event happened that determined me to quit the connection and when it took place i left my right in her to my successor  information had been given us that in a part of the forest concealed under ground a body of smugglers had stowed a considerable quantity of brandy and other things we found it out and the booty consisted of  00 anchors of brandy  00 half anchors of gin and    bags of tea containing  0 lb each this being lodged at a neighboring custom house it was condemned and solf and our part of the money amounted to   0 l which shared among eighteen was  0l a man thinking i should never meet with a better opportunity of equipping myself for a more respectable employ when in possession of the cash i took a french leave of my companions and never have heard any thing of them since  it was in the summer time when i quitted the forest and the first place i retired to was lymington where i staid long enough to get myself new dressed it is almost inconceivable to think how i labored to reconcile my past conduct with what is equitable and right i have often thought that it is with diffioulty that men who have been brought up religiously and with liberal notions fall away from an honest course of life i felt myself hurt at that i was just emerged from and endeavored to convince myself that i was not so bad as the world may suppose me from the account i have here given i began with reflecting that fear had driven me from one society and that like a hunted animal i took shelter in the first place that offered that i no sooner became a member of the company i have described but i labored to reclaim them and flatter myself that i in a great measure succeeded from villains of the first denomination i reduced them to scoundrels of the second made them rather serviceable to the community than otherwise and had they followed the example i pointed out by my own conduct they might have separated and become honest men i considered that unlike bad statesmen bad citizens of every class who are a scourge to all men we only were a scourge to the obnoxious and that if the necessities of a state can authorize and render eqitable the general plunder of our enemy both by sea and land we did no more though in a narrower scale we plundered only the enemies of the customs of the fair dealer and of society in a word if i acted wrong or an unequitable part in life i took the first opportunity to relinquish it and i wish every one could lay their hand upon their heart and say the same  i will finish this chapter with a striking anecdote on the subject a merchant of london was stopped on the highway by a man whom he soon discovered to have been once his servant instead of delivering his purse as he was ordered he began to reason with the robber good god thomas could i have supposed that you woudl have taken to this course of life you whom i always imagined strictly honest  come come sir replied the highwayman bad an i am i am as honest as you have not you employed your whole thoughts time and fortune in fitting and sending out privateers to plunder the french and other countries and what is this but robbing on the high way  as different says the merchant as light and day for we have declared war against the french if that be all the distinction retorts the robber i have declared war against all mankind  therefore give me your money or by god i will blow your brains out  the only difference between you and me said a pirate to alexander the great who upbraided him with piracy is that i commit hostilities with a single ships you with a whole fleet  chap xiv in this great length of time it may naturally be expected that i should have thought something of miss wildman and have been anxious to have known the determination of the jury respecting the death of the man i shot if i really had killed him but as in the course of the last chapter i was unwilling to interrupt my narrative i will tell the reader now that scarce a day passed but she was uppermost in my thoughts her ring had never been off my finger and i often kissed it with fervency with the pleasing remembrance of the donor and the animated huopes of calling her one day mine being out of the way of all information and never having seen a newspaper i was totally in the dark respecting the tranfaction that occasioned my flight in no publichouse could i find papers so far back and i was afraid to make any enquiry being now however in the world again i though proper to write to her to let her knwo i was alive the following is a copy of what i wrote  my dear miss wildman i am still in the land of the living in good health and in as good spiritis as so long an absence from you will admit of your ring that pledge of your constancy has never been off my finger of course you have never been out of my mind a fear of embarrassments in consequence of the event on the evening of the day i last saw you drove me from london and indeed has so far driven me from the world that i am totally ignorant of its result and of course it keeps me still at a distance from you i would be more particular in this letter was i sure it would fall into no other hands but yours but till i am convinced of this expect nothing from me but an assurance of the continuance of that affection i have so many times professed  the invincible and invariable attachment of your g  p s direct to a b c at the post house at salisbury  i want for nothing to miss wildman g wildmans esquire   berkleysquare london  i went over to southampton purposely to put this letter into the post and a fortnight after when i had reason to expect an answer i sent frequently to salisbury to enquire for any letter so addressed and was every time disappointed so that i concluded it must either have been intercepted or that she had proved unfaithful the last i was unwilling to suppose but till i had an opportunity of making some enquiries i gave up the idea of writing again  having dressed myself anew and my hair being grown to its usual length i called myself henry savage alluding to the life i had lately led and was ready again for any employ i could procure on my informing the tailor who made my clothes that i wished for a place he told me that dr bolus a physician at salisbury wanted a servant and that he thought i should suit him i accordingly with the taylors recommendation applied to this gentleman and was taken into his family as a footman this master of mine this son of esculapius had not been regularly bred as a physician but served his time as an apothecary in the north of england having however failed as a dispenser of drugs and finding an opening in this city by the death of dr killem who had practiced here thirty years he writes down to a friend at glasgow with a remittance of twenty guineas and a diploma for destroying mankind secundum artem was immediately dispatched by the stage coach with this faculty of poisoning his majestys liege subjects he sets up for a physician at salisbury and endeavored to acquire practice not by any medical abilities but by art and finessed all this i gathered before i had been with him a fortnight he was a little man about fifty years of age wore a pair of squaretoed shoes his stockings rolled over his knees a full trimmed coat with long skirts and a full bottomed wig that reached to his rump so different was he accoutred from the physicians of the present age that you would suppose him to have risen from the tombs in short he was no body for he was all wig and skirts and in fact such a piece of affectation that i wondered any one employed him but he had withal a great deal of worldly cunning and in a communicative mood one day told me physic was a farce and that it was astonishing the people were so taken in by it that nature always did best when left to herself and that a patient must be very ad indeed to be in danger of dying except when a physician is called in that there are but three or four principal medicines in the whole materia medica of any real efficacy and whose virtue almost every old woman is acquainted with that a good tongue is of more use to a man in this profession than all the learning of the hospitals that illness in general so affect the spirits that a sick person may be almost persuaded to any thing and that if a man knows but the art of concealing his ignorance he may pass for one of the first rate abilities often have i given in fevers says he too strong a cathartic potion for the constitution of my patient so as to excoriate his bowels and make him void blood and having afterward brought him round again by emollients he has attributed his cure to such supernatural avoidance when in fact it has gone near to kill him and from the same reasoning i often dread that when i treat a disorder right where it fails of success i may be censured for my conduct for as when i have acted wrong an ignorant patient has supposed it right i may be conceived to have proceeded ill when in fact i have done the best  what all the world says must be true is an old proverb and the general opinion of practitioners in physic concurring in this point is a corroboration of the fact the following circumstance did not a little strengthen me in this conceit having been sent to a neighboring apothecary for a medicine that had been ordered the master who had left his boy in the shop to make it up coming out of a back room and going behind the counter to see if it was finished flew in a violent passion and gave the boy a box on the ear with you young rascal i knew this would be the case then addressing himself to me i told the scoundrel to make up a vomit and he has made up a purge and on my observing that had the one been sent and administered instead of the other the consequences might have been fatal  he answered coolly oh no not so much for that  the woman it is for was to have been purged in the morning and whether she is purged to night and vomited tomorrow or vomited to night and purged tomorrow is very immaterial  i am only angry that the blockhead should not have followed my directions  the reader may wonder how i came to be so great a favorite as to be let into the secrets of this profession but he must know that my master had penetration enough to discern in a very little time that i had received a much better education than himself and that i might be of great use to him with this view he took me into his confidence and one day asked me if i thought i could compile him a treatise on nervous fevers i told him that my medical knowledge was but little but that if he would put into my hands two or three books upon the subject i was very sure that by twisting them and blending them together i could as apothecaries do their drugs make up a new composition so different from the original materials that it should neither have the color the taste or the consistency of either and yet should possess the inherent properties of them all  i did this for him he put his own name to it and published it and i have the vanity to think that he acquired no small degree of reputation from it  i wore a livery notwithstanding for as he could not afford to keep more than one man servant and as a livery was a necessary appendage to a physician i was obliged to wear that livery many a one of this profession has found it necessary to keep a chariot who could not afford a joint of meat at his table an equipage implies wealth wealth is the consequence of extensive practice and extensive practice must denote great medical knowledge therefore according to the rules of logic an equipage denotes great medical knowledge and is of course an essential appendage to the character of a physician  another artifice my master made use of to give him consequence in the town was to be a member of the evening clubs and my instructions were before he had been twenty minutes at any one of them to send for him out with such a lady is taken suddenly ill and he must make all the haste he can to be with her he would apologize to his company for leaving them explaining the necessity and from this club he would go to another where in twenty minutes more i would call him away with a similar tale and he would then go to a third and so on and as i took care to want him for some person of consequence it did him much credit in the opinion of his acquaintance and helped him on considerably in his practice many a time have i run into church panting for breath during the middle of service upon the same errand and brought him from his knees in his most fervent devotions  my master found it necessary also to play into the hands of the apothecaries they are always like the attorneys to the counselors very good friends to the physicians they have it in their power frequently to recommend whom they please and when they have brought a patient pretty near to deaths door they are willing to transfer the honor of killing him to a more able practioner they will then advise a physician to be called in and in this case generally recommend those who study most the interest of the apothecary it is on this account a physician prescribes freely and profusely and drenches the poor patient so immoderately as if he meant to wash away the evil spirit by a deluge of mixtures so again instead of ordering an emulsion for example in a pint bottle and two spoonfuls to be taken every three hours for which at most the apothecary can charge but two shillings the doctor orders the same quantity in draughts which will make eight and at one shilling each will pay the apothecary eight shillings instead of two  by these and such like means in a very few months he had more business then he could attend to and proposed to me to visit his poorer patients for which i should have half the fees it will readily be supposed that i accepted the offer and with the idea of studying under him and calling in his assistance if necessary i had a great deal of employ i learned his method of practice which was mostly to attend to nature and assist her where it could be done if a patient was inclined to sweat we sweated him if to purge we purged him if to vomit we vomited him and so on and if by increasing these evacuations too much we sometimes sent one out of the world yet upon the whole we saved a great many and for those whom we unfortunately lost we always found a friend on our side for there is seldom a person dies that is so illbeloved but there is some one belonging to him that rejoices at his death and is obliged to the physician for sending him out of a troublesome world besides it is a physicians best comfort that the dead cannot prosecute  i had a suit of clothes made up for the purpose which i occasionally put on at other times i appeared in livery but as my medical dress made a great alteration in my appearance the deception was never discovered especially as i took care to put on a formal voice with my formal dress  notwithstanding that thus i put a great deal of money in my pocket i must own i had now and then my moments of remorse i was hurling about me firebrands arrows and death and on my intimating my scruples one day to my master he rallied me out of them with the following reasoning physicians says he have been long held as useful members to society and if he who destroys but five men in a community does less injury to the state than he who destroys ten then he who destroys but five is the most praiseworthy of the two now as it is universally allowed that physicians do take away more lives than they save and we save more than we take away it follows that we are the better men and the more useful members of the state though this argument would have admitted of debate yet as few care to reason against their own interest i submitted to my masters superior judgment and continued my practice for a considerable time  i was always very particular as to the state of those patients i attended and if i could do not good i was as careful as i could be to do no harm though i knew little of pulses like other physicans i went through all the parade counted each stroke with attention and generally quitted the wrist with a significant nod of selfapprobation sick persons are generally frightened and seek for advice when advice is not necessary such i would amuse with a gilded pill made up of only common dough or a saline draught which if they did no good would do no harm they would at least leave the disorder to itself and give the patient a chance of recovery whereas others will by medicines throw back their patients in order to lengthen their attendance and increase their fees and i take merit to myself in this mode of practice and am bold to say was it more general there would be a great decrease in the burials of this kingdom  it is allowed by sensible and dispassionate men that the modern practice of physic is a farce  a far greater number are destroyed by it than saved i thought doctor you was out of town said a man to his physician by the decrease of deaths in the last weeks bills of mortality who enjoy a better state of health in general than the poor who cannot fee a physician or make it worth the apothecarys while to keep them long in hand and could a fair comparison be made between the number of poor and rich that annually pay the debt of nature it would certainly be found that length of life is three to one in favor of the poor notwithstanding the labor the hardships and the risks they are exposed to temperance is their physician and exercise their nurse and with an extra length of life they enjoy whilst they live a greater degree of health  however dr cadogans doctrine may be exploded i dare assert and i speak it from experience and observation that intemperance destroys more than the sword even in time of war i mean intemperance in eating rather than in drinking we arraign the conduct of those who drink to excess and perhaps because we see its ill effects whilst we take little or no notice of those who eat to a like excess whereas in fact the glutton is a more sordid wretch than the drunkard and though intemperance in eating is not attended with that outward unseemliness which accompanies excess of drinking yet the former incapacitates the man as much for business and devotion as the latter conviviality cheerfulness spirits cordial warmth may be excuses for drinking more than ordinary and if it intoxicates for a time it corrects many disorders brought on from accident inattention to diet and other things such as flatulencies crudities etc whereas immoderate eating is attended with inactivity heaviness stupor and lethargy not to mention the variety of disorders it gives birth to when we little expect it medical men frequently prescrible wine and cordials which is excess drinking asd restoratives but i believe no one ever thought of advising a patient to over eat himself in short gluttony is equally a sin with drunkness yet though there are more gluttons than drunkards we seldom heart of mans being censured for the former  feasting is now become a study and through the whole process we proceed methodically and with attention it having been found that when the spirits are up we generally eat most the stomach is surrounded with a plexus of nerves so that whatever affects the mind is presently communicated to the stomach i have known a piece of ill news brought at dinnertime entirely take away the appetite of the person it was brought to so on the other hand whatever tends to exhilerate the spirits adds to the appetice hence the introduction of music at feasts and the custom of eating in company provocatives that end to often in the destruction of the constitution  care is taken to keep the spirits up by company by wine by music and when by these stimulants we have almost eaten ourselves into a ferver coffee is introduced by way of sedative or quieter of the system soon after tea is brought forward and lest the tea should prey upon the nerves of the unstrung we have a rectifier for this maraschino or some other strong cordial is handed round and thus the ill effect of some things we eat is qualified or corrected by others but to resume my narrative  would men determine with themselves to be as cautious in eating as they are in drinking that is rise from table before they are to full their intellects would be clear their bodies active and they would enjoy much better health than they do were we to eat only half the quantity we are accustomed to in a few years remedies for the gout cachexy inflammation and the long train of disorders arsing from indigestion would be banished from our dispensaries and men would live longer by ten or fifteen years it is almost incredible to think how little will satisfy us lewis cornaro the spaniard lived one hundred and twenty years and for the last sixty years of his life an egg served him for three meals but he drank a pint of small wine every day this man from abftemiousness in eating was as active at ninety as the generality of men are at forty in short rise from table with an appetite never eat a thing that disagrees with you or causes heartburn drink moderately exercise freely rise early and go to bed early and you may give physic to the dogs  whilst i was in this town i fortunately met with a file of newspapers three or four years back and searching for the occurrences of the time when i had lived with mr wildman i discovered this paragraph the day before yesterday the following accident happened in berkley square some villains disguised as chairmen armed with deadly weapons having at the instance of a man of fashion waylaid a gentlemans valet with a view either of kindnapping him or putting him to death were fired at by the person they attempted to seize and one of them was killed on the spot the jury sat upon the body and bought in their verdict se desendendo or that the person was killed in the selfdefence the gentlemans porter was supposed to be a party concerned and was committed to tothilfields prison this gave me a satisfaction i knew not how to express it relieved me from any danger i might dread from the event and determined me to resume the name i had taken up on leaving my native place but as i was known in my great wig at salisbury by the name of dr savage i thought proper to go by that name whilst i there continued many an enquiry did i make at the post office in hopes of one day receiving an answer from miss wildman but all to no purpose and as i met with no one that knew any thing of the family i was still in a state of suspense  whilst i was in the service of dr bolus which was upwards of two years i became acquainted with the manager of a strolling company and from the account of the pleasant way of life they led and the encouragement i met with from this man to join them i was induced to try my abilities upon the stage and i was the more readily drawn into this attempt from an unwillingness to commit any more murder  indeed the following circumstance turned the laugh so much against me that i determined from that hour to quit the profession a gentleman in the neighborhood on having a ignorant servant throught proper to give him the following directions it is an unpleasant thing says he to be always directing every servant should anticipate his masters wants and not suffer him to call for things that he knows are necessary if he is to shave he should not only bring the razors and the basin but the towel the soap and all the etcaeteras if laying the cloth he should not forget the plates the knives the spoons and all the decoraments of the table if waiting at table he should know with what mustard is eaten with what oil with what vinegar pepper and so on and not suffer it to be asked for but hand it round in time in short in whatever he is employed he should always remember and prepare the consequences the servant listened with attention and promised to obey his orders this fellow had not been long in the house before his master was taken ill and he was sent to call me to attend him remembering the directions he had received he not only fetched me but also the apothecary the nurse the undertaker and the gravedigger and on his masters asking the reason of it replied the apothecary sir is the consequence of the physician at least such a physician as dr savage the nurse of the apothecary the undertaker of the nurse and the gravedigger is the natural consequence of the whole and as you enjoined me never to forget but prepare the consequences i have brought them all  this story got abroad very much to our disadvantage and as the profession i followed was a service of lying and deception i hated myself on account of it  the conduct of the college of physicians has as much hurt the credit of the profession as any thing in life because they are authorized by an act of parliament to discountenance any pretenders to physic and admit none to practice but such as have been regularly bred and of course are supposed able to pass a good examination they take the liberty to call upon all those who are not members of our two english universities to take out a license for the practice of physic the expense of this license is about eighty pounds and the qualification required is a sufficiency of medical knowledge ascertained by the candidates passing an examination no enquiry is made into the professional abilities of those who have taken a degree at oxford or cambridge though of all blockheads these places turn out the most in number but their enquiries seem directed against the students of the dutch and scotch seminaries as if leyden and edinburgh had not given birth to as many able men as oxford and cambridge the institution is a good one but may be abused the health of the people ought to be the principal object of the society and not their own interest but when it is known that the late dr rock of famous memory was a licentiate of the college of physicians it will be thought of little consequence from whom the application comes so that the eighty pounds are brought to discharge the fees it may be dr rock or dr last a shoemaker so called in one of footes farces a very learned friend of mine a physician whose medical abilities do honor to the profession but bred at leyden having been some time since called on by the college to take out a license on pain of being forbidden to act spurned the very idea of purchasing such a license and sent the college word that he was willing to submit to any examination they pleased to impose and the more rigorous it was the more agreeable it would be to him and that if they did not find upon enquiry that he had more medical knowledge than half the college put together then he would submit to their mandate not to practice but as to paying for their license which he was not ambitious to receive either eighty pounds or eighty pence he would do neither convinced that the legislature in investing them with that authority meant only to protect the health of the people and not fill the pockets of individuals this spirited declaration had its effect they dared not to call him forth to such an examination and i believe he stands alone a practicing physician in london unlicenced by the college  that they are a useless body of men combined i apprehend is universally allowed the following fact will bear me out in the assertion a gentleman who had the honor to be physician to the late king calling accidentally on a city friend and enquiring after the family was told the mistress of the house was just brought to bed of a dead child having but an indifferent opinion of menmidwives to which the family was partial he begged the father of the child to let him see the infant and from what he saw he was desirous of seeing the surgeon that laid her being convinced it had been destroyed in the birth the manmidwife was sent for and on being privately asked how he came to commit so horrid a deed his answer was he did at it the earnest request of the father this piece of intelligence the doctor communicated to a female friend a midwife who attended the royal family and who in hopes of checking such acts in future commissioned him to represent this story among others equally atrocious to the college of physicians and to offer the sum of one thousand pounds to that society in order to found a course of lectures on midwifery to be annually read to female practitioners provided they would patronise it but the college refused it and for this inattention to the lives and health of the public at large they were severely handled by the same physician in a pamphlet he soon after published entitled a petition of the unborn babes of england to the censors of the college of physicians  from all these circumstances so prejudical to the character of the medical profession and from the despicable opinion i entertained of it i was determined to withdraw myself from it to throw off my great wig and live in future by the inside of my head i did not however acquaint my master with my reasons but left him under a pretense of bettering my situation  chap xv the company i was to join was not the best equipped in the world the manager had met with misfortunes in removing from winchester to salisbury the wagon conveying his wardrobe scenery etc took fire from the dryness of the axletrees and destroyed his whole property property in stage language implies all the apparatus of the theater and since this disaster he had not been able to refit as before he has come over to salisbury for a piece of water a clound or two and a few odd things and was upon his return to winchester when he engaged me he would have had me have made my appearance in tragedy but as farce was my forte and as a player generally acquits himself best in a part to which he has been accustomed i determined to come out in the mock doctor and as the character i had played of dr savage had furnished me with a dress and his wardrobe was small he the more readily consented i soon made myself master of the part and wished only for an opporunity of showing him what i could do but the time was not come for though we had got to winchester which was to be our scene of action the company had not met  in the interim we had a great deal to do we had not only our theater to get ready and sundry matters belonging to it to prepare but we had an application to make to the mayor for leave to perform and as he was a strange kind of man our manager requested i would wait upon him for the purpose he was an oilman by trade as big round as one of his butts had been exceedingly low bred and was very proud of his office when i entered his shop he was serving a woman with a pennyworth of pickles and was wristdeep in the jar on my telling him i waited on him as mayor of the town  he put his dirty hand to my mouth with a hold friend not a word till i am in the justiceroom so saying having taken the money for his pickles and wiped his hand on a filthy apron he had before him he waddled into a back room and desired me to follow him when we were got into this place which was something like a counting house i began afresh i have taken the liberty sir  but he again interrupted me with why friend youre in a plaguey hurry  let me get into my great chair first  i begged his worships pardon submitted to etiquette and when he was fairly enthroned i told him my business that i was one of a company of players just arrived at winchester and that as i understood he was mayor of the corporation i waited on him to request his leave to perform harkee young man says he in a bellowing voice though we civil magistrates are mortal enemies to any thing that looks like an armed force i would rather dyesee see a parcel of soldiers come into the town than a parcel of playmen to pick our pockets and corrupt our wives and daughters  at the mention of these last words his wife who had been listening at the door bolted into the room and asked what business he was upon that occasioned him to mention her his worship immediately softened his tone and replied nothing my dear that concerns your it is only a parcel of playmen that want to play their rig in the town and i wont let em not let em mr girkin retorts she and what is the matter you will not let em if you want to be poplar you will let em and there is nothing like being poplar while one keeps shop but do you know my dear returns his worship what a world oharm these playervolks does a f  t of the harm says she what is that to us  it will keep families up late and we shall sell more candles and oil on that account why  aye to be sure replies the mayor the is something in that  what is the hour mr playerman you mean to show away  about half after six i told him and end about half after ten no says he that is too soon shops are scarce shut by that time make it seven and you shall have my consent for the business of the day must be over before i can suffer any maygames to take place i told his worship we would obey his directions and turning round to thank mrs girkin for her seasonable interference she gently slapped me on the shoulder wished us success and told me if we played alexander the great the first night she would certainly be there for she loved alexander to her life  he was such a proper man as i was going out at the door his worship bawled out  remember we sell oil and candles  having obtained permission to open our house our next business was to find one to open for since our managers misfortune a fresh company had taken possession of the town and though these were playing at southampton it was not clear that we could have the use of their theater on enquiry we found it as we expected and had another place to prepare this business delayed us some time but it gave me an opportunity of learning a part or two to begin with alexander the great exceeding the strength of our forces for when we mustered them on paper we could not make a greater number men women and children than fifteen it was settled therefore that the first piece got up should be othello or the moor of venice and that i should take the part of the moor having a tolerable good memory i became perfect in it sooner than i expected and our company dropped into town from different parts pretty nearly together but our principal heroine had not made her appearance yet our manager told me she belonged to a company in buckinghamshire and that he had some difficulty to engage her however he had happily succeeded and she would be his chief strength for she was a very pretty woman and a good player both in tragedy and comedy and had a very sweet pipe she was to be my desdemona  we soon procured a tolerable room and sufficiently large it had been a carpenters workshop and was quickly fitted up for our purpose as this lady sent us word that she could not join us till the week after we had proposed to open we determined to commence without her of course i had only to play in the afterpiece and had time to get up two or three more parts as i was a new performer it was proposed by our manager that on the nights i and this new woman performed the profits of the house should be divided into three parts of which each of us should have one this was a spur to my industry and i was desirous to get up as many characters as i could among the rest were romeo hamlet marplot archer benedict and bobadil  the entertainments given out for the first night were the journey to london and the mock doctor and though we designed to begin at seven in compliment to the mayor the house did not fill till near eight and such was our misfortune that we were obliged to study his worships interest more than we intended for we could not begin till the house was pretty nearly full and sufficient money was taken at the door to release our wardrobe from pawn this circumstance i was not made acquainted with till the house was opened however good luck stood our friend we took eleven pounds presently and that did the business the clothes were brought in and as our heads and legs were ready dressed we had only to slip on the remainder i was not in that predicament myself being dressed in the character of dr savage yet i felt for the embarrassment of my friend the manager and rejoiced with him at his delivery  the first night went off pretty well no accident happening but a piece of candle falling into the bushy part of sir franciss wig which set fire to it and miss jenny being almost pressed to death by count basset who was beat down flat upon her by the fall of a house owing to the carelessness of one of the sceneshifters the consequences however were no way fatal the fire in sir franciss wig was soon extinguished by my ladys wrapping up his head in her wet handkerchief for having a cold her nose had run profusely and miss jenny gave us to understand that there was no harm done to her for as she lay on her back the counts weight was not more than she could very well bear it created a laugh in the house and the audience departed in good humor  it may be expected i should say something of myself but modestry enjoins me to say no more than dr savage being only a mockdoctor i was equally at home both in one part and the other whether it was owing to me or the other performers i will not pretend to determine but the farce was so much liked that we played nothing else for six successive nights and the house was always full it held seventeen pounds and as the expenses were eleven the manager put six in his pocket but not considering me yet as part of his establishment out of these six he gave me one and as we performed three times a week i thought it a great deal of money  finding we were likely to succeed we enlarged our theater and made it hold twentyseven pounds and we added an additional fiddle to our band which before consisted only of two violins and a violincello for we had it in contemplation to perform comic operas two of our company indeed could not sing but we had a plan to make up the deficiency whenever they had a song to sing they were to stand pretty near the side scenes and a person without was to sing it for them we by a similar contrivance performed the beggars opera and the manager found me exceedingly useful as i could cut down a play to any number of characters now there being more characters in this piece than our small company could fill i cut out all the whores and rogues but two of each sort being persuaded that in these wicked and expensive times two rogues were enough to corrupt any man and two whores sufficient to ruin him  the week following our new heroine joined us and never was i more amazed in my life for who should this young lady be but miss biddy slashem the daughter of dr slashem of highgate where i was first received on my journey toward london it was on a saturday evening that she arrived an evening that we did not perform and the manager myself and two or three of the principals were regaling over a bowl of punch at a public house the manager was called out in order to introduce her and on her entering the room the instant she saw me she flew into my arms with rapture and the next moment as in a paroxism of rage she caught hold of my ears and shook me till i was obliged to bawl out for relief then again she almost smothered me with caresses and next burst into a flood of tears it is natural to conceive that this inequality of conduct this conflict of passions this mixture of love and anger must have been mysterious to all present but to me i was conscious i had not treated her well in omitting to correspond with her and that for reasons the reader will byandby know however she soon recovered herself apologized to the company for her behavior said i was the oldest acquaintance she had and that her transports in seeing me where she so little expected it had totally confused her  differences being adjusted and matters of ceremony settled our topics became general rolled upon the state of the company the success we had met with and our plan of operations in future and toward the close of the evening the manager conceiving as old acquaintance we might wish to be left together when the bowl was out he proposed retiring and left us to ourselves  we were no sooner alone but she burst into tears again upbraided me with my cruel conduct declared how much she loved me and said she had suffered greatly on my account i begged she would suspend her opinion of my conduct till she had heard my story which i would relate to her the first opportunity but that is was too long and too interesting to enter into at so late an hour in the evening i asked her if she was provided with a lodging she replied she was and hoped i would breakfast with her in the morning which having promised to do i conducted her home and lift her  chap xvi the next morning i waited on miss slashem at her lodgings and found her neatly and elegantly dressed to receive me she was grown tall and slender and had a fire in her eye that i never observed before i could not help telling her that i thought she was grown very handsome and that i was sorry to see her in no better situation than myself reduced for bread to join a strolling company of players she in return told me that her meeting with me compensated for the rubs that she had met with and they were not a few she reminded me of having promised to recount my story and i told it as faithfully as i have laid it before my readers excepting my attachment with the vows i had made to miss wildman and an untruth or two i was obliged to tell of having twice written to her an receiving no answer  when i came to that part of my story respecting the accident at mr wildmans door she corroborated the paragraph i had read in the newspapers and told me she had so far enquired as to find that the coroners inquest had acquitted me and that the porter though committed to prison as i did not appear against him was discharged at the following sessions  when i had ended my story which she observed for the little time we had been separated was the fullest of events she had ever heard of she gave me here is in the following manner  you must remember my dear fellow the critical situation you left me in i concealed it as long as i could but not hearing from you and having no friend to apply to i was under a necessity of discovering it to my mother and making a friend of her hussy says she this comes of your hanging about the men and though she rated me roundly for my misconduct as i applied to her feelings as a woman and my mother she wished if possible to keep it secret from my father but that was impracticable he had too keen an eye not to see a visible alteration in my person and knew too much of the world as he called it to be humbuggd in short it was known to him three months before i lay in and no poor devil between father and mother lived a more wretched life upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment in short your cruel usage added to theirs so distressed me that i was worn to a shadow and had they not relaxed in their severity near the time of my lying in i believe i should have died indeed i so frequently told them so that they began to believe it they on this consideration were less severe to me at the last and i made shift to live through the trying time having brought into the world a stillborn boy  there appearing now to be no living witness of my shame and my father not likely to be at any further expense after i was recovered he began to soften his brow and to reconcile the matter to himself but never could be brought to look upon me again with that pleasure and satisfaction he had formerly done in short the life i then led determined me to quit it whenever i had an opportunity and this opportunity soon offered for having a strolling company in the village which i heard were removing i wrote a note to the manager who was a single man and whom i had seen to this effect  sir a damsel in distress stands in need of protection she fancies she has abilities for the stage or for any thing if you are inclined to try them and have spirit enough to bring a ladder and carry her off secretly you will find her at the one pair of stairs window of the red house opposite the lamp post no     on the road to london on friday morning next between three and four oclock   for as you know my mother used to take the keys of the outer doors up into her room i had no other way of escaping i prepared every thing for my elopement put up my clothes in a bundle and on the appointed morning being just break of day i stole down to the window and though i doubted of seeing the person i waited for i no sooner opened the shutter than i found my ranger with a ladder ready and with all the vivacity and spirit i could wish he handed me out and we got clear off it was a fine morning and we walked away for hampstead where he had provided me a retreat having thrown the ladder over a hedge by the road side here he kept me a week and lived with me till his company removed to st albans and we then followed  your good sense my dear gabriel will forgive me this rash act could i have had your protection i would have preferred it to that of all the men in the world but as you had deserted me and my life was wretched from a persuasion that it could not be more so i ventured upon the change it was a bold enterprise as i was then scarce nineteen mr rider for that was my friends name was a tolerable good player took a great deal of pains with me and made me capable of earning my living before i had been three months with him i came out at first in very trisling parts but before we left st albans i had played juliet desdemona and two or three other capital characters and acquitted myself so well that i began to think of standing upon my own bottom  i had not been a great while at st albans before my father found me out and wrote to me after condemning my conduct and some few chidings on that account he proceeded to tell me that if i would quit the way of life i was in return home and be useful about the house that both he and my mother would receive me kindly  but i returned him for answer that i was making great proficiency in the profession i had taken up and had the vanity to think that in a little time i should be at the top of it i thanked him for his offer but i would rather continue as i was particularly as i could not be more disgraced than i had been and as his circumstances were not so great but he could dispense with a useless person about him after this letter he left me to myself and i never was importuned again upon the subject  i have written to my mother once or twice since not to ask any assistance but merely to enquire after her and my father but as i never could obtain an answer i wrote no more all i know is that on enquiry from a person who was lately in the neighborhood i find that they are both well and that his school has very much increased  i continued with mr rider upwards of three quarters of a year when a circumstance happened that occasioned our separation whilst i was at st albans a linendrapers apprentice a goodhumoured lad took a liking to me and was ever behind the scenes industriously attentive to please me and as he was a generous youth though without money and would frequently present me with a muslin handkerchief or two half a dozen pocket handkerchiefs an apron and other necessary articles i found it my interest to keep in with him   not enquiring interrupted i how he came by them  not i indeed continued she that was no part of my concern i suppose he paid his master for them  they were acceptable to me and i took them and when we removed to hertford this young man one sunday came over to see me at a time when mr rider was from home and not being able toget him away so soon as i wished mr rider returned and entered the room unexpectedly at the moment the poor boy was squeezing my hand in raptures mr rider grew jealous from this hour and was seldom after in a good humor i told him therefore frankly that i would continue no longer with him but leave him and his company to themselves i accordingly applied to the manager of the buckingham theater and as he wanted a woman in my cast of parts i immediately joined his company at a salary of four and twenty shillings a week and he being a musical man taught me to sing so that i am now a general player tragedy comedy opera farcenothing comes amiss miss to me  and have you say i continued with them till now  with some little interruption returned she i have i went on pretty smoothly for the first year when an old quaker at buckingham who had more of the sinner in him than the saint and was reputed to be very rich invited himself to drink tea which me at my lodgings i received him and he made me a formal proposal of taking me to live with him with a verily friend slashem thou have a leering eye and a bewitching form that stirs my whole frame i have been since i saw thee in such an eternal figet that i never shall be again composed till thou condescendeth to make me happy i gave him to understand that in the profession i was in i earned a great deal of money that if he took me out of it i should be a considerable loser for that i might find an unwillingness to return and that of course i could not think of changing my situation unless he would settle fifty pounds a year upon me which he consented to and i went home in a few days after to his house  you will scarce credit the assertion but it is nevertheless true that quakers notwithstanding their outward formality and stiffness are as wanton as boys and put on their formality only with their clothes mr broadbrim the gentleman i lived with was about sixty years of age and very much respected among the brotherhood i was dressed like one of them and passed for his housekeeper and might have continued long with him had not the friends began to smoke him as they called it and found out who i was truly friend broadbrim said an old acquaintance to him one day and which i overheard from the next room thy housekeeper savoureth too much of the flesh and betrayeth an impurity that becomes not thy age and outward sanctity ebenezer said mr broadbrim to him let not thy tongue outrun thy discretion flesh is sometimes necessary to cheer the spirits and comfort the outward man i can discover by thy eyes that thou also have thy wanton moments and that though thy flesh be weak thy spirit is willing  it was not always he could get off so well in short he was so laughed at by the young men and jeered by the old that he could not hold up against their ridicule and having been threatened with an expulsion from the society which he dreaded more than any thing he told me one day unwilling as he was he must part with me but that the fifty pounds a year i was welcome to keep and if i did not expose him he would be a friend to me whilst he lived i accordingly quitted him and returned to the way of life i was in before joining the buckingham company again at my former salary but as my own mistress with the addition of fifty pounds a year regularly paid every half year our manager dying soon after the company broke up and i am engaged here as you find me  i took the liberty to ask her some questions respecting the quakers she replied that indeed she did not know a great deal of them having never conversed with any one of them till she became acquainted with mr broadbrim but that he had an universal acquaintance among the fraternity and they were frequently at his house that as far as she could judge they were the greatest dissemblers in life and that she believed though they professed more candor and more sincerity than the rest of the world they at the same time had less of it that she knew it was a custom among them to have false bills of parcels to show to their customers by which they ascertained their profit to be very small when in fact it was very large and under a pretense of dealing for discount only that discount was twentyfive or thirty per cent i know the birmingham manufacturers allow a discount of twentyfive per cent upon their bills for ready money and if a retailer gets no more he gets a great deal too much but as my opinion of miss slashems judgment was but indifferent i ceased making any further enquiries  she would fian have urged me to live in the same apartment with her but i excused myself under the declaration of being the most inconstant fellow alive and the most unsettled that it was uncertain whether i continued in the profession i was in one month or twelve but that whilst i did and that we were within reach of each other i would see her when she pleased and where she pleased and should always think myself happy when i had it in my power to be of use to her  it may appear strange that one upon the town as i was should decline biddy slashems proposal whose purse as well as person would have been at my command but the truth is i hated a settled connection i will be honest enough to own that i frequently yielded to the bent of human nature and if i had occasionally a child or two sworn to me unjustly i compromised the matter with the parish where it was born on the best terms i could which seldom exceeded ten pounds and a treat to the overseers of the poor that ten pounds will not bring a child up till it is able to get its living we all know but these guardians of the infant poor are charitable enough to remove it from a sinful world as soon as possible at an entertainment i gave upon one of these occasions the churchwarden intimated when halfdrunk that ten pounds was a good price for a bastard child as wrapping it up a night or two in a wet blanket seldom failed of sending it to heaven presently  end of the second volume
