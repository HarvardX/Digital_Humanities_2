the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland in four volumes  by mr brook  dublin printed for the author by dillon chamberlain in dame street facing fowness street mdcclxv  to the right respectable my ancient and wellbeloved patron the public why dont you dedicate to mr pit  because sir i would rather set forth my own talents than the virtues and praises of the best man upon earth i love to say things that no one else ever thought of extraordinary quite out of the common way i scorn to echo the voice of every fellow that goes the road whether the vessel of the commonwealth shall sink or swim what is it to me i am but a passenger  but then there is a manner in doing things you know  no sir it is no business of mine mr pit is the patron of my patron let my patron then dedicate to him and welcome dedicate statutes temples monuments as lasting as the benefits conferred it is nothing to me neither will i say a syllable more about the matter  may it please your respectableness  though the dedication is the shortest part of a book and held by all readers to be the vilest and most contemptible yet the writer and his patron the dedicator and the dedicatee have a different way of thinking the latter on account of the incense that it breathes and the former on account of the profit that it brings look upon it as the most important part of the performance  alas how little consideration is left for the race of writers among the race of readers especially on this chapter of dedications  your respectableness perhaps has not duly perpended the travail the toil the mavelous drudgery the muck that dedicators are obliged to pass through and the fences of truth over which they must break in order to cull select and sublimate an offering fit to lay upon the altar of adulation  through what a world of weeds do they range to gather their little nosegays from what a profusion of offenses do they extract their perfumes and how many nights do they watch to concentre and realize a single mouthful of moonshine for the gratification of their partrons  the trades also incumbent upon them are manifold such as of painting patching and plastering of embroidering shaping and shaving and of tyring trimming and tayloring in order to smooth and garnish the man whom it delights them to honor and to furnish him with a full suit of praises  but your respectableness i humbly hope would not wish me to be at all this trouble for indeed trouble is a thing that i do not affect there is also a kind of delicacy requisite in tickling the ribs of vanity i am at best but a downright sort of a fellow and should i aukardly presume to dash your merits full into the chops of your modesty i might deserve but ill at the hands of your respectableness  my grandmother peace be with her i remember one thing among the many good advices which she gave and i forgot never disgrace yourself quoth she in order to do honor to any one breathing think not therefore my most respectable patron that i will either debase myself by cajoling you to your face or do violence to truth by any kind of panegyric when your back shall be turned  that i have received many favors from your greatness and have a competent sense of gratitude for the same is most certain it is also true that all my studies and labors have been applied for your service and that i wish no other death than that of laying down my life for your sake yet with all my love for your person and endeavors for your prosperity i cannot find about me the smallest scantling of veneration for your virtues  you have however the satisfaction to be quite easy upon this score and no way to be mortified at any sentiments to your disadvantage your fund of good humor on such occasions is inexhaustible and you have often joined with me in reproving and ridiculing your own vices and follies which at all times you take more pleasure to rally than i apprehend you will at any time take pains to amend  i remember that in my youth i was a great builder of castles and having your interest always at heart and seldom out of my head i employed my time in forming a thousand romantic and airy schemes for your advantage  i once proposed to build your happiness on religion on christian piety and a deep sense of duty but having in vain sought a foundation whereon i might lay the first stone the superstructure vanished like the clouds of last september  i then attempted to plan the establishment of your liberty and renown upon the ancient and approved principles of the spartan poverty as this had been barely a heathen virtue as it had raised and supported that great and glorious people through many succeeding centuries in an uninterrupted enjoyment of freedom power and prosperity and as nothing appeared to be wanting to the accomplishment of this scheme save a few simple articles such as moderation content selfdenial and so forth i made no doubt of your embracing the terms with joy  on paying my first visit your respectableness was just come from a corporationcant where i was told you had set your own mother up to sale but your dignity was so drunk at the cost of the bidders that i chose to defer matters to a more sober opportunity  on my next address i understood that the equipage of your respectableness was in waiting for it is not with you now as in the days of queen bess you were hastening to see the italian puppetshew as i advanced to pay my respects i was dazzled by the ornaments with which you had glorified your person all the product of foreign looms and of foreign labors your linen of the netherlands your point of spain your ruffles of dresden with a full suit in the cut of france and trimmed like that of the three brothers in a tale of a tub in short you were so satisfied so wrapped so full of your finery you could then attend to nothing save the contemplation of your fair self  i still had patience i watched my time i attended you late on a sunday evening when i thought you at leisure from the fervor of your devotions but how was i struck of a heap when your footman informed me that some noblemen and ladies of the most fashionable distinction had engaged you for the afternoon at the gaming table  soon after i was apprised that what with spending your time and money in running to rareeshows in playing four corners and a fool in drinking dressing drabbing and in gormandizing and gambling the finances of your respectableness were considerably sunk it also came to my ear that you were hugely fond of cockmatches though you kept them as far as possible from your own dunghill that it was your custom to bett on one side and then to bett on the other side and to lose your money on all sides and that by these and the former means your respectableness was dipped so up to the ears in debt it was thought your yearly income would in time barely answer the interest of what you owed  it was now confidently affirmed may it please your respectableness that you yourself were apprehensive of being reduced to sudden indigence and i eagerly seized this occasion of waiting upon you in order as i trusted to reconcile you to your fate and possibly to delight you with the prospect of your approaching poverty for i sighed when i reflected on your intemperate and unbounded thirst after riches that death to national nature which had proved the mortal poison of greece and of rome and of all people who tasted it from the beginning of the world to this present good day  being shown to your apartment i perceived your greatness seated in a moody kind of attitude but having formerly had the honor of being known to you i took a chair without ceremony and chatting with you awhile about the weather the news of the day and such like ponderous matters as sage ministers and sage politicians are wont to do i began to introduce and open the business  pray mister said your dignity somewhat short have you any particular business with me at this time i am come may it please you said i to propose a speedy and effectual method for the supply of all your wants at these agreeable tidings all the ears your respectableness had were pricked up and opened to audience  go on my good friend dispatch in heavens name  may it please you added i it was the custom of all the seers and sages of ancient days to introduce truth and wisdom under the covering of fable and this covering was as a nutshell if your teeth were able to crack it you had the kernel for your pains permit me then at least to imitate their manner for though the matter should happen to drop by the way the first traveller who takes it up may be bettered thereby  once upon a time for so says my story a householder with his family was cast on a certain island where through a process of years they propagated till they became a little nation the soil was exceeding fertile but there was neither river nor spring in all the land nature however had provided for this defect by a kind of fruit that perfectly allayed the thirst it was bitter to the taste but left an agreeable flavor in the mouth and gave health spirits and vigor to the whole constitution and it was called by a name which in our language signifies as nearly as i can render it the fruit of abstinence  there was also other fruits of a species wholly the reverse of the former for the flavor of these was extremely delicious but then they enflamed the thirst enervated the frame and were called by a name that signified the fruit of indulgence  as almost all people made this latter fruit a part of their daily food the national thirst in time became so great that the liturgy of their church was altogether composed of prayers for rain o jupiter some water a little water dear mister jupiter water water water we pray for nothing but water sink us plunge us drown us overwhelm us with water  on the decline of every sun several families spread out the fleeces of their flocks as also their sheets and blankets for the receiving and retaining of the nightly dew others furnished themselves with small alembicks for distilling the urine of their household some took a twelvemonths voyage to bring back as much liquid as they might subsist on for a few weeks and the geniuses of the nation employed themselves in various projects such as the chimical extraction of moisture from biscuit and old fiddles as also the hanging nets of a peculiar texture on poles of due elevation for catching the clouds  your respectableness has my tale  can make nothing of it say you  suppose the thirst of this people an emblem of their avarice and wealth to be represented by water in the fable   in short may it please your dignity i have brought you here it is a refinement on the institutions of the great lycurgus could i like the legislator of lacedaemon prevail upon you barely to abridge your desires you would find yourself wholely a stranger to want you would thereby acquire the wealth of greatness goodness gloriousness that peace that solidity of sublunary enjoyment which can only be found in a voluntary poverty  scarce had i pronounced the last fatal word when your respectableness started up in a passion you asked me if i had not seen the levee of duns at your gate and the catchpoles that lurked for you at every corner you consigned me with a very good will to the devil and desired that the next time i presumed to turn statequack i should not prescribe drink to a drowning man  as i retired under the greatest dejection of spirits  ho you cried honest friend mr what do they call you come back you who scatter your money as fast as your words as profuse of your purse as you are of your opinions you who always run a mile before your rents and live upon the harvest of the next years sickle are not you also a poor devil one of the diogenical gentlemen as very an emperor of the tub as myself  preach up poverty with a pox first get wherewithal to pay your own debts the ready runners my boy the passable pictures the royal pages the sparklers the portable the potable ay marry this would do this would fortify your argument this would mould me to your form and persuade me to your faith it is this my little lad that would shut too the door on all manner of temptations and kick the corruptions you have so often complained of into the kennel come cast me the nativity of this bright son of phoebus draw me a scheme for raising this egyptian from the deep and you shall be my darling my bardling my hourly oracle my apollo of delphos and what not  was your respectableness said i ever told your fortune perhaps it might bear some resemblance to my own i was a boy when the cunning man peering earnestly into my palm uttered a sentence which i shall remember the longest day i have to live you will always said he be getting a power of money and take my word you will never be worth a groat  indeed could i have prevailed upon your respectableness to be contented with poverty i was in hopes you would have enriched your monitor for his pains but in truth i am a very ass at this business of getting money either for you or myself and as for the keeping it when i have got it i have long since given up all thoughts of the matter i will however do my best to add to the glories to the virtues as i may say of your respectableness in a manner more acceptable than my present plan has proved  i am your dignitys most devoted and wish you a mighty good evening  having thereafter consigned my late scheme to bakers and barbers and to all the vilest applications of waste paper i sat down to study and provide a remedy for that feverish kind of consumption under which your respectableness apparently labored during our late confabulation  i was sensible at the same time that your distemper was common to many other countries and that it was no where held to be dangerous forasmuch as it only consisted of two articles the sensuality of the body and the corruption of the mind  i also knew that in former ages a great number of publicks had been affected with the very malady that now possessed your respectableness and yet had lived merrily under it to their dying day  i wished however to keep that day at some distance from your greatness and with long and intense labor and at the cost of many a candle during my nightly lucubrations i compounded a medicine of approved and infallible efficacy consisting for the nonce of a quantum sufficit of the temperance and patriotism of the primitive romans  i knew that the cure would follow but how to prevail upon your respectableness to swallow the prescription was a small matter of difficulty that yet remained for it is a misfortune peculiar to those who are bit by love avarice ambition pride and such passions that they detest the thoughts of a restorative and are so enamoured of their distemper they would rather see the devil than doctor apollo himself at their door  i again had the honor of being admitted to an audience i called up and exhausted all the powers of oratory on that capital occasion i demonstrated to your respectableness that the whole weight and elevation of the roman state rested simply on the two pillars of temperance and patriotism on which it rose increased and stood supported through many ages till those pillars being gradually sapped the mighty structure with its said foundation decayed grew ruinous and fell confounded together that temperance is necessary to the strength of a man as patriotism is necessary to the strength of a people that each roman thus nerved and powerful apart was yet strengthened a hundred thousand fold by an invisible chord which run from man to man and united all as one in the love of country that hence sprung the helicon of their abundant inspiration to toil industry frugality valor conquest and glory they were swallowed like so many drops in this ocean of patriotism they were lost to every care and sensation of self and were only found where they labored fought bled or expired for their country  while warmed and somewhat raised by the elevation of my subject i thus reasoned on nationalpower on humanexcellence on virtue on temperance on patriotism and glory i shall never forget the kind concern which your respectableness expressed for me in the evident alarm and compassion of your countenance as for a person whose fit you feared was approaching  being both of us more composed your greatness was pleased to demand whether this romance was wholly of my own invention or if i had lately been fishing the well where truth was formerly drowned for an ens rationis of some speculating philosopher where you cried in the name of wonder have you been able to gather together such an old fashioned bundlement of scientific balderdash you shall bring me to the practice exactly at the period that the hogs shall be brought to feed along with the herrings or at the time of the appearance of the comet with the three tails or on the week of the four fridays so long looked for by astrologians  here exclaimed your respectableness who waits all you my printers editors and other porters who attend at the gate of the public should this fellow come any more with these his preachments of piety and poverty and patriotism and stuff i command ye to shut my doors directly in his face  may it please your respectableness i am but a very little man and of a very lowly temper and yet i could not but be piqued at the severity of this treatment i was as a trodden worm and turned upon your greatness with a resentment that possibly did not become me  may your dignity i replied continue to be blessed with writers duly levelled to the taste of the reader with the politics of court hirelings the poetry of laureats the divinity of a h  y with bawdry from the fleet with fragments from the kennel of grubstreet with strumpet biography with w  upon grace with treatises on  and episcopal essays on spirit  i trust that my patron in recompense for a long life spent in his service will pardon me the dropping of one observation  nay dont look disgusted  it is no matter of great offense it is nothing more than this that the nose of your respectableness has ever been a ready handle for the leading of a fool and a fool shall accordingly attend you on my next visit  preface i hate prefaces i never read them and why should i write them they stand like pales about a park i always overleap em if i  there is any thing within worth  but what can i do i am likely to lead a fine life with this performance when people begin to quarrel with me upon reading the first word of the first page of my works  this friend and that friend and the other friend asks me and here sits another who is mighty curious to know why i entitle my hero the fool of quality  pray was it not more decent to impute folly to one man than to mankind if i found myself under the necessity of doing the one or the other  perhaps i call him a fool in complaisance to a world that will certainly honor him with the same title when they find his wisdom of a size not suited to their own  why pray what is wisdom  tell me first what is folly i will then tell you what is wisdom if i find any smattering of it in your definition  i wonder was there ever an age of wisdom or a land of wisdom  look about you the world will answer for itself  does not every age and nation grow wiser and wiser and have not all fathers from the flood downward been accounted no better than fools by their posterity  i wish i had not been born for some centuries to come what a prodigy of wisdom should i then be in comparison of what i am at this day  indeed i should be glad to be wise if i thought i could get any thing by it  right that is all the use that the world makes of it it is the very end purpose goal and business of all the wisdom upon earth  if a man has length enough of sense to outreach all about him by a yard and a half he is by a yard and half wiser than all his neighbors  but was not solomon then a fool to neglect riches which he might have had with a wish and to ask for wisdom whose only use is the obtaining of riches was not this wishing to mend a roundabout road when a quarter of an hour would have carried him by a short cut to the end of his journey  i fancy my dear friend it would be no great matter of additional burden to take the folly of solomon upon your own shoulders  for in case he had taken the riches how the pox should he keep them while any neighboring power was wiser than himself  paris was not five years younger than solomon when he also might have chosen either riches or wisdom and yet preferred a pretty wench to the one and to the other i am not so young as paris by five times five years and would therefore prefer the one or the other to the wench  you then allow that paris was a blockhead in the present case  sir i allow any man to be so in every case where he happens to differ in opinion from myself  why pray sage sir have you got all the wisdom of the world to yourself or what quantity thereof think you may there be upon earth  less by five scruples than any man in judiciary robes and a full bottomed wig conceives to have fallen to his own share  but folly you take to be multiplied and various  of two sorts quoth an eminent author that which belongs to the writer and that which belongs to the reader of these works  sir this is wild discourse and very wide from the purpose let me tell you the world was never so wise as now it is filled with men of deep erudition and science  true my monitor but are they a jot the wiser for all their knowledge  at the rate that you talk in the times of ancient ignorance there might have been a competent modicum of wise folk in the world  possible  and by the same rule in these our enlightened days of connoissieurship and erudition nearly all our literati may turn out fools  more than probable  these are riddles  that might be solved  explain em i beseech you  not at present i will tell you a story and pray listen it is worth the hearing  fifty and five pilgrims met one evening at a great inn that led to more roads than there are points in the compass they supped merrily together in a large hall and found upon enquiry that they were all bound to the castle of final repose appointed for the reception of the sons of science when the cloth was removed gentlemen quoth the pilgrim who first entered i rejoice to be joined by so much good company on these my honorable travels and i am still better pleased to have it in my power to conduct every man of ye the shortest and surest way to your journeys end here gentlemen here is my map of infallible directions the most accurate extract that ever was taken of all inquiries observations and informations for the nonce pardon me brother said the pilgrim who sat next your map must be erroneous by at least five degrees by five did i say by seven as i hope to get to my journeys end look here at my map and believe your own eyes i will be damned cried a third pilgrim peering over the maps of his neighbors and taking out his own parchment i will be damned if the geographers who designed the one or the other were any better than adventurers they never reached the place of destination i will be sworn gentlemen said a fourth with wonderful good temper i do not swear but i have critically remarked all the charts produced there is a blind beggar in our town who is led by his dog and if he does not arrive at the place we are bound to with better speed and greater certainty than any of you three i give myself do ye see and all my goods to the devil save a small perpetuity in remainder to my son that may be exclaimed a fifth but look ye here my friends here are the quotations here are the authorities authorities quoth a sixth a fiddlestick for a hobby are they unquestionable unassailable like these in my hand thus every mans chart throughout the fifty and five was like the hand of the son of hagar against the chart of every man each insisted on being accompanied in his own way as a matter of mere charity to all the rest they set out the next morning on as many different roads as there were persons at table and yet no one of them ever arrived at the place proposed if any dependence may be had on those customary posts whom the world from age to age has paid for intelligence  i dont clearly apprehend the application of your story  if that is not your fault it must be my own it is at least a dozen of the twelve labors to beat any thing into the head of some people  i will give you the chance of another tale  a certain prince sent an invitation to two distant personages to come to his court he further sent such directions as could not be mistaken by any one living who was willing to find the way and he further sent a written promise signed and sealed by the seal royal of the most happy accommodations upon their arrival  the one of the parties invited was a purblind man who barely saw sufficient to discern his road he accordingly was fearful of error he cautiously held on his way and thereby reached his journeys end the place of happy destination to which he was appointed  the other was a man who had all his eyes about him but he was a genius had vast invention and thought it a disparagement to tread in any path that had been beaten by others he was for contriving short cuts and opening new discoveries he made excursions on all hands he grew impatient of the accommodations appointed and reserved for him at the court of the prince he expected them on his journey and sought for them at every turn he found them not he therefore traveled and strayed this way and that way in search of them this led him still further and further from his road till maimed by accident and stiff with age he grew equally ashamed and unable to return   as plain as my nose  you can the readier follow  but talk to me no more about the world and its wisdom i detest wisdom i avoid it i would not be bit by it it is the tarantula that spins a web whereby innocence is entangled it is a politician who opens a gulf for the swallowing up of a people it is a lawyer who diggs a grave for the burial of equity it is the science of hocus pocus that bids happiness come and pass by the virtue of cups and balls it is a syllabub of fastingspittle for the fattening of the virtuosi it is a robe with a pompous train a wig spread to the rump a beard lengthened to the girdle it is a ditch of puddle with a hoary mantle that will not be moved to merriment by any wind that blows it is an ass in a sumptercloth an owl solemnly perched amidst solemn ruins on a solemn night  descend to me sweet folly if thou have not as i suspect been my constant companion be thou my sister my playfellow thou kitten of the solemn cats of state and learning but no thou never were the offspring of such stupid progenitors thou art ever joyous ever young although coeval in paradise with our first parents ere a pox upon their ambition they wished for the knowledge of good and evil pride pretends to spurn thee science affects to look down upon thee but they sigh for thee when no one sees they have frowned thee away and when they seek they shall not find thee come folly for even thy petulance and little wickednesses become delightful when thou incitest the yeanling kids and cooing turtles to combat thou art not captious thou art not testy they laugh at thee and thou laughest with them for company the hours dance before thee the graces smile in thy train thou art a companion for conquerors a playfellow for crowned heads but alas thou art not respected as heretofore when the monarch of all asia sent his ambassadors to wait upon thee they came with a mighty train even from persepolis unto laconia to see thee riding upon switches with agesilaus and his little son  by  my pleasant friend thou almost persuadest me to be a fool during the remainder of my pilgrimage through the wisdom of this world but is there no such thing as true wisdom in nature  sir i have written a whole chapter upon the subject but it lies a great way on toward the end of my book and you have much folly to wade through before you come at it  give me a peep i beseech you  no sir you shall not anticipate do you want to be in port without making any voyage  if i must win my way to wisdom inch by inch let me set out directly  here then begin and pray let me have your remarks unpremeditated as you proceed i will answer you as whim or judgment shall happen to dictate  the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland chap i richard the grandfather of our hero was ennobled by james the first he married a lovely girl of the ancient family of the goodalls in the county of surry and at seven years distance had two sons richard and henry but dying early in the reign of charles the first he bequeathed l  000 to his youngest and near l 0000 annual income to his eldest son not in any personal preference to his brother but as one who was to support the name and honors of the family he appointed his brother in law executor and guardian who educating the children agreeable to their different fortunes and prospects in life in about seven years after the death of their father sent richard with a tutor to take the tour of europe and bound henry apprentice to a considerable london merchant  during the travels of the one and the apprenticeship of the other the troubles happened and cromwell assumed the regency before the fortune of the morelands could be forfeited or endangered by siding with the crown or the commonwealth  richard returned to england a short time before the restoration and being too gay and too dissolute for the plodding and hypocricy of cromwell and his fanatics he withdrew to the mansion house of his forefathers  on his landing he had inquired for his brother henry but hearing that he was lately married and wholely absorbed in matters of merchandise as he had the utmost contempt for all cits and traders he took no further notice of him  in the country he amused himself with his bottle hounds hawks race horses etc and in debauching the persons of the neighboring wenches and corrupting the morals of the neighboring squires but on the restoration of his majesty of pleasurable memory he hastened to court where he rolled away and shone as in his native sphere he was always of the party of the king rochester etc where virtue was laughed out of countenance and where all manner of dissoluteness became amiable and recommendable by the bursts of merriment and zest of wit but toward the latter end of this droll reign earl richard being advanced in age and being still older in constitution than years began to think of providing an heir to his estate and as he had taken vast pains to impair it he married a citizens daughter who wanted a title and with her got a portion of one hundred thousand pounds which was equally wanting on his part  with his lady he again retreated to the country where in less than a year she made him the exulting father of a fine boy whom he called richard  richard speedily became the sole center of all his mothers solicitudes and affections and though within the space of the two succeeding years she was delivered of a second boy yet as his infant aspect was less promising and more unformed than his brothers she sent him forth to be nursed by the robust wife of a neighboring farmer where for the space of upward of four years he was honored with no token from father or mother save some casual messages to know from time to time if the child was in health  this boy was called henry after his uncle by the fathers side the earl had lately sent to london to make enquiry after his brother but could learn no manner of tidings concerning him  mean while the education of the two children was extremely contrasted richard who was already entitled my little lord was not permitted to breathe the rudeness of the wind on his lightest indisposition the whole house was in alarms his passions had full scope in all their infant irregularities his genius was put into a hot bed by the warmth of applauses given to every flight of his opening fancy and the whole family conspired from the highest to the lowest to the ruin of promising talents and a benevolent heart  young harry on the other hand had every member as well as feature exposed to all weathers would run about mothernaked for near an hour in a frosty morning was neither physicked into delicacy nor flattered into pride scarce felt the convenience and much less understood the vanity of clothing and was daily occupied in playing and wrestling with the pigs and two mungril spaniels on the dunghill or in kissing scratching or boxing with the children of the village  when harry had passed his fifth year his father on a festival day humbly proposed to send for him to his nurses in order to observe how the boy might turn out and my lady in a fit of good humor assented nurse accordingly decked him out in his holiday petticoats and walked with our hero to the great house as they called it  a brilliant concourse of the neighboring gentry were met in a vast parlour that appeared to be executed after the model of westminster hall  there was sir christopher cloudy who knew much but said nothing with his very conversable lady who scarce knew by halves but spoke by wholesale in the same range was sir standish stately who in all companies held the first place in his own esteem next to him sat lady childish it was at least thirty years since those follies might have become her which appeared so very ridiculous at the age of fiftyfive by her side were the two stiltons a blind man would swear that the one was a clown and the other a gentleman by the tones of their voices next to these were two pair of very ill mated turtles mr gentle who sacrificed his fine sense and affluent fortune to the vanity and bad temper of a silly and turbulent wife and squire sulky a brutal fool who tyranized over the most sensible and most amiable of her sex  on the opposite side was lord prim who evidently labored hard to be easy in conversation and next to him was lord flippant who spoke nonsense with great facility by his side sat the fair but dejected miss willow she had lately discovered what a misfortune it was to be born to wit beauty and affluence the three capital qualifications that lead the sex to calamity next to her was colonel jolly with a heart ever tuned to merriment and lungs to laughter had he known how to time his fits the laugh might have grown catching below him was seated mrs mirror a widow lady industriously accomplished in the faults of people of fashion and below her sat the beloved and respected mr meekly who always sought to hide behind the merits of the company next to him was major settle no one spoke with more importance on things of no signification and beside him sat miss lovely who looked sentiment and while she was silent inspired others with sense and virtue  these were the principal characters the rest could not be said to be of any character at all the cloth had been lately removed and a host of glasses and decanters glowed on the table when in comes young harry escorted by his nurse  all the eyes of the company were instantly drawn upon him but he advanced with a vacant and unobserving phisiognimy and thought no higher of the assembly than as of so many peasants at a country wake  dicky my dear says my lady go and welcome your brother whereat dick went up took harry by the hand and kissed him with much affection harry thereupon having eyed his brother i dont know you said he bluntly but at the same time held up his little mouth to kiss him again  dick says my lady put your laced hat upon harry till we see how it becomes him which he immediately did but harry feeling an unusual encumbrance on his head took off the hat and having for some time looked contemptuously at it he cast it from him with a sudden and agile jerk as he used to cast flat stones in order to make ducks and drakes in the mill pond the hat took the glasles and decanters in full carrier smash go the glasses abroad pours the wine on circling laces dresden aprons silvered silks and rich brocades female screams fill the parlour the rout is equal to the uproar and it was long ere most of them could be composed to their places  in the mean while harry took no kind of interest in their outcries or distresses but spying a large spanish pointer that just then came from under the table he sprung at him like lightning seized him by the collar and vaulted on his back with inconceivable agility the dog wholly disconcerted by so unacustomed a burden capered and plunged about in a violent manner but harry was a better horseman than to be so easily dismounted whereon the dog grew outrageous and rushing into a group of little misses and masters the children of the visitants he overthrew them like ninepins thence proceeding with equal rapidity between the legs of mrs dowdy a very fat and elderly lady she instantly fell backward with a violent shriek and in her fall unfortunately overthrew frank the foxhunter who overthrew andrew the angler who overthrew bob the beau who closed the catastrophe  our hero mean time was happily dismounted by the intercepting petticoats and fairly laid without damage in the fallen ladys lap from thence he arose at his leisure and strolled about the room with as unconcerned an aspect as if nothing had happened amiss and as though he had neither act nor part in this frightful discomfiture  when matters were once more in some measure set to rights my heavens exclaimed my lady i shall faint the boy is positively an idiot he has no apprehension conception of persons or things come hither sirrah she cried with an angry tone but instead of complying harry cast on her a look of resentment and sidled over toward his nurse dicky my dear said my lady go and pretend to beat his foster mother that we may try if the child has any kind of ideas here her ladyship by ill fortune was as much unadvised as her favorite was unhappy in the execution of her orders for while dick struck at the nurse with a counterfeited passion harry instantly reddened and gave his brother such a sudden pash in the face that his nose and mouth gushed out with blood dick set up the roar my lady screamed out and rising and running at harry with all imaginable fury she caught him up as a falcon would truss a robin turned over his petticoats and chastised him with all the violence of which her delicacy was capable our hero however neither uttered cry or tear but being set down he turned round on the company an eye of indignation then cried come away mammy and issued from the assembly  harry had scarce made his exit when his mother exclaimed after him ay ay take him away nurse take him away the little devil and never let me see his face more  i shall not detain my readers with a tedious detail of the many and differing opinions that the remaining company expressed with regard to our hero let it suffice to observe that they generally agreed that though the boy did not appear to be endowed by nature with a single faculty of the animal rationale he might nevertheless be rendered capable in time of many places of very honorable and lucrative employment  mr meekly alone though so gentle and complying at other times now presumed to dissent from the sense of the company i rather hold said he that this infant is the promise of the greatest philosopher and hero that our age is likely to produce by refusing his respect to those superficial distinctions which fashion has inadequately substituted as expressions of human greatness he approves himself the philosopher and by the quickness of his feelings for injured innocence and his boldness in defending those to whom his heart is attached he approves himself at once the hero and the man  harry had now remained six months more with his nurse engaged in his customary exercises and occupations he was already by his courage his strength and action become tremendous to all the little boys of the village they had all things to fear from his sudden resentment but nothing from his memory or recollection of a wrong and this also was imputed to his native stupidity the two mungril dogs were his inseparable playfellows they were all tied together in the strictest bonds of friendship and caressed each other with the most warm and unfeigned affection  on a summers day as he strolled forth with these his faithful attendants and rambled into a park whose gate he saw open he perceived in a little copse that bordered on a fishpond a stranger seated on a bench of turf harry drew near with his usual intrepidity till he observed that the man had a reverend beard that spread over his breast that he held something in his hand on which he gazed with a fixed attention and that the tears rolled down his cheeks without ceasing and in silence except the half suppressed sobs that often broke from his bosom harry stood awhile immovable his little heart was affected he approached the old man with a gentle reverence and looking up in his face and seating himself by his side the muscles of his infant aspect began to relax and he wept and sobd as fast as his companion  friend  pray who is this ancient stranger i have a great curiosity to know is he necessary to your story is he to have any future connection with the child how came he by the long beard beards were not the fashion in those days there must be some extraordinary reason for it if there is any reason at all is his story long do you begin upon it directly it is a great fault in authors to hold their readers in suspense our curiosity grows languid twenty to one it is vanished before you begin to give it any kind of satisfaction who in the world is he what business has he here  author  sir you see he is a stranger i have mentioned him as such if he chooses to continue so for some time longer i know of no right that i have to discover him perhaps i am the only person breathing whom he has entrusted with the secret of his affairs i am upon honor not to betray him you must pardon me  pray proceeed  chap ii the old gentleman turned and gazed at the child as on some sudden apparition his tears stopped he returned the picture which he held into his bosom and lifting up his eyes great power he cried is this the one of all the world who has any feelings for me is it this babe this suckling whom thou have sent to be a partaker in my griess and the sharer of my afflictions welcome then my little friend said he tenderly turning and caressing the child i will live the longer for thy sake and endeavor to repay the tears thou have shed in my behalf  the language of true love is understood by all creatures and was that of which harry had almost the only perception he returned his friends caresses with unaffected ardour and no two could be more highly gratified in the endearments of each other  what is your name my dear said the old gentleman harry clinton sir harry clinton repeated the old man and started and pray who is your father the child then looking tenderly at him replied i will have you for a father if you please sir the stranger then caught him up in his arms and passionately exclaimed you shall you shall my darling for the tenderest of fathers never to be torn asunder till death shall part us  then asking him where he lived and harry pointing to the town before them they both got up and went toward it our hero was now again all glee all action he sprung from and to his friend and played and gambold about him like a young spaniel in a morning just loosed from his chain and admitted to accompany his master to the field as his two dogs frisked about him he would now mount upon one then bound upon the other and each pranced and paraded under him as delighted with the burden the old gentleman beheld all with a pleasure that had long been a stranger to his breast and shared in the joys of his young associate  being arrived near the farm house nurse who stood at the door saw them approaching and cried out gaffer gaffer here comes our harry with the dumb gentleman when they were come up good people says the stranger is this your child no no sir answered the nurse we are but his fosterers and pray who is his father he is second son sir to the earl of moreland the earl of moreland you amaze me greatly is this all the notice and care they take of such a treasure sir replied the nurse they never sent for him but once they dont mind him they take him for a fool for a fool cried he and shook his head in token of dissent i am sure he has the wisest of all human hearts i wish it may beso sir said the nurse but he behaved very sadly some time ago at the great house she then made a recital of all our young heros adventures in the mansionparlour whereat the old gentleman inwardly chuckled and for the first time of some years permitted his features to relax into a smile of cheerfulness  nurse said he every thing that i hear and see of this child serves the more to endear and bind me to him pray be so good as to accompany us to my house we will try to equip him better both as to person and understanding  as this strangers seat made part of the village they were soon there he first whispered his old domestic who then looked upon the child with surprise and pleasure the footman was next sent to bring the tailor and some light stuffs from the town shop matters being thus dispatched with respect to our heros first coat and britches nurse was kept to dinner and after this gentleman had entertained his young guest with a variety of little tricks childish plays and otherfooleries toward evening he dismissed him and his nurse with a request that she would send him every day and a promise that he should be returned every night if she desired it  harry being thus furnished with the external tokens of a man child having been born into the world became an inseparable friend and playfellow to his patron at times of relaxation the old gentleman with the most winning and insinuating address endeavored to open his mind and cultivate his morals by a thousand little fables such as of bold sparrows and naughty kids that were carried away by the hawk or devoured by the wolf and of good robbins and innocent lambs that the very hawks and wolves themselves were fond of for he never proposed any encouragement or reward to the heart of our hero save that of the love and approbation of others at the times of such instruction harry who knew no other dependence and beheld his patron as his father and as his god would hang upon his knee look up to his face delighted and greedily imbibe the sweetness of those lessons whose impressions neither age nor any occurrence could ever after erase so prevalent are the dictates of lips that are beloved  at other times the stranger would enter with our hero into all his little frolicks and childish vagaries would run and wrestle with him ride the rods roll down the slope and never felt such sweet sensations and inward delight as when he was engaged in such recreations  there was a cock at harrys nurses the lord of the dunghill between whom and our hero a very particular intimacy and friendship had been contracted harrys hand was his daily caterer and dick for the cock was so called would hop into the childs lap and pick his clothes and rub his feathers against him and court harry to tickle and stroke and play with him  upon a shrovetuesday while harry was on his road from his patrons intending a short visit to his nurse and foster father a lad came to their door and offered gaffer a double price for dick the bargain was quickly made the lad bore off his prize in triumph and gaffer withdrew to the manuring of a back field just at that crisis harry came up and enquired of the maid for his daddy and mammy but was answered that neither of them was within he then asked after his favorite cock but was told that his daddy had that minute sold him to yonder man who was almost out of sight  away sprung our hero like an arrow from a bow and held the man in view till he saw him enter a great crowd at the upper end of the street up he comes at last quite out of breath and making way through the assembly perceived his cock at some distance tied to a short stake and a lad preparing to throw at him with a stick forward he rushed again and stopped resolutely before his bird to ward the blow with his own person at the instant that the stick had taken its flight and that all the people cried out hold hold one end of the stick took harry in the left shoulder and bruised him sorely but not regarding that he instantly stooped delivered his captive favorite whipped him under his arm caught up the stick flourished it as in defiance of all opponents made homeward through the crowd and was followed by the acclamations of the whole assemby  the old gentleman was standing before his court door when his favorite arrived all in a sweat what is the matter my dear says he what made you put yourself into such a heat what cock is that you have under your arm in answer to these several questions harry ingenuously confessed the whole affair and when his patron with some warmth cried why my love did you venture your life for a silly cock why did i repeated the child why sir because he loved me the stranger then stepping back and gazing upon him with eyes of tender admiration may heaven for ever bless thee my little angel he exclaimed and continue to utter from thy lips the sentiments that it inspires then catching him up in his arms he bathed him with his tears and almost stifled him with his caresses  in a few days our hero was again restored by frequent fomentations to the use of his arm and his dada as he called him and he returned to their old recreations  as harrys ideas began to open and expand he grew ambitious of greater power and knowledge he wished for the strength of that bull and for the swiftness of yonder horse and on the close of a solemn and serene summers evening while he and his patron walked in the garden he wished for wings that he might fly up and see what the sky and the stars and the rising moon were made of  in order to reform this inordinacy of his desires his patron addressed him in the following manner  i will tell you a story my harry on the other side of yonder hill there runs a mighty clear river and in that river on a time there lived three silver trouts the prettiest little fishes that any one ever saw now god took a great liking and love to these pretty silver trouts and he let them want for nothing that such little fishes could have occasion for but two of them grew sad and discontented and the one wished for this thing and the other wished for that thing and neither of them could take pleasure in any thing that they had because they were always longing for something that they had not  now harry you must know that all this was very naughty in those two little trouts for god had been exceedingly kind to them he had given them every thing that was fittest for them and he never grudged them any thing that was for their good but instead of thanking him for all his care and his kindness they blamed him in their own minds for refusing them any thing that their silly fancies were set upon in short there was no end of their wishing and longing and quarrelling in their hearts for this thing and the other  at last god was so provoked that he resolved to punish their naughtiness by granting their desires and to make the folly of those two little stubborn trouts an example to all the foolish fish in the whole world  for this purpose he called out to the three little silver trouts and told them they should have whatever they wished for  now the eldest of these trouts was a very proud little fish and wanted forsooth to be set up above all other little fishes may it please your greatness says he i must be free to tell you that i do not at all like the way in which you have placed me here you have put me into a poor narrow and troublesome river where i am straitened on the right side and straitened on the left side and can neither get down into the ground nor up into the air nor go where nor do any one thing i have a mind to i am not so blind for all but that i can see well enough how mighty kind and bountiful you can be to others there are your favorite little birds who fly this way and that way and mount up to the very heavens and do whatever they please and have every thing at command because you have given them wings give me such wings also as you have given to them and then i will have something for which i ought to thank you  no sooner ask than have he felt the wings he wished for growing from either side and in a minute he spread them abroad and rose out of the water at first he felt a wonderful pleasure in finding himself able to fly he mounted high into the air above the very clouds and he looked down with scorn on all the fishes in the world  he now resolved to travel and to take his diversion far and wide he flew over rivers and meadows and woods and mountains till growing faint with hunger and thirst his wings began to fail him and he thought it best to come down to get some refreshment  the little fool did not consider that he was now in a strange country and many a mile from the sweet river where he was born and bred and had received all his nourishment so when he came down he happened to alight among dry sands and rocks where there was not a bit to eat nor a drop of water to drink and so there he lay faint and tired and unable to rise gasping and fluttering and beating himself against the stones till at length he died in great pain and misery  now the second silver trout though he was not so high minded as the first little proud trout yet he did not want for conceit enough and he was moreover a narrow hearted and very selfish little trout and provided he himself was snug and safe he did not care what became of all the fishes in the world so he says to god  may it please your honor i dont wish not i for wings to fly out of the water and to ramble into strange places where i dont know what may become of me i lived contented and happy enough till the other day when as i got under a cool bank from the heat of the sun i saw a great rope coming down into the water and it fastened itself i dont know how about the gills of a little fish that was basking beside me and he was lifted out of the water struggling and working in great pain till he was carried i know not where quite out of my sight so i thought in my own mind that this evil some time or other may happen to myself and my heart trembled within me and i have been very sad and discontented ever since now all i desire of you is that you would tell me the meaning of this and of all the other dangers to which you have subjected us poor little mortal fishes for then i shall have sense enough to take care of my own safety and i am very well able to provide for my own living i warrant you  no sooner said than done god immediately opened his understanding and he knew the nature and meaning of snares nets hooks and lines and of all the dangers to which such little trouts could be liable  at first he greatly rejoiced in this his knowledge and he said to himself now surely i shall be the happiest of all fishes for as i understand and am forewarned of every mischief that can come near me i am sure i love myself too well not to keep out of harms way  from this time forward he took care not to go into any deep holes for fear that a pike or some other huge fish might be there who would make nothing of swallowing him up at one gulf he also kept away from the shallow places especially in hot weather left the sun should dry them up and not leave him water enough to swim in when he saw the shadow of a cloud coming and moving upon the river a ha said he to himself here are the fishermen with their nets and immediately he got on one side and skulked under the banks where he kept trembling in his skin till the cloud was past again when he saw a fly skimming on the water or a worm coming down the stream he did not dare to bite however hungry he might be no no said he to them my honest friends i am not such a fool as that comes to neither go your ways and tempt those who know no better who are not aware that you may serve as baits to some treacherous hook that lies hid for the destruction of those ignorant and silly trouts that are not on their guard  thus this over careful trout kept himself in continual frights and alarms and could neither eat nor drink nor sleep in peace lest some mischief should be at hand or that he might be taken napping he daily grew poorer and poorer and sadder and sadder for he pined away with hunger and sighed himself to skin and bone till wasted almost to nothing with care and melancholy he at last died for fear of dying the most miserable of all deaths  now when god came to the youngest silver trout and asked him what he wished for alas said this darling little trout you know may it please your worship that i am but a very foolish and good for nothing little fish and i dont know not i what is good for me or what is bad for me and i wonder how i came to be worth bringing into the world or what you could see in me to take any thought about me but if i must wish for something it is that you would do with me whatsoever you think best and that i should be pleased to live or die even just as you would have me  now as soon as this precious trout made this prayer in his good and his humble little heart god took such a liking and a love to him as the like was never known and god found it in his own heart that he could not but take great care of this sweet little trout who had trusted himself so wholely to his love and good pleasure and god went wheresoever he went and was always with him and about him and was to him as a father and friend and companion and he put contentment into his mind and joy into his heart and so this little trout slept always in peace and wakened in gladness and whether he was full or hungry or whatever happened to him he was still pleased and thankful and he was the happiest of all fishes that ever swam in any water  harry at the close of this fable looked down and grew thoughtful and his patron left him to himself to ruminate on what he had heard now harry had often heard talk of god and had some general though confused notions of his power  the next day he requested his patron to repeat the story of the three little silver trouts when he had ended dada says harry i believe i begin to guess a little at what you mean you wouldnt have me wish for any thing but leave every thing to god and if i thought that god loved me half as well as you love me i would leave every thing to himself like the good little trout he does my harry he loves you a thousand times better than i love you nay a thousand times better than you love yourself god is all love it is he who made every thing and he loves every thing that he has made ay but dada i cannot for the heart of me help pitying the two poor little naughty trouts if god loves every thing why did he make any thing to dye you begin to think too deeply harry we will speak more of these matters another time for the present let it suffice to know that as he can kill he can also make alive again at his own pleasure  harry had now remained about twelve months with his patron when it was intimated to the earl and his lady that the dumb man had taken a fancy to their child and that he was almost constantly resident at his house alarmed at this news and apprehending that this man might be some impostor or kidnapper they once more sent orders to the nurse to bring the boy home  nurse run in a hurry to the strangers and having informed him of the necessity she was under to take away the child many mutual tears were shed at parting but harry was the sooner pacified when nurse told him that it was but for a short visit as before  when they came to the castle there was no company in the parlour but the earl and his lady with lord richard and some other masters of quality about his age and size harry however looked about with a brow of disgust and when my lady desired him to come and kiss her maybe you will whip me he answered sullenly no she replied if you dont strike your brother dicky any more i will not beat him says harry if he will not beat mammy come then and kiss me my dear said my lady whereon harry advanced with a slow caution and held up his little mouth to receive her salute he was then kissed by his father his brother and the little masters and all things promised future reconcilement and amity  a number of glittering toys were then presented to harry on all sides he received them indeed in good part but laid them all aside again as things of whose use he yet was not wise enough to be apprehensive  friend is it not too early for your hero to show a contempt of toys   author my lady as you will see imputed it to his folly not to his philosophy   fr but children have a natural fondness for fine things   aut how so is there a natural value in them   fr no but    aut education indeed has made the fondness next to natural the coral and bells teach infants on the breast to be delighted with sound and glitter has the child of an inhabitant of monomotapa a natural fondness for garbage   fr i think not   aut but when he is instructed to prize them and sees that it is the fashion to be adorned with such things he prefers them to the glister of gold and pearl tell me was it the folly or philosophy of the cock in the fable that spurned the diamond and wished for the barley corn   fr the moral says it was his folly that did not know how to make a right estimate of things   aut a wiser moral would say it was his philosophy that did know how to make a right estimate of things for of what use could the diamond be to the cock in the age of acorns antecedent to ceres and the royal ploughman triptolemus a single barley corn had been of more value to mankind than all the diamonds that glowed in the mines of india   fr you see however that age reflection and philosophy can hardly wean people from their early fondness for show   aut i see on the contrary that the older they grow and the wiser they think themselves the more they become attached to trifles what would you think of a sage minister of state who should make it the utmost height of his wishes and ambition to be mounted on a hobbyhorse   fr you cannot be serious for the soul of you   aut it has been seriously and truly and literally the fact for haman being asked by the greatest monarch upon earth what should be done most desirable for the man whom the king delighted to honor he answered in the persuasion that he himself was the person let the royal apparel be brought and let him be arrayed therewith and let him be put upon the horse that the king uses to ride and let him be brought through the street and have it proclaimed before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor what shall we say here could the sage and ambitious haman think of nothing better than what would have suited the request of a child of five years old or was it that the emperor of asia or this world itself had nothing more valuable to bestow than a fine coat and a hobbyhorse   fr how many volumes do you expect this work will contain   aut sir a book may be compared to the life of your neighbor if it be good it cannot last too long if bad you cannot get rid of it too early   fr but how long i say do you propose to make your story   aut my good friend the reader may make it as short as he pleases   chap iii my lady piqued thereat told the earl that she resolved once more to prove the wits of the youngster in britches and whispering to dicky he immediately went out and took with him his companions soon after dick returns without his shoes but with a pitiful face and cries brother harry honey i want a pair of shoes sadly will you give me yours yes i will said harry and instantly strips and presents them to him then entered another boy and demanded his stockings in the like petitioning manner another begged his hat another his coat another his waistcoat all of which he bestowed without hesitation but when the last boy came in and petitioned for his shirt no i will not said harry a little moody i want a shirt myself my lady then exclaimed upon my conscience there is but the thickness of a bit of linen between this child and a down right fool but my lord rose up took harry in his arms and having tenderly embraced him god bless thee my boy he cried and make thee an honor to old england  dinner soon after was ordered up and harry permitted his nurse to retire peaceably to the kitchen during the interval as he and all the masters were then on terms of amity  my lady placed harry next herself at table but no peer ever paid such a price at pontacs as our distressed hero did that day for his ordinary for he must sit up just so and hold his knife and fork just so and cut his meat and open his mouth and swallow his victuals just so and so and so and then between every two words there was to be so many my lords and my ladies and i thank you sir and i thank you madam and master this and master that that poor harry no longer able to contain himself cried i wish i was with my mammy in the kitchen  after dinner the children were set to questions and commands but here our hero was beaten hollow as he was afterward at draw glove and shuffle the slipper they next came to hot cockles and harry being first down had his left hand well warmed for near a quarter of an hour till more by good luck than any good policy he fixed upon a delicate little gentleman the son and heir of lord and lady toilet who lay down accordingly when harry endeavoring to sum all the favors he had received in one payment gave master such a whirrick that his cries instantly sounded the ne plus ultra to such kind of diversions but harry being chidden for his rudeness and obliged to ask pardon all was soon whole again  now throughout these several amusements though this group of little quality behaved themselves with great good manners toward our hero yet as my ladys judgment of his intellects became current through the country and that all took him to be little removed from a natural these small gentry also held him in the lowest contempt and gave themselves secret credit for the decency of their conduct in his behalf  two or three of them however having maliciously contrived to set him in a ridiculous light prevailed upon his brother to join in the plot they accordingly proposed a play wherein harry was enjoined to stand in the center for so many minutes without motion or resentment let his companions do what they would about him  our hero consequently fixed himself to a posture and countenance altogether determined the attack instantly began some grinned some pointed some jeered and flouted at him some twitched him by the hair some pinched him by the breech one tweaked him by the nose and another spirted water full in his face but harry bore all with the firmness and resignation of a stoic philosopher till my lady quite impatient cried out did you ever see the like such a stock of a child such a statue why he has no kind of feeling either of body or mind  while she was pronouncing these words young skinker eldest son to a wealthy squire a chubbed unlucky boy about the age of lord richard put one hand within the other and desired harry to strike thereon which he did accordingly but feeling unusual smart and fired at the treachery that he justly conceived was in the case harry gave him such a sudden fist in the temple as drove him staggering backward several steps skinker wholly enraged and conscious of superior strength immediately returned and with all his might gave harry a stroke on the head which compliment he returned by a punch in the eye as rapid as lightning all the boys stood aloof and amazed at the combat my lady vehemently cried out to part them but my lord rose and peremptorily commanded fair play mean while young skinker wholly desperate to be foiled by one so much his inferior in strength and understanding flew on harry like a fury and fastened the nails of both his hands in his face from which gripe our hero as quickly disengaged himself by darting his head into the nose and mouth of his adversary who was instantly covered with blood though his passion would not permit him to attend to the pain for exerting his last effort he closed in on our little champion and determined at once to finish the combat by lifting and dashing him against the ground but harry finding himself going nimbly put one foot behind and hit skinker in the ham and at the same time pushing forward with all his force prone fell the unfortunate skinker precipitated by the double weight of himself and his antagonist and his head rebounded against the floor while up sprung harry and with a rising dunt in the stomach put a period to the fray  all dismayed and wholly discomforted skinker flowly arose and began to puke and cry most piteously his companions then gathered about him and compassionating his plight turned an eye of indignation upon the victor all promiscuously exclaimed o fie master harry i am quite ashamed master harry you gave the first blow it was you that gave the first blow master harry to all which reproaches harry surlily replied if i gave first blow he gave first hurt  come come said my lord there must be something more in this affair than we are yet acquainted with come hither master skinker tell me the truth my dear what was it you did to harry that provoked him to strike you indeed sir said skinker i did not intend to hurt him so much when i gave him one hand to strike i held a pin within side in the other but the pin run up further than i thought for go go said my lord you deserve what you have got you are an illhearted boy and shall not come here to play any more  my lady then called harry desired to look at his hand and found the palm covered with blood this she washed away and having found the wound she put a small bit of black sticking silk to the orifice and harry instantly held himself as sound a man as ever  it was then that instead of exulting or crowing over his adversary he began to relax into melancholy and dejection and sideling over toward skinker and looking wistfully in his face if said harry with a trembling lip if you will kiss and friends with me i will never beat you any more to this overture skinker was with a sullen reluctance persuaded by his companions and from that moment the victor began to gain ground in the heart and good graces both of father and mother  night now approached the candles were lighted up and the children took a short and slight repast master dicky then privately whispering to his mamma desired her not to be frighted at what she might see and immediately withdrew in a short time he returned and gathering all his little companions into a group in the center of the parlour held them a while in chat when o tremendous a back door flew open and in glided a most terrifying and horrible apparition the body and limbs from the neck downwards were all wrapped in a winding sheet and the head though fear could not attend to its form appeared wholly illuminated with flames that glared through the eyes mouth and nostrils  at sight hereof master dicky appearing the first to be frighted screamed out and ran behind his mammas chair as it were for protection the pannick grew instantly contagious and all this host of little gentry who were thereafter to form our senates and to lead our armies ran shrieking and shivering to hide themselves in holes and to tremble in corners  our hero alone stood undaunted though concerned and like an astronomer who with equal dread and attention contemplates some sudden phenomenon in the heavens which he apprehends to be sent as an ensign or forerunner to the fall of mighty states or dispeopling of nations so harry with bent and apprehensive brows beheld and considered the approaching spectre  he had never heard nor formed any idea of ghosts of hobgoblins he therefore stood to deliberate what he had to fear from it it still advanced upon him nor had he yet budged when his brother cried out from behind my ladys chair beat it harry beat it on the instant harry flew back to the corner next the hall and catching up his staff the trophy of shrove tuesday he returned upon the spectre and aiming a noble blow at the illuminated sconce he at once smashd the outward lantern drove the candle flame and all into the mouth of him who held it and opened his upper lip from the nose to the teeth out spouted the blood as from a spiggot the ghost clapped all the hands that he had to his mouth and slunk away to show to his friends in the kitchen how he had been baffled and mauled by an infant of seven summers  heaven preserve us cried my lady we shall have nothing but broils and bloodshed in the house while this child is among us indeed my dear replied the earl if there was any thing more than mere accident in this business it was the fault of your favorite dicky who desired the boy to strike  by this time the little gentry came all from their lurking holes though yet pale and unassured and whatever contempt they might have for the intellects of harry they had now a very sincere veneration for his prowess  bed time now approaching and all being again settled harry says my lord you have been a very good boy to day and have joined with your companions in all their little plays now if you have any plays to show them i am sure they will have the good manners to do as you desire what say you harry have you any play to show them yes sir said harry i have a many of them there is first leap frog and thrush a thrush to it then harry says my lord and pray all you little gentlemen do you observe his directions  no sooner said than done harry took his companions one by one and causing them to stoop with their heads toward the ground in a long line and at certain distances each before the other he returned to the tail and taking the advantage of a short run to quicken his motion he laid his hands on the rump of the hindmost and vaulting lightly over him he with amazing rapidity flew along the whole line clearing a man at every motion till he alighted before the foremost and down he popt in the posture of those behind  my lady in utter astonishment lifting up her hands and eyes exclaimed o the fine creature o the graceful creature if there was but a mind to match that body there would not be such another boy in the universe  lord richard being now hindmost was the next who adventured and with action enough cleared his two first men but then having lost the advantage of his run and his foreman being of more than ordinary size he first stuck upon his rump and pitching thence broke his forehead against the floor he got up however with a pleasant countenance and running along side the line set himself in his former posture before his brother the hindmost then and then the next and the next and so onward took their turns in succession without any better success the one bruised his shoulder another sprained his finger another bumpt his head another broke his nose etc etc so that in less than five minutes my lady had got an hospital of her own though not altogether consisting of incurables  now spirits and vinegar brown paper black plaster etc were called for in a hurry and the several stupes and dressings being skilfully applied the children were ordered to their respective beds and nurse was prevailed upon to continue with harry till he should be reconciled to his new friends and associates  now harry was become a favorite especially among the servants who in a manner adored him since the adventure of the box and the hobgoblin  friend hobgoblin  in good time  nothing amazes me so much as the terrifying apprehensions that the world from the beginning has universally entertained of ghosts and specter   author do you fear them   fr no  i cannot say  not much  something of this formerly i should not like even now to lie alone in a remote chamber of a ruinous castle said to be haunted and have my curtains at midnight opened suddenly upon me by a deaths head and bloodybones all nonsense i know it the early prejudices of a dastardly fancy  i fear while i am convinced there is nothing to be feared  do you think there is any such thing in nature as a spirit   aut i know not that there is any such thing in nature as matter   fr not know there is any such thing as matter  you love to puzzle  to throw lets into the road of common sense  what else do you know from what else can you form any kind of idea   aut the room is warm enough more heat is needless  i know that thoughts and conceptions are raised in my mind but how they are raised or that they are adequate images of things supposed to be represented i know not what if this something or this nothing called matter should be a shadow a vacuum in respect of spirit wholely resistless to it and pervadeable by it or what if it be no other than a various manifestation of the several good and evil qualities of spirit if one infinite spirit as is said fills the universe all other existence must be but as the space wherein he essentially abides and exists indeed they could not be produced or continued for a moment but by his existing omnipotently indivisibly entirely in and throughout every part   fr this is new very new  but i will not batter my brains against your castle  according to your thesis when a man is apprehensive of a spirit or spectre it is not of shadows but of substances that he is afraid   aut certainly his principal apprehension arises from his believing it more sufficient more powerful and more formidable than himself   fr excuse me there are more tremendous reasons on the supposition of an engagement those sort of invisible gentry have many advantages over us they give a man no manner of fair play they have you here and have you there and your best watch and ward is no better than fencing against an invisible flail  but seriously do you think we have any innate fears of these matters   aut all our fears arise from the sense of our own weakness and of the power and inclination that others may have to hurt us   fr if our horror of apparitions is not innate how comes it to pass that soldiers that general officers who dare all other danger that heroes who like brutus have given death to themselves or who have been led to execution without a changing cheek have yet dreaded to lie alone or to be left in the dark   aut we all see that a spirit has vast power nothing else in truth can have any power at all we perceive by ourselves and others with what ease it can act upon what we call matter how it moves how it lifts it perhaps were our spirits detached from this distempered prison to which the degeneracy of our fallen nature has confined them they might more easily whirl a mountain through the atmosphere than they can now cast a pebble into the air the consideration of this power when joined to malevolence as is generally the case becomes very tremendous the stories told by nurses and gossips about a winters fire when the young auditors crouch closer and closer together and dare not look about for fear of what may be behind them leave impressions that no subsequent reason or religion can efface the ideas of an apparition on these occasions are connected with all the horrors of which infant imaginations can be susceptible fangs horns a threatening mien saucer eyes a flaming breath and a deadly aspect when children are told of fairies who carry off people to dwell with them under ground and of evil spirits who snatch away soul and body together to be their associates in regions of darkness and woe the fear of such evils greatly surpasses those of death as it weds misery to existence beyond the grave  on the contrary side had spirits been originally represented to infants as beings of an amiable appearance and as guardians benevolent and beneficent to man had they further deigned to visit us under such representations and had we experienced the advantage of their instructions and good offices we should have met them with transport and have parted with regret   fr i observe that as our female antiquarians drop off our faith in specter perceptibly decays we have not the fiftieth story either propagated or believed that was credited as gospel when i was a boy what think you is it for or against religion that such fables should get footing among mankind   aut i never could think it for the interest of religion that the providence of god should be elbowed as it were quite out of the world by a system of daemonism on the other hand i take the devil to be a personage of much more prudence than to frighten his favorites from him by assuming such horrid and disgustful appearances he rather chooses to lurk behind temptation in the allurement of beauty the deceitfulness of smiles the glozing of compliments in revel and banqueting in titles and honors in the glitter of ornament and in the pomp of state when god sends his spirits on messages to man there is a meaning of importance in the errand such was that of his angel to manoah for the delivery of a people and to zacharias and the blessed virgin for the redemption of humankind but when the devil is said to send his emissaries throughout the earth on what errands does this archpolitician employ them even such as could suit no other than a dunce or a driveller i never yet heard of one of these missions that could be construed to any intention of cunning or common sense i therefore hold the legends of his ghostly visitation to be altogether apocryphal   fr every man of common sense must be of the same opinion and yet have you known any person wholely free from such prejudices who made no distinction on this fantastical article between darkness and midday between a lonely charnel house and a full assembly   aut i have but they were men of exceeding strong nerves as also of exceedingly clear or exceedingly callous consciences which coming from opposite points equally met for the same purpose on this occasion  two travelers the one a man of piety the other a profligate met at a country inn just as night came upom them it was halontideeve the season in those days wherein the devils were said to keep high carnival and when all the inhabitants of the visionary regions were supposed to revel and range throughout the earth at pleasure  for want of better company our travelers made up an acquaintance and further cemented it by a jugg of good liquor the night was dark the girls of the house had new washed their smocks to be hung to the fire and turned by the ghostly resemblances of their sweethearts and the conversation in the kitchen ran on many an authentic narrative of specter and particularly on the man in gibbets who hung by the road and who was reported between twelve and one at midnight to descend from the gallows and take just three turns about the old barn  do you believe any of this droll stuff said the profligate i know not what to think answered his pious companion i find all the world in the same story and yet as the saying is i never saw any thing more frightful than myself as for my share said the profligate i think i shouldnt fear the great devil himself and indeed i should be glad to have a little chat with the old gentleman stout as you are rejoined his companion i will lay you a bett of five crowns that you dare not warm a porringer of broth and go and offer it without there to the man in gibbets i will depend on your honor for performance of articles it is done cried the other the betts were produced and respectively deposited in the hands of my landlady  our pious traveller who now began to be alarmed for his wager stole slily out while his companion was busied in heating the broth he made up to the place where the deceased malefactor was taking the fresh air the gallows was low and by the advantage of a bank behind and his own agility he leaped up and fastened his arms about the shoulders of the corpse so that they both appeared but as one body  he had just fixed himself to his mind when up comes his companion with the porringer and a stool he directly mounted the stool and reaching up a spoonful of broth to the mouth of the dead with a firm and bold voice he cried sup man why dont you sup  scarce had these words been uttered when fearful to hear with a tone deep as hell and dismal as the grave the man in gibbets replied  it i  is too ho  ot and damn you why dont you blow it then rejoined the other   fr my nerves will not admit of this for fact the tale indeed is good though such an instance of intrepidity in any mortal may be disputable but shall we never return to our story again   aut it matters not how far we travel from it since the magic of a wish can bring us back in a twinkling   chap iv ruffled linen laced hat silk stockings etc had now been ordered for harry with a new suit of clothes trimmed like those of your beauinsects vulgarly called butterflies they were tried on in the presence of his parents and highly approved by all except harry himself who seemed by his fidgettings to be somewhat disgusted at this new kind of encumbrance harry says my lord puts me in mind of the son of jesse in the armor of saul he has not yet proved them well harry how do you like yourself i dont know not i says harry but papa can you tell me what these things are for in truth harry you pose me will not people love me better sir not a whit indeed harry replied my lord l  d help that little fools head of thine interposed my lady if people will not love thee they will respect thee the more fools head repeated my lord upon my soul the child has more sense than half our nobility  harry had been now near a month with his parents and as his nurse had not yet parted he was tolerably amenable to quality government however he pined in the absence of his dada as he called him and daily importuned my lord and lady to be permitted to go and see him for as harrys heart told him that his bearded dada loved him better than all the world so harry loved him better than three worlds for he was ever desirous of going three times as far in affection and good offices as any one went for him  at length he obtained consent and was conducted by his nurse in all his finery on a visit to this dear dada  their meeting was accompanied by tears of joy on both sides when the old gentleman struck with concern at the garb in which he saw his darling cried out and who my dear put this fools coat upon my child fools coat sir says harry yes my love it is worse than all that they were very naughty doctors who have endeavored to poison my boy there is not a bit of all this lace and ruffling that is not full of rank poisons i will tell you a story my harry  there was once upon a time a very good and a very clever boy called hercules as he grew up beside his prayers and his book he was taught to run and leap to ride wrestle and cudgel and though he was able to beat all the boys in the parish he never used to hurt or quarrel with any of them he did not matter cold nor hunger nor what he eat nor what he drank nor how nor where he lay and he went always dressed in the skin of a wild beast that could bear all winds and weathers and that he could put on or off at pleasure for he knew that his dress was no part of himself and could neither add to him nor take away any thing from him  when this brave boy came to mans estate he went about the world doing good in all places helping the weak and feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and comforting those that cried and beating all those that did hurt or wrong to others and all good people loved him with their whole hearts and all naughty people feared him terribly  but o sad and dismal a lady whom he had saved from great hurt and shame made him a present of a new coat which was called a shirt in those days as they wore it next the skin and now my harry take notice the lady had covered this coat all over with laces and with rufflings and with beads of glass and such other fooleries so that poor hercules looked just as fine as you do now and he turned him to this side and he turned him to that side and he began to think more and better of himself because he had got this fools coat upon him and the poison of it entered into his body and into his mind and brought weakness and distempers upon the one and the other and he grew so fond of it that he could not bear to have it put off for he thought that to part with it would be to part with his flesh from his bones neither would he venture out in the rain any more nor box nor wrestle with any body for fear of spoiling his fine coat so that in time he lost the love and the praises of every body and all people scorned him and pointed at him for a fool and a coxcomb as he went by  for some time after the old gentleman had finished his story the child continued to gaze up at him with fixed eyes and open mouth as fearful of losing any syllable that he might utter till recollecting himself he cried out o this is a very sad case indeed i wish my coat was burnt so i do but dont fear for me dada why how then harry replied his patron why i may find a trick for all this dada i warrant you never see me in this ugly coat again  after this and some other instructions and mutual endearments nurse pressed to be gone and these two fond friends were compelled to sunder with a promise on harrys part of a speedy return  for some time after his arrival at the mansion house harry appeared thoughtful and greatly dejected which they ascribed to his parting with his old friend but harry had schemes in his head that they were little able to fathom or guess at having peeped about for some time he found a knife in a window which he instantly seized upon and then stole up with all possible privacy to his apartment  there he stripped himself in a hurry and falling as quickly to work began to cut and rip and rend away the lacings of his suit without sparing cloth or seam while he was thus in the heat and very middle of his business he heard himself repeatedly called on the stairs and hurrying on his clothes to obey the summons he ran down to the parlour with half the trimmings hanging in geometry fritters and tatters about him  the droll and very extraordinary figure that he cut struck all the company into utter amazement having gazed on him for some time in a kind of silent stupor why harry cries my lady what is all this for who abused you my child who put you in this pickle come hither and tell me who spoiled your clothes i did madam you did sirrah cried my lady giving him a shake and how dare you spoil them why because they wanted to spoil me said harry and who told you they would spoil you sirrah i will not tell said harry i will lay a wager cried my lady it was that old rogue with the beard but i will have him whipped for a fool and a knave out of the parish pray my dear be patient a little said his lordship come here harry and tell me the truth stoutly and no harm shall happen to you or your dada with the beard come speak what fault did he find with your clothes why sir he said as how they would poison me poison you my dear pray how was that why sir he told me as how there was a little master called herclus and as how he was a mighty good boy and was cold and hungry and almost naked and did not matter so as how he could do good to every body and as how every body loved him with all their heart and then he told me as how he got a mighty fine coat and looked here and looked there and minded nothing but his coat and as how his coat poisoned him and would not let him do any more good and as how all the boys then hated him and pissed upon him sir  and as how  i believe that is all sir   here my lord and lady took such a chink of laughing that it was some time before they could recover while harry looked abashed and disconcerted but my lord recollecting himself took the child on his knee and warmly pressing him to his bosom i must tell you my harry said he as how you are a mighty good boy and as how your dada with a beard is a mighty good dada and has told you all that is right and true and that i will go myself one of these days and thank him in person thank you sir says harry  well harry said my lord i promise that no one shall poison you any more with my consent whereupon another new suit was immediately appointed of a kind that should fear no weather nor in case of dirt or damage draw upon harry the resentment or admonitions of his mama  just as dinner was served up mr meekly entered and took his seat he came in order to conciliate a late difference between the earl and sir standish stately and in this he found no manner of difficulty as my lord was by nature of a kindly disposition and required no more than a first advance to be reconciled to any man  during the entertainment harry kept his eyes fixed on mr meekly and as soon as the cloth was off he rose went over to him looked fondly in his face and took hold of his hand with the familiarity of an old acquaintance  mr meekly said my lord my son harry pays you a very particular and very deserved compliment he puts me in mind of that sort of instinct by which a strange dog is always sure to discover and to apply to the most benevolent person at table indeed my lord said mr meekly caressing the child i know not whether by instinct or by what other name to call my own feelings but certain it is that the first moment i saw him in his little peasant petticoats i found my heart strongly affected toward him  in a short time my lady retired with the children and left the earl and mr meekly over a temperate bottle mr meekly said my lord taking him cordially by the hand i rejoice at the advantage of our late acquaintance or rather i repine that it was not earlier i am greatly interested sir in asking you a few questions if i thought i might do it without offense are you any way straitened in your circumstances  no my lord  but would you not wish them more affluent would you not wish that your power of doing good were more extensive more answerable to the benevolence of your own inclinations  i cannot say that i would my lord i have upward of seven hundred a year clear income and that is fourteen times more than i have occasion to expend  it would be indelicate replied the earl very indelicate to own that i am sorry for your prosperity and yet i feel that i should have been happy in your distress in the power it would have given me to serve to oblige you i want a friend i want just such a friend as mr meekly and i know of no price at which i would not gladly purchase him  my lord i am yours freely affectionately yours without fee or condition sir rejoined my lord as i find that i cannot make out a title to your particular attachment i am content to be taken into the general circle of your benevolence  the world mr meekly think me the happiest of men blessed in my family in my friends with health honors affluence with the power of gratifying every wish that human fancy can form but alas my sensations are very far from affirming their judgment of these matters and i will deserve your advice your consolation if you can afford it by unbosoming myself to you without reserve  when i reflect on my past life i look on many parts of it with repentance and on the whole with regret not that i wish the return of pleasures that i now despise or of years spent in a manner that virtue and common sense must equally disapprove but i am arrived at my evening of life like a sportsman who having been in pursuit of game all the day returns homeward sorrowful satigued and disappointed with every advantage that could gratify either my vanity or my appetites i cannot affirm that i ever tasted of true enjoyment and i now well perceive that i was kept from being miserable merely by amusement and dissipation  as i had the misfortune to be born to title and a vast estate all people respected in me the possession of those objects which they themselves were in pursuit of i was consequently beset with sycophants and deceivers of all sorts and thereby trained from my infancy to unavoidable prejudices errors and false estimates of every thing i was not naturally illdisposed but i was perpetually seduced from all my better tendencies  both my parents died before i arrived at those years wherein our laws allow of any title to discretion i had but the one brother o that dear brother how many sighs he has cost me i was older than him by about seven years and this disparity of our age together with the elevating notion of my birthright gave me the authoritative airs of a father without a fathers tenderness toward him this mutually prevented that cordiality that sympathy as i may say by which brothers should be cemented during their minority and when our guardian as i then judged had so far betrayed his trust as to bind my brother apprentice to a trader and thereby to deprive him of all title to gentility i looked upon him as a branch cut off from the familytree and as my thoughts about him were accompanied by coldness or disgust i forbore to make any enquiry concerning him  i am apt to think however that he was not equally unnatural on his part but hearing of the dissolute life i led on my return from travel he might justly deem me unworthy of his acquaintance or notice  during the time of my intimacy with his late majesty and the ministers of his pleasures and policy a servant brought me word that a gentleman attended by a number of the principal citizens waited for me in my antechamber whereupon i gave orders for their immediate introduction  on their entrance i was awfully struck with the presence of their principal with the elegance of his figure the nobleness of his aspect and ease of his address and i felt myself drawn to him by a sudden kind of instinctive attachment  my lord says he we come to wait upon you in the name of the very respectable body of the citizens of london some infringements have been lately made on their citycharter and their first application is to your lordship as they wish above all others to be obliged to you for their redress  they have been very discreet said i in their choice of an advocate their demands must be exorbitant if they fail of success while you are their solicitor  this paper proceeded he contains a clear detail of their rights and the encroachments that have been made thereon they are sensible of your lordships interest with his majesty and the ministry and they humbly petition for your favor and happy influence in their behalf  without papers i replied or any inducement save that of your own request let me but know what i am to do and i shall think myself truly honored and obliged by your commands  my lord he rejoined i do not wish to betray you into any mistaken or unmerited complaisance i am but a trader a citizen of the lower order  i now felt myself blush with shame and disappointment i resented my being deceived by the dignity of his appearance and i was more particularly piqued by the sarcastical kind of smile with which he closed his declaration all confused i looked down and pretended to cast my eye over the paper in order to gain time for recollection having at intervals muttered a few words such as charters grants privileges immunities and so forth i am not said i an enemy to the lower ranks of men poor people must live and their service as well as subordination is necessary to society but i confess i was always fond of those sumptuary laws that confined the degrees of men to their respective departments and prevented mechanics from confounding themselves with gentlemen  my lord says he with the most easy and provoking unconcern when you shall be pleased to look down from the superiority of your station and to consider things and persons according to their merits you will not despise some merely for being of use to others the wealth prosperity and importance of all this world is founded and erected on three living pillars the tiller of the ground the manufacturer and the merchant of these the tiller is supposed to be the least respectable as he requires the least of genius invention or address and yet the plowman triptolemus was worshipped as a god and the plowman cincinnatus is still held in as high esteem as any peer of any realm save that of great britain  i have known said i a mob of such gods and dictators somewhat dangerous at times i must be free to tell you mister that matters are much changed since princesses kept sheep and the sons of kings were cowherds the ranks and orders of men are now appointed and known and one department must not presume to break in upon the other my baker barber brewer butcher hatter hosier and tailor are unquestionably of use though i have not the honor of being acquainted with one of them and hitherto i have deemed it sufficient to send my servants to entertain and pay them their bills without admitting them to a tete a tete as at present  he now rejoined with a little warmth my lord we pardon your indelicacy in consideration of your error the venerable body now present might be admitted to a tete a tete with the first estate of this kingdom without any condescension on the part of majesty and would you allow yourself to be duly informed i should soon make you sensible that we have actually done you the honor which we intended by this visit  permit me to repeat that the wealth prosperity and importance of every thing upon earth arises from the tiller the manufacturer and the merchant and that as nothing is truly estimable save in proportion to its utility these are consequently very far from being contemptible characters the tiller supplies the manufacturer the manufacturer supplies the merchant and the merchant supplies the world with all its wealth it is thus that industry is promoted arts invented and improved commerce extended superfluities mutually vended wants mutually supplied that each man becomes a useful member of society that societies become further of advantage to each other and that states are enabled to pay and dignify their upper servants with titles rich revenues principalities and crowns  the merchant above all is extensive considerable and respectable by his occupation it is he who furnishes every comfort convenience and elegance of life who carries off every redundance who fills up every want who ties country to country and clime to clime and brings the remotest regions to neighborhood and converse who makes man to be literally the lord of the creation and gives him an interest in whatever is done upon earth who furnishes to each the product of all lands and the labors of all nations and thus knits into one family and weaves into one web the affinity and brotherhood of all mankind  i have no quarrel i cried to the high and mighty my lords the merchants if each could be humbly content with the profits of his profession without forming themselves into companies exclusive of their brethren our itinerant merchants and pedlars i confess myself an enemy to the monopolies of your charterd companies and city corporations and i can perceive no evil consequence to the public or the state if all such associations were this instant dissolved  permit me he mildly replied once for all to set your lordship right in this matter i am sensible that the gentlemen of large landed properties are apt to look upon themselves as the pillars of the state and to consider their interests and the interests of the nation as very little beholden or dependent on trade though the fact is that those very gentlemen would lose nine parts in ten of their yearly returns and the nation nine tenths of her yearly revenues if industry and the arts promoted as i said by commerce did not raise the products of lands to tenfold their natural value the manufacturer on the other hand depends on the landed interest for nothing save the material of his craft and the merchant is wholely independent of all lands or rather he is the general patron thereof i must further observe to your lordship that this beneficent profession is by no means confined to individuals as you would have it large societies of men nay mighty nations may and have been merchants when societies incorporate for such a worthy purpose they are formed as a foetus within the womb of the mother a constitution within the general state or constitution their particular laws and regulations ought always to be conformable to those of the national system and in that case such corporations greatly conduce to the peace and good order of cities and large towns and to the general power and prosperity of the nation  a nation that is a merchant has no need of an extent of lands as it can derive to itself subsistence from all parts of the globe tire was situated in a small island on the coast of phaenicia and yet that single city contained the most flourishing opulent and powerful nation in the universe a nation that long withstood the united forces of the three first monarchies brought against her by nebuchadnezar and alexander the great  the seven united provinces do not contain lands sufficient for the subsistence of one third of their inhabitants but they are a nation of merchants the world furnishes them with an abundance of all good things by commerce they have arrived at empire they have assumed to themselves the principality of the ocean and by being lords of the ocean are in a measure become the proprietors of all lands  should england ever open her eyes to her own interests she will follow the same prosperous and ennobling profession she will conform to the consequences of her situation she will see that without a naval preeminence she cannot be safe and without trade that her naval power cannot be supported her glory will also flow from this sure source of her interests and a sailyard will become the highest scepter of her dignity she will then find that a single triumph of her flag will be more available for her prosperity than the conquest of the four continents that her preeminence by sea will carry and diffuse her influence over all lands and that universal influence is universal dominion  avarice my lord may pile robbery may plunder new mines may be opened hidden treasures may be discovered gamesters may win cash conquerors may win kingdoms but all such means of acquiring riches are transient and determinable while industry and commerce are the natural the living the never failing fountains from whence the wealth of this world can alone be taught to flow  and can you cried i have the effrontery to insinuate a preference of yourself and your fellow cits to our british nobles and princes who derive their powers and dignities from the steadfast extent of their landed possessions was it by barter and bargain that our edwards and henrys achieved their conquests on the continent or was it by pedlars and mechanics think you that the fields of cressi of poictiers and agincourt are rendered immortal go i continued seek elsewhere for redress of your insignificant grievances we give little to sturdy beggars but nothing to saucy rivals  wholely kindled by this invective he cast on me a fierce and menacing regard and with a severe accent and a side glance that shot fire when courtiers says he acquire commonsense and that lords shall have learned to behave themselves like gentlemen i may do such a one the honor to acknowledge him for a brother  your brother exclaimed mr meekly your brother my lord  yes mr meekly my brother my amiable my very amiable and honorable brother indeed but turning contemptuously from me he instantly departed with his attending citizens  i ought to have followed i ought to have staid him i should have fallen upon his neck with my tears and carresses i should have wrung a pardon from him and not have suffered him to leave me till by my submissons i had obtained full forgiveness this indeed was my first emotion but the recollection of my long and unnatural neglect my utter disregard of his person and concerns now aggravated by my late insults persuaded me that a reconciliation on his part was impossible  i remained disconcerted and greatly disturbed i felt with what pride and transport i should now have acknowledged have courted have clasped this brother to my bosom but my fancy represented him as ice in my arms as shrinking and turning from me with disgust and disdain at times i formed a hundred schemes toward recovering his affections but again rejecting these as ineffectual i endeavored to console myself for his loss by considering his late demeanor as exceeding faulty and expressive of a disposition insufferably proud and overbearing my heart indeed acknowledged how very lovely he was in his person but the superiority of his talents and the refinement of his manners gave him a distinction that was not altogether so grateful  all day i kept my apartment in displeasure at my brother myself and the world the next morning i was informed that the moment he left me he went to the minister who engaged at his instance to have every grievance that he complained of redressed to their extent that the minister had afterward introduced him to his majesty in full levee that the king held him in long and familiar conversation and that all the court was profuse of their admiration and praises of mr clinton  this also was fresh matter of triumph to him and mortification to me it was now evident that my brothers application to me was intended merely to do me peculiar honor and in return said i to myself i have endeavored to cover him with confusion and disgrace yet when i understood that he had disdained to mention me as his brother or of his blood i also scorned to derive luster from any claim of affinity with him and i further felt that i could not forgive him the reproaches which he constrained me to give myself in his behalf  from that time i took great pains to dissipate or suppress those uneasy sensations which the remembrance of him gave me but after i had married and retired from the glare and bustle of the world and more particularly on the birth of my first child when my heart had entered into a new sphere of domestic feelings this dear brother returned with double weight upon my mind yet his idea was no longer accompanied by envy or resentment but by an affectionate and sweet though paining remorse  i wrote him a letter full of penitential submissions and of tender and atoning prayers for pardon and reconcilement but alas my messenger returned with tidings that some years past he had withdrawn from trade had retired to france or holland had dropped all correspondence and that no one in england knew whether he was dead or alive  ah my brother my dear brother i would often repeat to myself has any reverse of fortune happened to you my brother perhaps some domestic calamity some heavy distress no doubt and no brother at hand to console or share your afflictions return to me divide my heart divide my fortune with me and mine alas wretch that i am you know not yet that you have a brother one deserving of that name you know not that this bosom of flint is now humanized and melted down in the fervor of affection toward you you hate me you despise me my amiable brother how how shall i make you sensible that my heart is full of your image of esteem of tenderest love for my lovely harry clinton  i again sent other messengers in search of intelligence i procured letters to the bankers and merchants of principal note abroad but all my solicitudes and enquiries were equally fruitless  the grief that this occasioned first taught me to reflect and cast a shade over the luster of every object about me the world no more appeared as that world which formerly had held out happiness to either hand i no longer beheld it through the perspectives of curiosity or youthful desire i had worn out all its gayeties i had exhausted all its delights for me it had nothing more to promise or bestow and yet i saw no better prospect no other resource  should i turn to religion a little observation taught me that the devotees themselves were warm in pursuit of objects of which i was tired that they were still subject to the passions and desires of the world and were no way to be distinguished from other men save by an unsociable reserve or gloomy cast of countenance  may i venture to confess to you mr meekly that at times of my despondence i dared to call the justice and wisdom of omnipotence into question take this world said i to myself consider it as it seems to stand independent of any other and no one living can assign a single end or purpose for which it could be made men are even as their fellowinsects they rise to life exert their lineaments and flutter abroad during the summer of their little season then droop die away and are succeeded and succeeded in an insignificant rotation even the firmest human establishments the best labored systems of policy can scarce boast a nobler fate or a longer duration the mightiest states and nations perish like individuals in one leaf we read their history we admire their achievements we are interested in their successes but proceed to the next and no more than a name is left the ninevehs and babylons of asia are fallen the sparta and athens of greece are no more and the monuments that promised to endure to eternity are erased like the mount of sand which yesterday the children cast up on the shore  when i behold this stupendous expanse so sumptuously furnished with a profusion of planets and luminaries revolving in appointed courses and diversifying the seasons i see a work that is altogether worthy of a god again when i descend to earth and look abroad upon the infinite productions of nature upon provisions so amply answering to the wants of every living being and on objects and organs so finely fitted to each other i trace a complicated maze of wisdom bounty and benevolence but when i see all these beauties and benefits counteracted by some adverse and destructive principle when the heavens gather their clouds and roll their thunders above and the earth begins to quake and open beneath us when the air that seemed so late to be the breath and balm of life grows pregnant with a variety of pests plagues and poisons when life itself is found to be no other than the storehouse or habitation of death and that all vegetable and animal systems include within their frame the principles of inevitable distemper and dissolution when additional to all these natural mischiefs i consider the extent and empire of moral evil upon earth when i behold the wretched perishable short lived animal called man for the value of some matter of property as transient as himself industrious and studious of the destruction of his species when not content with the evils that nature has entailed upon him man exerts all his talents for multiplying and speeding the means of perdition to man when i see half the world employed in pushing the other half from the verge of existence and then dropping after in an endless succession of malevolence and misery i cannot possibly reconcile such contrasts and contradictions to the agency or even permission of the one over ruling principle of goodness called god  could not omniscience foresee such consequences at creation unquestionably said mr meekly  might he not have ordered matters so as to have prevented the possibility of any degree of natural or moral evil in his universe  i think he might my lord  why did he not then prevent them to what end could he permit such multiplied malevolence and misery among his creatures  for ends certainly my lord infinitely worthy both of his wisdom and his goodness  i am desirous it should be so but cannot conceive cannot reach the way or means of compassing such an intention  can you not suppose said mr meekly that evil may be admitted for accomplishing the greater and more abundant good may not partial and temporary malevolence and misery be finally productive of universal durable and unchangeable beatitude may not the universe even now be in the pangs of travail of labor for such a birth such a blessed consummation  it were rejoined the earl as our shakespeare says it were indeed a consummation devoutly to be wished but might not omnipotence have brought about a consummation equally good without any intervention of preceding evil  had that been possible my lord it would unquestionably have been effected but if certain relations arise between god and his creatures and between man and man which could not arise save on the previous supposition of evil without which indeed neither the attributes of god himself nor the insufficiency dependence or obligation of the creature could have been duly discoverable throughout eternity then temporary evil becomes indispensably necessary to the consequence and consummation of the greatest good  your notion exclaimed the earl is great amazing truly glorious and every way worthy of a god who in such a case would be infinitely worthy of all worship is this the reason mr meekly that what we all so earnestly seek for is no where to be found that no portion or taste of happiness is to be had upon earth  i do not say so my lord i think that a man even on earth may be occasionally nay durably and exceedingly happy  what happy durably exceedingly happy repeated the earl i was told that the experience of ages that philosophy and even divinity had agreed with solomon in this that all upon earth was vanity and vexation of spirit if any may enjoy happiness on this side of the great consummation that you speak of i am persuaded mr meekly that you yourself are the man your lips indeed say nothing of the matter but neither your eyes nor your aspect can restrain the expression of some extraordinary peace that abides within o say then my dear my estimable friend whence how by what means may a man arrive at happiness  by getting out of himself my lord  out of himself mr meekly you astonish me greatly a contradiction in terms unnatural impossible  god himself my lord cannot make a man happy in any other way either here or hereafter  it is said the earl an established maxim among all thinking men whether divines or philosophers that selflove is the motive to all human actions virtue forbid exclaimed mr meekly all actions are justly held good or evil base or honorable detestable or amiable merely according to their motives but if the motive is the same to all there is an end at once to the possibility of virtue the cruel and the kind the faithful and the perfidious the prostitute and the patriot are confounded together  do not all men returned the earl act agreeable to their own propensities and inclinations do they not act so or so merely because it pleases them so to act and is not this pleasure the same motive in all  by no means my lord it never was nor can be the motive in any we must go a question deeper to discover the secret principle or spring of action one man is pleased to do good another is pleased to do evil now whence is it that each is pleased with purposes in their nature so opposite and irreconcilable because my lord that the propensities or motives to action in each are as opposite and irreconcilable as the actions themselves the one is prompted and therefore pleased with his purpose of doing evil to others through some base prospect of interest redounding to himself the other is prompted and spurred and therefore pleased with his purpose of endangering his person or suffering in his fortune through the benevolent prospect of the good that shall thereby redound to others  pleasure is itself an effect and cannot be the cause or pinciple or motive to any thing it is an agreeable sensation that arises in any animal on its meeting or contemplating an object that is suited to its nature as far as the nature of such an animal is evil evil objects can alone affect it with pleasure as far as the nature of such an animal is good the objects must be good whereby its pleasures are excited  when damon was sentenced by dionysius of syracuse to die on such a day he prayed permission in the interim to retire to his own country to set the affairs of his disconsolate family in order this the tyrant intended most peremptorily to refuse by granting it as he conceived on the impossible conditions of his procuring some one to remain as hostage for his return under equal forfeiture of life pythias heard the conditions and did not wait for an application on the part of damon he instantly offered himself to durance in the place of his friend and damon was accordingly set at liberty  the king and all his courtiers were astonished at this action as they could not account for it on any allowed principles selfinterest in their judgment was the sole mover of human affairs and they looked on virtue friendship benevolence love of country and the like as terms invented by the wise to impose upon the weak they therefore imputed this act of pythias to the extravagance of his folly to the defect of head merely and no way to any virtue or good quality of heart  when the day of the destined execution drew near the tyrant had the curiosity to visit pythias in his dungeon having reproached him for the romantic stupidity of his conduct and rallied him some time on his madness in presuming that damon by his return would prove as great a fool as himself my lord said pythias with a firm voice and noble aspect i would it were possible that i might suffer a thousand deaths rather than my friend should fail in any article of his honor he cannot fail therein my lord i am as confident of his virtue as i am of my own existence but i pray i beseech the gods to preserve the life and integrity of my damon together oppose him ye winds prevent the eagerness and impatience of his honorable endeavors and suffer him not to arrive till by my death i have redeemed a life a thousand times of more consequence more estimation than my own more estimable to his lovely wife to his precious little innocents to his friends to his country o leave me not to die the worst of deaths in my damon  dionysius was confounded and awed by the dignity of these sentiments and by the manner still more sentimental in which they were uttered he felt his heart struck by a slight sense of invading truth but it served rather to perplex than to undeceive him he hesitated he would have spoken but he looked down and retired in silence  the fatal day arrived pythias was brought forth and walked amidst the guard with a serious but satisfied air to the place of execution  dionysius was already there he was exalted on a moving throne that was drawn by six white horses and sat pensive and attentive to the demeanor of the prisoner  pythias came he vaulted lighty on the scaffold and beholding for some time the apparatus of his death he turned with a pleased countenance and addressed the assembly  my prayers are heard he cried the gods are propitious you know my friends that the winds have been contrary till yesterday damon could not come he could not conquer impossibilities he will be here tomorrow and the blood which is shed to day shall have ransomed the life of my friend o could i erase from your bosoms every doubt every mean suspicion of the honor of the man for whom i am about to suffer i should go to my death even as i would to my bridal be it sufficient in the mean time that my friend will be found noble that his truth is unimpeachable that he will speedily approve it that he is now on his way hurrying on accusing himself the adverse elements and the gods but i haste to prevent his speed executioner to your office  as he pronounced the last words a buzz began to arise among the remotest of the people a distant voice was heard the crowd caught the words and stop stop the execution was repeated by the whole assembly  a man came at full speed the throng gave way to his approach he was mounted on a steed of foam in an instant he was off his horse on the scaffold and held pythias straightly embraced  you are safe he cried you are safe my friend my beloved the gods be praised you are safe i now have nothing but death to suffer and i am delivered from the anguish of those reproaches which i gave myself for having endangered a life so much dearer than my own  pale cold and half speechless in the arms of his damon pythias replied in broken accents  fatal haste  cruel impatience  what envious powers have wrought impossibilities in your favor  but i will not be wholely disappointed  since i cannot die to save i will not survive you  dionysius heard beheld and considered all with astonishment his heart was touched his eyes were opened and he could no longer refuse his assent to truths so incontestably approved by their facts  he descended from his throne he ascended the scaffold live live ye incomparable pair he exclaimed ye have borne unquestionable testimony to the existence of virtue and that virtue equally evinces the certainty of the existence of a god to reward it live happy live renowned and o form me by your precepts as ye have invited me by your example to be worthy of the participation of so sacred a friendship  you bring your arguments quite home mr meekly said the earl the understanding cannot reject what the heart so sensibly feels my soul deeply acknowledges the existence of virtue with its essential and inherent difference from vice and this difference i acknowledge must as necessarily be founded in the difference of the principles from whence they proceed but what those principles are i know not and i am equally a stranger to what you intend by a mans getting out of himself in order to happiness what am i to understand by the term self mr meekly  every particle of matter my lord has a self or distinct identity inasmuch as it cannot be any other particle of matter now while it continues in this its state of selfishness or absolute distinction it is utterly useless and insignificant and is to the universe as though it were not it has however a principle of attraction analogous or answerable to desire in mind whereby it endeavors to derive to itself the powers and advantages of all other portions of matter but when the divine intelligence has harmonized certain quantities of such distinct particles into certain animal or vegetable systems this principle of attraction in each is overcome for each becomes attracted and drawn as it were from self each yields up its powers to the benefit of the whole and then and then only becomes capable and productive of shape coloring beauty flowers fragrance and fruits  be pleased now to observe my lord that this operation in matter is no other than a manifestation of the like process in mind and that no soul was ever capable of any degree of virtue or happiness save so far as it is drawn away in its affections from self save so far as it is engaged in wishing contriving endeavoring promoting and rejoicing in the welfare and happiness of others  it is therefore that the kingdom of heaven is most aptly and most beautifully compared to a tree bearing fruit and diffusing odours whose root is the principle of infinite benevolence and whose braches are the blessed members receiving consummate beatitude from the act of communication  i think indeed said the earl that i can form some sort of a notion of such a society in heaven but it would pose you mr meekly to exemplify your position from any body of men that ever were upon earth  pray pardon me my lord the states of sparta and rome derived their luster and power their whole preeminence and praise from this principle of communication which in them was called love of country but this beatifying principle was still more eminently instanced in the society of the church of jerusalem who had all things in common who imparted their possessions to all men as every man had need and thence did eat their common bread with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all people  you say my lord that you can form a notion of some such excellence in heaven but i can form no notion of any excellence more admirable in heaven itself than when a man in his present state of frail and depraved nature overbears his personal fears of pain and mortality and yields up his body to assured perdition for public good or for the sake of those whom it delights him to preserve  i shall pass over the instances of the roman regulus and the decii as also that of leonidas and his three hundred spartans who devoted their lives for the liberties of greece was that candidate less a hero who being rejected from being one of these selfdevoted exclaimed the gods be praised that there are three hundred in sparta better men than myself but i come nearer our own times and our own nation to exemplify this disregard of self the vital source and principle of every virtue in six mechanics or craftsmen of the city of calais  edward the third after the battle of cressy laid siege to calais he had fortified his camp in so impregnable a manner that all the efforts of france proved ineffectual to raise the siege or throw succors into the city the citizens however under the conduct of count vienne their gallant governor made an admirable defense day after day the english effected many a breach which they repeatedly expected to storm by morning but when morning appeared they wondered to behold new ramparts raised nightly erected out of the ruins which the day had made  france had now put the sickle into her second harvest since edward with his victorious army sat down before the town the eyes of all europe were intent on the issue the english made their approaches and attacks without remission but the citizens were as obstinate in repelling all their efforts  at length famine did more for edward than arms after the citizens had devoured the lean carcasses of their starved cattle they tore up old foundations and rubbish in search of vermin they fed on boiled leather and the weeds of exhausted gardens and a morsel of damaged corn was accounted matter of luxury  in this extremity they resolved to attempt the enemys camp they boldly sallied forth the english joined battle and after a long and desperate engagement count vienne was taken prisoner and the citizens who survived the slaughter retired within their gates  on the captivity of the governor the command devolved upon eustace saint pierre the mayor of the town a man of mean birth but of exalted virtue  eustace now found himself under the necessity of capitulating and offered to deliver to edward the city with all the possessions and wealth of the inhabitants provided he permitted them to depart with life and liberty  as edward had long since expected to ascend the throne of france he was exasperated to the last degree against these people whose sole valor had defeated his warmest hopes he therefore determined to take an exemplary revenge though he wished to avoid the imputation of cruely he answered by sir walter mauny that they all deserved capital punishment as obstinate traitors to him their true and natural sovereign that however in his wonted clemency he consented to pardon the bulk of the plebeians provided they would deliver up to him six of their principal citizens with halters about their necks as victims of due atonement for that spirit of rebellion with which they had enflamed the vulgar herd  all the remains of this desolate city were convened in the great square and like men arraigned at a tribunal from whence there was no appeal expected with beating hearts the sentence of their conqueror  when sir walter had declared his mesage consternation and pale dismay was impressed on every face each looked upon death as his own inevitable lot for how should they desire to be saved at the price proposed whom had they to deliver save parents brothers kindred or valiant neighbors who had so often exposed their lives in their defense to a long and dead silence deep sighs and groans succeeded till eustace st pierre getting up to a little eminence thus addressed the assembly  my friends we are brought to great straits this day we must either submit to the terms of our cruel and ensnaring conqueror or yield up our tender infants our wives and chaste daughters to the bloody and brutal lusts of the violating soldiery  we well know what the tyrant intends by his specious offers of mercy it will not satiate his vengeance to make us merely miserable he would also make us criminal he would make us contemptible he will grant us life on no condition save that of our being unworthy of it  look about you my friends and fix your eyes on the persons whom you wish to deliver up as the victims of your own safety which of these would ye appoint to the rack the axe or the halter is there any here who has not watched for you who has not fought for you who has not bled for you who through the length of this inveterate siege has not suffered fatigues and miseries a thousand times worse than death that you and yours might survive to days of peace and prosperity is it your preservers then whom you would destine to destruction you will not you cannot do it justice honor humanity make such a treason impossible  where then is our resource is there any expedient left whereby we may avoid guilt and infamy on the one hand or the desolation and horrors of a sacked city on the other there is my friends there is one expedient left a gracious an excellent a godlike expedient is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life let him offer himself an oblation for the safety of his people he shall not fail of a blessed approbation from that power who offered up his only son for the salvation of mankind  he spoke  but a universal silence ensued each man looked around for the example of that virtue and magnanimity in others which all wished to approve in themselves though they wanted the resolution  at length saint pierre resumed  it had been base in me my fellow citizens to propose any matter of damage to others which i myself had not been willing to undergo in my own person but i held it ungenerous to deprive any man of that preference and estimation which might attend a first offer on so signal an occasion for i doubt not but there are many here as ready nay more zealous of this martyrdom than i can be however modesty and the fear of imputed ostentation may withold them from being foremost in exhibiting their merits  indeed the station to which the captivity of lord vienne has unhappily raised me imparts a right to be the first in giving my life for your sakes i give it freely i give it cheerfully who comes next  your son exclaimed a youth not yet come to maturity  ah my child cried saint pierre i am then twice sacrificed  but no  i have rather begotten thee a second time  thy years are few but full my son the victim of virtue has reached the utmost purpose and goal of mortality who next my friends  this is the hour of heroes  your kinsman cried john daire your kinsman cried james wissant your kinsman cried peter wissant  ah exclaimed sir walter mauny bursting into tears why was i not a citizen of calais  the sixth victim was still wanting but was quickly supplied by lot from numbers who were now emulous of so ennobling an example  the keys of the city were then delivered to sir walter he took the six prisoners into his custody he ordered the gates to be opened and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the remaining citizens with their families through the camp of the english  before they departed however they desired permission to take their last adieu of their deliverers  what a parting what a scene they crowded with their wives and children about saint pierre and his fellow prisoners they embraced they clung around they fell prostrate before them they groaned they wept aloud and the joint clamor of their mourning passed the gates of the city and was heard throughout the camp  the english by this time were apprised of what passed within calais they heard the voice of lamentation and their souls were touched with compassion each of the soldiers prepared a portion of their own victuals to welcome and entertain the half famished inhabitants and they loaded them with as much as their present weakness was able to bear in order to supply them with sustenance by the way  at length saint pierre and his fellow victims appeared under the conduct of sir walter and a guard all the tents of the english were instantly emptied the soldiers poured from all parts and arranged themselves on each side to behold to contemplate to admire this little band of patriots as they passed they bowed down to them on all sides they murmured their applause of that virtue which they could not but revere even in enemies and they regarded those ropes which they had voluntarily assumed about their necks as ensigns of greater dignity than that of the british garter  as soon as they had reached the presence mauny says the monarch are these the principal inhabitants of calais they are says mauny they are not only the principal men of calais they are the principal men of france my lord if virtue has any share in the act of ennobling were they delivered peaceably says edward was there no resistance no commotion among the people not in the least my lord the people would all have perished rather than have delivered the least of these to your majesty they are selfdelivered selfdevoted and come to offer up their inestimable heads as an ample equivalent for the ransom of thousands  edward was secretly piqued at this reply of sir walter but he knew the privilege of a british subject and suppressed his resentment experience says he has ever shown that lenity only serves to invite people to new crimes severity at times is indispensably necessary to deter subjects into submission by punishment and example go he cried to an officer lead these men to execution your rebellion continued he addressing himself to saint pierre your rebellion against me the natural heir of your crown is highly aggravated by your present presumption and affront of my power  we have nothing to ask of your majesty said eustace save what you cannot refuse us  what is that  your esteem my lord said eustace and went out with his companions  at this instant a sound of triumph was heard throughout the camp the queen had just arrived with a powerful reinforcement of those gallant soldiers at the head of whom she had conquered scotland and taken their king captive  sir walter mauny flew to receive her majesty and briefly informed her of the particulars respecting the six victims  as soon as she had been welcomed by edward and his court she desired a private audience my lord said she the question i am to enter upon is not touching the lives of a few mechanics it respects a matter more estimable than the lives of all the natives of france it respects the honor of the english nation it respects the glory of my edward my husband my king  you think you have sentenced six of your enemies to death no my lord they have sentenced themselves and their execution would be the execution of their own orders not the orders of edward  they have behaved themselves worthily they have behaved themselves greatly i cannot but respect while i envy while i hate them for leaving us no share in the honor of this action save that of granting a poor and indispensable pardon  i admit they have deserved every thing that is evil at your hands they have proved the most inveterate and efficacious of your enemies they alone have withstood the rapid course of your conquests and have witheld from you the crown to which you were born is it therefore that you would reward them that you would gratify their desires that you would indulge their ambition and enwreath them with everlasting glory and applause  but if such a death would exalt mechanics over the fame of the most illustrious heroes how would the name of my edward with all his triumphs and honors be tarnished thereby would it not be said that magnanimity and virtue are grown odious in the eyes of the monarch of britain and that the objects whom he destines to the punishment of felons are the very men who deserve the praise and esteem of mankind the stage on which they should suffer would be to them a stage of honor but a stage of shame to edward a reproach to his conquests a dark and indelible disgrace to his name  no my lord let us rather disappoint the saucy ambition of these burghers who wish to invest themselves with glory at our expense we cannot indeed wholely deprive them of the merit of a sacrifice so nobly intended but we may cut them short of their desires in the place of that death by which their glory would be consummate let us bury them under gifts let us put them to shame with praises we shall thereby defeat them of that popular opinion which never fails to attend those who suffer in the cause of virtue  i am convinced you have prevailed be it so cried edward prevent the execution have them instantly before us  they came when the queen with an aspect and accents diffusing sweetness thus bespoke them  natives of france and inhabitants of calais ye have put us to vast expense of blood and treasure in the recovery of our just and natural inheritance but you acted up to the best of an erroneous judgment and we admire and honor in you that valor and virtue by which we are so long kept out of our rightful possessions  you noble burghers you excellent citizens though you were tenfold the enemies of our person and our throne we can feel nothing on our part save respect and affection for you you have been sufficiently tested we loose your chains we snatch you from the scaffold and we thank you for that lesson of humiliation which you teach us when you show us that excellence is not of blood of title or station that virtue gives a dignity superior to that of kings and that those whom the almighty informs with sentiments like yours are justly and eminently raised above all human distinctions  you are now free to depart to your kinsfolk your countrymen to all those whose lives and liberties you have so nobly redeemed provided you refuse not to carry with you the due tokens of our esteem  yet we would rather bind you to ourselves by every endearing obligation and for this purpose we offer to you your choice of the gifts and honors that edward has to bestow rivals for fame but always friends to virtue we wish that england were entitled to call you her sons  ah my country exclaimed saint pierre it is now that i tremble for you edward could only win your cities but philippa conquers hearts  brave saint pierre said the queen wherefore look you so dejected  ah madam replied saint pierre when i meet with such another opportunity of dying i shall not regret that i survived this day  here a long pause ensued at length the earl recollected himself mr meekly sais he you have now proved to me your position more effectually more convincingly than all the powers of ratiocination could possibly do while you related the story of those divine citizens i was imperceptibly stolen away and won entirely from self i entered into all their interests their passions and affections and was wrapped as it were into a new world of delightful sensibilites is this what you call virtue what you call happiness  a good deal of it my lord there are in nature but two kinds of self in other words there are but two sorts of wills in the universe the will of infinite wisdom of infinite benevolence going forth in beauty and beatitude on all creatures and the will of the creature desiring attracting envying coveting and rending all things from all to its own interest and advantage in the first will subsists all possible good from the second arises all possible evil and did not the first will in some measure inform and meliorate the second the will of every creature would be an ishmael his hand would be against every one and every ones hand against him and there would be nothing but strife and distraction hatred horror and misery throughout the creation  hence it follows that as there is but one will from eternity infinitely wise to discern what is best throughout the universe infinitely good to desire the accomplishment of what is best and infinitely powerful to put what is best in execution every will that is not informed by this one will must of necessity act in ignorance in blindness and error i will further affirm that every act of every will that is not informed by the one will of goodness must of equal necessity be the act of malevolence  i do not see the necessity of that replied the earl i well perceive that god can give to intelligent beings an existence or identity distinct from himself for i see that he has done it what should therefore prevent him from giving qualities as distinct from himself as the essence why might he not impart to any limited degree capacity discernment power wisdom and goodness might not such a being instantly perceive to a vast extent the relations of things with their several fitnesses and disagreements would he not consequently be enamoured of what was right and beautiful would he not act agreeable to such a just approbation and would not such actions be fitly accounted the act of virtue  at this instant a messenger arrived on the spur he brought word to mr meekly that his friend mr husbands was taken suddenly ill and earnestly requested to see him directly whereupon mr meekly who preferred any matter of charity to all other considerations immediately got up made a silent bow and vanished  to return to our hero as soon as he was new rigged he pressed for another visit to his patron who received him with accustomed tenderness but greatly wondered at his peasant dress nurse then recited to him the whole adventure of the fritterd robeings whereat the old gentleman in a manner devoured him with the eagerness of his caresses  when nurse and harry were departed he called to him his old domestic james says he with a tear yet standing in his eye i can no longer live without the company of this dear child hasten therefore the orders that i have already given you and let all things be in readiness for the first opportunity the domestic who had caught the filent habit of his master with a bow assented and retired  autumn was now advanced and lord dickey with his brother a number of little associates and an attending footman got leave to go to the copse a nutting as the children were perfectly acquainted with the way the servant desired to stay behind a while in order to provide hooks for pulling down the branches this was granted and forth they all issued in high chat and spirits  the copse lay at some distance on one side of the park behind the mansion house but when they had nearly approached the place of their destination harry missed a garter and promising speedily to rejoin his companions went back to seek it  in the mean time his associates on entering the wood met with another little posse of the village fry who were on their return one of whom carried a bag of nuts that seemed bulkier than the bearer so gentlemen says lord dickey where are you going why home where should we go says a little boor sullenly and pray what have you been doing says the lord guess says the boor is it nuts that you have got in that bag demanded the lord ask tomorrow answered the boor sirrah sais dickey a little provoked how dare you to come and pull nuts here without our leave why as for that master dickey replied the other i know you well enough and i wouldnt ask your leave an you were twenty lords not i sirrah says dickey i have a great mind to take your nuts from you and to give you as good a beating into the bargain as ever you got in your life as for that master dickey coolly answered the villager you must do both or neither here i lay down my nuts between us and now come any two of your watergruel regiment one down the other come on and if i dont give ye your belly fulls why then take my nuts and welcome to make up the want  this gallant invitation was accepted on the spot lord richard chose his companion in arms and both appeared quite flush and confident of victory for though neither of them had been versed in the gymnastic exercises they didnt want courage and they knew that the challenger was their inferior in strength and in years  but unhappily for these two champions of quality tommy truck their adversary had like harry been a bruiser from two years old and upward and was held in veneration as their leader and their chief by many who were his superiors in age and stature  lord richard began the assault but was down in a twinkling to him his friend succeeded but with no better fortune a swing or trip of tommys sent them instantly as alcides sent antaeus to gather strength from their motherearth and though these summer heroes like the young roman nobility at the battle of pharsalia were solely intent on defending their pretty faces from annoyance yet tommy at the third turn had bloodied them both  harry who was now on his return perceived the engagement and running up and rushing between the combatants interposed with a voice of authority and parted the fray  having enquired and duly informed himself of the merits of the case he first turned him to lord richard and said o brother dickey brother dickey you ought not to hinder poor boys from pulling a few dirty nuts what signifies em then turning to the challenger his old acquaintance tommy says he did you know that dickey was my brother yes says tommy rudely and what though of i did o nothing at all says harry but i want to speak with you tommy whereupon he took the conqueror under the arm and walked away with him very lovingly in all appearance looking about to take care that none of the boys followed him  mean time the little gentry threw out their invectives in profusion against our departed hero i think says one that master harry had as much to blame in tommy as lord dickey ay says another one would think he might as well have taken his brothers part as that blackguards indeed it was very naughty of him says a third for my part says a fourth i never will have any thing more to say to him  while thus they vilified their late friend he and his fellow champion walked arm in arm in a sullen and uninterrupted silence till coming to a small opening in a secreted part of the wood harry quitted his companion desired him to strip and instantly cast aside his own hat coat and waistcoat why should i strip says tommy to box says harry why should you box with me harry sure i didnt strike you says tom yes sir replied our hero you struck me when you struck dickey and knew that he was my brother nay harry cried tom if it is fight you are for i will give you enough of it i warrant you  tom was about eight months older than harry his equal in the practice of arms and much the stronger but harry was full as tall and his motions quicker than thought prevented the ward of the most experienced adversary  together they rushed like two little tigers at once they struck and parried and watching every open they darted their little fists like engines at each other but tom marking the quickness and feeling the smart of harrys strokes suddenly leapt within his arm bore him down to the earth and triumphantly gave him the first rising blow  harry rose indignant but warned by the strength of his adversary to better caution he now fought more aloof and as tom pressed upon him he at once guarded struck and wheeled like an experienced cock without quitting the pit of honor  tom finding himself wholely foiled by this parthian method of combat again rushed upon his enemy who was now aware of the shock they closed they grappled they caught each other by the shoulders joined head to head and breast to breast and stood like two pillars merely supported by their bearing against one another again they shifted the left arm caught each other about the neck and cuffed and punchd at face and stomach without mercy or remission till tom impatient of this length of battle gave harry a side swing and harry giving tom a trip at the same time they fell side by side together upon the earth  they rose and retreated to draw breath as by mutal consent they glared on one another with an eye of vindictive apprehension for neither of them could now boast of more optics than poliphemus and from their forehead to their shoes they were in one gore of blood  again they flew upon each other again they struck foined and defended and alternately pressed on and retreated in turns till harry spying an open darted his fist like a shot into the remaining eye of his enemy tom finding himself in utter darkness instantly sprung upon his foe and endeavored to grapple but harry with equal agility avoided the shock and traversing here and there beat his adversary at pleasure till tom cried out i yield i yield harry for i cannot see to fight any more  then harry took tom by the hand and led him to his clothes and having assisted him to dress he next did the same friendly office to himself then arm in arm they returned much more loving in reality than they set out having been beaten into a true respect and affection for each other  sometime before this the footman had joined his young lord with the several implements requisite for nutting they had already pulled down great quantities the young quality had stuffed their pockets and the little plebeians who had assisted were now permitted to be busy in gathering up the refuse when all turning at the cry of there is harry there is tom they perceived our two champions advancing leisurely but hand in hand as friends and brothers  they had left their clothes unbuttoned for the benefit of the cooling air and as they approached their companions were frozen into astonishment at the sight of their two friends all covered with crimson  they were neither able to advance to meet them nor to speak when they arrived till lord dickey first inquired into this bloody catastrophe and harry remaining wholely silent on the subject blind tommy cried out why master dickey the truth is that harry beat me because i beat you then dickey feeling a sudden gush of gratitude and affection rising up in his bosom looked wistfully on his brother and said with a plaintive voice o brother harry brother harry you are sadly hurt and turning about he began to weep most bitterly but harry said shaw brother dickey dont cry man i dont matter it of the head of a brass pin then turning to the footman with tom still in his hand he cried here john take that bag of nuts and poor blind tommy to my mammys and tell daddy that i desire him to see them both safe home  friend sir your hero is indeed a hero he must be every bodys hero   author sir you do him vast honor and i should be proud of your further instructions toward his supporting the dignity of the character you give him pray what are the ingredient qualities of which a hero is compounded what idea have you formed of such a personage tell me i beseech you what is a hero my good friend   fr pshaw  what a question  every fool knows that  a hero is  as though one should say  a man of high achievement  who performs famous exploits  who does things that are heroical  and in all his actions and demeanor is a hero indeed  why do you laugh  i will give you the instances approved throughout the world recorded and duly celebrated by poets painters sculptors statuaries and historians  there was the assyrian ninus the sesostris of egypt the cyrus of persia the alexander of greece the caesar of rome and partly in our own days there was the conde of france the charles of sweden and persias kouli kan  what the plague does the fellow laugh at   aut i am laughing to think what a blockhead themistocles was being asked whom he considered as the greatest of heroes not him who conquers but who saves replied themistocles not the man who ruins but the man who erects who of a village can make a city or turn a despicable people into a great nation   fr according to your notion of heroism that boor and barbarian peter alexiowitz of russia was the greatest hero that ever lived   aut true my friend for of a numerous people he disembruted every one except himself but then in all equity he ought to divide his glory with kate the washerwoman who humanized the man that humanized a nation   fr whom do you take to have been the greatest hero of antiquity   aut lycurgus without comparison the greatest of heroes and the greatest of legislators in those very early days the people of lacedaemon were extremely rude and ignorant they acknowledged no laws save the dictates of their own will or the will of their rulers lycurgus might have assumed the scepter but his ambition aspired to a much more elevated and durable dominion over the souls manners and conduct of this people and their posterity he framed a body of the most extraordinary institutions that ever enteredinto the heart or head of man next to those of our divine legislator they were intended to form a new creature he prevailed upon the rich to make an equal distribution of their lands with the poor he prohibited the use of all such money as was current among other nations and thereby prohibited the importation of the means and materials of pomp and luxury he enjoined them to feed in common on simple and frugal fare he forbid all gorgeousness of furniture and apparel in short he endeavored to suppress every sensual and selfish desire by injunctions of daily exercise toil and hardship a patient endurance of pain and a noble contempt of death at length feigning some occasion of being abroad for a season he exacted an oath from the lacedaemonians that they should strictly observe his laws without the smallest infringement till his return thus for the love of his country he went into perpetual banishment from it and he took measures at his death that his body should never be found lest it should be carried back to sparta and give his countrymen a color for dissolving their oath   fr laying peter aside who think you was the greatest hero among the moderns   aut to confess the truth among all that i have heard or read of the hero whom i most affect was a madman and the lawgiver whom i most affect was a fool   fr troth i believe you never would have been the writer you are at this day if you had not adopted somewhat of both the said qualities but come unriddle i beseech you where may this favorite hero and legislator be found   aut in a fragment of the spanish history

assure you but i perceive that you think i am drolling you dont suppose that you can ever be seriously of the same opinion yet if you demand of your own memory for what have the great heroes throughout history been renowned it must answer for mischief merely for spreading desolation and calamity among men how greatly how gloriously how divinely superior was our hero of the mancha who went about righting of wrongs and redressing of injuries lifting up the fallen and pulling down those whom iniquity had exalted in this his mavelous undertaking what buffettings what bruisings what tramplings of ribs what pounding of packstaves did his bones not endure mine ached at the recital but toil was his bed of down and the house of pain was to him a bower of delight while he considered himself as engaged in giving ease advantage and happiness to others if events did not answer to the enterprises of his heart it is not to be imputed to the man but to his malady for had his power and success been as extensive as his benevolence all things awry upon earth at the risque of his limbs and life would instantly have been set as straight as a cedar  but let me turn with reverence to kiss the hem of the robes of the most respectable of all governors and legislators sancho pansa what judgments what institutions how are minos and solon and the inspired of the goddess aegeria here eclipsed sancho thou wast a peasant thou wast illiterate thou wast a dunce for a man but an angel for a governor inasmuch as contrary to the custom of all other governors thou did not desire any thing thou did not wish for any thing thine eye was not bent to any thing save the good of thy people therefore thou could not stray thou had no other way to travel could aesops log have been moved to

pray you why has the world through all ages and nations universally ascribed heroism and glory to conquest   aut through the respect as i take it that they have for power man is by nature weak he is born in and to a state of dependence he therefore naturally seeks and looks about for help and where he observes the greatest power it is there that he applies and prays for protection now though this power should be exerted to his damage instead of defense it makes no alteration in his reverence for it he bows while he trembles and while he detests he worships in the present case it is with man as it is with god he is not so awful and striking he is not so much attended to in the sunshine and gentle dews of his providence and benignity as in his lightnings and thunders his clouds and his tempests  hero heroes and  in the three languages signify a demigod or one who is superior to mere man but how can this superiority or distinction be shown the serene acts of beneficence the small and still voice of goodness are neither accompanied by noise nor ostentation it is uproar and tumult rather the tumbling of sacked cities the shrieks of ravished matrons and the groans of dying nations that fill the trump of fame men of power and ambition find distinction and glory very readily attainable in this way as it is incomparably more easy to destroy than to create to give death than to give life to pull down than to build up to bring devastation and misery rather than plenty and peace and prosperity upon earth   fr were not mankind in this instance as blind to their own interests as they were iniquitous in giving glory where shame alone was due   aut in so doing they proved at once the dupes and the victims of their own folly praise a child for his genius in pranks of mischief and malevolence and you quicken him in the direct road to the gallows it is just so that this wise world has bred up its heroic reprobates by ascribing honor and acclamation to deeds that called loudy for infamy and the gibbet for the world was an ass from its very commencement and it will continue a dunderhead to the end  from the beginning of things a long time ago the joint invention of mankind has discovered but two methods of procuring sustenance on earth the first by the labor of their own hands the second by employing the hands of others  all therefore are excluded or at least ought to be excluded from such a world who refuse to labor or what is still worse who disturb and prevent the labor of others  among those who will not labor we may number all who have the happiness of being born to no manner of end such as the monks of every country the dervises of persia the bramins of india the mandarins of china and the gentlemen of these free and polished nations  these have nothing to do but to sleep it to wake it to eat it to drink it to dance it to doze it to riot it to roar it and to rejoice in the happy earnest which this world has given them of the jollities of the next  among those who disturb the labor of others i reckon all your rascally alexanders and caesars whether ancient or modern who in their fits of frenzy and folly scamper about breaking the lanterns and beating the watch of this world to the great amazement of women and terror of little children and who seem to think that heaven gave noses and heads for no end in nature but to be blooded and cracked in short i have no patience when i hear talk of these fellows i am not half so fretted when i hear my own works read  go on i request you it may happen to put me in temper   chap v the young gentlemen were now upon their return and as they approached the house they crowded about harry to keep him from being seen till he took an opportunity of slipping away and stealing up to his chamber he now grew stiff and sore and his nurse having got an intimation of what had happened hurried up to him and wept over him with abundant tears of cordial affection she strait undressed and put him to bed and having ordered some white wind whey of which she made him drink plentifully she also undressed and went to bed to him and harry casting his little arm about her neck and putting his head in her bosom was fast in a twinkling  by this john had returned from the execution of his commission he had been fully apprized by tommy on the road of all the circumstances relating to this bloody business and going to his lord and lady he gave them the whole detail occasionally dwelling and expatiating on harrys courage his prowess his honor and his generosity they could now no longer forbear indulging themselves with the sight of a child in whom they held themselves honored above all titles they stole gently up stairs and having got a peep at harry and observed that he was fast asleep they stole as softly back again each inwardly exulting in their glorious boy  our hero was scarce recovered from his wounds and bruises when on a day he met a little beggar boy at the halldoor half naked and whinging and shivering with cold his heart was instantly touched with wonted compassion and taking him by the hand what is your name my poor little boy says harry neddy sir says the child and where is your daddy and mammy o sir answered ned i have no daddy nor mammy in the world wide dont cry dont cry says harry i have several daddies and mammies and i will give you one or two of em but where did you leave your clothes neddy i havent any sir replied the child in a piteous accent well well it dont matter neddy for i have more clothes too says harry so taking him again by the hand he led him up to his apartment without being perceived of any and helping him to strip he ran to his closet for the shirt which he had last thrown off and put it on the new comer with equal haste and delight he next ran for the entire suit that his bearded dada had given him and having helped and shown him how to put on the breeches he drew on the stockings and shoes with his own hands to these succeeded the coat and waistcoat and ned was now full as well rigged as his benefactor  never had our hero enjoyed himself so highly as while he was thus employed when he had finished his operations he chuckled and smiled turned ned round and round walked here and there about him and was as proud of him as if he had been wholely of his own making  he now again became thoughtful forecasting in his mind the particulars that might further be requisite for the accommodation of his guest for he was grown too fond of him to think of parting suddenly he then recollected an adjoining lumberroom and taking ned with him they found a little old mattress which with united strength they dragged forth and lodged in a convenient corner of the closet to this they added a pair of old blanketts and harry having spread them for neds repose in the best manner he was able asked his dependent if he was yet hungry yes very very hungry indeed sir cried ned no sooner said than harry flew down to the kitchen and looking about and spying a large porringer of milk and a luncheon of bread that one of the servants had provided for a young favorite of their own he seized upon them like a hawk and hastening again to his chamber delivered them to neddy who already had half devoured them with his eyes ned instantly fell to with the rapture of a cormorant or any rapture that can be supposed less than that of his friend harry who stood over him with the feelings of a parent turtle that feeds his young with the meat derived from his own bowels  for a few days harry kept his dependent shut up in his chamber or closet without the privity of any of the family except nurse to whom he had revealed the affair under the seal of the strictest secresy  but on a cross day susy the housemaid having entered with a new broom into our heros apartment perceived in a corner the tattered deposite of neds original robeings and lifting them at a cautious distance with a finger and thumb she perceived also as many other philosophers have done that there is no part of this globe which is not peopled with nations of animals if man had but attention and optics duly accommodated to the vision she dropped the living garment as though she had taken up a burning horse shoe and was instantly peopled by her prolific imagination with tribes of the same species from head to foot  in this fit of disgust susy happened unfortunately to step into the closet and spyed ned in a dark corner where he had squatted and drawn himself up to the size of a hedgehog she immediately flew at him like one of the eumenides and dragged him forth to the light as hercules is said to have haled cacus from his den she questioned him with a voice of implacable authority and ned with humble and ingenuous tears confessed the whole adventure but susy no way melted exclaimed what sirrah have you and your master harry a mind to breed an affection in the house i will remit of no such doings for i have an utter conversion to beggarbrats and vermil she then commanded him to bundle up his old rags and driving him down stairs before her she dismissed him from the halldoor with a pair of smart boxes on each side of his head and ordered him never more to defend her sight  poor ned went weeping and wailing from the door when who should he see at about fifty paces distant but his beloved patron harry who had been cutting a switch from the next hedge to him he ran with precipitation harry touched with a compassion not free from resentment to see his favorite in tears demanded the cause of his apparent distress which ned truly related our hero thereupon became thoughtful and moody and judging that susy had not acted thus without authority he conceived a general disgust at a family who had treated him so injuriously in the person of his neddy but comforting his dependent the best he could come neddy says he dont cry my man i will bring you that i will to my own dear dada and he will welcome and love you for my sake then making his way through a small breach in the neighboring hedge he ordered ned to follow him and flew across the field like a bird of passage in a direct line to his patrons  the old gentleman saw him approaching and gave sign to his ancient domestic who withdrew with precipitation he received and caressed our hero with more than usual transport and who my dear says he is this pretty little boy that you have got with you harry then like the grecian demosthenes taking time to warm himself with the recollection of his own ideas and setting his person forth with an action and ardour that determined to prevail made the following oration  why dada i must tell you as how this poor little boy for he is a very poor little boy and his name is neddy sir and he has no friend in the wide world but you and i sir and so sir as i was telling you he comes to the door crying sadly for cold and hunger and he would have pitied every body for he had no clothes nor daddy nor mammy at all sir and i had a many of them and that was not fair you know sir and i was in the humor to give him all the dadas and mamas i had in the world except you sir and mammy nurse and so i takes him up stairs and i puts the clothes upon him that you gave me when i was a poor little boy sir for no body had to say to em but you and i sir and i knew that you would pity poor little neddy more than i pitied him myself sir and so dada they takes my poor little neddy to day and boxed him and beat him sadly and turned him out of doors and so i meets him crying and roaring and so you know sir as how i had nothing to do but to bring him to you sir or to stay and cry with him for company sir  here orator harry ceased to speak except by his tears which he could no longer restrain and which proceeded to plead most emphatically for him but his patron took him in his arms and kissed the drops from both eyes and said dont cry my darling for i am yours my harry and all that i have is yours and if you had brought a whole regiment of poor little neddies with you they should be all welcome to me for your sake my harry  then harry sprung up and caught his patron about the neck so that it was some time before the old gentleman could get loose but harry says he i am going just now to leave this country will you and your man neddy come along with me over the world wide dada says harry but where are you going sir i am going a begging harry o that will be brave sport says harry i will tell you what you shall do dada what is that my love why sir says harry you must get a great bag like the old man and little child that was at door tother day and neddy and i will beg for you sir and we will put all that we get into your great bag as that good little child did for his daddy without touching a bit though he was a hungry enough himself poor fellow i warant but dont let us go to beg to papas door sir for if you do they will box and beat us and drive us away as they did to poor little neddy to day sir  the old gentleman thereat had his countenance divided betwixt the rising tear and the bursting laugh but taking harry by the hand he said no no my heavenly creature i am not going to beg of any man living but to beg of god to pour down his full weight of blessings upon my harry and to endeavor to confirm them to him both here and hereafter by my care and instructions  having thus spoken he put a large cake into the hand of each of the children and causing them to drink a full glass of small white wind he took them into a back yard where a light coach with six horses and three servants ready mounted attended and having placed his young companions and seated himself between them away the coach drove at a sweeping gallop  about the time that our hero and his patron set out nurse went up stairs with a most bountiful cut of homebaked bread and butter for the amusement of the young caitiff whom she had left in the closet but not finding him there she hastily dropped her provinder on the first window she met and hurrying down to the kitchen earnestly enquired for the little beggarboy whom master harry had taken into his service at this question all the servants stood in silent amazement except susy who bridling up and assuming the whole importance of her station why nurse says she you mustnt oppose that i am come here to sweep and to clean after lousy little flagrants it was enough to breed an antagion that it was in the house so what magnifies many words i took the little dirty bastard and cuffd him out of doors you did hussy says nurse you dare to affront and vex my child my little man the honor and pride of all the family and so saying she ups with her brawny arm and gave susy such a douse on the side of the head as left her fast asleep for an hour and upward then running up stairs again she went searching and clamouring for her harry about the house in order to comfort and condole with him for his loss  dinner was now served up and the company seated and all the servants ran severally here and there repeatedly summoning master harry to attend but harry was out of hearing by many a mile when the cloth was removed nurse entered with an aspect half in tears and half distracted and exclaimed that her child was not to be found and what nurse says the earl do you think is become of him i hope my lord says she that he is either strayed to his daddy or to the dumb gentlemans then messengers were instantly dispatched to both houses who speedily returned with tidings that master harry had not been seen at his fosterfathers and that no one was at home at the house of the dumb gentleman  the business now became serious and alarming the whole house was in commotion and all the domestics and our heros loving nurse with lord dickey in her hand ran searching through the gardens the fields and the groves that resounded on all sides with the name of the absentee  on their return from a disquisition as fruitless as solicitous nurse declared her apprehensions that harry was gone off with a little favorite boy whom he had taken into service and whom the house maid that morning had beaten out of doors susy being nearly recovered and now called and questioned hereon was compelled to confess the fact though in terms less haughty and less elegant than usual when my lord looking sternly at her and who you strumpet he cried gave you authority to turn any one out of my house whom my noble and generous boy was pleased to bring in get you instantly away and never let me be so unhappy as to see that face again  by this time the whole village and neighborhood as well as this noble family were in trouble and alarms for the loss of their little favorite when a countryman entered in sweaty haste and desired without preface to be admitted to the earl my lord says he i think i can give you some news of your dear child as i was returning home on the london road i saw a coach and six driving toward me at a great rate and though it passed me in haste i marked that the gentleman with the beard was in it and that he had two children with him one on each hand though i had not time to observe their faces  here is something for your news said the earl it may be as you say  here john take a posse of the servants along with you go in haste to that mans house if no one answers break open the door and bring me word of what you can learn concerning him  john who was the house steward hurried instantly on his commission and finding all in silence after loud and repeated knockings he and his myrmidons burst open the door and rushing in ran up and down through all the apartments they found the house richly furnished a library of choice books above stairs a buffet full of massy plate and every thing in order as if prepared for the reception of a family of distinction at this they all stood astonished till john casting his eye toward a table in the street parlour perceived a paper which he hastily snatched up and found to be a letter duly folded and sealed and addressed to his lord exulting at this discovery he left some of the servants to watch the goods and hurried back with all possible speed to his master  my lord says john entering and striving to recover breath the dumb gentleman as they call him must be a main rich man for the very furniture of his house cannot be worth less than some thousands of pounds john then presented the letter which the earl hastily broke open and found to be as follows  my lord i am at length presented with an opportunity of carrying off your little harry the greatest treasure that ever parents were blessed with  the distress that i feel in foreseeing the affliction that his absence will cause to your whole family has not been able to prevail for the suspension of this enterprise as the childs interest and happiness outweighs with me all other considerations  permit me however to assure your lordship that our darling is in very safe and very affectionate hands and that it shall be the whole concern and employment of my life to render and to return him to you in due time the most accomplished and most perfect of all human beings  in the mean while your utmost search and enquiry after us will be fruitless i leave to your lordship my house and furniture as a pledge and assurance of the integrity of my intentions  and am etc   the mystery of our heros flight was now in a great measure unravelled but no one could form any rational conjecture touching the motive of the old gentlemans procedure in the case and all were staggered at his leaving such a mass of wealth behind him  as the falling on of a dark night rendered all pursuit for that time impracticable my lord ordered the servants to bed that they might rise before day and then to take every horse he had coachcattle and all and to muster and mount the young men of the village and to pursue after the fugitives by different roads according to the best likelihood or intelligence they might receive  in this hopeful prospect the house was again in some measure composed all except poor nurse who would not be comforted neither could be prevailed upon to enter in at the doors but all night on the cold stairs or rambling through the raw air continued clapping and wringing her hands and bewailing the irreparable loss of her harry  on the following day my lord ordered a minute inventory to be taken of all the furniture in the forsaken mansion house and further appointed harrys fosterfather with his family to enter into possession and to take care of the effects till such time as the proprietor should renew his claim  after three tedious days and as many expecting nights the posse that went in quest of our runaways returned all drooping and dejected most of them slowly leading their overspent horses and universally bespattered or covered with mire without any equivalent of comfortable tidings to balance the weight of their langour and fatigue  the happiness or wretchedness of human life as it should seem does not so much depend on the loss or acquisition of real advantage as on the fluctuating opinions and imaginations of men the absence of this infant who but a few months before had no manner of interest in the views affections or solicitudes of this noble family appeared now as the loss of all their honors and fortunes a general face of mourning seemed to darken every apartment and my lord and lady no more paid visits nor received public company they were however inventive in many contrivances for amusing and consoling their darling dickey but even this was to little purpose for he was often found silently languishing in corners or crying o where is my brother harry my own sweet brother harry shall i never see my own brother harry any more  my lord had already dispatched a multitude of circular letters to all his acquaintances with other notices throughout the kingdom containing offers of ample rewards for the recovery of his child but finding all ineffectual he caused advertisements to the same purpose to be repeatedly inserted in all the public papers as the same no doubt are still extant and may be found in the musty chronicles of those days  within a few weeks after the publishing of these advertisements my lord received a letter respecting his son harry that afforded great consolation to him and his lady insomuch that with the help of the lenient hand of time in less than the space of twelve months this noble family were restored to their former cheerfulness and tranquillity  but to return to the situation in which we left our hero the coach drove on at a round rate and the children continued in high glee and thought this kind of conveyance the finest sport imaginable  when they had entered a space on the first common the coachman looked about to take care that no one was in sight and turning to the right hand he held gently on till he came to another great road on which he drove at his former rate this he did again at the next common and coming to another road that led also to london and night now approaching he put up at the first great inn he came to  harrys patron had the precaution to keep his great coat muffled about his face so that no one could observe his beard till they were shown to a room and fire and candles were lighted up then his ancient friend and domestic having provided scissars and implements for shaving locked the door and set to work in the presence of the children  harry was all attention during the whole process and when the operation was quite completed he drew near to his patron with a cautious kind of jealousy and looking up to his face with the tears in his little eyes speak to me sir says he pray speak to me it is answered the old gentleman the only comfort of my life to be with you and to speak to you my harry the child hearing the well known voice of friendship immediately cleared again and reaching up his little arms to embrace his patron o indeed says he i believe you are my own dada still  though harry was now reconciled to the identity of his friend yet he felt a secret regret for the absence of his beard for he loved all and every part of him so entirely that the loss of a hair appeared a loss and a want to the heart of harry  after an early supper and two or three small glasses of wine per man this gentleman whom his servants had now announced by the name of mr fenton became all things in all with his young companions he delighted them with several entertaining tricks he put the point of a large needle to the edge of a drinking glass and then placing the center of a pewter plate on the top of the needle he began to turn it about with an increasing motion till it whirled round at a rapidity that was altogether joyous and amazing to the little spectators he next turned two plates with their faces to eachother and placing them on the brim of a large beerglass he put an egg upon the plates and giving the plates a slight stroke with the side of his hand the plates instantly flew from between the glass and the egg and the egg fell plumb into the glass without the smallest fracture  after some other of the like fooleries the table was removed and as the room was very large mr fenton proposed hide and go seek to his associates this invitation was accepted with transport and after they were cloyed with hide and seek they all played tagg till they were well warmed  mr fenton then ordered a pallet into the chamber for james his faithful domestic and little ned then helping to undress harry he put him first to bed and hastening after he took his darling to his bosom and tenderly pressed him to a heart that loved him more than all the world and more than that world ten times told  in about three days more they arrived safe at hamsted and stopping at the court of a large house that was delightfully situated they were welcomed by a gentlewomanly looking matron whom james had fixed for housekeeper about a fortnight before  the next day mr fenton and his blithe companions were attended at table by james and the two footmen  as soon as the latter grace was said and the cloth taken away harry says mr fenton it is now our turn to wait on james and his fellow servants for god made us all to be servants to each other and one man is not born a bit better than another and he is the best and greatest of all who serves and attends the most and requires least to be served and attended upon and my precious he that is a king to day if so it shall please god may become a beggar tomorrow and it is good that people should be prepared against all that may happen  having so said he took his associates down to the hall just as the servants had sat down to dinner he gave his domestics the wink and beginning to set the example asked mrs hannah and mr james and mr frank and mr andrew what they would please to have the servants readily falling in with their masters scheme ordered harry to bring such a thing and ned to fetch such a thing and harry to do this and harry to do that while harry with a graceful action and more beautiful than ganymede the cup bearer of the gods flew cheerfully about from side to side preventing the wishes of all at table so that they poured upon him a thousand blessings from the bottom of their hearts and would now scarce have parted with him for the mighty rewards which his father some time after proposed for his recovery  within a fortnight after this mr james the house steward had furnished a large lumberroom with thousands of coats outcoats shirts waistcoats breeches stockings and shoes of different sorts and sizes but all of warm and clean though homely materials  when this was done mr fenton led his favorite up to the stores and said my harry you see all these things and i make a present of all these things to my harry and now tell me my love what will you do with them why dada says harry you know that i cannot wear them myself no my dear says mr fenton for you have clothes enough beside and some of them would not fit you and others would smother you what then will you do with them will you burn them or throw them away o that would be very naughty and wicked indeed says harry no dada as i dont want em myself i will give em to those that do that will be very honestly done of you says mr fenton for in truth they have a better right to them my harry than you have and that which you cannot use cannot belong to you so that in giving you these things my darling it should seem as if i made you no gift at all o a very sweet gift says harry how is that says mr fenton why the gift of doing good to poor people sir mr fenton then stepping back and gazing on our hero cried whoever attempts to instruct thee my angel must himself be instructed of heaven who speaks by that sweet mouth  but harry it would not be discreet of you to give these things to the common beggars who come every day to our door give them victuals and halfpence or pence apiece and welcome but if you give such beggars twenty suits of clothes they will cast them all off and put on their rags again to move people to pity them but when you spy any poor travelers going the road and that your eyesees that they are naked or your heart tells you that they are hungry then do not wait till they beg of you but go and beg of them to favor you with their acceptance then take them in to the fire and warm them and feed them and when you have so done take them up to your storeroom and cloth them with whatever you think they want and believe me my harry whenever you are cold or hungry or wounded or in want or in sickness yourself the very remembrance of your having clothed and fed and cured and comforted the naked and the hungry the wounded and the afflicted will be warmth and food and medicine and balm to your own mind  while mr fenton spoke the muscles of harrys expressive countenance like an equally tuned instrument uttered unisons to every word he heard  from this day forward harry and ned by turns were frequently out on the watch and often single or in pairs or by whole families harry would take in a poor father and mother with their helpless infants driven perhaps from house and home by fire or other misfortune or oppressive landlord or ruthless creditor and having warmed and fed and clothed and treated the oldones as his parents and the littleones as his brothers and sisters he would give them additional money for charges on the road and send them away the happiest of all people except himself  by this time mr fenton had inquired into the circumstances and characters of all the poor in the town and throughout the precincts and having refuted or confirmed the intelligence he had received by a personal inspection and visit from house to house and having made entries of all such as he deemed real objects and worthy of his benificence he invited the heads of the several families to take a dinner with him every sunday at his hall  on the following sunday there came about thirty of these visitants which number soon increased to fifty weekly guests  on entering they found the cloth ready spread and mr james having counted heads laid a crown in silver upon every plate which first course was a most relishing sauce to all that followed a plentiful dinner was then introduced and the guests being seated mr fenton harry ned and the four domestics attended and disposed themselves in a manner the most ready to supply the wants of the company the guests all abashed and confounded at what they saw sat some time with open mouth and unswallowed victuals much less did they presume to apply to the waiters for any article they wanted till being encouraged and spirited up by the cheerfulness ease and readiness of their attendants they became by degrees quite happy and jovial and after a saturating meal and an enlivening cup they departed with elevated spirits with humanized manners and with hearts warmed in affection toward every member of this extraordinary house  by the means of this weekly bounty these reviving families were soon enabled to clear their little debts to the chandlers which had compelled them to take up every thing at the dearest hand they were also further enabled to purchase wheels and other implements with the materials of flax and wool for employing the late idle hands of their household they now appeared decently clad and with happy countenances their wealth increased with their industry and the product of the employment of so many late useless members became a real accession of wealth to the public so true it is that the prosperity of this world and of every nation and society therein depends soley on the industry or manufactures of the individuals and so much more nobly did this private patron act than all ancient legislators or modern patriots and landlords whose selfishness if they had but common cunning or common sense might instruct them to increase their proper rents and enrich their native country by supplying the hands of all the poor within their influence with the implements and materials of the prosperity of each  in the mean time mrs hannah daily instructed the children in the reading of english neither was mr fenton inattentive to any means that might preserve and promote the health action and corporal excellencies of his little champion  he held a large lawn behind his garden and hither he summoned three times in every week all the boys of the vicinage that were within two years advanced above the age of our hero to these he appointed premiums for football hurling wrestling leaping running cudgelling and buffing but the champions were enjoined to invest their fists with little mufflers insomuch that how great soever their vigor might be the bruises that they gave stopped short of mortality  now though these premiums were almost universally adjudged to the party of which harry then happened to be a member or individually to himself for his single prowess and preeminence yet he never would consent to bear the prize from the field but either gave it to some favorite among those with whom he had been associated or to the particular champion whom he had worsted in contest for he felt the shame and defeat of his mortified adversary and consolingly hinted at the injustice of the judges and reformed their error by the restoration of the reward  one day while harry was watching to intercept poor travelers as eagerly as a fowler watches for the rising of his game he heard a plaintive voice behind the hedge as he thought in the opposite field he flew across the road and passing through a small turnstile soon found the unhappy objects he sought for he stood for some time like a statue and his compassion became too strong for tears or utterance but suddenly turning and flying back again he rushed with precipitation into the room where mr fenton was writing a letter what is the matter said mr fenton starting what has frighted you my harry what makes you look so pale to this harry replied not but catching hold of his hand and pulling with all his force o come says he o come dada and see  mr fenton then got up and suffered himself to be led where the child pleased to conduct him without another word being asked or answered on either side  when they were come into the field mr fenton observed a man sitting on the ground his clothes seemed from head to foot as the tattered remainder of better days through a squalid wig and beard his pale face appeared just tinctured with a faint and sickly red and his hollow eyes were fixed upon the face of a woman whose head he held on his knees and who looked to be dead or dying though without any apparent agony while a male infant about four years of age was half stretched on the ground and half across the womans lap with its little nose pinched by famine and its eyes staring about wildly though without attention to any thing distress seemed to have expended its utmost bitterness on these objects and the last sigh and tear to have been already exhausted  unhappy man cried mr fenton pray who or what are you to which the stranger faintly replied without lifting his eyes whoever you may be disturb not the last hour of those who wish to be at peace  run harry says mr fenton desire all the servants to come to me immediately and bid mrs hannah bring some hartshorn and a bottle of cordial  away flew harry like feathered mercury on his godlike errand forth issued mr james frank and andrew and last came mrs hannah with the housemaid and cordials  hannah stooped in haste and applied hartshorn to the nose of the woman who appeared wholly insensible after some time her bosom heaved with a longrising and subsiding sigh and her eyes feebly opened and immediately closed again then hannah and the housemaid raising her gently between them got a little of the cordial into her mouth and bending her backward they observed that she swallowed it then james frank andrew and the housemaid joining their forces lifted her up and bore her as easy as possible toward the house while harry caught up her infant as a pissmire does its favorite embryo in a time of distress in order to lodge it in a place of protection and safety  in the mean time mr fenton and mrs hannah put their hartshorn with great tenderness to the nostrils of the stranger and requested him to take a sup of the cordial but he turning up his dim though expressive eyes feebly cried are you a man or an angel and directly fainted away  they rubbed his temples with the spirits and did their utmost to recover him but a sudden gust of grateful passion had proved too strong for his constitution on the return of the servants he was also carried in a physician was instantly sent for beds were provided and warmed in haste the new guests were all gently undrest and laid therein and being compelled to swallow a little sack whey they recovered to a kind of languid sensibility  the physician gave it as his opinion that this unhappy family were reduced to their present state by excess of grief and famine that nourishment should be administered in very small proportions and that they should be kept as quiet as possible for a fortnight at least  while all imaginable care is taking for the recovery of these poor people we beg leave to return to the affairs of their protectors  friend a plague upon your return this is just like a man in whose company i once traveled we were advanced on our journey in a fair and happy road when he took it into his head to ride back again in search of an old glove here you have raised my curiosity to the highest and equally distressed me in favor of this unhappy family when in the instant you fly off from the satisfaction expected but here also i presume you are upon honor you are entrusted with secrets and would not for the world betray them to your readers   author sir you never were more mistaken i know nothing at all of these peoples affairs as soon as they are able they will speak for themselves i know of no advantage that they can get by their silence whatever they may derive from your compassion and generosity by telling their case but the doctor for the present will not permit them  proceed my friend i pray you your patience will have but a very short trial   chap vi about a month before this mr fenton had engaged one mr vindex the schoolmaster of the town to come for an hour every evening and initiate the two boys in their latin grammar but he had a special caution given him with respect to the generous disposition of our hero which was said to be induced to do any thing by kindness but to be hardened and rouzed into opposition by severity  in about ten days after the late adventure mr fenton was called to london where he was detained about three weeks in settling his books with his dutchcorrespondents and in calling in a very large arrear of interest that was due to him upon his deposits in the funds  during his absence mr vindex began to assume a more expanded authority and gave a freer scope to the surly terrors of his station  ned was by nature a very lively but very petulant boy and when vindex reproved him with the imperial brow and voice of the great mogul ned cast upon him an eye of such significant contempt as no submissions or sufferings on the part of the offender could ever after compensate  the next day mr vindex returned doubly armed with a monstrous birch rod in one hand and a ferule in the other the first he hung up in terrorem as a meteor is said to hang in the heavens threatening future castigation to the children of men the second he held as determined upon present action nor was he unmindful of any hook whereon to hang a fault so that traveling from right to left and from left to right he so warmed the hands of the unfortunate edward as ruined the funny economy of his countenance and reduced him to a disagreeable partnership with the afflicted  on the departure of vindex though neds drollery was dismayed his resentment was by no means eradicated for the principle of ned was wholly agreeable to the motto of a very noble escutcheon and nemo me impune lacessit was a maxim of whose impropriety not saint anthony himself could persuade him  all night he lay ruminating and brooding on mischief in his imagination and having formed the outlines of his plan toward morning he began to chuckle and comfort himself and exult in the execution he then revealed his project to his bedfellow mr james who was greatly tickled therewith and promised to join in the plot  full against the portal that opened upon the schoolroom there stood an ancient and elevated chair whose form was sufficiently expressive of its importance mr vindex had selected this majestic piece of furniture as alone suitable to the dignity of his exalted station for he judiciously considered that if thrones and benches were taken from among men there would be an end of all dominion and justice upon earth  through the center of the seat of this chair of authority ned got mr james to drill a small hole not discernible except on a very minute scrutiny he then provided a cylindrial stick of about six inches in length to one end of which he fastened a piece of lead and in the other end he fixed the head of a large needle this needle had been a glovers of approved mettle keen and polished and threesquare toward the point for a quick and ready penetration of tough leather he next fastened two small chords transversly to the leaden extremity of the stick and james assisting they turned the chair with the bottom upward and tacked the four ends of the chords in such a manner as answered to the four cardinal points of the compass while the stick remained suspended in an upright direction with the point of the needle just so far through the drill as put it upon a level with the surface of the seat lastly they fastened a long and well waxed thread about the middle of the stick and drawing this thread over the upper rung they dropped the end of it just under neds stool and replaced the seat of learning in its former position  greatly did ned parade it when on trial he found that his machine answered to a miracle for the stick being restrained from any motion save that in a direction to the zenith on the slightest twitch of the thread the needle instantly mounted four sixths of two inches above the surface of the seat and was as quickly recalled by the revulsion of the lead  at the appointed hour of magisterial approach in comes mr vindex master harry and ned are called each seizes his book and takes his seat as usual in a line nearly diagonal to the right and left corner of the chair of authority mr vindex assumes the chair but scarce was he down when ned gives the premeditated intimation to his piercer and up bounces vindex and gives two or three capers as though he had been suddenly stung by a tarantula he stares wildly about puts his hand behind him with a touch of tender condolance returns to the chair peers all over it with eyes of the most prying inspection but not trusting to the testimony of his occular sense in a case that so very feelingly refuted its evidence he moved his fingers over and over every part of the surface but found all smooth and fair in spite of the late sensible demonstration to the contrary  down again with slow caution subsided mr vindex reconnoitring the premises to the right hand and to the left  as his temper was not now in the most duleet disposition he first looked sternly at ned and then turning toward harry with an eye that sought occasion for present quarrel he questioned him morosely on some articles of his lesson when ned not enduring such an indignity to the patron of his life and fortunes gave a second twitch with better will and much more lively than at first and up again sprung vindex with redoubled vigor and action and bounded plunged and pranced about the room as bewitched he glared and searched all about with a frantic penetration and pored into every corner for the visible or invisible perpetrators of these mischiefs he now began to imagine that some devil wanted a pincushion and proposed no other for the purpose than his capacious material  in this thought he retreated to the next chamber stripped off his clothes his shoes and breeches and to know whether a lodgment had been duly made he groped for the heads of the supposed weapons he next searched his breeches and every skirt and posterior fold of coat and waistcoat but finding the coasts clear of any ensigns of hostility he writhed and twisted his head and eyes to this side and to that to discern if possible the devastations that had been made in the field of honor when hearing a little titter in the neighboring school room he began to smell a fox and dressing himself again with a malignant determination of better note for the future he returned with a countenance of dissembled placability and resuming his chair began to examine the boys with a voice apparently tuned by goodtemper and affection  during this short serene poor ned happened to make a little trip in his rudiments when vindex turned and cried to our hero master harry my dear be so kind to get up and reach me you ferrule  these words had not fully passed the lips of the luckless pedagogue when ned plucked the string with his utmost force and vindex thought himself at least impaled on the spot up he shot once more like a sudden pyramid of flame the ground could no longer retain him he soared aloft roared raved cursed and swore like a thousand infernals while ned with an aspect of the most condoling hypocricy and words broke by a tone of mourning tenderly inquired of his ailments  vindex turned upon him an eye of jealous malignity and taking a sudden thought he flew to the scene of his repeated infliction and turning up the bottom of the seat of pain this complicated effort of extraordinary genius lay revealed and exposed to vulgar contemplation  he first examined minutely into the parts and construction of this wonderful machinery whose efficacy he still so feelingly recollected he then drew the string and admired with what a piercing agility the needle could be actuated by so distant a hand and lastly and deliberately he tore away piece by piece the whole composition as his rascally brethren the turks have also done in their antipathy to all the monuments of arts genius and learning throughout the earth  in the mean while our friend edward sat trembling and frying in his skin all his drollery had forsaken him nor had he a single cast of contrivance for evading the mountain of mischiefs that he saw impending how indeed could he palliate what had he to hope or plead in mitigation of the penalty where in the party so highly offended he saw his judge and his executioner  mr vindex had now the ball wholly at his own foot and that ned was ever to have his turn again was a matter no way promised by present appearances  vindex at length looked smilingly about him with much fun in his face but more vengeance at his heart mr edward said he perhaps you are not yet apprized of the justice of the jewish laws that claim an eye for an eye and a breech for a breech but i my child will fully instruct you in the fitness and propriety of them  then reaching at the rod he seized his shrinking prey as a kite trusses a robin he laid him like a little sack across his own stool off go the breeches and with the left hand he holds him down while the right is laid at him with the application of a woodman who resolves to clear part of the forest before noon  harry who was no way privy to the machination of the needle now approached and interposed in behalf of his unhappy servant he petitioned he kneeled he wept but his prayers and tears were cast to the winds and the rocks till vindex had reduced the posteriors of poor ned to a plight little different from those of saint bartholemew  mr vindex justly deemed that he had now given a lesson of such ample instruction as might dispense with his presence for some days at least  in the mean time the scalping of neds bottom held him confined to his bed where he had full time and leisure to contrive with one end a just and worthy retribution for the sufferings of the other  harry went often to sit and condole with ned in this the season of his calimity and as he had now conceived a strong aversion to the pedagogue on account of his barbarity he offered to assist his friend in any measures deemed adequate to the stripes and injuries he had received  the house of mr vindex was a large and oldfashioned building with a steep flight of stonestairs and a spacious landingplace before the door ned was again on his legs the night was excessive dark and the family of the preceptor had just finished an early supper  about this time a gentle rapping was heard and a servant opening the door looked this way and that way and called out repeatedly to know who was there but no voice replying he retired and shut all to again scarce was he reenterd when he hears rap rap rap rap the fellows anger was now kindled and opening the door suddenly he bounced out at once in order to seize the runaway but seeing no creature he began to feel a coming chilness and his hairs to stir as though each had got the life of an eel back he slunk closed the door with the greatest tenderness and crept down to reveal a scantling of his fears to his fellows in the kitchen  now though men and maids laughed heartily at the apprehensions of hodge they yet resented this insult on their house as they called it and getting all up together in a group they slily crowded behind the door with the latch in one of their hands ready to issue in an instant and detect the delinquents  they were not suffered to freeze knock knock knock knock knock open flys the door and out rush the servants nothing appeared they all stood silent and astonished beyond measure some however with outward bravade but inwards tremblings went searching along the walls and behind the posts for some lurcher again they gathered to the landingplace and stood whisperingly debating what this might be when to the inexpressible terror and discomfiture of all present the spontaneous knocker assumed sudden life and motion and gave such a peal and alarm to their eyes and ears as put every sense and resolution to the rout and in they rushed again one on the back of the other and clapped to the door as in the face of a host of pursuing demons  mr vindex and his lady for some time past had been sitting opposite and nodding over a fire in the back parlour where they returned each others salute with the greatest good manners and punctuality imaginable he now started on hearing the rustling in the hall and angrily called to know what was the matter  vindex from the prejudice of education during his infancy had conceived the utmost spite to all specter and hobgoblins insomuch that he wished to deprive them of their very existence and labored to persuade himself as well as others of their nonentity but faith proved too strong within him for all his verbal parade of avowed infidelity  while the servants with pale faces and short breath made their relation the magisterial philosopher did so sneer and contemptuously toss this way and the other and throw himself back in such affected fits of laughter as nothing could be like it till bouncing at the sound of another peal he mustered the whole family boaders and all to about seventeen in number together with madam vindex who would not be left sole and now they appeared such an army as was sufficient to face any single devil at least and forth they issued and filled the landing place leaving the door on the jar  here mr vindex turned and with his face toward the knocker thus addressed the assembly  my honest but simple friends quoth he can any thing persuade ye that a spirit or ghost as ye call it a breath or being of air a something or nothing that is neither tangible nor visible can lay hold of that which is or are ye such idiots as to imagine that you knocker for he did not yet venture to touch it a substance of solid and molten brass without members or organs or any internal system or apparatus for the purpose can yet be endued with will design or any kind of intelligence when the least locomotive faculty in the meanest reptile must of necessity be provided with an infinitely varied mechanism of nerves tubes reservoirs levers and pulleys for the nonce i should discredit my own senses on any appearance contrary to such palpable demonstration in all lights  soft  break we off  look where it comes again  for in this instant of affirmation so peremptory and conclusive the knocker as in contempt and bitter despite to philosophy so loudly refuted every syllable of the premises as left neither time nor inclination to vindex for a reply but rushing desperately forward he burst in at the portal with such as had presence of mind to take advantage of the opening and turning again and shutting the door violently in the face of half of his family he ran and threw himself into his chair in an agony of spirits  the servants and boarders whom vindex had shut out not abiding to stay in presence of the object of their terrors tumbled in a heap down the stairs and gathering themselves up again ran diversely to communicate to all their neighbors and acquaintance the tidings of the enchanted knocker their contagious looks and words gave the pannic throughout but curiosity prevailing above apprehension the town began to gather though first in thin parties and at a cautious distance till the crowd increasing took heart and resolution from number and venturing up a step or two of the stairs and being still pressed and urged forward by new comers from behind they at length filled the whole flight and the landingplace and one of them growing bold enough to lift his hand toward the knocker the knocker generously convinced him that no assistance was wanting rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap back recoil the foremost ranks casting off and tumbling over the ranks behind no one stayed to give help or hand to friend or brother but rising or scrambling off on all fours each made the best of his way to the first assylum and in less than ten seconds there was not a mouse stirring throughout the street  if i had the ill nature of most authors who seldom communicate any thing worthy the knowledge of the public i might also leave the foregoing aenigma to be solved or rather made more implicit in such ways as philosophy might happen to account for but in compassion to the pains of a laboring imagination i choose to deliver my reader with all possible ease and dispatch  the fact is that these astonishing and tremendous phenomenon that discomfited little city alarmed the country round and resuscitated the stories and legends of the old women of all the parishes from barnet to london was the whole and sole contrivance of our heros petulant foundling during a nightly lucubration  ned had accordingly imparted his plan of operations to harry and harry had engaged mrs hannah in the plot  now mrs hannah had a house in a narrow part of the street just opposite to that of mr vindex where her niece and an old servant resided this house was narrow but of the height of four stories and on the said memorable night ned dropped the end of a bottom of small twine from the garret window which hannah took across the way and fastened with a double knot to the knocker of vindexs door and now it is twenty to one that if vindexs family and the rest of the neighborhood had been even thus far let into the secret they would not have been altogether so much alarmed at the consequences  i have read of generals who could gain but not maintain conquests and of women who could keep all secrets but their own thus it happened to ned his vanity was at least on a level with his ingenuity he was so elated with the success of his recent stratagem that he boasted of it to some and half whispered it to others till it came to the ears of the much exasperated vindex vindex in the first heat and very boil of his passions snatches up a huge rod just cut from that tree whose bare name strikes terror through all our seminaries of learning and taking with him one of his boarders he marches directly down to the house of mr fenton and thus formidably armed he enters the fatal schoolroom  ned by great good fortune for himself was then absent but our hero happening to be there vindex instantly shut the door and called him to task  master harry says he did you know any thing of the strange knocking at my door last tuesday night to this question harry who was too valiant to be tempted to tell a lie through fear without hesitation answered in the affirmative you did sirrah cried the pedagogue and have you the impudence also to confess it to my face here jacky down with his breeches and horse him for me directly  jack was a lusty lubberly boy about ten years of age and stooping to unbutton harry according to order our hero gave him such a sudden fist in the mouth as dashed in two of his teeth that then happened to be moulting and set him a crying and bleeding after a piteous manner vindex then rose into tenfold fury and took our hero in hands himself and notwithstanding that he cuffed and kicked and sought it most manfully vindex at length unbuttoned his breeches and set him in due form on the back of his boarder  the pedagogue at first gave him the three accustomed strokes as hard as he could draw so much my friend says he is for your own share of the burden and now tell me who were your confederates and abettors in this fine plot that i will never tell you deliberately and resolutely answered our hero what shall i be bullied and outbraved replied the frantic savage by such a one as you you little stubborn villain i will flea you alive i will carbonade you on the spot so saying he laid at him as though he had been a sheaf of wheat while harry indignantly endured the torture and holding in his breath that he might not give vindex the satisfaction of a groan he determined to perish rather than betray  in the mean time ned had peeped in at the keyhole and spying the situation and plight of his loved patron he ran to mrs hannah and imparted the horrid tidings hannah rose with all the wrath of tisiphone in her countenance and flying to the schoolroom she rushed violently against the door burst it open in a twinkling and springing forward fastened every nail she had in the face and eyes of vindex and tore away and cuffed at a fearful rate jack at this period had let his rider to the ground when harry catching at a sword that hung against the wainscot whipped it down and drawing it from the sheath as quick as lightning he sprung at vindex in order to run him through the body but happily not having had the patience to put up his breeches they trammelled him in his advance and he fell prostrate with the sword in his hand which reached the leg of the pedagogue and gave him a slight wound just as he was endeavoring to make his way through the door jack had already made his escape and the mauled preceptor scampered after with his ears much better warmed and his temper better cooled than when he entered  harry bore his misfortune with a sort of sullen though shamefaced philosophy but every other member of this honorable family almost adored him for the bloody proof that he had given of his virtue and vowed unpitying vengeance on the ungenerous vindex  during the above transactions the strangers whom mr fenton had received into his house had been tended with great humanity and were now on the recovery  mr james on conversing with the head of this little family observed that he was an exceeding sensible person and had provided him with a decent though cast suit of his masters and had also with the assistance of mrs hannah put his wife and little boy into clean and seemly apparel  as jamess invention was on the rack to get adequate satisfaction on the base spirited vindex he went to consult his new friend who dropped a tear of generosity and admiration on hearing the story of harrys heroism and nobility of soul  by his advice mr james dispatched a messenger to a druggist at london and to several other shops for a sundry apparatus and having all things in readiness and harry being now able to bear a part in the play james sent a strange porter to vindex with compliments from his master as though he were just come home and requested to speak with him  vindex accordingly comes and knocks the door opens he enters and it instantly shuts upon him he starts back with horror as at the sight of medusa he perceives the hall all in black without a single ray save what proceeded from a sickly lamp that made the gloom visible he is suddenly seized upon by two robust devils covered over with painted flames they drag him to the schoolroom but o terror of terrors he knows the place of his pristine authority no more he beholds a hell more fearful that his fancy had yet framed the cieling seemed to be vaulted with serpents harpyes and hydras that dropped livid fire on one side ran phlegeton in waves of burning sulphur and here the tisiphone magaera and alecto of the heathens appeared to contend for frightfulness with miltons death and sin four fends and two little imps at once laid their fangs upon him and would have dragged him to the ground but the pedagogue was a sturdy athletic fellow and cuffed and scratched and roared it out most manfully the devil however proving too strong for the sinner he was cast prostrate to the earth and being left in retrospection as bare as father time some sat upon his shoulders to keep him down while others on each side alternately keeping time like the threshers of barley gave our flogger such a scoring as imprinted on his memory to the last state of magistracy a fellowfeeling for the sufferings of petty delinquents  being all out breathed in turns they remitted from their toil and now appeared to be a set of the merriest devils that ever were associated they fastened the clothes of the disconsolate vindex about his neck with his own garters and having manacled his hands before him they turned him loose to the street while he with a wonderful presence of mind in the midst of his terrors raised his hands the best he could to cover his face and hurried homeward judiciously recollecting that forty nine in fifty would recognize the one end who would not recognize the other especially in the present pickle  within a few days after this adventure mr fenton returned at the first sight of one another he and his harry grew together for near half an hour he then addressed every member of his family one by one and with a familiar goodness inquired after their several healths and concerns he also asked after his late guests and desired to see them but on mr jamess intimation that he had somewhat of consequence to impart to him they retired to the next room  here james made him a minute recital of the preceding adventures and set forth in due contrast the baseness and barbarity of vindex on the one part and the unassailable worthiness of his harry on the other while the praise of this chosen of the old gentlemans soul sunk like the balm of gilead upon his wounded mind and almost eradicated every memorial of former grief and planted a new spring of hope and joy in their room  the table being spread for dinner mr fenton sent to desire that the stranger and his little family should join company they came according to order but entered evidently overcome with a weight of shame and gratitude too grievous to be borne  mr fenton saw their oppression and felt the whole burden upon his own shoulders he accordingly was interested and solicitous in the removal which he effected with all that address of which his humanity had made him a great master  through the enfoldings of the strangers modesty mr fenton discerned many things preceding the vulgar rank of men mr clement said he i am astonished beyond measure that a person of letters as you are and who has so much of the gentleman in his person and manner should yet be reduced to such extremity in a christian country and among a people distinguished for their humanity there must be something very singular and extraordinary in your case and this night if you are at leisure and that the recital is not disagreeable to you you would oblige me by your story  sir answered mr clement since my life is yours you have surely a right to an account of your property whenever you think proper i will cheerfully obey you  mr fenton now rose and stepped into town and calling upon a neighbor whom he took to the tavern he sent for mr vindex who came upon the summons  mr vindex says he pray take your seat i am sorry mr vindex for the treatment you have got in my house and still sorrier that you got it so very deservedly  i have long thought mr vindex that the method of schoolmasters in the instruction of our children is altogether the reverse of what it ought to be they generally lay hold on the human constitution as a pilot lays hold of the rudder of a ship by the tail by the single motive i say of fear alone  now as fear has no concern with any thing but self it is the most confined most malignant and the basest though the strongest of all passions  the party who is possessed with it will listen to nothing but the dictates of his own terror nor scruple any thing that may cover him from the evil apprehended he will prevaricate and lie if that lie is questioned he will vouch it by perjury and if he happens to do an injury he will be tempted to commit murder to prevent the effects of resentment  fear never was a friend to the love of god or man to duty or conscience truth probity or honor it therefore can never make a good subject a good citizen or a good soldier and least of all a good christian except the devils who believe and tremble are to be accounted good christians  how very different is the lesson which our master christ teaches who commands us not to fear what man can do unto us to smile in sickness and calamity to rise superior to pain and death and to regard nothing but as it leads to the goal of that immortality which his gospel has brought to light  there is mr vindex but one occasion wherein fear may be useful in schools or commonwealths that is when it is placed as a guard against evil and appears with its ensignia of rods ropes and axes to deter all who behold from approaching thereto  but this mr vindex is far from being the sole occasion on which schoolmasters apply the motive of fear and castigation they associate the ideas of pain to those lessons and virtues which the pleasure of encouragement ought alone to inculcate they yet more frequently apply the lash for the indulgence of their own weaknesses and for the gratification of the virulence of their own naughty passions and i have seen a giant of a pedagogue raving raging and foaming over a group of shrinking infants like a kite over a crouching parcel of young turkeys  there are i admit some parents and preceptors who annex other motives to that of the rod they promise money gaudy clothes and sweet meats to children and in their manner of expatiating on the use and value of such articles they often excite in their little minds the appetites of avarice of vanity and sensuality they also sometimes add the motive of what they call emulation but which in fact is rank envy by telling one boy how much happier or richer or finer another is than himself  now though envy and emulation are often confounded in terms there are not two things more different both in respect to their object and in respect to their operation the object of envy is the person and not the excellence of any one but the object of emulation is excellence alone as when christ exciting us to be emulous of the excellence of god himself bids us be perfect as our father which is in heaven is perfect the operation of envy is to pull others down but the act of emulation is to exalt ourselves to some eminence or height proposed the eyes of envy are sore and sickly and hate to look at the light but emulation has the eye of an eagle and soars while it gazes in the face of the sun  were tutors half as solicitous throughout their academies to make men of worth as to make men of letters there are a hundred pretty artifices very obvious to be contrived and practiced for the purpose they might institute caps of shame and wreaths of honor in their schools they might have little medals expressive of particular virtues to be fixed on the breast of the atchiever till forfeited by default and on the report of any boys having performed a signal action of goodnature friendship gratitude generosity or honor a place of eminence might be appointed for him to sit on while all the rest of the school should bow in deference as they passed such arts as these i say with that distinguishing affection and approbation which all persons ought to show to children of merit would soon make a new nation of infants and consequently of men  when you mr vindex iniquitously took upon you to chastise my most noble and most incomparable boy you first whipped him for his gallant and generous avowal of the truth and next you barbarously flead him because he refused to betray those who had confided in his integrity  when i behold so many scoundrels walking openly throughout the land who are styled your honor and your honor and who impudently usurp the most exalted of all characters the character of a gentleman i no longer wonder when i reflect that they have been principled or rather unprincipled by such tutors as mr vindex  the merry devils mr vindex who took you in hand were not of a species so alienated from humanity as you might imagine they have therefore appointed me their vehicle of some smartmoney in recompense but desire no further advantage from your company or instructions  so saying mr fenton put a purse of five and twenty guineas into the hands of the pedagogue and withdrew without speaking another word  friend upon my credit this mr fenton  i long to know something more of him  he is a sensible kind of a man and has given us some very valuable hints upon education  but may i be so free with you as to drop some general remarks upon the whole of what i have read   author free sir  by all means  as free as you please to be sure  believe me you cannot do me a greater favor   fr why there is the plague on it now  you begin to kindle already  ah were you authors to know the thousandth part of the liberties that are taken behind your backs you would learn to bear with more humility a gentle admonition though uttered to your faces  few indeed have the generosity or even humanity to intimate what they themselves think or what the world speaks of you we are seldom over forward to say any thing that might give displeasure to others because we like that others should be pleased with ourselves but in your absence we pay ourselves largely for our taciturnity in your presence and i have often been in company where the intimates and confidents of you authors have depreciated and ridiculed the very same passages which they applauded with cries and claps in your closets the world my friend has substituted good manners in the place of good nature whoever conforms to the former is dispensed with from any observance of the latter shall i add for the misfortune of you authors that there is a set of men who at once dispense with common manners and common humanity they go under the name of crities and must be men of wealth that the deference paid to fortune may give a sort of stamp and currency to the dross of their erudition in the strictest sense indeed they may be called men of letters their study as well as capacity being nearly confined to a just or orthographical disposition of the alphabet their business is to reconoitre the outworks of genius as they have no key to the gates of nature or sentiment they snuff faults from afar as crows scent carrion and delight to pick and to prey and to dwell upon them they enter like wasps upon the gardens of literature not to relish any fragrance of select any sweets but to pamper their malevolence with every thing that savours of rankness or offense happily for them their sagacity does not tend to the discovery of merit in such a case a work of genius would give them the spleen for a month or possibly depress their spirits beyond recovery  to these high and dreaded lords justiciaries the critics authors deem it incumbent to submit the products of their lucubrations not in the prospect of any advantage from their advice or animadversions neither in the hopes of acquiring their friendship or patronage but merely to sooth and deprecate the effects of their malignity accordingly i have been present when some of these dictators have been presented with a manuscript as with an humble petition they have thereupon assumed the chair as a judge assumes the bench when a criminal is called before him not in order to trial or hearing but to sentence and condemnation to what scenes of mortification have i been witness on such occasions to what a state of abatement of abasement of annihilation have these entertainers of the public been depressed  i am sorry sir to tell you that this will not do  a few attempts here and there but that will not compensate  here again how injudicious absurd unpardonable  lord sir you should have considered that when a man sits down to write for the public the least compliment they expect from him is that he should think  here my friend i have seen enough i cannot affront my judgment so much as either to recommend or patronize your performance all i can do for you is to be filent on the subject and permit fools to approve who have not sense to discern  thus do these criticsparamount with the delicacy and compassion of the torturers of the inquisition search out all the seats of sensibility and selfcomplacence in order to sting with the more quick and killing poignancy  now my dear friend as you have not applied for the favor of these established arbitrators of genius and literature you are not to expect the least mercy from them and i am also free to tell you that i know of no writer who lies more open to their attacks you are excessively incorrect your works on the one hand have not the least appearance of the limae labor nor on the other have they that ease which ought to attend the haste with which they seem to be written again you are extremely unequal and disproportioned one moment you soar where no eye can see and strait descend with rapidity to creep in the vulgar phrase of chamber maids and children then you are so desultory that we know not where to have you you no sooner interest us in one subject than you drag us however reluctant to another in short i doubt whether you laid any kind of plan before you set about the building but we shall see how your fortuitous concourse of atoms will turn out   aut do i want nature   fr no   aut do i want spirit   fr rather too much of fire at times   aut do i want sentiment   fr not altogether   aut then sir i shall be read and read again in despite of my own defects and of all that you and your critics can say or do against me the truth is that the critics are very far from being bugbears to me they have always proved my friends my best benefactors they were the first who writ me into any kind of reputation and i am more beholden to their invectives than i am to my own genius for any little name i may have got in the world all i have to fear is that they are already tired of railing and may not deem me worth their further notice  but pray my good sir if you desire that i should profit by your admonitions ought you not to give me instances of the faults with which you reproach me   fr that would be time and labor altogether thrown away as i have not the smallest hope of bringing you to confession you are a disputant a casuist by your education you are equally studied and practiced in turning any thing into nothing or bringing all things thereout but dont flatter yourself that i have yet given you the detail of half your faults you are often paradoxical and extremely peremptory and desperate in your assertions in this very last page you affirm that the character of a gentleman is the most revereable the highest of all characters   aut i did sir i do affirm it and will make it good   fr i knew it sir i knew it but dont choose at present to enter into the discussion at the next pause i shall willingly hear you on this question   chap vii on his return he ordered a fire and a bottle of wine into his study and sent for mr clement mr clement says he sit down i assure you mr clement i am inclined to think very well of you but pray let me have the narrative of your life and manners without disguise an ingenuous confession and sense of past errors has something in it to me full as amiable or more than if a man had never strayed  sir says mr clement i have indeed been faulty very faulty in my intentions though god has hitherto preserved me from any very capital act and has by your hand wonderfully brought me to this day  history of the man of letters bar tholomew clement sir a retailer of hard ware on the strand is my father he was lowbred and as i believe of narrow capacity but proceeding in what they call the dogtrot of life and having a single eye to the making of money he became vastly rich and has now a large income from houses and ground rents in the city of westminster the fruits and acquisition of his own application  i remember nothing of my mother except her fondness for me nor of her character except the tears that i have seen my father shed when occasional circumstances have brought her fresh to his memory she died when i was in my seventh year i was their only surviving child and my father transferred all his tenderness for her to me  the love of my father was not the mere partiality or prejudice of a parent it was not an affection he had a passion for me that could be equalled by nothing but his vanity in my behalf he resolved he said that there should be one gentleman in the family and with this view he resisted his desire of having me always in his sight and sent me to westminster school and from thence to cambridgecollege where i continued till i was twenty years of age without any thing happening that was uncommon or deserving of your attention  in the mean time my father was as prodigal of his purse toward me as he was of his caresses he had me with him every vacation he visited me frequently during term and seemed to lose the better half of his existence when we parted  he had infused into me a strong tincture of his own vanity and views i lost even a portion of that tenderness and respect which i had felt in his regard he was a trader a mechanic i sighed for his reptile state and i looked down upon him as icarus did on that very father from whom he had derived wings for so exalted a flight  my application accordingly was equal to my ambition i was not merely a master i was a critic in the classical languages i relished and commented on the beauties of the greek and latin authors was a thorough connoisseur in the customs and manners of the ancients and could detect the slightest transgression of a sculptor or designer in their folding of the roman toga i also had the honor to be intimate with all the great of antiquity i frequently sat in synod with the whole posse of heathen gods on olympus and i kept them as i imagined in a kind of dependence by my perfect knowledge of all their secret lapses and mistreadings i had traced the system of nature from aristotle and pythagoras down to epicurus and lucretius and from them down to des carts gassendi and hobbes and i was so thorough paced an adept in all the subtleties of logic that i could confute and change sides without losing an inch of the ground that i had gained upon my adversary  i now imagined that i was arrived at the very pinnacle of human excellence and that fortune and honor were within my grasp on either hand i looked on the chancellorship or primacy as things that must come in course and i was contriving some station more adequate to the height of my merits and ambition when i received this letter  son hammel have lately enquired into thy life and character am sorry to find them too bad to give hope of amendment have lost my money and my child thou have cut thyself from my love i have cut thee from my fortune to comfort myself have taken a neighbors widow to wife come not near me i will not see thee would pray for thee if i did not think it in vain  bartholomew clement   for some time after the receipt of this cruel letter i remained in a state of stupidity i could not believe the testimony of my senses i gave a kind of discredit to all things but awaking from this lethargy into inexpressible anguish my soul was rent by different and contending passions  whatever contempt i might have for the station of my father i still loved his person better than riches and honors but he loved me no more he was gone he was lost he was already dead and buried at least to me i cast myself on the ground i groaned i wept aloud i bewailed him as though he had lain a lifeless corpse before me at length having vented the first ravings of my passion i rose and wrote to my father an answer of which this in my pocketbook is the copy  sir if you had not wished to find those faults you sent to seek after in a life that defies malice and is wholly irreproachable you would not have given credit to scoundrels who cannot judge of the conduct of a gentleman nor have condemned your only child without hearing or defense  in cutting me from your fortune you only cut me from what i despise but in cutting me from your love you have unjustly robbed me of that which no fortune can repair i see that you are irretrievably taken away from me i shall never more behold my long indulgent and fond father and i shall not cease to lament his loss with tears of filial affection but for this new father whose heart could dictate so unnatural and inhuman a letter i equally disclaim all commerce and concern with him and could it be possible that a person of my talents and abilities should be reduced to indigence or distress you sir are the very last man upon earth to whom i would apply or from whom i would deign to accept relief  but if on the other hand it should please god hereafter to visit your hardheartedness with affliction and poverty and that i like the son of the blacksmith in the days of our eighth harry should stand next the throne in dignity and honors you will then find me desirous of making you all sorts of submissions you will then find the dutifullest the fondest and tenderest of children in  sir your little known and much injured hammel clement   having thus vented the gusts and feelings of my heart i began seriously to think of the course i ought to take and considered london as the sphere in which a luminary would appear with the greatest luster  i discharged my servant sold my two geldings disposed of my room my furniture and most of my books and having mustered somewhat upward of three hundred and fifty pounds i lodged the l 00 with a cambridge dealer from whom i took bills on his correspondent in london and set out on my expedition in the first stage  i took cheap lodgings near charing cross i was altogether unknowing and unknown in that great city and reflecting that a hidden treasure cannot be duly estimated i daily frequented markhams coffeehouse amidst a promiscuous resort of swordsmen literati beaus and politicians  here happening to distinguish myself on a few occasions where some articles of ancient history or tenet of thales or law of lycurgus chanced to be in question i began to be regarded with better advantage  an elderly gentleman one day who sat attentive in a corner got up and whispered that he would be glad of my company to take share of a pint in the next room i gratefully obeyed the summons and when we had drank a glass a piece mr clement says he you appear to have but few acquaintance and may possibly want a friend my fortune is small but i have some influence in this town and as i have taken an inclination to you i should be glad to serve you if the question is not too free pray what is your present dependence and prospect for life  having with a grateful warmth acknowledged his goodness to me i ingenuously confessed that my circumstances were very slender and that i should be glad of any place wherein i could be useful to myself and my employer and pray says my friend what place would best suit you i hope sir answered i my education has been such that laying aside the manual crafts there is not any thing for which i am not qualified i am greatly pleased to hear it replied mr goodville and hope soon to bring you news that will not be disagreeable  within a few days mr goodville again entered the coffeehouse with a happy aspect he beckoned me aside clement says he i have the pleasure to tell you that i have brought you the choice of two very advantageous places mr giles the banker wants a clerk who can write a fine hand and has made some proficiency in arithmetic and my good friend mr tradewell an eminent merchant would give large encouragement to a youth who understands the italian method of bookkeeping as his business is very extensive and requires the shortest and clearest manner of entry and reference  my friend here paused and i blushed hung down my head and was wholly confounded at length i answered hesitatingly perhaps sir you have happened on the only two articles in the universe mechanics as i said apart of which i have no knowledge well well my boy says he dont be discouraged i will try what further may be done in your behalf  within about a fortnight after mr goodville sent me a note to attend him at his lodgings in redlion square i went flushed with reviving hope my child said he as i entered i have now brought you the offer of three different places and some one of them as i trust must surely fit you  our east india company propose to make a settlement on the coast of coromandel and are inquisitive after some youths who have made a progress in geometry and are more especially studied in the science of fortification there is also the colonel of a regiment an old intimate of mine who is going on foreign service and he in truth applied to me to recommend a person who was skilled in the mechanic powers and more particularly who had applied himself to gunnery and engineering there is lastly the second son of a nobleman to whom i have the honor to be known he is captain of a man of war and would give any consideration to a young man of sense and letters who is a poficient in navigation and in the use of the charts and compass and who at the same time might serve as a friend and companion  sir said i quite astonished i have been a student as goliath was a man of war from my childhood if all my tutors did not flatter me my genius was extensive and my progress in learning may prove that my application has been indefatigable i know all things from the beginning of time that the ancient or modern world as i was told accounted matters of valuable erudition or recognizance and yet i have not so much as heard of the use or estimation of any of these sciences required as you say by persons in high trust and commission  mr goodville hereupon looked concerned and shook his head my dear clement says he i do not doubt your talents or learning but i now begin to doubt whether they have been directed or applied to any useful purpose my cousin goodville informs me that the bishop of st asaph is in distress for a young gentleman a man of morals and a linguist who has some knowledge in the canon and civil law as his vicar general is lately dead he tells me further that a gentleman a friend of his who is in great circumstances and who is now about purchasing the place of surveyor general wants a youth who has got some little smattering in architecture and has an elegant hand at the drawing of plans and sections i am also known to one of the commissioners of excise and if you are barely initiated in gauging or surveying i think i could get you into some way of bread  alas sir i replied in a desponding tone i am equally a stranger to all these matters  perhaps said mr goodville i could get you into holy orders if you are that way inclined are you well read in theology  yes yes sir i briskly answered i am perfectly acquainted with the gods and manners of worship through all nations since the deluge  but are you replied my friend equally versed in the christian dispensation have you studied our learned commentators on the creeds are you read in polemic divinity and are you a master of the sense and emblematical reference that the old testament bears to the new  sir said i i have often dipped with pleasure into the bible as there are many passages in it extremely affecting and others full of fine imagery and the true sublime  my poor dear child mournfully answered mr goodville by all i can find you know no one thing of use to yourself or any other person living either with respect to this world or the world to come could you make a pin or a waistcoat button or form a pill box or weave a cabbage net or shape a coblers last or hew a block for a barber or do any of those things by which millions daily maintain themselves in supplying the wants and occasions or fashions and vanities of others you might not be under the necessity of perishing  the ways of life for which your studies have best prepared you are physic and the law but then they require great expense and an intense application of many years to come before you can propose to enter on a livelihood by either of those professions and after all your success would be very precarious if you were not supported by many friends and a strong interest at least on your setting out  i have already told you clement that i am not rich and if i were it is not he who gives you money but he who puts you into a way of getting it that does you a friendship  i am advised to go to montpellier for the establishment of my health after a tedious fit of sickness that i had at bath i shall set out in about a month but before i go my child i earnestly wish and advise you to fix on some craft or trade or manner of employing your time that will enable you to earn a certain subsistence and at the same time make you a worthy member of the community for believe me my boy that it is not speculative science no nor all the money and jewels upon earth that make any part of the real wealth of this world it is industry alone employed on articles that are useful and beneficial to society that constitutes the true riches of all mankind  as soon as you have made your election let me see you again and in all events let me see you before i set out  hereupon i bowed and retired the most mortified and dejected of all beings i was so low and dispirited that i could scarce get to my lodgings i threw myself on the bed the gildings of the vapors of grandeur and ambition that like the sky of a summers evening had delighted my prospects now wholly disappeared and a night of succeeding darkness fell heavy on my soul  one third of my principal fund was almost sunk and my imagination considered the remainder as already vanished without the possibility of supply or resource i now secretly cursed the vanity of my father he must breed me a genman thought i with a pox as though i had been born to no manner of end had i been the son of a cobbler of a porter an ostler of the lowest wretch who wins his bread by the sweat of his brow i should not yet have been reduced to the worst species of beggary that of begging with sound limbs and a reasonable soul the least pitied though most pitiable object of the creation for surely that is the case of a poor scholar and a poor gentleman  for some following days i went about prying and enquiring into the various and numberless occupations that maintained so many thousands of active hands and busy faces throughout that wonderful city  one evening as i returned late and fatigued through cheapside i observed a man very importunate with a woman who walked before me sometimes she would hurry on and again make a full stop and earnestly beseech him to go about his business but in spite of her entreaties he still stuck close to her till coming to the end of a blind alley he suddenly seized her by the arm and pulled her in after him  she shrieked out for help with repeated vociferation when recollecting all my force and drawing my sword villain i cried out quit the woman instantly or you are a dead man he perceived the glittering of the weapon and retired a few paces but taking out a pocket pistol he discharged it full at me and ran off with precipitation  the ball entered my clothes and flesh and lodged on the rotula of my left arm i felt a short pang but not attending to it i took the woman under the arm and returning with her to the street i told her we had no time to lose and desired to know where she lived she answered at the sign of the fan and ruffle in fleet street where she kept a milliners shop we had not far to go we made the best of our speed and were let in by a servant maid who showed us to a back parlour  jenny said mrs graves that was her name bring a glass and a bottle of the cordialwine you look a little pale sir i hope you are not hurt not much i think madam but i feel a small pain in my left shoulder sir here is my best service to you with my best blessings and prayers for you to the last hour of my life you must drink it off sir we both stood in need of it this was a frightful affair jenny where is arabella within a few doors madam at the miss hodginses come sir said mrs graves i must look at your shoulder then opening the top of my waistcoat she instantly screamed out god preserve my deliverer i fear he is wounded dangerously jenny fly to mr weldons bring him with you immediately do not come without him dearest worthiest of men let me press another glass upon you it is necessary in such a waste of blood and spirits madam i replied the wound cannot be of consequence but i was greatly fatigued at the time that i had the happiness to rescue you from that ruffian  the surgeon soon came and looking at my wound said something apart to mrs graves who thereupon ordered jenny to get a fire and to make and warm the bed in the best chamber  sir said i to mr weldon dont alarm the gentlewoman i am not of a fearful temper and hope to bear my fortune like a man sir said he your wound has been made by a rifled ball and it may cost you much pain to extract it you must not think of stirring from hence for the present by the time your bed is ready i will be back with the dressings  during the surgeons absence mrs graves was all in tears while i sat suspended between my natural fears of an approaching dissolution and my hopes of being suddenly and lastingly provided for the cruelty of my father the disappointment and overthrow of all my elevated expectations and my utter incapacity of being of the smallest use to myself or mankind had given me a kind of loathing to life i had not indeed attended to my duty as a christian but i was then innocent of any actual or intentional evil and as my conscience did not condemn me i looked to mercy with a kind of humble resignation  mr weldon came with the dressings his eldest apprentice and a man servant i was then conducted to my chamber and helped to bed where i was put to great anguish in the extraction of the ball as the periostium had been lacerated and that the lead being flattened extended much beyond the wound it had made  having passed a very painful and restless night i remembered nothing further till at the expiration of one and twenty days i seemed to awaken out of a long and uneasy dream  i turned my head and beheld as i imagined all arrayed in shining white and at my bedside an inhabitant of some superior region for never till then had i seen nor even conceived an idea of any form so lovely  tell me said i fair creature on what world am i thrown but instead of replying it flew out of my apartment and soon after returned accompanied by mrs graves whose hands and eyes were elevated as in some extraordinary emotion  mrs graves said i how do you do i hope you are well i now beign to conjecture whereabouts i am but neither did she answer but falling on her knees by my bed and taking hold of my hand i thank i thank thee o my god she cried and bursting into tears she wept and sobbed like an infant ah mrs graves said i i fear that you have had a very troublesome guest of me but then says she we remember that trouble no more now that you are once again born into the world  during the few succeeding days in which i kept my bed mrs graves and her fair niece arabella whom i had taken for a vision constantly breakfasted and spent their evening in my apartment  i gave them a short narrative of my foregoing history and understood on their part that they were the sister and daughter of the late reverend mr graves of putney who had little more to bequeath than his books and furniture amounting to about five hundred pounds which they held in joint stock and had hitherto rather increased than diminished  as i scarce remembered my mother and had now as it were no father relation nor friend upon earth i felt a vacuity in my soul somewhat like that of an empty stomach desirous of seizing on the first food that should present itself to my cravings delightful sensibilities sweet hungerings of nature after its kind this good woman and her niece became all the world to me the one had conceived for me all the passion of a parent the other that of the fondest and tenderest of sisters on the other hand i had for mrs graves all the feelings of a child who conceives himself a part of the existence of her who bore him and my eyes and actions could not forbear to discover to arabella that my heart was that of the most affectionate of brothers though too delicate to indulge itself in those familiar endearments which the nearness of kindred might venture to claim  when i was up and about the house i requested mrs graves to make out her bill for my board and for physician surgeon drugs etc during my long illness hereupon she looked eagergly and tenderly at me mr clement says she i think you are too generous designedly to reproach us with what we owe you but for what is it my child that you desire us to charge you is it for rescuing me from death or a shame worse than death probably from both or is it for delivering this my darling from the bitter grief and distress that my loss must have brought upon her or do you rather desire to pay us for the fearful pains and sickness which you suffered on our account and for having nearly forfeited your life in our defense no mr clement you must not think of paying us the very debts that we owe you more indeed mr clement than all our little fortune than the product of the industry of our lives can ever repay  here i was silenced for the present but in no degree convinced and i felt in a sort the disgust of an injured person uneasy and studious till some revenge might be had  in two days after while mrs graves was at market and arabella gone with a brussels head and ruffles to a young lady of distinction i stepped into the shop where jenny waited the commands of those that should call i had scarce entered when a sheriffs officer appeared at the door and bolting in laid an execution on the shop for eighty five pounds odd shillings at the suit of mr hardgrave the cambric and lacemerchant  i was at first surprised and grieved but pleasure quickly succeeded to my concern on the occasion i took out my pocketbook immediately discharged the debt with costs and gave a crown to jenny on her solemn assurance that she would not betray a syllable of what had happened to her mistress or arabella  soon after this good gentlewoman and her niece returned dinner was ordered up and i sat down to table with a heart and countenance more easy and cheerful than ordinary  before the cloth was removed jenny came and delivered a note to her mistress she read it over and over with apparent surprise and attention asked if the messenger was waiting and stepped to the door again she returned sat down without speaking a word and the muscles of her countenance being strongly affected she could no longer retain her passion and her tears burst forth  what is the matter cried arabella my aunt my dear dear mother my only friend and parent and breaking also into tears she threw herself about her neck  oh there is no bearing of this exclaimed mrs graves this young man my arabella distresses us beyond expression he has this very day my love for the second time snatched us from instant ruin i would tell you if i could speak but read that note which she did accordingly  the note was signed freestone hardgrave and imported how sorry he was that his late losses by sea had put him under the necessity of laying an execution on her house without customary notice that he was glad however she had so large a sum ready as l 0 the receipt of which he acknowledged and hoped that this affair would make no difference with respect to their future dealings  and why best and dearest of women said i to mrs graves why would you grieve that i should endeavor to relieve myself from a part of that burden with which you goodness and obligations have so greatly oppressed me oh that it were that it were in my power i cried and my hands pressed eachother with an involuntary ardour but it never will it never can be possible for me to prove the passion that my soul has for you and  there i hesitated  to show you i say the love that i have for you mrs graves you two make my world and all that i am concerned for or desire therein  since that is the case said mrs graves with a smile and a tear that glistened together if you will admit an equal passion from one so old as i am it were pity we should ever part send my child this very day and discharge your former lodgings the time that we spend together cannot but be happy all cares are lessened by the society of those we love and our satisfactions will be doubled by feeling for eachother  i did not at that time know the whole reason of the delight with which i accepted this generous invitation i settled at mrs gravess without any formal agreement and all my little matters were directly brought home  o how happy were many succeeding days how still more happy when contrasted with the misery that ensued we spent all the time together that business and attention to the shop would permit and we grudged every moment that was spent asunder i related to them a thousand entertaining stories and passages occasionally recollected from the poets and historians of antiquity and a secret emotion and inward ardour for pleasing gave me fluently to intersperse sentimental observations and pertinent digressions more delightful to my auditory than all my quoted authorities  i was now daily gathering health and strength to which the complacence of my mind greatly contributed when one evening mrs graves returned more dejected than ordinary i inquired into the cause with a solicitude and countenance that naturally expressed the interest i took in her concerns why my dear child says she perhaps i have been both impertinent and indiscreet but i meant all for the best you must know then that i have been on a visit to your father to my father madam even so i would to heaven that he were worthy to be called father to such a son but as i was saying  your father mr clement is in great circumstances he keeps his coach has taken a fine new house and lives at a high rate i sent in my name with notice that i came to him on business of consequence i was thereupon shown to a back parlour where he sat in company with mrs clement and a lusty ill looking young gentleman but your stepmother has a comely and good humoured countenance she also appears to be far advanced in her pregnancy mrs graves said your father take a seat what are your commands with me madam i came sir to let you know that your son mr hammel clement the best of human beings has been on the point of death have you nothing to say to me madam but what concerns my son hammel i have not i confess sir but that is more than enough it is very interesting and affecting and concerns you most nearly here mr clement for i will never more call him by the sacred name of father here i say he started up and catching at a book he pressed it to his lips and cried i swear by the virtue of this and all other holy books that i will never listen to any person who would speak a single word in behalf of hammel clement and so mrs give me leave to show you the way out again so saying he caught my hand and drew me to the door while i turned and cried to your stepmother o madam what sort of a heart is yours that refuses its intercession on this occasion but she gave me an eye and sneer of such a mischievous meaning as expressed the whole fiend under the guise of an angel when mr clement had taken me to the outward door i just turned and said i am sorry sir that a man of your grave and sensible appearance should suffer yourself to be so duped by people whose interest it is to deceive you but swelling into choler he gave me a violent push from him and clapped to the door in my face so that in short my dear child i fear i have done you harm where i meant you true service  it matters not my mother said i endeavoring to suppress a tear of tender resentment i will soon i trust procure some kind of independence on that barbarian and his fortune and while i have you and your arabella i shall want neither father nor friend  being now very nearly reestablished in my health i set out again in search after some employment that might suit me as i was strolling on tower hill i observed a shop on my left hand it was that of mr wellcot a bookseller and printer i stepped in and after some introductory discourse i asked him if he had occasion in the way of his business for a friend of mine a gentleman in distress but of parts and learning alas sir cried wellcot such creatures as you mention are a drug upon earth there is a glut of them in all markets i would give any one a broad piece per man who should deliver me from three or four of them who lie heavy on my hands not sir that they are greedy or idle in the least i can get one of these gentlemen as you are pleased to call them on whose education more money has been expended than at the common and legal interest would maintain a decent family to the end of the world i can get one of them i say to labor like a hackney horse from morning to night at less wages than i could hire a rascally porter or shoe boy for three hours i employ them occasionally in correcting the press or folding or stitching the sheets or running of errands but then sir they have all of them aspects of such a bilcous despondence that a man may with less melancholy behold a deaths head and really sir i could not stand it if custom as i may say did not harden me by the perpetual vision of these specter  while wellcot was speaking i made a secret vow against having any kind of commerce or concern with booksellers or printers for at least a century to come but fearing to be suspected as a party concerned i affected an air as easy as possible and observing some females who were busy in stitching pamphlets i asked him if they contained any thing new or entertaining  sir said wellcot this is an elaborate performance of the most eminent of our patriot writers i pay him at the lowest five guineas weekly and could any man write with double his spirit and genius i could better afford to give that author an hundred for good writings are like diamonds that are valued according to their carrats do but double their weight and they immediately become of twenty times the estimation  this pamphlet consisted of a sheet sewed in blew paper i instantly paid my twopence and sat down to peruse it i found that it contained several very free remonstrances against his majesty and the ministers for joining with france in the war against holland in opposition to the civil and religious interests of england together with a few collateral digressions in assertion of magna charta of the freedom of man in general and of britons in particular i perceived that it was written with much more judgment than genius and what said i to wellcot will you give to that man who shall confessedly excel this your most eminent of patriot writers upon his own subject and in his own way give sir cried the bookseller many thanks and a proportionable increase of profits enough sir i answered you shall soon hear from me again i wish you a good morrow  on my return i called at mr goodvilles but he had sailed for france about a fortnight before i then went about to a number of pamphletshops and bought up all the political papers that had any reference to the matter in hand  i sat down to my work like a hungry man to his victuals and i grudged my heart those short indulgencies which it enjoyed in the society of the two objects of its fondest affections  having finished my first paper in about a fortnight i entitled it the weekly monitor and took it directly to wellcots here sir said i is my friends first venture but has your friend demanded wellcot in a discouraging accent sent the usual indemnity for the first impression of a young author that shall not be wanting i answered if you require it mr wellcot why said he i do not take upon me to be a judge in these matters and yet custom has given me a shrewd sort of a guess come sir i have a few minutes to throw away and they are at your service  he then sat down and having read about a dozen lines ay ay says he they dont always do thus at newmarket your friend i find has set out at the top of his speed going on something further he cried well supported by  and then proceeding to the third page this says he must have been stolen from one of the ancients because there is no modern who could write like it well sir you need not give yourself further trouble for the present i will print this first paper at my own suit desire your friend to be careful about the second call to me in a week and i think i shall be able to tell you something that will please you  how diligent is expectation how elevated is hope i returned with the feathers of mercury at my heels i set about my second paper with double genius and application my ideas were more expanded my spirits more sublimed all the persuasives of cicero all the thunder of demosthenes all that i had read on the topic of liberty in popular governments or commonwealths occurred to my remembrance  i finished my second essay within the week i went with it to wellcot and he presented me at sight with twenty guineas it is more said he than hitherto comes to your share but i love to encourage and i trust that in the run i shall not be a loser i sell this pamphlet for two pence nearly two fourths thereof go to printing paper etc another fourth i reserve as an equivalent for my application and knowledge in this way and the remainder is a redundance which on extraordinary tides ought to flow to the writer the demand for this paper has been very uncommon and by what i can judge the sale may in time amount to twelve thousand you need not sir be ashamed to acknowledge yourself the author preserve but a moiety of the spirit of this elijah with which you have set out and my own interests will instruct me to serve you effectually  i now returned as in a triumphal chariot i never before received the prize as i may say of personal prowess the fortune of my father the fortune of all men living who were merely born to fortune diminished beneath me o how sweet said i to myself how delicious are the fruits of a mans own plantation then like the sagacious and independent spider his labors will be crowned with personal honor and success while he spins his subsistence from his proper bowels it is then and then only that a man may be said to be the true proprietor of what he possesses and the value is endeared and the enjoyment doubled thereby  i hastened to impart my transports to the two loved objects of all my cares and satisfactions jenny told me that her mistress was not at home but that miss arabella was above in her closet i ran up i tapped at the door but no one answered again i tapped and added the soft voice of affection requesting to be admitted at length she opened but looked pale and with swollen and downcast eyes i perceived she had been in tears and a sudden frost fell upon all my delights what is the matter miss i cried my sister my sweet friend my dearest arabella and i gently took her hand between both of mine i wish you had not come at this time mr clement said she coolly but you must permit me to keep my little griefs to myself yes i replied if it is your pleasure to torture to kill me outright refuse me my portion in your interests and concerns o mr clement says she your soul is too generous i dare not tell you i feel what you would suffer should you know that you are concerned in the cause of my tears but we must part sir indeed we must we must part mr clement and that suddenly  here her voice failed and throwing herself into a chair she burst out afresh into a gush of affliction while i stood astonished and dropping beside her on one knee awaited with unspeakable anguish the suspension of her grief  at length perceiving my situation rise sir she cried i entreat you to rise and take a chair beside me and i will tell you as fast as i can of this distressful business  you must know that i was a while ago to the miss hodginses they are very friendly and good young women and told me in confidence though with much concern of a whisper in the neighborhood that my aunt had entertained a young gentleman in the house who was admitted to such familiar and convenient intimacies as could not at all times be without their consequence especially between persons of our age and sex  now mr clement i am no way ashamed to confess that i have nothing in heaven but my innocence nor on earth but my character and i think you wish me better than to desire that i should forfeit the one or the other desire it o heavens i suddenly exclaimed i will for ever guard them both to the last drop of my blood and last breath of my life alas cried arabella you are the man of all others whom the world would not admit for my champion in this case they are absolute judges they ought to be obeyed our parting will be painful but it must be complied with  but my sister my arabella most lovely and most beloved of all the human species tell me says i my angel is there no other way no expedient to satisfy a misdeeming world save a remedy that is worse than death itself no said she with an air somewhat resolute and exalted there is no other expedient at least no other to which i can consent o miss graves answered i with a hasty dejection if that is the case you shall be obeyed i am indeed very unhappy but i will not be importunate adieu dearest of creatures adieu for ever i spoke and suddenly withdrew and gave her as i imagined the last farewell look  hold sir she cried pray stay a moment i should be wretched beyond expression if you went away in the greatest of all errors but is it possible you should think that i could mean any slight to you mr clement no sir no of all men living indeed it was not possible i spoke through an humble sense of my own demerits my determination was just i do not repent me of it i  i  perhaps sir i have not understood you  indeed i scarce know what i say or mean myself  of this however be assured that i neither do nor ever did nor ever can mean any offense to mr clement  while she spoke i had kneeled before her i took her hand and pressed it to my lips and bosom my arabella said i i confess that this was no premeditated motion of mine nay this very morning the world should not have prevailed with me to have accepted this hand for which i now kneel i was then poor and wretched without resource and i could not think of bringing distress upon her independent of whose happiness i could have no enjoyment i was sensible that i loved you with infinite tenderness with unspeakable ardour but my passion did not dare to admit of desire i could have suffered all things to have heaped blessings upon you but i would not permit to my soul the distant though dear wish of being happy with you  ah what posture is this exclaimed arabella nay you shall not stir i cried nor will i rise till you have heard me a few words since morning i say i have got room to hope that my arabella would not be so unhappy as i feared in being united to me i will not urge her however i leave her free i leave her mistress of her own will and actions but here i vow to heaven that whether she live or die consent or not consent i will never marry another i am from this moment her wedded for eternity the faithful and fond husband of her image and remembrance  so saying i rose and seated myself beside her she looked astonished and affected beyond the power of utterance but covering her face with a handkerchief she gently leaned toward me and shed a plenteous shower of tears upon my bosom  when mrs graves returned i told her of my extraordinary success at the booksellers i had before made her the treasurer of my little possessions and i poured my twenty pieces into her lap  arabella as i conjectured did not delay to impart to her aunt the late adventure for i observed that the eyes of that good woman dwelt upon me with a fresh accession of fondness and delight  having finished my third paper i took it to wellcot who presented me with twenty guineas and further acknowledged himself my debtor returning homeward i cast up in a pleasing kind of mental arithmetic how much my weekly twenty guineas would amout to at the years end and found it much beyond my occasions even in the state of matrimony  i now looked upon myself as in the certain receipt of a plentiful income and this encouraged me to press for the completion of my happiness decency alone could give difficulty or delay in an affair that was equally the wish of all parties we were privately married in the presence of the miss hodginses and two or three other neighbors and i was put into possession of the blushingest fearfullest and fondest of all brides  job very justly says shall we receive good at the hands of god and not receive evil and yet i imagine that the recollection of past happiness rather heightens than alleviates the sense of present distress my soul in those days enjoyed a tide of delight to the fullness of its wishes and to the stretch of its capacity i thought that till then no person had ever loved as i loved but the love of my arabella was a kind of passion that wanted a new name whereby to express it it was an absence a sort of death to all other objects it was a pleasure too paining a distressful attention the avarice of a miser who watches over his hoard and joins to the rapture with which he beholds it the terrifying ideas of robbery and loss  i had now within the space of five weeks received about one hundred and twenty guineas on the sale of my monitor when going abroad one evening i was stopped within a few doors of my house by a genteel looking person who asked if my name was clement it is sir i answered then sir says he i arrest you in his majestys name for sedition and a libel against the government then beckoning to three or four sergeants that attended he had me directly seized and conveyed toward newgate  as i was not of a timorous temper nor conscious of the smallest tincture of the crimes with which i was charged i should have made little more than a jest of this business had i not trembled for the apprehensions of those who i knew would tremble for me  on the way this officer informed me that my bookseller had betrayed me and had confessed to the ministers that i was the author of a famous pamphlet entitled the weekly monitor being delivered to the keeper i put a few pieces into his hand and was conducted to a decent apartment considering the place  i immediately sent for humphrey cipher esquire sergeant at law whom i had once occasionally feed in behalf of mrs graves and i sent at the same time for a set of the weekly monitor when mr cipher came i put five pieces into his hand and having told him my case i requested him to peruse the papers in question and to give me his opinion thereon  having read them with due attention mr clement says he i perceive that you are a learned and ingenious young gentleman but i find that you are better acquainted with the republics of greece than with the nature and constitution of our limited monarchy hence alone has proceeded some lapses and misapplications that your adversaries would lay hold of yet there is nothing grossly scurrilous or malicious throughout nor what may amount to the incurring of a praemunire by the most violent constraint or wresting of the sense if you are inclined says he to proceed in the course of these papers i would advise you to put in bail and to stand the action but as i am persuaded that the court have commenced this prosecution as a matter merely in terrorem to deter you from a work that gives them great disgust if you have any genteel friend who would solicit in your favor and promise a future conduct more amenable to power you would undoubtedly be discharged without further cost or trouble  i returned my warm acknowledgments to the sergeant for his friendly counsel and told him i would consider of it before i gave him further trouble when he was gone i dispatched a letter to mrs graves wherein i gave her an account of my present situation in a manner as little alarming as possible i requested her to provide bail for my appearance at bar but insisted that till this was done neither she nor arabella should come to my prison and that i had given express orders that they should not be admitted  alas had they complied with my directions how happy might we have been all together at this day but the excess of their goodness was the cause of our common ruin their affection would not be satisfied with simple bail and they resolved never to rest till they had procured my full discharge  they went about to all their customers of any distinction they solicited petitioned and bribed without measure they borrowed money to the utmost extent of their credit and pawned or sold all their effects under prime cost they gave a purse to one to bring them acquainted with another on whom they bestowed a larger sum to introduce them to a third having at length made their way to lord stivers an agent of the minister he thought he saw an advantage in granting their request and my discharge was made out without further delay  on the fifth evening from my imprisonment the door of my chamber opened and in came my dear aunt with my dearer arabella they flew upon me they clasped me on each side in their arms and my wife instantly swooned away upon my bosom she soon revived however at the known voice of love and as every door for my enlargement had been previously opened we went down stepped into the coach and drove home directly  here i saw the first subject and cause of alarm the shop was shut up i was shocked and felt a sudden chilness come upon me but did not venture to inquire except by my eyes  the kettle being down and all seated to tea i introduced the affair with an affected unconcern and by question after question artfully extracted from my companions the whole history and adventures of the five preceding days whereby i found that they had expended in my behalf beyond the last penny of their own substance and that nothing remained save one hundred and fifty pounds to which the several deposits amounted which i had made with mrs graves  i could now no longer contain myself cruel women inhuman friends i cried the bitterness of enmity the rancour of malice could never have brought an evil like this upon me accursed wretch that i am ordained to be the instrument of perdition to those whom i would feed with my blood and foster with my vitals would to heaven i had not been born or would i had been cut off by some quick and horrid judgment ere this had happened  here mrs graves drew her chair close to mine and catching me about the neck and dropping upon me a few tears that she struggled to suppress dont grieve my child she cried dont afflict yourself for nothing all is as it should be there is no harm done your arabella and i can always earn genteel and independent bread without shop or other means than the work of our hands we can never want my hammy we have done nothing for you neither has any thing happened wherewith you ought to reproach yourself what we did was for ourselves for the relief of the anguish of our own hearts to bring you home to us again as soon as possible my son since we found that we could live no longer without you  within a few days i perceived that my dear aunt began to decline in her health perhaps occasioned by her late fatigue and anxiety of spirits i brought an able physician to her but he could form no judgment of the nature of her disorder till some time aster when her complexion began to change and the doctor declared her to be in the jaundice he began to apply the customary medicines and no care nor expense was spared for her recovery arabella and i sat up with her alternately every night and all the day we read to her some book of amusement in order to dissipate the melancholy of her disease but alas all our cares and remedies our attention and solicitude our prayers and our tears proved equally unsuccessful and at the end of five months she expired within our arms  arabella then quitted her hold and crossing her arms upon her bosom and looking eagerly on the face once so lovely and always boloved you are then at peace said she my mother o death had thou not enough of terrors in thy aspect without adding to thy agonies those of tearing from us that which we prized above life o my friend my only parent my dearest dearest mother  she could no more but immediately fainted away upon the body  i took her up in my arms and carrying her into the next room i laid her on the bed i ordered jenny and the two nursekeepers to take care of her recovery and charged them not to permit her to see her aunt any more  i then returned to the chamber wherein the precious ruins of the half of my world was laid i locked the door within side i approached the body and hung over it and gazed upon it with inexpressible emotion i repeatedly clapped my hands together i stooped down and kissed and rekissed her cold lips in an agony of affection i gave a free scope to my tears sobs and lamentations ah i cried my parent my patroness ah mother to the son of your unhappy election have i lost you my only prop are you for ever departed from me my support and consolation i was abandoned by the world by friends father and relations but you became the world and all relations to me i was a stranger and you took me in i was sick and in prison and you ministered unto me but you are gone you are gone from me afar off and i die a thousand deaths in the anguish of surviving you here you lie my mother the victim of your goodness to your unlucky guest wretch that i am doomed to bring no portion save that of calamity to those who regard me woe of woes where now shall i ease my soul of its insupportable burden of the debt with which it labors to this kind creature she will no more return to take aught at my hands and i must suffer the oppression through life and through eternity  having thus vented the excesses of my passion my spirits subsided into a kind of gloomy calm i returned to my wife  but i see sir you are too much affected i will not dwell on this melancholy scene any longer  when i had discharged doctors fees apothecaries bills and funeral expenses i found that our fortune did not amount to fifty pounds my wife was now far advanced in her pregnancy her labor was hastened by her grief and late fatigues and she was delivered of that boy whom your charity a second time brought into this world  as i was now all things to my arobella the only consolation she had upon earth i never left her during her illness by the time she was up and about what with the charges of child bearing and a quarters rent etc our fund was again sunk within the sum of ten pounds and i was going one evening to look out for some employment when we heared a rapping of distinction at the door  jenny came in a hurry and brought us word that lord stivers was in the parlour and desired to speak with me i went down greatly surprised and something alarmed at his visit mr clement says he with a familiar air i have long wished to see you but i did not think it seasonable to disturb you during the misfortune of your family and the illness of your wife your weekly monitors have genius and spirit but they have done some mischief which we wish to have remedied as how pray my lord why mr clement i never knew a writing in favor of liberty or against any measures of government which the populace did not wrest in favor of licentiousness and to the casting aside of all manner of rule now mr clement we want you to undertake our cause which is by much the more reasonable and orderly side of the argument in short we want you to refute your own papers  o my lord i answered i should think it an honor to serve your lordship or the ministry on any other occasion but in a matter that must bring public infamy upon me indeed my lord you must excuse me i should be pointed at as an apostate and prostitute by all men and bring my person and writings into such disgrace as would for ever disable me from serving either myself or your lordship  well sir replied my lord i will not then insist on a formal refutation of your own writings i only ask if you are willing to engage in our quarrel as far as is consistent with honor and truth i am my lord i rejoined as far as is consistent with my own credit and the good of my country  the good of your country mr clement says my lord i hope you do not think that government is contrary to the good of your country pray in what do you make this liberty consist of which you are become so eminent a patron  there are two sorts of liberty my lord i answered the first constitutes the duty and happiness of a man independent of community the second constitutes the privilege and happiness of a man merely as he is a member of any state or commonwealth  independent of community a man is so far free and no further than he acts up to the dictates of reason and duty in despite of inward appetite and outward influence  as a member of community a man is so far free and no further than as every other member of that community is legally restrained from injuring his person or encroaching on his property  inimitably well definded cried his lordship i have read volumes in folio upon the subject but never knew what liberty was before well mr clement as this liberty of yours is in all respects so opposite to the licentiousness i was talking of it cannot but make mainly in favor of good government i therefore request you to write a treatise to the purpose of your definition and to take us with you as far as you can we shall not be ungrateful we are good paymasters sir why do you hesitate did you not tell me you were disposed to serve us  my lord i replied i fear i should fall greatly short of your expectations i am not studied in the constitution of modern states and how should i be able to justify any government with respect to measures that perhaps are a secret to all except the ministers i must further observe to your lordship that my former field would be greatly contracted on this occasion it is very easy and obvious to find fault and to call in question but to vindicate truth itself against popular prejudice hoc opus hic labor est  mr clement says my lord i am proud that we have got a gentleman of so much honesty and ingenuity to befriend us it shall be my care to provide you with materials and i am confident that so great a master of his instrument as you are will make excellent music on a few fundamental notes here are twenty guineas earnest and ten guineas shall be paid you weekly till we can fix you in some station of due honor and advantage i will take a glass or a dish of tea with you in a few days and wish you a good evening  on the third morning after this interview my lord returned with a large bundle of antipatria pamphlets in his chariot and some manuscript notes and hints for my instruction he breakfasted with us and was easy polite and cheerful  i now entered on my new province but not with usual ardour as i had formerly lashed the insolence encroachments and rapaciousness of power less ambitious of conquest over aliens and enemies than over the very people it was ordained to protect i now on the other hand rebuked with like acrimony the riotous factious and seditious propensities of a turbulent licentious and unsatisfied people ever repugnant to government and reluctant to the rein of the gentlest ruler i proved from many authorities and instances derived from greece and rome that power is never so dangerous to a populace as when it is taken into their own hands that the governors and governed by the violence of collision are apt to fly to extremes on either side that anarchy is the most direct of all roads to tyranny and that a people who have no will to be governed reduce themselves to the necessity of being crushed insulted and governed whether they will or no  now sir though i thus alternately sided with the people against power and with power against the people yet i struck at nothing but faults on either hand and equally asserted on both sides of the question the cause of my country of liberty and truth  i took five times the pains with these latter papers that i had with the former and yet i confess i had not equal pleasure in the delivery i am also persuaded that these had more than double the merit of the other and in point of sentiment moral and general instruction were of twenty times the value to mankind but how can that instruct which is not attended to it was intimated to the people that these had been written at the instance of their governors and they would not have listened to an oracle if uttered from that quarter  six months had now elapsed in these lucubrations i had delivered to my wife two hundred and sixty guineas the weekly price of my labors we had lived with great frugality arabella had again taken in as much work as her nursing and attention to the child would admit and we had some pieces left of our former remnant when lord stivers called in upon me with pleasure and good news as it were prologue in his aspect  mr clement says he i want to speak to you apart i had yesterday some talk with the minister about you and he has promised me four hundred a year pension for you till something better can be done and this is to be wholly clear and over your weekly wages of ten guineas while we keep you so hard at work but tell me clement says he laying his hand with an affectionate familiarity upon my shoulder are you of a jealous temper the furthest from it my lord of any man breathing o i am glad of that but if you were i have nothing exceptionable to propose to be short half a dozen of noblemen all my friends and people of strict probity and virtue have engaged to spend a share of tomorrow in a party of pleasure upon the thames and we have each of us laid a bet of a hundred guineas that from the number of his relations his friends or acquaintance he will bring the prettiest woman to this field of contention i had fixed on lady fanny standish a lovely creature and a relation of my own but she unfortunately happened to be preengaged to one of my rivals i am therefore quite at a loss and must infallibly lose my wager if you do not favor me with the company of mrs clement with her i can make no question of conquest and i give you my honor to pour into her lap the whole five hundred guineas the just prize of her beauty  why my lord i answered this is indeed a very pleasant project and has nothing in it exceptionable that i can perceive if no one was to know any thing of the matter but what will the world say to see your lordship so paired shaw damn the world clement i am your world man your lordship has a very good right to damn an inferior world i rejoined but the world has an equal right and would certainly make use of it in the damnation of my wife what said he warmly you will not then confide her to my friendship and honor i will not my lord confide her honor unnecessarily to any man from under that guardianship and protection which i vowed to her in marriage it is very well mr clement you may hear from me tomorrow and away he went  he was as good as his word the very next morning i was arrested at his suit for two hundred and fourscore guineas the amount of all that i had received from him and i was hurried to the fleet prison without being permitted to speak to any one  as my lord knew that on issue i must cast him in his action and further come upon him for special damage and false duress it instantly occurred that this was merely a stratagem for the seduction of my arabella and her defenseless state gave me inexpressible torture i immediately wrote her an account of my situation and apprehensions which unhappily for all parties were too well founded but sir i will give you a detail of these extraordinary events in the order of time in which they happened as i afterward learned them from the mouth of my wife and from the testimony of others on trial in public court  before my wife could have the least intelligence of my confinement my lord paid her a visit and entering with his accustomed freedom and good humor mrs clement says he i am come to prevent your being alarmed when you should hear that i sent your husband to the fleet prison this morning but to convince you that i intend him no manner of harm i have here brought you the money for which he was arrested and it is at your own choice to release him within this hour or on the feast of saint simpleton if you are not in a hurry so saying he put a large purse into her hand and pray my lord then demanded arabella on what account was it that you had him arrested to punish him answered my lord for being the most jealouspated coxcomb in europe jealous my lord pray of whom can he be jealous of you and i madam of us my lord sure we never gave him cause no that i will be sworn rejoined my lord but more is the pity the jealousy came first and the cause ought now in all conscience to follow  before the last words had escaped his mouth he sprung forward and catching her in his arms he pressed and kissed her with the rudest ardour but quickly disengaging herself and pushing him violently from her i see youre a villain she cried and desire that you will instantly quit my house and so saying she threw the purse out at the door my lord however stood his ground and looking at her with astonishing ease and unconcern mrs clement says he the destiny of your husband and yourself is in my hands and i must tell you it does not become you to treat your best friend in so injurious a manner i have here brought you a settlement of five hundred a year for life it is perfected to you without condition and how far you will be grateful lies wholly at your own election may heaven forsake me she cried when i accept the smallest advantage from you or your fortune well well arabella replied my lord i must and will have you on your terms or my own but if you had really a mind to contest this business with me what a little fool you were so simply to cast away the sinews of war i leave you child for the present to wiser reflections then insolently smiling in her face he retired  as soon as he was gone my wife hurried to the miss hodginses and prevailed upon one of them to keep her company till she should be able to procure my enlargement she then went to a person who dealt in household furniture and requested him to come the next morning and make a purchase of some goods that she had to dispose of and lastly she writ me a letter with an account of all these matters and a promise to be with me the day following  i should have apprised you before this that our faithful and affectionate jenny had forsaken us a small legacy had been left her whereupon she quitted service and went to live with her parents and we were obliged to hire a strange maid in her room  the next day arabella sold as much of her furniture to the forementioned dealer and some neighbors as amounted to upward of forty guineas she had put these with her former deposit of two hundred and sixty into her pocket it was now afternoon and she was joyfully preparing to come and give me freedom when our new maid entered and told miss hodgins that a lady waited for her at home on earnest business but promised not to detain her above five minutes alas miss hodgins was scarce gone when lord stivers entered and my wife giving a violent shriek dropped backward in a chair  lord stivers thereupon drew another chair and with an impudent appearance of tenderness seated himself beside her my dear arabella said he dont be alarmed by  i am not come to do you the smallest injury i tell you however that youre wholly in my power your street door is bolted i have two able footmen below in your kitchen and the maid who contrived to get your friend out of the way is much more my servant than yours i assure you i have loved you long my arabella and the frequent visits i paid are to be placed to your credit and not to that of the stupid polities with which i amused your husband and now my angel if you will make any concession but the slightest return to the excess of my passion and fondness for you i here vow to you perpetual faith and constancy for life and both my fortune and person shall be wholly devoted to you but dont attempt to impose dont hope to deceive me  no no my lord she cried i will not deceive you by pretending to sacrifice the least article of duty to your person or fortune i see that i am in danger on the brink of perdition i see that hell is strong and subtle at devices heaven save me any how strike stike me dead this instant you thunders and earthquakes that once were my terrors be now my deliverers  why my arabella says lord stivers this is all very sine it is the sweetest rant i ever heard and you are the sweetest girl upon my soul that ever i saw i perceive that you are really alarmed my love but what is it that frights you you shall never receive any treatment from me save proofs of the fondness and violence of my affection recall your spirits child and prepare yourself with patience for what must be for i swear to you arabella by  etc etc that no power in the universe shall snatch you this hour from the ardour of my caresses  the wretched object of the lust of this barbarous man then dropped upon her knees in a frantic agony o god she cried out if you are in heaven if you hear and see these things if virtue and purity are not an offense unto you send send and deliver me by some sudden salvation o my lord once our generous patron and protector the friend and support of our declining house would you now tumble into deep and irreparable ruins the work of your own hands alas you know not what you do you cannot guess at the horrors you are about to perpetrate if ever you had a touch of pity if ever  but what shall i say if you do not like devils delight in the miseries of wretches damned for eternity shield shield me my dear lord be you yourself my savior from this my hour of terrors from this hell that is come upon me i have already suffered the pangs of death in the bare apprehension i will never live to bear in me and about me a detestable being hope it not dream not of it by heaven i will not a moment survive my pollution o mercy mercy mercy and so saying her voice was stopped by an agony of sobs and tears  charming girl enchanting creature exclaimed the deliberate villain every action every word intended to dissuade are fresh fuel and incitement to my passion for you my arabella but i see that you will not consent to my happiness and that i must give you an apology for your acceptance of any favor or fortune at my hands  so saying he arose and up she sprung at the instant and running to the furthest corner of the room recollected all her spirits and force for her defense she struggled and shrieked and called out upon heaven and earth to save her but no help appearing nigh she suddenly recollected a pair of long and sharp pointed scissars that she had in her pocket and in the moment that lord stivers threw her prone upon the floor she drew them forth and aiming at him with all her strength she almost buried the weapon in his left side whereat he gave a loud curse and over he tumbled gasping and grovelling beside her  up she got with all haste and running to the cradle where her infant lay crying she caught him in her arms and opening the chamber door softly and shutting it after her she stepped down stairs as upon feathers and stealing to the street door she opened it suddenly rushed into the street and hurried on till she came to a stand of coaches where she hired the first she met threw herself hastily into it and desired the man to drive with speed to the fleet prison  on her arrival she discharged the action and fees of arrest with all possible dispatch and then hurried up to my apartment on the first glimpse i sprung to her and caught her in my arms with unspeakable transport but finding the child with her and observing that her breath was quick and uneven i withdrew a step or two and looked eagerly at her and perceiving that she was pale and had a kind of wildness in her eyes and motions what is the matter my love i cried what has happened to you i have not been well she answered with an affected unconcern before the keeper but pray come down my dear you are much wanted and the coach is in waiting  nothing further passed between us till we got into the coach and that my wife desired the man to drive to some neighboring street and to stop at the first door where he saw a bill for lodgings for lodgings again i demanded for whom does my arabella desire to take lodgings for you and i mr clement for you and i she cried wringing her hands together lord stivers lies weltring in his blood at our house deprived of life within this half hour by my unhappy hand  i was suddenly struck dumb with surprise and horror all the occasions and consequences of this direful event whirled through my imagination in a fearful succession what must now become of my souls sole enjoyment what indignities must have been offered what violation might she not or rather must she not have suffered before she could be brought to perpetrate so terrible a deed i grew instantly sick and putting my head through the window desired the coachman to stop at the first tavern i ordered the drawer to nasten with a pint of spanish white wine to the door and i pressed and compelled my wife to swallow a part our spirits being in some degree settled thereby we drove to a private street on the right hand of cheapside where i took a back room and closet up two pair of stairs at one mrs jennetts an old maid and a mantuamaker i immediately ordered a fire to be kindled and the teathings to be laid and giving the servant a crown desired her to bring the value in proper ingredients  the evening was now shut in and while the maid was abroad not a syllable passed between my wife and me i dreaded to enquire of what i still more dreaded to understand and arabella seemed to labor under some mighty oppression when retiring to the closet where our bed stood she covered her child up warm and kneeling down by his side broke forth into a violent torrent of tears intermingled with heavings and half strangled sobs  i sat still without seeming to observe her emotion i was sensible that nature wanted this kindly relief the teas and sugars were brought the kettle put on the fire and the maid again retired when i gently called to my arabella to come forth with a voice of the truest love and softest endearment that ever yet breathed from a human bosom  her eyes were already wiped her countenance composed and her motions and demeanor much more settled than before she sat down with a rising sigh which she checked with a half smile my arabella said i my only joy my unmeasured blessing what is it that thus distracts my dearer part of existence your mind your spirit my angel is still pure and unpolluted and bodies are merely as bodies incapable of defilement being doomed from our birth to dissolution and corruption  ah my hammy she exclaimed you are quite beside the mark i sigh not i weep not i grieve not for myself i fear not nor regard the consequences however fatal of what has happened suppose a sudden and shameful death i thank my god for it death will offer me up a victim still pure and unpolluted but o the wretched stivers what is now become of him sent so sudden and unprovided to his eternal audit unhappy that i am perhaps an instrument of perdition to an immortal being ah rather that i had not been born would i had perished in his stead a death in the cause of virtue had been my advocate for mercy  how is this my arabella i cried is condemnation then to be brought upon the good because they oppose themselves to evil would you have censured any one living except yourself for having given you this deliverance by the death of the ravisher no surely in the daily and nightly robberies massacres and assassinations that the violent machinate against the peaceful is it the fault of those who stand in the defense of righteousness that villains often perish in the act of transgression tell me my sweet mourner in the sacking of a city when the lustful and bloody soldiery are loosed to their whole delight in burnings rapes rapines slaughters howlings and violations is it the perpetrators of all these horrors that you compassionate when they happen to be crushed in the ruins they have wrought meritorious my arabella most meritorious were that hand who should cut a whole host of such infernals from the earth remaining innocence and virtue would be his debtors for ever commiseration to the flagitious is cruelty to the just and he who spares them becomes the accomplice of all their future crimes  during tea my wife gave me an ample narrative of all that happened at our house while i was in confinement as she spoke i was first speechless with fearful and panting expectation i was then kindled into fury and a vehement thirst of vengeance and lastly i was elevated into an aweful rapture i looked at my wife with eyes swimming with love and veneration i rose from my seat i threw myself on my knees before her adorable creature i cried divine arabella supreme excellence of women thus let me worship through the pure of all mediums that godhead who inspires and delights in such perfections  our fortune was now reduced to very little more than fifteen guineas we had no clothes but what we wore and we did not dare to go or send to our house for others neither to make ourselves known to any acquaintance we went by the name of stapleton and on the following night i ventured abroad and bought for myself a few secondhand shirts with a common gown and some changes of linen for my wife  on the fifth day at breakfast while arabella was casting her eye over a newspaper that she had borrowed from mrs jennett she turned suddenly pale what she cried before i could question her accused for robbery as well as murder that is hard indeed but i trust that my lot shall not exceed my resignation and so saying she handed me over the paper with a smile in which heaven appeared to open  the advertisement ran thus  whereas arabella clement alias graves did on the   th day of september instant most barbarously stab and murder the rt hon james  late lord stivers at a house of ill report where she formerly had kept a milliners shop in fleet street and whereas she did further rob the said rt hon etc of a large purse of money his gold repeater snuff box diamondring etc and did lastly flee for the same as may be proved and is evident from the examination and testimony of three concurring witnesses now his majesty in his gracious abhorrence of such crimes does hereby promise a reward of three hundred guineas to any person who shall stop discover or arrest the said arabella so as that she may be brought to condign and adequate punishment if any such may be found for such unequalled offenses  o said my wife i perceive that my enemies will swear home indeed their plunder of lord stivers can no way be assured save by my condemnation but be it as it may that providence who overules the wickedness of this world may yet give submission a clue to escape its perplexities and my innocence i trust will be an equivalent to all that the world can inflict and much more than an equivalent to all that it can bestow  i now had every thing to fear for my arabella as well from the interested villainy of the witnesses as from the power of the ministry and the resentment of the relations of so great a man and i looked upon her death to be as certain as her caption had i been the first in remainder to the greatest estate in england i would have exchanged my whole interest for as much ready cash as would have served to convey us to some region of safety but this was not practicable with the very small remainder of the wreck of our fortune and we had taken our lodging certain at fifty shillings per quarter  we appeared as little as possible even to the lodgers of the house and i intimated to my landlady that it was the fate of many a gentleman to be obliged to abscond till his affairs could be compounded with hard hearted creditors  during the space of nine months our principal diet was weak tea and bread and if we ventured at odd times on a small joint of meat it served us cold hashed and minced from one week to the other  as my wife did not dare to take in work nor i to stir abroad to look for employment our chief entertainment was the reading some old folio books of history and divinity which i borrowed from mrs jennett and which had belonged to her father  how small must be the cravings of simple nature when a family like ours accustomed to affluence could subsist in london without murmuring for upward of nine months on less than eight guineas but our fund was now exhausted to a few shillings and my sword watch and buckles were also gone in discharge of our three quarters rent to the landlady ruin stared us in the face i beheld as it were a gulf unfathomable and impassable opening beneath our feet and heaven and earth joining to push us down the precipice  we yet lived a month longer on coarse bread and cold water with a little milk which we got now and then for the child but i concealed from my wife that we had not a single sixpence now left upon earth  i looked up to heaven but without love or confidence dreadful power i cried who thus breakest to powder the poor vessels of thy creation thou art said to be a bounteous and benevolent caterer to the spawn of the ocean and to the worms of the earth thou clothest the birds of the air and the beasts of the forest they hunger and find a banquet at hand thou sheddest the dew of thy comforts even on the unrighteous thou openest thy hand and all things living are said to be filled with plenteousness are we alone excepted from the immensity of thy works shall the piety of my wife shall the innocence of my infant thus famish unregarded and unpitied before thee  ah it is i who am the accursed thing who bring plagues upon all with whom i am connected even the labors of my life the issues of my honest industry have been changed by thy ordinances into nothing but damage to the imprisonment of my person to the ruin of those who had the misfortune to befriend me and to the death danger and desolation of all whom i held dear i strive in vain with thy omnipotence it is too mighty for me and crushes me below the center pour out then the vessels of thy wrath upon my head but on my head alone o just creator and take these littleones to thy mercy for they cannot have participated of the guilt thou art pleased to impute to me  the night was now advanced but that which fell upon my soul was a night which would admit no ray of comfort nor looked ever to behold another morning i wished for dissolution to myself to the universe i wished to see the two proprietors of my souls late affections now lying pale and breathless before my eyes i would not have endured my hell another moment i would have given myself instant death but i dreaded to leave my desolate widow and helpless orphan without a friend as i then conceived either in heaven or earth  my wife had lain down with her infant on the bed a sudden reflection started my death thought i may yet be useful to those for whom alone i could wish to live i rose frantically determined my brain was on fire i took down an old pistol which hung in a corner i put it into my breast down stairs i went and issued to the street  i was bent on something desperate but knew not what i had not gone far when i saw a large tavern open beside me i passed through the entry and running up stairs boldly entered the dining room where a numerous company of gentlemen sat round their bottle i clapped to the door and taking out the pistol gentlemen i cried i starve i die for want resolve instantly to relieve or to perish along with me  they all fixed their eyes upon me but the meager frenzy as i suppose which they saw in my countenance held them silent the person who was nearest directly took out his purse and presented it to me i again returned it to him and putting up my pistol no no sir i cried i will not take your gold i am no robber but give me some silver among ye to keep awhile from the grave three creatures who famish amidst a plentiful world  they all as by one consent put their hands to their pockets and instantly made a heap of upward of three pounds i devoured it with my eyes i beheld it as a mint of money and panting and grappling at it like a vulture i stuffed it into a side pocket and being too full of acknowledgment to thank my benefactors by word or token i burst forth into tears and turning from them i got once more into the street without any interruption  i made directly home and stepping softly up stairs i first restored the pistol to its old station i then went to the closet where my wife lay still asleep i gently awaked her by the fondness of my caresses my arabella i cried i have ventured out for the first time and heaven has sent us some small relief by a friend that i happened to meet here my love i said putting a crown into her hand call the maid and send out for some comfortable sustenance our fast has been long indeed  within a few days our strength and our spirits began to recruit though we still continued to live much within the bounds of temperance my soul again settled into a kind of sullen calm and looked forth though at a distance to some future dawning  one day as my landladys bible lay shut before me a sudden thought occurred i breathed up to god a short and silent ejaculation beseeching him to instruct me in what i ought to do by the passage upon which my thumb should happen to rest on opening the book i instantly made the venture and found the following words i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against thee and before heaven and am no more worthy to be called thy son  alas i was far from imagining at that time that it was no other than my father in heaven who called me and who would thereby have directed and conducted me to himself  i puzzled and racked my memory to discover in what i had given just offense to my earthly progenitor but resolved in all events to observe the admonition  in the dusk of the evening i tied my handkerchief sailorlike about my neck i pulled my wig forward and slouching my hat i slid out of doors and stooping half double i limped with a counterfeited gate toward my fathers i was duly apprizd that if i knocked at the door or directly enquired for him i should not be admitted i therefore walked to and again now near now aloof for near an hour before his door in patient expectation of his appearance  i had repeated this exercise for five successive evenings when the door at length opened and a servant in livery came up and accosted me is your name clement sir suppose it were says i supposing so replied he i am ordered to tell you that my master is well informed of all your wicked designs and that if ever you appear again in sight of his windows he will send you to newgate without bail or mainprize and prosecute you to the last of the laws of the land  we parted without another word and i crossed over the way to a chandlers shop the good woman of the house also happened to sell some small ale in her back apartments i called for a mugg and requested her company for a few minutes after some introductory chat i addressed her in a manner that i judged most engaging for one in her sphere she very freely told me the history of my father and his present family and further that it was his custom on every monday and friday to repair to the tradesmans club at the golden anchor in templelane about eight of the clock at night and not to return till about eleven  i went home something satisfied with this intelligence as i now knew where to find my unnatural parent though his last barbarous and insulting message had rendered me hopeless and quite averse to any kind of application to him  we had now lived three months longer on the last booty or charity i know not which to call it we were again reduced to the last shilling and what was still worse our landlady became importunate for her quarters rent my wife had lately requested her to look out for some sempstrywork among the neighbors this she promised to do but purposely declined as she and her family got the benefit of her labor gratis  i began again to return to my former evil thoughts i resolved to make war upon the whole race of man rather than my wife and infant should perish in my sight but i reflected that it was more equitable to begin with a father on whom nature had given me a right of dependence than to prey upon strangers on whom necessity alone could give me any claim  it was monday night the clock struck ten i took down the old pistol and marched toward the anchor i patroled near the place of expectation above an hour the night was excessive dark and no lamps in that part at length i listened to the sound of distant steps and soon after heard a voice cry murder murder robbery watch watch  i ran to the cry and perceived one man on the ground and another stooping in act to rifle his pockets i instantly drew my pistol and striking at the robbers head with my full force i laid him senseless on the pavement i then gently raised the other who was bleeding and stunned by the stroke he had received i supported him step by step toward a distant lamp where at length we arrived and found a tavern open i entered and ordered a room with fire and lights and desired that a surgeon should be immediately called the gentleman whose face was nearly covered with blood and dirt began now to recover his strength and senses i got him to swallow a small dram of spirits and he stepped with me up stairs scarcely leaning on my shoulder  while we sat at the fire and a napkin and warm water were getting ready the stranger grew passionate in his acknowledgments for the life which he said he owed me and which service he promised to recompense to the stretch of his power and fortunes but when he had washed and wiped away the blood and dirt from his face heaven what was my emotion at the sight of an aspect once so loved and so revered all my injuries and resentments vanished instantly from my memory i fell at his knees with a great cry is it you then my father my once dear my ever dear and lamented father is it the face of a father that i at last behold i burst into tears i wept aloud i interruptedly demanded will you not know me will you not own me will not nature speak in you will you not acknowledge your son your once beloved hammel so long the comfort of your age and the pride of your expectations  while i spoke my father looked wild and eager upon me he at length recollected me through all my leanness and poor apparel and hesitatingly replied i i i believe indeed you are my child hammel and strait fainted away  end of the first volume
