in universal esteem and liable to every ones observations yet it has not been my fortune to meet with any discourse written purposely upon the nature of them the essayists are apt to beat the imagination in search of strange and exotic subjects to write upon while a disquisition into their own works which are capable of affording matter so ample seems to be entirely overlooked by them in this resembling the human mind which while it enters into and examines the depth of all other sciences seems to consider nothing less than its own motions  most other kinds of writing have i think been the objects of criticism and rules and orders have been laid down for the writers of them to observe but in this species nobody is confined the only rule that i know and it is generally well observed is not only to go without but to go against all order and method whatsoever montaigne if i mistake not was the inventor of it and he is in all its beauties and faults the best pattern to examine it by he has a great deal of wit much good observation and some learning but his essays are wild rambling and incoherent some of them dont treat at all of the subjects proposed and others might as well have any other title as those they wear they are in effect like mr bayss prologue that would do either as prologue or epilogue or serve indifferently for any other play as well as that which it was written for  though there are to be found among the ancients some little tracts upon particular subjects which if they were written at this time would be called essays yet as they were generally if we except the symposiacks of plutarch made by receipts and done with a view to the rules which orators and declaimers laid down for such compositions the honor of this invention must still be ascribed to montaigne who first introduced that useful practice of digression into treatises upon select subjects and by giving us every whimsical conceit that came into his head has led us as it were dancing after his morality much more pleasantly than if we walked in the stilts or were directed by the leadingstrings which seneca had accustomed us to montaigne had a great many followers in france and some in this country but the best and he that excelled his original was la bruyere the finest and most delicate remarks the strongest sense and the justest reasoning all embellished by an elegance of style and a felicity of expression are to be found in his works to which we must add that the frequent egotisms the needless quotations the whimsical display of the authors character and manners at every period and other impertinences which pass upon some for humor are not to be met with in him he has all the variety and an appearance of the irregularity which pleases but entirely divested of the digression and distraction which consound and disgust the reader in these performances in short reading montaigne is hunting in a country where you start so much game as to spoil your sport while la bruyere gives you all the pleasure and variety of the chase without the fatigue of following the prey too far  without arraigning the taste of others i will venture to say that very little in this way worth observation has appeared at home till the tatler began to retail his pennyworths of wit several political tracts it is true have come forth and some argumentative discourses which had their shares of merit but did not come properly within this species of writing the character of bickerstaffe had it been real was more upon the humourist and whimsical than that of montaigne and i believe the fiction which was seen in it by being natural heightened the pleasure which it gave us besides the limits of his paper prevented his being so diffuse and prolix as we often find the frenchman who for want of such a confinement sometimes disgusts us the spectator and nestor ironside are characters also excellently well adapted to the creation of our pleasures by our knowledge of their being fictitious for such is our malignity of temper that we cannot forgive a real author acting or thinking oddly or idly though our entertainment arises from thence because we consider him as a reasonable man and obliged by a superior duty to another kind of behavior but we can indulge an imaginary or assumed personage in any ludicrous frolicksome or whimsical words or opinions because we know that he only plays the fool for our delight and amusement which we grudge him to do for his own thus montaignes faults are the beauties of bickerstaffe and ironside and thus cibber and hippesly are applauded on the stage for what they would in private life run the hazard of correction  certainly writing under an assumptive character is a fine improvement in this way and i believe the novelty of it without derogating from the wit humor good sense or excellent style of those mentioned papers made up the greatest part of their merit the little incidents of human life pieces of conversation and familiar arguments which may be thrown into writing under such a character give it the advantage of all other methods and i am of opinion it must eternally please and the success of the following papers when first published corroborates the opinion if as new matter is continually rising some geniuss could be found able to treat it in a manner equal to their predecessors though perhaps the stamp act first and then the rise and multiplication of weekly journals are now such impediments to a fair hearing in this method as almost amount to a prohibition of such essays for the future  the invention of weekly journals was i believe owing to the taste which the town began to entertain from the writings of the tatler spectator and others small essays were so much liked that it was imagined worth while to put a little wit and a great deal of history in a large quantity of paper and sell it for the same or a less price than the stamp duty had raised the half sheet treatise to the project succeeded and we have had several excellent things published in that way some that in their fame almost rivalld any thing that went before them but by the nature of their subjects ought to be excluded from this class of writing which whatever liberties men take ought never to be drawn into controversies about religion or government things that to be sure require a more orderly and regular manner of treating than is consistent with the freedom and latitude of an essay  but as i hinted before we have almost lost the advantage of entertaining in any other manner the journals come abroad so seldom that if a humor was begun men would forget it before it could be prosecuted and the jest would be lost before it was found the general way now of communicating our thoughts to the public is by distinct and unconnected letters to the author of this or that journal and the common assumed characters are a philosopher a critic or a divine in these some important point is constantly laid down and as gravely and solemnly discussed thus we intrude upon the pulpit and seem not to think that to mend the heart it is necessary to please the imagination  this certainly is missing the mark and these little essays are written in the truest taste when they cloth good sense with humor and embellish good morals with wit when they instruct familiarly and reprove pleasantly when they dont swell above comprehension nor sink below delicacy in short when they adapt the wisdom of the ancients to the gust of the moderns and constrain montaignes pleasantry within bickerstaffes compass  i cannot conclude without mentioning two objections which amongst others these sort of writings and their authors are liable to the first is that as from the nature of their subjects it is often necessary they should be occasional which requires dispatch and prevents that accuracy which much leisure and frequent reviews generally produce in other works that in such cases to sketch out or design well is as much as can be performed which certainly can give the mind but a half pleasure and so far the work must necessarily be imperfect  the second is to be found in ben johnsons discoveries which therefore take in his own words  some that turn over all books and are equally searching in all papers that write out of what they presently find or meet without choice by which means it happens that what they have discredited and impugned in one work they have before or after extolled the same in another such are all the essayists even their master montaigne these in all they write confess still what books they have read last and therein their own folly so much that they bring it to the stake raw and undigested not that the place did need it neither but that they thought themselves furnished and would vent it these objections had not been mentioned but that we believe the following pieces stand clear of them the reception which was at first given them encourages us in that thought and it is hoped that from a perusal of them the candid reader will entertain the same opinion  the plain dealer no i vol i  hoc est vivere bis vita posse priore frui mart monday march         when a stranger comes

a cane for i am naturally partial to the manufactures of my country and an irreconcilable enemy to the east india company  my father who was one of the cavaliers of the last century had a dash in his temper of what his mistresses called surly but he was of frank heart and simple manners there was an unlucky kind of contrast in his disposition for he was amorous but unpolished he seems to have been rather serious than witty yet he loved wit in others and was particularly charmed with the wantonness of mrs behn that arch baggage has made bold in her comedy called the rover both with his name and his character  whoever has seen ned blunt has seen not the copy but the very life of my father  he left me an estate rather moderate than plentiful which i have neither improved nor diminished i was naturally disposed to quiet and affected to think calmly for this reason i have obstinately resisted marriage i pass my summers at blunthall the ancient seat of our family in the dirtiest part of sussex my winters i enjoy in town where i am the oldest member now alive of an assembly of both sexes very numerous and diversified we meet twice a week at the house of a sober widow whom we placed there on purpose but because i delight in study and am an enemy to the faction and flutter of the polite end of the town i have my lodgings in a lowbuilt silent house in the city which has a large shady garden and covers the very spot where of old as stow tells me stood the watchtower of barbican  it has always been my custom to keep a daily account in writing of my actions and observations even to particulars of no seeming importance by help of these notes i live over again my past time and learn wisdom from my follies  i have lately been reflecting and taken it stongly into my fancy that wanting children of my own i should be every bodys father i have so many things to say and am so naturally fond of teaching that i promise my self no small fame from the success of my weekly counsel the subject of my paper gave me little or no pain my propensity to talking required that it should be general and unboundedly copious but the name was a difficulty that i could not easily get over that large part of mankind which consists of superficialists judging every thing by appearance taste but coldly of a meaning which is not dressed to their relish and the will that is too stubborn to bend to the fancy shall hardly be able to work upon the understanding  this doubt was so knotty that i submitted it to the assembly where a learned clergyman spoke first and was for calling it the inquisitor he was honestly proceeding to give his reasons for that name but was smartly interrupted by an aldermans wife who with eyes full of fire and face as red as her ribbands told him that however the inquisition might agree with his principles it would never go down with honest people and protestants  if you desire said she to me that your paper should be read by the friends of the government you should give it a sober name and call it the truthteller  a pert coquet who sat next her a toast and a great fortune burst into a loud laugh oh heavens cried the gipsey i shall faint at the odious formality of that title ah madam how could you be so unreasonably mistaken the truthteller  lord deliver us why the court can never bear it and all the gay world will despise and abhor it  no no if you wish your paper to spread and grow public you have nothing to resolve but to call it the secret  for my part answered a grave virgin about fifty i think they would do well to entitle it the coquet there is scarce a fop in town but would be fond of that name for he would consider the paper as his property  a famous critic interposing remarked that the taste of the age was so vitiated that no name could be acceptable unless it were musical and the wind says he of modern arguments being an overmatch for their weight i am for calling it the bagpipe  oh much rather the flute replied the coquet the bagpipe is so filthy so horrible an instrument that twould be impossible to bear the sound of it unless twere introduced in an opera  a justice of the quorum my next neighbor in the country and an eminent foxhunter maintained with invincible strength both of voice and authority that it ought by all means since it was intended for society to be called the good fellow but he bowed and changed his mind when our aldermans young daughter who sat at her mothers elbow blushed and whispered in his ear that for her part she could think of no name that would be so pretty as the sweetheart  an old maid of the widows to whom for pleasantrysake we indulge the familiarity and privilege of impertinence had been standing all this while behind her mistresss chair and broke out on a sudden with an air of amazement hey day if you must whip it about thus and keep it constantly spinning the best thing you can do is to call it the whirligig all the company laughed at the wenchs conceit till the critic assumeing a surpised and decisive air assured us positively it must take for that no body could fail to expect as much wit at least in the whirligig as in the whatdyecall it  i was unsatisfied with all this and having a natural partiality to my own character i bethought myself of the plain dealer the whole assembly agreed in approbation of that name and gave it as their jointopinion that whether it would be generally liked or no it was never more generally wanted  the ladies when they hear that my design is plain dealing will consider me perhaps as an oldfashioned fellow who can have nothing to do with them yet i know they will be frequently kind enough to furnish me with business and i shall handle them as often as they allow me opportunity  the church and the state i have no great genius for meddling with they are either well as they are or will never be the better for any thing i can say to them but the passions the humors the follies the disquiets the pleasures and the graces of human life all these i claim a right to consider as my subjects and shall treat them without prejudice in the most frank and open manner so that the watchtower of barbican shall again resume its use and overlook this ancient city for her service and her safety  the plain dealer no ii  ridentem dicere verum quis vetat hor friday march         three enormous abuses have grown of late years to a scandalous height among us masquerading gaming and stockjobbing they are enemies to the civil society of mankind and destroyers of that valuable doctrine of plain dealing which i would so earnestly recommend  masquerades are the undoers of beauty honor and innocence and methinks it should be enough to deter any young lady if she did but reflect upon this great truth that her masque has at best thrown a cloud upon her reputation that will hang heavy for a long time after and sink her in the esteem of her former admirers  as to gaming the sons of our nobility and the heirs to plentiful estates especially those who become too early their own masters are the victims of sharpers the prey of those manhunters who form associations to overturn as many honest societies as they can and only live in peace together by being united in a confederacy to spread desolation among others the heads of our best families may not improperly be called the game of this widewasting fraternity  stockjobbing is the overthrow of all regular commerce and involves many a rich trader in the utmost distress  these three grand enormities stand in direct opposition to plain dealing and the province which i have undertaken demands of me to declare war against them and exert my best endeavors to remove them out of the way as fast as i am able they grow out of the obliquity of a mind that meditates an unnatural increase of its own ease by diminishing the satisfaction of other people and filling them with uneasiness and disquiet these subjects are so fruitful that i shall employ this whole paper upon the masquerades alone and defer the correction of the other to a second opportunity  the count of the illfavored visage may may be considered as the leader and captain general of these forces and therefore if in entering into a single combat with him i am valiant enough to get the better i doubt not but the army under his command will pull off their masks in respect to my victory and not be ashamed to show their faces when they appear on the side that is uppermost  they who lay masks to the counts charge have accounted for it very pleasantly and will have it to be a politic undertaking he ought say they by the laws of sympathy to have regard to a vizor since his natural countenance bears such resemblance to those artificial ones that the only means in his power to look like a man was to teach every man to look like a monster  but i am not in a humor to content my self with such abstracted speculations which appear to me to be artfully framed on purpose to excuse a man they pretend to find fault with it is true they make a jest of the person but they throw a masque over the mind which ought certainly to be most chastised i dare swear for the count it is not his nature to be angry with any body that by handling his face a little freely gives him a handsome opportunity for handling the pockets of other people greater statesmen than he have been contented to look silly for a wise end and to become the jests of the people when they have been sure of an equivalent this makes me afraid that these waggs who speak of him with so much seeming smartness are his friends at the bottom and i doubt if the truth were known he has bribed them to be of his party by letting them now and then into the secrets of masquerading  i must therefore take leave to look a little seriously into this matter and i am afraid we shall find that the count has not so much a design to make persons of quality with their masks on look like the count as to make the count look like persons of quality with their masks off  several clergymen some bishops and other grave personages have thought this a matter of importance enough to take notice of as well as i but still it seems the count is secretly resolved to have wit enough to take no notice of any of us it must be allowed indeed that he is a person of uncommon parts to stand proof against the reasoning of so many learned and great men without being in the least convinced or persuaded  but though this power of resisting the force of so many eloquent reasoners proves him a prodigy in genius and demonstrates him to have a world of wit yet i would not have him forget that there is some merit also in modesty if a clergyman or a bishop give their opinions against him he thinks it sufficient to shrug his shoulders and say grinning in his own defense that he wonders they should make such a bustle for that a domine a cassock and a mitre are the most common masks in fashion this raises a loud laugh and he comes off cleverly among the young fellows but he must not imagine to escape so with persons of my gravity  several old counselors of state and at law grave physicians ancient citizens and worthy country gentlemen just come up with their wives and daughters to pay a visit to the town have all complained of him in their turns and met with no better quarter and notwithstanding all they can say to the contrary he has continued to carry on his show with very successful raillery i expect that he will give me my share of his taunts among the rest but i have as little taste for his wit as i have for his sweetmeats and to deal plainly with him i am in no such merry vein as he may think when i tell him this unwelcome truth that the effects of masquerades are very serious things to husbands and fathers though they are jokes to him and to some who are pleased to support him i must therefore desire him to lay aside his wit and consider with a little wisdom whether he may not be in danger of falling hereafter into the clutches of a certain dark enemy who is now his friend in masquerade and who will not be so easily eluded  he may recollect if he pleases in one of the masquerades a strange spectacle like a man whom he took at first to have a vizard on but found upon a more narrow examination to have exactly the lineaments of his own face the same shape the same air the same gait the same clothes as himself and his very wig of the same color and hanging with the foretop on one tip of the ear just like his own he may remember that this ghastly mimick constantly attended him that whole night did every thing that he did said every thing he said and went to every place where he went he may remember that he was struck with a terrible panick and did not know what to think of this uninvited companion of his but took him sometimes for a mere mimick sometimes for a spectre but at last he was convinced that it could be no other than the devil which a great many wellmeaning people believed was certainly the truth and he very well knows that he and his companion were easily mistaken for one another and that no body at last could well tell which was the count and which was the devil  though the count as the phrase goes of him looks bad enough at the best he was remarked to look much worse after this vision than at any time before he was for many days much dejected and profoundly pensive and melancholy and the terrible apprehensions he was under caused a visible increase of wrinkles and furrowed him into such frightfulness that if ever he went to take coach the horses would start and run away from him  but one day above the rest when he was deep in the doleful mood an airy young fellow hearing him say he intended to have no more masquerades got out of him the secret of his disorder this youth who was afraid that if that diversion discontinued he should not succeed with a lady for whose sake he was used to hide his face that he might charm her with less difficulty found an expedient to free the count from his fears and made him believe that it was a trick of the prince de monte aspero but the poor count is imposed on if he gives credit to that fictitious story and might have been better advertised of the truth if he had only had an eye to the clubfoot which stood out and plainly showed his companion as several innocent spectators then present could testify besides as a poet who would preserve probability could produce no body proper to personate amphitryon but jupiter nor to mimick sofia to the life but mercury so the count if he reflects sufficiently upon his person parts and qualities must of necessity be convinced in his mind that since nothing human could so exactly resemble him it must be at least a cacodaemon  upon the whole if he lay this seriously to heart as i hope he will he will lay aside jesting become a true penitent and take the good time of lent to consider whether it will not be proper to quit all thoughts of masquerading for fear that ghastly figure that once took his person upon him should the next time take off his person  the plain dealer no iii  non est mortale quod optas ovid  dicique beatus ante obitum nemo supremaque funera possit  monday march  0      so weak is the frailty of human nature that we can never be too secure though armed with the sublimest virtue against the repeated attacks of so many passions as constantly besiege us and though the garrison of the mind may be never so well provided with all means of resistance the greatest of qualities virtues and perfections that our nature is capable of attaining nevertheless treachery within force or stratagem from without may surprise and defeat us an example of which infirmity the following story will furnish the reader and teach him of all things to avoid what is called spiritual pride that contempt of another for not being so good as himself when he sees how in an instant the greatest piety and religion may be changed by indulging only one dangerous passion into the other extreme of wickedness so that we may apply to the lubricity of human virtue what a wise man of greece said of happiness that it can never be determined till death  in the following story which is true as to fact i shall be obliged to disguise some circumstances of time and place to prevent the unfortunate subject of this paper or his family from being known so that it will be enough to inform the reader that less than half an age ago there lived a certain gentleman of good birth and fortune who had polished and finished a learned education by the improvement of a camp and a court in both which he spent some time when about the thirtieth year of his age he thought fit to settle himself in the world and change his condition by choosing a partner of life whose mind was as well adorned as her person was engaging this happy couple spent five years together in perfect felicity the husband with reputation as well as fortune and the wife with virtue not inferior to her beauty  but what crowned all their bliss was that mutual esteem they had contracted for one another in this time they had two or three children who all died in their infancy and now it pleased heaven to snatch from this happy man the only joy and comfort of his life his charming spouse died and left him not only an inconsolable but almost distracted widower when the first emotions of grief were over he retired from his own house to a little farm in another country where no object should come in his way to revive in his memory the loss of his lamented wife here he spent two years which led him into the thirty eighth of his life this time he divided between his studies and devotion being religious from his very infancy which natural piety was now so much increased by his late loss that at last he resolved to quit his native country and to retire into a convent being born and bred in the roman catholic communion  this resolution was no sooner known to his friends but they endeavored to divert it by all manner of persuasions and arguments by remonstrating to him that he was now in the flower of his age and blessed with a plentiful fortune to give him all the comforts and pleasures of life that it would be unjust thus to fling himself away not only to himself but his friends and family to whom he owed the debt which he had contracted for posterity to continue his name they told him that he had paid all the tribute to the memory of his deceased wife that the laws of honor decency and the obligations of a good husband required that he was now at liberty to make another choice that one good woman was not a phoenix but that others of the same species might be found to make him as happy as before  these arguments though backed with reason were all ineffectual he was deaf to every remonstrance and passed over into flanders where he placed himself at first as pensioner in a religious house and lived with the same strictness that even the rules of that order required from those who were under vows of such austerities nor did he receive more edification from the example of others than he gave by his own  after a life led for some time with the greatest esteem and reputation he communicated to the superiors of the house his ardent desire of being received into their society the good fathers though inwardly pleased with the honor of having so excellent a person in their order did not receive his proposal with that cheerfulness which he expected their prudence suggested to them that he was yet too young a man to be really upon good grounds disgusted with the world into the love of which he lay under great temptations of relapsing by reason of that large fortune which could furnish means of enjoying those pleasures which he must now for ever abandon and the loss of which if he should repent his vows would make him as miserable as he proposed to himself to to be happy they conjured him at the same time strictly to search his own heart so as to be convinced that this desire was an impulse and call from god and not any temporary disgust of the world which might blow over and vanish in time he submitted to this proposal and in a little time assured them that it proceeded from the directions of that providence to whose service he had so strong and glorious a passion to dedicate the rest of his life upon this the society consented on condition that he would undergo a double noviciate that by the length of the time they might be assured of his being confirmed in those pious resolutions  this he accepted and immediately sent over powers into his own country to convey and settle his estate upon his heir which was accordingly done and the time of his noviceship being expired he took his vows and embraced that life in which he proposed to himself so much heavenly satisfaction  he had not thus lived long in the convent but his great capacity and learning rendered him too necessary to the service of his order to be kept at home by command of his superiors he went on several commissions into other countries where he executed the orders which he had received with wonderful address and fidelity at the same time acquiring an universal reputation for his extraordinary sanctity of life  his fortune settled him at last in france where he met with the same esteem and veneration as in other countries being universally caressed and admired at last his ardent zeal for the service of god inflamed him with a passionate desire of laying down his life in asserting the cross of christ nothing would now satisfy his growing fervor but to be sent on a mission to convert infidels to the christian faith in which employ he had the holy ambition to meet with a crown of martyrdom this pious inclination he communicated to the superiors of his order but was repulsed in his request being told that men of less weight than he might be as serviceable in the conversion of savages that less abilities than his were sufficient to instruct nations so stupidly ignorant that his presence was more necessary in europe where they had so many learned adversaries to combat  this repulse not a little mortified the zeal of the good father whose passion for martyrdom was now more inflamed by hearing that there was a new mission of french jesuits going over to america he applied himself to the bishop of quebec who was just upon his departure for canada this prelate was so charmed with the zeal and piety of the man whose character he had heard before that he entered into his sentiments and made use of the interest he had in the court of france to get the request of this new apostle granted by authority thus master of his wishes he went over with the bishop to canada where he met with as much veneration of his piety humility and all other christian virtues in america as he left behind him in europe after some time of refreshment he prepared for his apostolical function and went with his colleagues among the most savage and cruel nations of the indians some of his comrades were murdered by these people others died of the hardships and fatigues which they endured while our missionary escaped through the goodness of his constitution  in this first expedition he was several times in imminent danger of life having once the knife over his head to scalp him but providence whose secrets are unsearchable preserved him and would not vouchsafe that honor which he so passionately desired of dying a martyr in this first attempt he succeeded so far as to vanquish the obstinacy and ignorance of twentytwo indian men and women whom he baptized and brought with him to quebec which town he entered triumphantly with his converts the reader may guess at the veneration paid him by the people who looked on him as a saint and apostle and pressed near to touch and kiss his very garments the winter months he was obliged to spend his time at quebec it being impossible to preserve life in so cold a country without the cover of houses against the inclemency of the air the summerseasons were taken up entirely by the labors of his mission in which he had wonderful success the third winter at which time he approached the  0th year of his age the governor who had a profound respect for him invited the good missioner to come and reside at his house with a request to instruct his daughter who desired to learn languages and mathematics the good father cheerfully undertook his new province and very assiduously attended his young pupil the pregnancy of whose parts made his pains the more agreeable this lady was about eighteen years old with a person equal to the beauties of her mind and all the vivacity so natural to her country the preceptor had not often attended his fair scholar but he found those emotions in his heart which in a little time shipwrecked his virtue he fell desperately in love and through the eyes sucked in that poison which now tainted a soul that so much virtue had long and constantly defended before love that invincible tyrant entirely subdued and added the heart of this once holy man to his other triumphs in order to make himself the more agreeable he cut off his beard and now put on linen next his skin which he had not worn for some years the more to indulge his mortification though he was not obliged to that austerity by the rules of his order that devotion which had flamed so long in his heart toward god almighty was now turned into adoration of one of his creatures love converting all others passions into itself as the plague does all other distempers  in short he managed his amors with that address that at last he triumphed and gratified his criminal desires the fruits of which soon appeared the young damsel was with child which flung the lovers into the last confusion and distress there was no remedy but one which was to fly accordingly one night the summer now advancing so as to permit them to lie in the woods they got over the ramparts and fled to the indians among whom he had a great interest and who now received them with open arms as he had seen some campaigns in his youth and understood fortification and the mathematical part of war he began to train and discipline the savages whom he persuaded to revolt against the french in the mean while the governor overwhelmed with grief for this terrible misfortune in his family sent out several small parties to bring them back but these were defeated by the superiority of numbers upon which the governor marched with the whole garrison and all the fighting men he could muster the lovers animated and encouraged the savages whom they brought in great numbers to oppose the enemy the little armies came in sight and while the two unfortunate lovers stood close to one another she with an indian quiver at her back and bow in her hand the first fire from the french laid them both on the ground such was the sad catastrophe of this unhappy man whose piety and good life for so many years could not prevent his falling at last so memorable an example of the imbecility of all human accomplishments  the plain dealer no    tigris agit rabida cum tigride pacem

since it may so truly be said that there is nothing honorable that it does not aim to make vile nothing great and magnificent that it does not reduce to look little and despicable  how would the deceased bucharis have been able to leap down from behind the chariot of a departed lord and step into a finer of his own if he had wanted the happy turn of obliging unlucky gentlemen to live in a more uncomfortable state than even his companions before himself became a gentleman what must the great cartaerarius think when he prances along the pavements upon a par with the prime nobility and sees a wretch walk the streets halfstarvd with cold and hunger dressed in sagathie in the depth of winter whom he knew to have been his superior in wealth and magnificence till he reduced him to this disparity can my readers imagine that cartaerarius must not lose the jollity of his heart for a moment at so mortifying a prospect or do they think he can be brute enough to enjoy himself upon the reflection of his different fortune and of the tricks he had played in his life and the numbers he had made as wretched as the object i have mentioned  this is a strange and melancholy fate a box and dice heartily stamped upon a table here in london shall have a more powerful effect on the walls of a strongbuilt castle in the country than the firing of twenty mortas against it could have had on the spot and shall force the possessor to surrender it at discretion with all the territories round about it to one who is innocently called a fair enemy and who attacks it in play only  it is still more strange that a custom which has been known to have brought such uncommon calamities upon the greatest and richest men should at last become common among the common people themselves and yet this was lately the case tradesmen and sharpers of a lower rank committed the like hostilities and shops were shut up by way of gaming i know one wise man an apothecary who neglected his business to become rich and has been seen to lose more money by shaking his elbow over a gamingtable in three hours than he could recover by brandishing his arm over a mortar in three times as many months  i am the more slack in my remarks and throw together only a few loose hints against this vicious habit because a more effectual way has been lately taken to check its progress and if people of fashion did not think themselves above the benefit of those laws which vulgar persons are cautious of transgressing for fear of being treated as cheats and impostors this discourse would be rendered useless the nature of imposture is no otherwise altered by being the fact of a person of distinction but by its becoming more highly criminal out of persons of fashion and estate are generally chosen those who are obliged to watch over the public welfare and can they guard property in public life who lay snares to entrap it in a private capacity no man should be allowed to appear in an assembly of business who has made himself a member among the surrounders of a hazard table there have been of late but two gamesters that stepped high enough to have any rule in public affairs entrusted to their management exlex and the young montanus these though otherwise men of signal capacities and many worthy qualifications could not resist their natural propensity and thereby infused into two kingdoms such an universal spirit of avarice and gaming by strange schemes till then unheard of as must if continued have soon accomplished the ruin which they threatened at their first appearance  as to gaming in lower life the justices of the peace have acted with such commendable vigilance that they have scarce left me a known sharper in the town to exercise the edge of my satire upon most of them have i believe by this time taken to the more honorable way of robbing with a pistol and brace of balls in it which is much less dangerous to the offended and less safe to the offender than a box with a pair of dice in it others have gone in gangs like footpads and while one knocked down the passenger the other rifled him which is only a kind of emblem of their play called two poll one thus i believe that if a strict scrutiny were made into the numbers that are left of the fraternity we should find that since the happy dissolution of that knot most of the loose ones have been swept away by his majestys industrious subject mr jonathan forward rearadmiral of the city transports  but there is a species of more mischievous gamesters remaining still among us who ought methinks to have had free passage in some of that great pilots vessels  i mean the present fraternity of stockjobbers  this brotherhood who play their game upon the hopes and fears of other people make use of cant names as the gamesters did and with just the same propriety the gamesters called their instruments of mischief by the denomination of squibs and puffs and the stockjobbers have their bulls and bears nor were those half so formidable in covent garden as these are about the royal exchange in cornhill  a bear is a beast of prey who not having perhaps a morsel in the world appears with the pretense of a whole paw full of stock which he agrees to deliver on a day but if stock rises he must as the phrase is show his tail that is he must run away  a bull is just the reverse of this he is as pennyless as his brother beast but roars and bellows for stock and devours all that is offered him and if at the time when it is to be paid for it happens to fall then he too must run off as the bear did  numbers of honest tradesmen are deluded by these odd beasts and kept warm with imaginary hopes of turning their money better and faster upon stocks than in business and where the unskilful are drawn in to try their fortunes this way their money becomes a sacrifice to the jobbers and themselves bankrupts to the public bulls and bears as opposite as they are in their natures agree very well together and sometimes personate one another to draw in an honest citizen and if he once gets between both by that time the stocks have had a few variations to and fro he is sure by their tossing him from one to the other to be worried out of his senses  my friend the alderman who has sometimes a way of jesting peculiar to himself says that when he has been running over the advertisements relating to bankrupts in our gazettes he would frequently make marks on the margin denoting where such a brokenhearted butcher has been forced to shut up his stall upon being gored by the horn of a bull and where the paw of a bear has pulled a rich linnendraper by the head and ears over his counter i warrant you my old friend will he often say for he is apt to dwell upon old jokes when the watchtower of barbican was standing the sharpest eye of any man that stood in it could never perceive round this whole city one such voracious animal threatening ruin to the inhabitants as the modern bulls and bears are  it is certain that the aldermans jest was true in earnest for our wise ancestors made wholesome laws for extirpating all wild and mischievous beasts out of the land and set a price upon their heads it must be therefore very wrong in such a populous town as this to permit bulls and unmuzzled bears to have their stalls and dens about exchangealley where they have opportunity to run out and destroy unwary citizens besides the alderman told me as a remark of his wife that under boast of the vast stocks they deal for they tempt the yielding hearts of many a rich citizens daughter and pin themselves on families to be kept without a groat and sometimes take a bite of the young lady in that part they like best and then run away without coming to account for it she says that mr honeyman a sugar baker has two cubs upon his daughters hands by a bear that has left the alley and that mr simples favorite child is upon the point of being delivered of a calf begot by a silly awkward bull that burst himself by swallowing stock beyond the power of his natural digestion  these are things not to be tolerated in any civil government whatsoever for they manifestly tend to the ruin of commerce and at this rate it will come to pass in the course of a few years that while russia is polishing its rough inhabitants into the finer resemblance of englishmen the politeness of britain will be transformed into the barbarity of russia and the greatest part of this metropolis will be overrun with an unheard of generation of savages and monsters it is therefore my serious opinion that the practice should be put down and that for the quiet and safety of sober citizens every bull and bear of them all should be first driven out of the city by the way of newgate and then transported out of the kingdom  the plain dealer no   militat omnis amans and habet sua castra cupido ovid monday april        the love of our country when it is understood as great spirits consider it is the most noble among those virtues which grace and elevate human nature but in the general idea which men form when they speak of this public duty it is a mean and selfish frailty a poor contraction of soul which would call in our beneficence from mankind our common brotherhood and confine it with a scandalous frugality of affection to the land which we were born in for the same ridiculous reason which made the ape in the fable the first that produced her young ones when a decree had been published that the most beautiful among the beasts should succeed to the government  few men i am afraid have any nobler motive than this love of themselves for the love they bear their country but the partiality of a true patriot must be justified by his care of the public honor he must contribute to the general interest with the loss of his particular ease and to the hazard of his private safety the same impatient beat with which the soul conscious of immortality presses forward to futurity and inspires a secret pleasure in our hope of fame hereafter though we are sure we shall be dust and have no ear for those praises which we charm our our selves in death with but the prospect and faint image of  the same noble source has the spirit of true patriotism  it teaches a wise man to love his country like his offspring not merely as they are his but for the natural virtues which he observes in them and which he has taken delight to to cherish and urge forward for the ornament of posterity  the prejudices of our minds and the different interests we are led by make us very unqualified judges of the state of this virtue with regard to the times we live in and the same passions have always produced the same effects in the historians of former ages but there are some instances so strongly demonstrative in their nature that partiality can add no beauty by the arts of describing nor can envy discolor them by false lights or misplacing  deep enquirers into nature have recommended it as a way to judge soundly of mens good or evil tendency by observing what effect is produced in their passions upon relation of some amiable example of human excellence if such a trial is just i should wish to avoid the society of that man who could reflect on the following story without unusual emotions in honor of the noble roman to whose true sense of public spirit we owe it  in that part of the punick war when fabius maximus commanded the forces of italy against hannibal certain officers of the roman army were taken prisoners by the enemy fabius was well acquainted with the skill and courage of these men and resolved not to lose them he therefore treated with the carthaginians and agreed upon their ransom at a very high sum for payment of which by a day appointed he engaged the honor of the roman senate but the senate instead of sending him the money refused to ratify the agreement  fabius received the news with more grief than indignation and giving strict orders for concealing it from his army dispatched his son to rome with all secrecy and expedition to make sale of his own paternal estate and to return to him with the money which as soon he received he sent it to hannibal as from the senate  for i had rather said he it should be reported of the romans that they have a general without land than a senate without humanity  our clergyman whom we delight to consider as a blessing to the assembly because his life is a silent enforcer of his doctrine was expatiating the other day on the grace and grandeur of this action and had fixed us in the most satisfied and respectful attention when he was broke in upon by the coquet with the following relation which she assured us was matter of fact and happened very lately  and it contains added she so exalted an instance of refined and generous love that if ever i find a man who would be mine upon such terms i shall marry and bid defiance to the sound of the word matron  courthope was the son of an english merchant who had lived long in the canary islands he had been sent young to london for the advantage of his education and while there fell in love with bellaria the only daughter of a gentleman of a good family and estate who had promised this lady to a distant relation of his name but she had an aversion for his person and made open profession of a passion for young courthope which the father was so far from approving that being provoked by her firmness he commanded her under penalty of his hatred and his curse never more to converse with him and confined her from that time forward to prevent even the possibility of it bellaria notwithstanding this restraint found means to escape and dressing her self in boys clothes embarked with courthope on a spanish ship that was bound for the canaries where he assured her they would be welcome to a father whose gentle nature knew nothing of that rigor which from her infancy she had been oppressed by they were taken in this voyage by a moorish vessel belonging to the rovers of sallee and it is easier to conceive than express the affliction the despair the astonishment of courthope fallen at once from a prospect of the sweetest and most lively joy to the depth of consummate misery he saw her now the companion of his slavery who had wished and ventured so much to make him partner of her affluence and he suffered more than death every time that his eyes all swimming in tears stole a glance at his bellaria whom he durst not distinguish by any marks of respect or service for fear of pointing out her sex to the brutes who were their masters  but what aggravated his sorrow to the most piercing extremity was an information he received from a native of the canaries whom he found a slave at sallee that his father was newly dead and that all his effects had been seized by the spaniards on occasion of some criminal correspondencies which he had unwarily been drawn into  they passed about a week with the rest of their ships company in a public dungeon of the city where they were to expect the killing summons which must expose them in a market to be sold and torn for ever from the enjoyment of that mutual comfort which was now the only thought that could support em in their wretchedness the moon one night shone clearly through the grates of the prison windows and courthope while the rest were asleep hung in melancholy transport over the bosom of bellaria who started in broken slumbers and filled his soul with sad reflections he took notice of a rugged stone which rose pointed through the earth and imagining it might hurt her removed it with much difficulty and had no sooner drawn it out but he discovered an old piece of woollen cloth which had formerly been hidden under it in which were sixty moidores two gold rings and a writing which he perceived to have been french but now defaced and not legible  he approached bellarias ear and awaked her in all the ecstacy of a man who considered himself as distinguished by providence he whispered his new hopes of an immediate redemption and found means soon after by aid of an honest jew a man of much charity who visited the slaves every morning to be carried to the alcaid and trusting his gold with the jew proposed to ransom himself and bellaria whom he called his brother but the conflict of his passions had so visible an effect in his looks and his earnestness that the alcaid took advantage from what he observed and insisted on the whole sum for the liberty of one only which was offered him for both  he bid him name at his choice either his brother or himself but advised him to lose no time for an english sloop was ready to sail out of the harbor with ransomed captives on board and would carry him to gibraltar where his countrymen were in garrison  he added too that all the christian slaves in sallee were to set out the next morning for mequinez to work on some new buildings of the emperor of morocco  courthope trembled with jealousy and a thousand different fears at the distracting imagination of bellaria in the eye and power of such a tyrant  he went out with the jew and took a sudden resolution  about noon the same day the jew returned to the prison and carried with him an order for the dismission of bellaria who enquiring after courthope was told he went before to prepare things for her reception on board the vessel they were to embark in and had given him orders to conduct her thither immediately never was any order obeyed with so much transport the jew hired a boat and attending her to the ship returned abruptly to the town without taking leave of her  she was led into the cabin where expecting to find her lover she was received by the master of the vessel with whom the jew had been before and who delivered her a letter which she opened with trembling hands and read in it what follows  how miserable should i have been my dear my lost bellaria if heaven had not enabled me to redeem you from misery  the money which i found in the dungeon was too little to save us both allow me therefore the honor to have restored you to that liberty which you lost for having pitied me i am a wretch whose illfortune neither your sex nor your limbs were framed to be partakers of  if i am worthy of bellaria i shall see her again if she blesses me with her prayers i cannot fail to be fortunate  and if she wishes to live without me i shall die happiest in absence  angels guide you to your father if he has loved he will forgive me and permit a sigh now and then to the memory of poor  courthope   she flew skrieking upon the deck as soon as she had read this dreadful this insupportable letter but saw with as much distinction as her tears would permit her that the ship was under sail and all she wished to live for left in slavery behind her  the plain dealer no    quae te ter purelecto poterunt recreare libello hor friday april  0      though goodbreeding and politeness are generally thought the same they are qualities very different politeness is the influence of a natural refinement goodbreeding the form of an artificial civility the last but restrains us from giving offense the first impowers us to give pleasure politeness is the happy mixture of greatness with benignity it is a sunshine from the soul on the looks words and actions goodbreeding is often a surface without depth and like the painters gay colors on dark primings spreads a gloss over the outside even of vices and meanspiritedness whereas politeness like the crystal is transparent as well as shiny and always appears lovelier the fuller light it is placed in  i intended to have adapted to this serious introduction a very sober dissertation which many of my gentle readers might no doubt have mistaken for a dull one but i shall substitute in its place a most extraordinary essay of the epistolary kind which will serve for the same purpose it brings me the uncommon case of a faithful though unfavourd lover whose goodbreeding without politeness has lost him a mistress by an odd kind of civility which he made use of for engaging her  i need not inform my readers that this letter is an original they will discover natural graces in it which are inimitably genuine  these for the plaindealer at mr robertss in warwick lane with care and speed deliver mr plaindealer sir all yours yet published have regularly received and note their contents i thought it proper to let you know that although i am a cooper i loved her as well as her finical turkeymerchant but i forgot to let you know first that the needful of this letter is that she that i mean is a pretty young woman worth a brace and a half of thousands but that makes nothing to the story i had money enough for that matter and though i was no powdered fine fellow with a finical white wig yet i valued and esteemed her as if i had been the mother that bore her and i should have been glad when heaven saw fit to have had her in her smock and so mayhap now i think on it would her beau too but i mean in an honest way only but what matters that fair and false was an old saying in its time and if i had stuck close to my calling and valued her no more than the paring of my nails i had been a better man for it by some hundreds but there is no setting old heads upon young shoulders every body knows i am no bragster and though i say it that should not i could have loved the very ground that she went upon and very unhappy she has made me that is certain whereby i hope somebody that is higher than she will remember her for it in the last day for then all secrets will be laid open i cannot for my life imagine what possesses me but i shall begin to hate my ownself shortly if it was in nature to be possible because whenever she comes into my head i am ready to cry at the thoughts of her  now you must know she had told a friend of mine that wished me to her not once nor twice but that very day that he was leading her home from drapers gardens that she thought as how no man could fall in love with a redhaird woman but to see how strangely mistakes will come about this was all but her own fancy for i never once thought of it nor was never the man that had ever concerned my self with any thing she had about her so because i woudnt be uncivil i made a great supper and invited an old aunt of mine that she knowd and half a score young women besides herself to take part of it for it burnt in my mind strangely in the middle of the supper i watched my time to drink to her and told her before em all that she might be sure by my having no body to supper but folks with red hair as how i shoudnt like her a crum the worse for that for i didnt care a pin for that matter if she was as red as a fox all over to be sure she looked all night after it as the devil looked over lincoln and when i went the afternoon after to make love to her as i used to do nothing vexed me but her sending me down word by that pert gossip mrs briget that i am sure has had of me at times in presents besides good words to the value of five pieces and yet she bid her forsooth to go and tell me that i had no need for giving my self any more trouble to come there for her mistress would have nothing to say to a hoopdriver  now i knowing as how we are commanded to forgive all our enemies would not do her no harm for the world and so hoping you will print this only to expose her concludes the needful at present from  your real friend g  b  ps her hair was not golden locks but that hot sort of red which most folks call carrots     as i shall borrow from my correspondents the entire entertainment of this day here follows an epistle which i have newly received from the malapert mistress of a ridinghood warehouse  to the withered old crabtree who calls himself the plaindealer dear drybones with all due respect to the dignity of woollen nightcaps what has urged thee to profess such a spleen against masquerading when nothing less than a mask can make thee fit to keep company it was just such a vinegar visage as thine appearing abroad uncovered to the terrifying of whole parishes that made impudence be called barefaced thy oakenstick is a type of thee only not half so dry nor so tough nor so crabbed  it is well you have taken up your lodgings in a watchtower if i knew how to come at you you should have a feeling of my respect for your parts and your plain dealing  yet you are in the right too in one thing that relates to your paper which is your publishing it on fridays for fishdays and fasts prepare people for mortification  if you needs must be preaching are there not subjects enough to cant on without quarrelling with one pleasant night or two in a moon which gets so many honest people a comfortable livelihood too and which accommodates sober gentlemen and ladies with so decent an opportunity to converse without censure why since you must rail dont you rail like a good subject at the inconvenient presumption of late so much in fashion of making bold with our betters egad if i was somebody nobody should dare to deal plainly  it is a sign you are an old fellow since you cannot meddle with the ladies without nettling em if this is your manner of handling us women which you had the confidence to threaten at your first setting out a fig for all you can do to us  you could never want subjects if you did not want brains without abusing pleasures you are past the enjoyment of  there is the fool and the wise and the statesmen and the fine gentleman scope enough for variety  let alone but the masquerades and use the world at your pleasure  the fool will be readily allowed to the plain dealer but many indeed may wonder what the wise can have to do with your paper  why they see the rest in the wrong and laugh where they should remedy their ill nature therefore stands in need of a snarler  the statesman you know is by prescription and the happiness of our constitution the right of the scribbler and as for the fine gentlemen i mean those of the newest edition all gilt down the back and tightly bound in calfs leather they are a race of breathing blanks fast asleep with eyes broad open yet if you were good for any thing but to spoil trade you might wake em by a pinch or two of plaindealing into an apprehension of this truth which they never so much as dreamed of  that the dead may as well be called members of a state as they who live to no purpose  see now goodman sowersop here is business enough cut out for you  let the women alone and concern yourself with what you are fit for  not a word for the future in prejudice to an assembly where love and strictest union make the general occupation throw away your greasy mousecolourd gloves and wear these clean ones  from yours as you shall merit m  l    the plain dealer no    sapientia prima stultitia caruisse  hor monday april         being the other day in a large company at a gentlemans house in covent garden i was highly delighted to hear a young beautiful lady acknowledge that tears flowed from her eyes upon reading of the story of courthope she who had the virtue to be so elegantly moved by his distress will relish an account of his better fortune which she may hereafter expect to be entertained with but when she added that she had been a coquette too long and if ever it should be her fate to meet with a suitor of courthope s desert she would let him lose no time for fear of accidents when i perceived she made this frank confession not only with her lips but from her heart i confess i began to conceive hopes of knowing very speedily that some visible fruits would arise from these my labors  i was therefore a little concerned when i found my self interrupted by a young wag who was pleased to pass pertness upon the company for jesting that plain dealer said he is a wellmeaning writer but he does not strike out a meaning cleverly this is one of the best stories i have read upon the subject of love only there is not one doublemeaning through the whole and that makes it insipid he has been generally hitherto a perfect inhabitant of his blunthall which seems to be rather the seat of his understanding than of his person but since the ladies like him i will endeavor to be of their mind and especially because he tells us he is an old bachelor as well as a plain dealer and we must have some humor struck out of him when he comes to act that character  i guessed what the young malapert would be at by the word humor and i found i was not deceived when he pulled out of his pocket a little scrap of poetry entitled  an epistle from mrs robinson to senesino  in which he peremptorily swore there was a great deal of turn life and spirit  it is certain he showed some spirit in reading it and proved himself a master of humor for he went boldly and undauntedly through it and would never observe that every fresh line excited fresh blushes in the faces of all the fair and modest part of the assembly  i take this opportunity of informing that young spark and all others of the same class are desired to take notice of it that he is greatly mistaken if he expects any such humor from me notwithstanding his irreverent way of talking of his elders and throwing over my shoulder a general sneer upon all the old batchelors in great britain  my province must be tedious before it can grow pleasant i must first remove folly before i can make room for wit for it is by clearing their way through the rubbish of absurdity that men take the first steps to wisdom  if according to the maxim in the forehead of my paper it was my immediate office to teach that young spark better things which i had then a great inclination to do only for fear of discovering my self i would begin by weeding out of his mind that rank conceit which he entertains of his parts and showing him that there is no true humor in lewdness nor true wit in a double entendre  how different was the principle of waller that excellent writer as i have heard my old friend mr dryden relate publicly at wills in his commendation used to say that he would raze any line out of his poems which did not imply some motive to virtue this is a saying that ought to be memorable among our poets it carries with it the energy of good sense as well as virtue  for my own share i declare i would rather propagate one such maxim with good effect amongst the writers of the present age than be the head of those writers myself and the author of better verses than wallers  they who believe this to be my real sentiment may guess how extremely delighted i must have been with the following answer which a young lady has given to the affront and outrage offered to the whole sex by one who personates senesino in that scandalous epistle  an answer from mrs robinson to senesino from thy loose lines i turn my eyes away nor know overspread with blushes what to say the modest muses wounded by thy strain for me and for themselves do thus complain o thou our countrys folly and expense dull foe to tragedy and godlike sense too long mean mercenary shade too long have thou these isles enchanted with thy song musicks soft god unbinds the charm he raised he blessed thy tongue and while he blessed we praised by thee polluted he disclaims his choice and will no longer warble in thy voice his trembling notes where melting softness hung and every grace will seek a chaster tongue no more the lover shall thy song repeat no more the fair one sigh  it is wondrous sweet oh guilty senesino thou no more shall bravo bravo hear  or loud encore the loose and dull shall all thy audience be the chaste and witty shall resent for me all unattended shall thy awkward form to sad uncrowded scenes or whine or storm thy wretched ha  shall unapplauded grow and illplacd bays fall withering from thy brow know songster julius godlike chief disdains thy shrill unnatural ungraceful strains with rage redoubled pompeys ghost must burn to find such tears profane his sacred urn remember echo soon thou wilt know the time stripped of thy robes thy legions and thy rhyme thou poor machine of mean delusive sound when i shall see thy temples all unbound and those that heroes act like heroes crowned thou to thy famished italy shall go and rival faustus to the shades below the business of the following is of a nature very surprising to say truth i was startled at it it does not directly indeed come to me from the devil but it was sent me from a deputy of his who professes the black art and styles himself doctor faustus he dates his letter from the theater in lincolnsinnfields  and would pass upon me for a player or a tumbler or zany under the disguise of a magician but i beg his pardon for that i am seldom deceived so easily i am almost persuaded it is an agile evil spirit that walks and does mischief by candlelight and assumes enticing shapes to draw in the unwary and deprive people of their wits but if he be really flesh and blood i am at a loss what to think of him only his assurance seems considerable since he appears by his letter to belong to one of our theaters that he should imagine me to be novice enough to believe he could be a conjurer  faustus the magician to the plain dealer greeting forasmuch as i reverence your name and your purpose i decline the revenge which by aid of my art i might return for my injuries and content my self by your means to expose an impostor  having fixed my place of residence on my arrival in this famous city at the theater by lincolns inn for the public display of qualities which distinguish the sons of magic i heard with a due mixture of contempt and displeasure that the rumor of my purpose had encouraged another theater to disguise under the venerable character of faustus a professed lover of levity and endeavor in spite of nature to give him the weight of a wizard  but being satisfied in the consciousness of my own superiority i have overlooked and neglected him till emboldened by success he has dared now at last to publish his list of fooleries with a pertinacious pretense to something not unlike comparison i am therefore determined immediately to make him leap out of my gown and confess himself no doctor  in that catalogue of tricks most illiberal appellation he makes use of these strange words  a usurer comes in and brings a moneybag to the doctor for which he offers his note but the usurer entirely contemns the proposal and will have the doctor s leg instead of security for the money the doctor endeavors to dissuade him from this demand and offers him his head in exchange of the leg he wanted  i pass over the unmagical absurdity of a necromancers wanting money or that a usurer who would rather have parted with his own leg to save a bag of money should be so whimsical to surrender it in exchange for anothers i leave such remarks to the trite essays of critics not descending my self to the insignificance of being witty but what i would convey to the knowledge of your readers is the necessity which my charms have laid this boaster under to expose and discover himself in the very act of his imposture  for who does not know that had he been the true faustus his brains must have had their situation in his head his head therefore he would have preferred to all his inferior members but the seat of his understanding having been placed by his profession at the bottom of his body i commissioned a familiar to perplex his apprehension who by convincing him of how little worth his head was in comparison with his heels drew him under such a terror that he continually cries out to those who come for his catalogue the devil is in good earnest in the conjurer of lincolns end but i am only a dancing master  you shall prosper in plaindealing if you publish this letter and have faith in  faustus the enchanter   the plain dealer no    nos duo turba sumus ovid friday april         there is a liveliness and race of spirit which we commonly call wit but it is the effect of natural accident and depends like a machine upon order and parts it is only the result of a mixture of different humors and of animal spirits finer and more delicately agitated than ordinary which imprint in their passage a quick and lively sense of images and animate by that impression the visage voice and deportment  it is merely by this quickness and heat of their imagination that witty men surprise us a smart and sprightly rhetoric a humorous turn of phrase a frank vivacity of mien with a modish affectation of peculiar looks and gesture make the merit of their character but these men want for the most part both strength of mind and penetration their imaginations are thin and delicate and play lightly on the skirts of objects but they are too weak for solid reasoning and in any thing abstracted and above the pitch of the senses they are miserably impotent and grow presently weary  they are the ladies favorites however by a kind of sympathy or resemblance for women being naturally of feeble constitutions have their brains of soft consistence with fibers fine and slender apt and easy to be moved by the weakest agitations they are subject therefore to their senses and wanting force to strike deeper set up for judges of modes and fashions and relish nothing but what contributes to their pleasure or their ornament they have fixed the standard of wit by certain rules of this tendency and find nothing so difficult as to believe a man can want it who has such charms for their entertainment  ned volatile a member of our assembly at the widows is a foreman of this species with a great extent of good nature he appears void of any his facility to jest and rally transports him beyond decency to illustrate objects or debase em and without regard to ceremony merit or condition he contracts things or magnifies them when they fall in his way till he has adapted them to his talent of presenting every thing ridiculously  we have the very reverse of this character in the frankhearted major steadfast a brave and able officer the reward of whose merit has been oppression and injustice yet so firm is the manly generosity of his temper that at one and the same time he vindicates his character with the boldness of an injured soldier and offers arguments in excuse for the rashness of his ruiner imputing to credulity and the malice of misrepresenters what his friends all consider as an act of violence and barbarity there is no subject which he oftener or with more pleasure enlarges on than the great and noble qualities of the man who has undone him nay he talks even of his justice with as much warmth and seriousness as if he had himself been obliged by it  the major and ned volatile are the north and south poles of our assembly ned speaks and the major thinks the first is always pleased but the other always pleases there is a humanity in the majors air that never fails to mark him out as the common friend of the company and a kind of majestic tenderness in his behavior gives him the authority of their father he corrects and approves with openness and is at once severe and amiable there is a solemn force and weight in the manner of his speaking which seems to borrow its equality from the steddiness of his principles he esteems without transport and condemns without anger what is fancy in ned volatile is reason in the major the one has a judgment that is solid and plain the other an imagination that is sparkling and wanton  it is a very frequent and agreeable entertainment which arises to the assembly out of the natural opposition of these two characters who yet preserve a decorum by effect of the regard each has for the other the major loves neds cheerfulness but thinks him trifling and impertinent and ned volatile hears with reverence the wisdom of the major but would like him a great deal better if he would be merrier and more noisy  we had lately the pleasure of hearing in a full meeting some of the newest opera songs by a skilful italian lady who has been famous on our theaters and is equally remarkable for the sweetness of her voice and the strength of her features she is an acquaintance of the widow who asked us as soon as she was gone our opinion of this person to whom we all knew her partial ned volatile prevented any answer but his own and desired he might have liberty to give it under his hand he had pen and ink brought him and every body was grown impatient for the product of his muse when he presented it in the following verses from randolph  now shame pursue my meddling sight would i had been all ear to night sweet is her voice as flowers in june but never was face so out of tune lower than gammut are her eyes her nose does above ela rise were i to choose my self a dear not by my eye but by my ear here would i fix  could i but woo the sound without the substance too some women are all tongue  and oh what joy twoud be were this but so harmonious gods to ease my mind or strike her dumb or make me blind no sooner had ned volatile repeated his verses but a general applause of laughter was returned him by the company all but the widow the major and myself were extravagantly transported with the humor and the satire and ned was triumphantly expanding his poetry with an air of levity and satisfaction when the major to prevent a second reading of what he saw was distasteful to some part of the assembly began to speak in this manner  the company must acknowledge they are obliged to mr volatile for the pains he is at to please them but if he were as inclinable to reason as he is to entertain no body could convince us sooner that the finest ridicule is to be considered but as cruelty where it borrows its subject from mens natural defects or their miseries i know very well that whatever savours of instruction is offensive in conversation and that nothing is more insupportable than a liberty people take of prescribing rules to all the world we presently wish to fly the society of those who dogmatize for the mind of man is generous and resists truth or receives it as its approaches are rude or gentle but then there is an equal inconvenience in the contrary extreme and if we would enjoy conversation with a delicacy of wit we should have liberty to bound it by the interposition of our judgment  the harmony of this lady who has so agreeably entertained us is a beauty that might weigh against the absence of other charms more frequent and perhaps less valuable it is the motherly indulgence of nature to rob us of no benefit without bestowing on us some other in a double proportion how seldom do we find all accomplishments united in the same person some are happy in their humor and have their spirits full of fire and swift and subtle in their motion others not so sprightly have a blood more cold and phlegmatic but the course of their animal spirits being temperately regulated they are cautious in deliberation strong and constant in resolution and unshaken in their enterprises how visible is this difference one is airy and facetious the other thoughtful and judicious the wit of one is sharp the sense of the other solid  i remember to have seen during the last war in flanders in a town where i had my winter quarters a wonderful example of this recompense observed by nature an old man who had been born blind and had always continued so had a natural sagacity that was prodigious and scarce credible a legacy being left him to the value of fifty pistoles the poor man who had never expected to be master of such a sum was under no small solicitude how to secure his possession of it he determined at last to dig a hole in the cellar and hide it but it happened that a dutch soldier who was quartered in the house saw him bury the purse and went afterward and stole it the blind man bethinking himself of a place more convenient returned in an hour or two and discovered his misfortune for which he contrived an ingenious remedy by detecting the author of it which he judged to have been the dutch soldier but the difficulty was how to prove it  they lay in the same room and at night when they were in bed the blind man began under pretense of friendship and confidence to consult with the soldier concerning a necessity which he said he was under to hide a hundred pistoles to say truth added he i have hid fifty of them to day and would dispose of the other fifty in the same place to morrow only i am desirous to be satisfied whether in point of conscience such a practice is unlawful my relations being so extravagant that they would waste it all if they could come at it  the soldier swallowed the bait and argued like a casuist to confirm the intention expecting now to get it all he rose therefore betimes and going into the cellar restored the fifty pieces to the hole he had taken them from the blind man went afterward and recovered his money as he expected by the success of his stratagem  here the major closed his speech and it was difficult to say which had most pleased the hearers his story or his goodnature ned volatile himself though his vanity was a little shocked felt an awe from the virtue and plaindealing of his friend and looking generously out of countenance told the major with a serious smile that in company of the wise none are foolish but the witty  yet to show you said he by this time beginning to recover himself that i have edified by your sermon i will make an honorable amends to the ladies by producing the example of a living glory to their sex who has also been pleasant on a natural defect but in a manner much more generous she made them on a boy that was dumb but of excellent quickness of parts and i speak with the more pleasure in praise of this lady because i know i can do nothing more acceptable to the major whom i have often heard declaring himself one of her devoted admirers i sing the boy who gagged and bound has been by nature robbed of sound yet has she found a generous way one loss by many gifts to pay his voice indeed she close confined but blessed him with a speaking mind and every muscle of his face discourses with peculiar grace the ladies tatling over their tea might learn to charm by copying thee if silence thus can man become all women beauties should be dumb then happy boy no more complain nor think thy loss of speech a pain nature has used thee like good liquor and corkd thee but to make thee quicker the major embraced ned volatile with a fatherly pride and tenderness and there was not one in company who did not think it a happiness to be guilty of a fault which had furnished an opportunity of repenting so gracefully  the plain dealer no    fratremque ruentem sustentat dextra  vir monday april  0      there is nothing more talked of and less easily found than friendship every one pretends to it and not one in a million really possesses this noble passion which is the most generous that can actuate and adorn the soul of man being as necessary a cement in private and domestic life as public faith to public society and the greater commerce of the world  for want of authentic and real examples of this noble quality so conducive to pleasure as well as profit the ancient poets have had recourse to fiction and told us stories of their pylades and orestes but we will entertain the reader with the greatest action of generous friendship that human nature is capable of performing and this from an author of unexceptionable credit who was both an eye and ear witness to part of the story which is more remarkable by happening between two brothers whom the constant observation of all ages has remarked to be less often friends notwithstanding the ties of blood than other persons insomuch that virgil who had a perfect knowledge of human nature has thought fit as it were proverbially to express himself on this occasion et infidos agitans discordia fratres   in the beginning of the xvith century the portugueze carracks sailed from lisbon to goa a very great colony of portugueze in the east indies these carracks are the largest vessels that press the ocean on board of one of them were twelve hundred souls mariners merchants passengers priests and friars who were going on their several missions established in china and the indies the beginning of their voyage was prosperous they had doubled the cape of good hope and were steering northeast to the continent of india when some gentlemen on board having studied geography and navigation found in the latitude in which they then were a very great ridge of rocks laid down in their sea charts upon this they applied themselves to the captain of the ship and acquainted him with the danger which they apprehended desiring him at the same time to communicate what they had discovered to the pilot which request he immediately gratified recommending to the pilot to lie by in the night and slacken sail by day till they should be past the danger by the discipline of the portugueze navy the sailing part is absolutely committed to the care of the pilot who is answerable with his head for the safe carriage of the kings ship and under no manner of direction from the captain who commands in all other respects  instead of complying with so reasonable a request on which the safety of so many lives depended the insolent pilot thinking it an affront to be taught in his own art crowded more sail than he carried before  the observations of these gentlemen were too true not to have a fatal issue they had not sailed many hours but just upon break of day which would have been prevented if they had lain by the ship struck upon a rock and broke her back  i leave to the readers imagination what a scene of horror this must be the fright of twelve hundred persons in the same inevitable danger at the sight of that instantaneous death which stard them in the face  the captain in this distress ordered the pinnace to be launched into which after having tossed in a small quantity of biscuit and some few boxes of marmelade he got himself with nineteen others who seeing the danger of a crowd in the common horror rushing into the boat drew their swords and prevented the coming in of any more the same necessity obliged them immediately to put off lest their pinnace should be drawn in by the suction of the sinking carrack  here their eyes were entertained with the most dismal of spectacles the sight of their sinking friends and their ears with the cries of so many in the same misery whom they could not help without their own destruction a scene of woe which nothing could alleviate but the reflection that they themselves were not in the same extremity though humanly speaking they were not in a much better condition being destitute on the vast indian ocean in an open boat without any compass to direct them without any fresh water but what must fall from those heavens whose mercy alone could deliver them to which must be added the inevitable danger of being overset by the first wind that should raise the waves besides the certainty of perishing as soon as their small stock of provisions should be spent which only served to prolong their miseries by reserving them for a more lingering and cruel death in this distress after they had for four days rowed to and fro without guide or direction the captain who had been sick and very weak for some time overcome with grief and fatigue died this added if possible to their misery for now they fell into the last confusion every one would govern and none would obey this obliged them to choose one of their own company to command them whose orders they agreed implicitly without any reserve to follow  the choice fell upon a gentleman who was what the portugueze call a mestizzo that is one begotten between an european and an indian this person vested with his new authority proposed to the company to draw lots and throw every fourth man overboard by reason their provision was spent so far as not to last above three days longer they were now nineteen persons in all in this number were a friar and the carpenter both whom they would exempt by reason of their being so necessary the one to absolve and comfort them in their last extremity and the other to take care of the boat in case of a leak or other accident the same compliment they paid to their new captain he being the odd man and his life of more consequence than any of the rest he refused a great while but at last acquiesced so that there were four to dye out of the sixteen remaining  the three first on whom the lot fell after having confessed and received absolution submitted to their fate  the fourth whom fortune condemned was a portugueze gentleman who had a younger brother in the boat who seeing him about to be flung overboard most tenderly embraced him and with tears in his eyes besought him to let him dye for him enforcing his arguments by telling him that he was a married man and had a wife and children at goa besides the care of three sisters who absolutely depended upon him that as for himself he was single and his life of no great importance he therefore conjured him to let him supply his place  the elder brother astonished and melted with this generosity replied that since the providence of god had appointed him it would be wicked and unjust to suffer any other to dye for him especially a brother to whom he was so infinitely obliged  the younger would take no denial but flinging himself on his knees held his brother so fast that they could not disengage them thus they disputed for a while the elder brother bidding him be a father to his wife and children and as he would inherit his estate take care of their common sisters but all he could say made him not desist this was a scene of tenderness which must fill with pity any breast susceptible of generous impressions  at last as it is no difficult thing to persuade a man to live the constancy of the elder brother yielded to the piety of the younger he acquiesced and suffered the gallant young man to supply his place who being flung into the water when he came to it could not be content to dye but being a very good swimmer got to the stern of the pinnace and laid hold with his right hand which being perceived by one of the sailors he cut off the hand with a cutlass upon which dropping into the sea he caught hold again with his left which received the same fate by a second blow thus dismembered in his two hands he made a shift notwithstanding to keep himself above water with his feet and two stumps  this moving spectacle so raised the pity of the whole crew that they cried out he is but one man let us save him which was accordingly done and he taken into the boat had his hands bound up as well as the place and circumstances would permit they rowed all that night and next morning when the sun arose as if heaven would reward the gallantry and piety of this young man and for his sake save all the rest they descried land which proved to be the mountains of mozambique in africa where the portugueze have a colony hither they all safely got where they staid till the next ships from lisbon passed by and carried this company to goa where linschotten a dutch author of good credit assures us that he himself saw them land supped with the two brothers that very night saw the younger with his stumps and had the story from both their mouths

trade there is one disadvantage unavoidably annexed to it  it weakens our humanity and eradicates an open confidence which most men are born with but lose as it were insensibly by the influence of low maxims such as are early imprinted on the minds of all who are educated to the arts of bargaining  the notions of such men unless in some extraordinary cases are strangely narrow and confined they are seldom capable of relishing or even of comprehending the extent of a disinterested beneficence  their wisdom is but cunning and their learning is a craft when they hear the fame of some vast bounty some expansion of the soul that is unusual and astonishing instead of that emotion and warm transport of heart which it excites in the generous all their wonder is the effect of their incapacity to conceive it for measuring it by a supposition that there must be some latent design they are at a loss to account for the gain or the drift of it  civility in these men is not manners but mystery their friendships are a kind of barterings for exchange of good offices and the weakest of their passions are their love and their pity  no condition of life can be more afflicted and mortifying than the misery of owing money to these scantlings of humanity they consider you then no longer on the foot of merit or quality but as if good manners and decency were their ready money commodities they throw off all respect and grow brutal and unsociable  mr hawthorn my neighbor the sussex justice of the quorum came lately into the assembly with a mien disturbed and martial he swung his arms like a pendulum his face was flushed and flaming and his whole gesture menacing he puffed and breathed short sat him down in one of the windows threw his hat upon the floor and as soon as he could speak intelligibly gave us loudly to understand that he had been waiting six hours in a tavern without eating or drinking with a furious determination to break the head of the vintner  is this said he the goodbreeding of your welcomemongers that keep taverns  is this the little flattering scraping sneering wagtail fellow that used to be so ready and so nimble  to rub his hands and wriggle forward like a spaniel to the streetend of his entry  odsbobs it was a lucky reprieve for his bones that he was gone down to the customhouse for i am verily convinced that in the fury of my heart i should have broke the kings peace though i had lost my commission for it  the assembly was by this time in a midway disposition betwixt mirth and astonishment when he threw me a rumpled paper and nodded at me to open it i did so in some confusion and perceived it was a letter which upon a second permissive nod i read aloud to the company  for squire robert hawthorn these sir i should athought how such as you should a been a man of honor your friend as gave you a character promised that you was ready money for that pipe of neat port as i sent away by your order to the carriers in the borough  but i find no

in perplexity what to say when ned volatile whose levity is sometimes of much weight interposed very seasonably and with his usual vein of humor  lend your cudgel to me mr justice of the quorum for if you should pay him your self you will pay him with interest  besides it is an honor that every body does not merit  to be beat by a magistrate  the matter is not so great neither  if you will do me

candlesticks  but as to poor winpenny he is an honest fellow at bottom and no worse than a miser  but so pleasantly covetous that if you were as learned in him as i am you would forgive him out of gratitude for the laughter he would afford you  shall i tell you a merry story of him  poor winpenny you must know lost a cargo of wine that was coming to him from lisbon and in the anguish of his heart he resolved to live no longer he tied a rope about his neck and fastning it to a beam in his cellar jumped heroically off from an unlucky empty hogshead that tumbled down from its stand and alarmed one of his drawers who was unseasonably vigilant the silly rogue cried out and i happening at that time to be drinking behind the bar run immediately down and as illluck would have it came time enough to cut the rope  great endeavors were used to compose his ruffled mind  but when he was told the next morning in what manner he was preserved he grew desperate and uncomfortable and nothing would serve his turn but his rope must be paid for  i have the bill at home uncancelld where he charges me by way of postscript with this remarkable article  for cutting a new rope what you please or think reasonable  mr hawthorn lost his anger in ned volatiles start of pleasantry and the assembly grew composed and took occasion from this incident to enter upon a serious and instructive chain of reasoning on the loveliness of that quality which is called generosity at the close of which the major who had listened from the beginning with a silent approbation and a face augustly sweetened with an amiable reverence took his turn in the conversation and as soon as he offered to speak a cheerful expectation appeared in the eyes of the whole company and every body paid him the homage of a voluntary attention  i have been greatly delighted said this friend of mankind with the discourse which i have heard of an excellence i love and which i remember a fine experience of by a companion of mine an agreeable young fellow who in an exigency that befell him tried the difference of mens natures  he applied himself to two persons of whom one was his near relation and the other had been his schoolfellow he sent each of them a letter which had the same contents verbatim  from the first he had this answer i keep both copies in my pocketbook for i should be sorry to lose either  dear tom you could never have applied your self to me at so unlucky a time as now for i have not a loose corn by me the funds are to me instead of a strong box and you know when they are in such a fair way of rising one would not willingly sell out unless for some extraordinary occasion i send you the note again because it dont fall in my way to make the proposed use of it but i am heartily and sincerely sorry that it should happen to be thus out of my power for no body in the world can be more willing and ready at all times to serve you than  dear tomsy your loving uncle and real friend d w   the answer to his other letter was very different and runs thus sir no good news can be more welcome than a proof that i am honored with the friendship of the deserving  i must consider in this light the obligation you have laid me under by that confidence you allowed to my professions of sincerity  this bill should have come alone but that i find my self under a necessity to rectify a mistake you have made in the note you sent me  forgive me therefore that i return it you i am with the greatest respect  sir your most obliged and most obedient servant m z   the note which he sent back was that by which my friend had acknowledged his receipt of the money he desired to borrow and which he promised to repay on demand to the lender or his order all this the refined obliger had erazd with his pen and instead of it wrote what follows on the blank side of the paper  i do hereby declare that i owe five hundred guineas to my good friend mr s  and will always reserve them in a readiness for his call in return for the pleasure he has given me by borrowing of me one hundred  while we were expressing our satisfaction in this finespirited instance of the art of enlarging favors by the manner of conferring them the alderman was observed to have fixed his eyes on the floor in a posture of thought and sadness that was very unusual in him  ned volatile who had just made a tour round the table to beg a pinch of spanish from the coquetts venetian snuff box passing close behind the alderman and supposing him fast asleep guided part of it to his nose and roused him into a fit of sneezing which as soon as he was freed from he looked round for ned volatile and after a half smile and a sober wag of his head thus addressed himself to the company  i knew i owed this favor to the wantonness of that young madcap who is as full of mischief as a monkey he fancied i was nodding and truly i am sorry that he happened to be mistaken for i was musing and very melancholy  this story of the majors brought afresh into my mind an extraordinary accident that i met with my self in the year of the great frost that was before the revolution  many losses that year had disabled me to make good my credit so that i was run upon by my enemies and gave myself up for no better than a gone man but one morning early  i shall never forget it  i was just come down into my counting house in my nightgown and slippers  when in comes a porter and delivers me a letter and away he goes immediately without asking for an answer  the letter was from a merchant that had formerly been my best friend but we had broke off for some years upon my refusing to lend him a thousand pounds upon his bond and we had never conversed since that time till now that he sent this letter the contents of which were to tell me that he was sorry to hear what was reported abroad to the discredit of my circumstances for he knew it must be owing to some unfortunate accident since whatever defects i had i could never want frugality  but however says he if five thousand pounds can save you call for it when you please and i will lend it you by way of punishment for an unkindness of yours formerly and since the mortification this must give you merits pardon for your fault i will forget it from this time forward that we may be friends again as usual  the alderman interrupted himself in this part of his story by a sudden burst of tears which he strove in vain to suppress and which affected the whole assembly with a sympathy more touching than could have been excited by the most pathetick force of eloquence  he recovered himself after a short pause and went on to inform us that within less than a week after he had saved himself from ruin by receipt of this money his generous friend the merchant fell out of a boat below bridge and was unfortunately drowned  it is true continued the good alderman i repaid it very punctually and have made all acknowledgments and done all services in my power to his sorrowful widow and his children  but alas what did all that signify  he was dead that had obliged me  and gone beyond all possibility of ever knowing how i repented my unkind usage of him and what a shame and a change his generosity had produced in me  he would willingly have spoke more but could not support his anguish  and wept again very passionately so that rising abruptly he hastened out of the room and left us all in great disorder  the plain dealer no     nugis addere pondus hor monday april         i yesterday went to see a very agreeable friend at whose house i found a handsome appearance of young people of both sexes upon my entrance every one rose and very obligingly proffered me a seat each insisting on the preference i should give in acceptance of the honor designed me  as i was unwilling to disoblige any one where all had treated me with so much civility i winked at my friend who with great formality conducted me to a large elbowchair and put an end to the dispute  while i was wondering with a secret pleasure at such an unaccustomed piece of goodbreeding and examining the countenances of the company my friend who till then had discoursed of indifferent matters told me with a smile he had assembled this set of young people with a promise of showing them the plain dealer and therefore desired i would throw aside all reservedness and look upon every one as my professed admirer and friend which was immediately confirmed by a general reverence  i thanked him for the favor he had done me in introducing me to such agreeable society and could not help discovering by my looks the inward satisfaction i felt at the sight of so much youth and beauty which ended in that melancholy reflection how many dangers it was exposed to and how easily it might be vitiated  when the teaequipage was removed and every one remained silent in expectation of what i should say the charming leonilla my friends eldest daughter after having first fixed her eyes on a young lady that sat opposite to her and then on me desired in behalf of part of the company i would give my opinion in the case of that restriction young women lie under who from a custom which in her opinion had no just grounds for its support are forbid by decency let their passion be the most virtuous and tender that was ever felt to make the least advance by which the party beloved may discover the sentiments they have in his favor to which i answered a woman of sense can never feel that tenderness for a fool  and a man of sense would always reckon such a declaration a desire of enjoying that happiness whose basis is love and whose support is virtue  after i had delivered my opinion in favor of leonilla i turned to the lady with whom i could perceive by the blush in her cheeks she had been disputing and told her there was a false as well as a true decency and that one consisted in grimace and show the other in an open deportment the result of an unaffected disinterested love of virtue and that it would always be found a man has no more reason to conceive hopes from the free converse of the latter than to fear success from the distant carriage of the former true virtue wants no foil and is never talking of itself false virtue sensible of its weakness is forced to have recourse to hypocrisy and is ever boasting a strength it is a stranger to  as i was running on in this grave discourse i was interrupted by a young gentleman who told us he had just met with a copy of verses said to be written by lady w  y m  e wherein he thought there was the most delicate sense of virtue mixed with the most agreeable turn of wit upon the whole companys desiring to see it he pulled a paper out of his pocket and read as follows  the resolve whilst thirst of praise and vain desire of fame in every age is every womans aim with courtship pleased of silly toasters proud fond of a train and happy in a crowd on each poor fool bestowing some kind glance each

been tried he comes too near that comes to be denied we all agreed in the character he had given of this little piece particularly a gentleman who has a smattering in poetry who not to be behindhand with the sex in modesty produced the subsequent lines which he desired i would read to the company  answer to the resolve whilst empty coxcombs blast a womans fame in every state and every age the same with their own folly pleased each fair they toast and where they least are happy swear they are most no difference marking twixt the gay and lewd but dreaming all who fly would be pursued whilst thus they vainly think and vainly live lost to that reverence loves soft lessons give let this great maxim be my passions guide may i never hope where i am never denied nor gain a woman willing to be tried if before we were loud in commendation of the first here we were extravagant the ladies oppressed him with thanks and told him he should lose nothing by the generous opinion he had entertained of the sex to which a wag in company with an envious smile replied if he should lose nothing by it he was sure he would get nothing but what would be merited by his mortifications  my friend perceiving both parties grew warm desired them before they went on to consider what they were saying since he was persuaded the plain dealer would print the occurrences of that day upon which they all composed their looks and a general silence ensued when my friend turning to me you see says he the necessity of a man of your character every way youre serviceable the public feels the benefit of your

promised at the first opportunity to comply with and calling at my printers as i went home found the following billet which but for the advice my friend gave me i should hardly have been prevailed upon to make public  to the plain dealer april   th      sir the best construction i can put upon your attempt is vanity or folly for unless you look upon yourself as superior to the authors of the

have as just a veneration as any man living for the laws of my native country they are generous mild and gentle built on equal foundations of justice and mercy and to say all in a word they are such as every freeman would wish to be governed by i am so far from denying them the reverence they deserve that i have always read with pleasure the most elaborate and strained encomiums with which the gentlemen of the robe fill their writings on this subject  but since it is the most desirable among all the advantages of liberty to think and speak freely it cannot i hope be offensive if i declare myself not well satisfied with any arguments i have yet heard in defense of capital punishment for certain crimes which are low and frequent and which carry methinks no proportion in comparison with others of a much blacker complexion to which notwithstanding they seem paralleled by the equality of their sentence  the life of a man is so infinitely of more value than his beast or his moveable that whenever i see the sufferings of pinched and hungerstarved wretches under the agonies of an execution for having robbed perhaps to avoid famishing i find myself oppressed by a grief which nothing mitigates but this reflection  that their lives were exposed to such extremities of want and misery that their death should be a comfort  and yet the long protracted gazings the paleness the tremblings and the ghastly distorted faces of the poor departing strugglers who die with strong reluctance and linger and lengthen out their last painful moment make it evident to the beholders that unfriendly as the world was to them they are not willing to forsake it  i am convinced that if it were possible to see on some such plain as that of salisbury under one assembled prospect the whole number of men and women who have been executed for theft only in all the counties of this kingdom within the memory of any person of but a moderate advance in years such a dreadful demonstration of the waste which is made by this sweep of the sword of justice would be a startling inducement to those whose province it is known to be to weigh with pity and deliberation whether punishments more adequate and more politic too than death might not easily be appropriated to a number of petty crimes which ever were and ever must be unavoidably frequent in all peopled places being the necessary consequences either of the wants or the depravity of the lowest part of the human species  one evening very lately all my neighborhood in barbican were in an uproar on a sudden and i was disturbed in my meditations by the shrieking of women the mixed cries of children and a growing hum of concourse that seemed close under my window  i threw aside my pipe and hastening to look out saw the street entirely filled by a groupe of dismal faces that had gathered themselves into a tumult about a house directly opposite and appeared to be touched as strongly as common natures are capable with a mixture of surprise and sorrow it seems the husband of a laborious poor creature who was mistress of this house had been condemned at the county assizes in one of the late circuits for stealing a horse and a letter had just now been delivered to his wife which the criminal himself had written the very morning he was executed  his relations and acquaintance had depended on a reprieve for the man was universally beloved among his neighbors and though always very poor and unfortunate in his dealings had been remarkable for his industry of a sober disposition and never known before to have been guilty of the least dishonesty he had six children alive and the eldest but eight years old his mother who lived in the same little house had been disabled by sickness for several months past so that perceiving it beyond his power to subsist his family any longer and not daring to stay in town by reason of some debts he had contracted he went down to try his friends who lived in good circumstances in the country but instead of meeting with assistance he only spent in this journey all the little he had carried with him and not being able to support the thoughts of returning without bread to a family in such want of it he rode away with a horse which he found tied to a gate and being pursued and overtaken was tried condemned and hanged for it  this history was loudly given me by the good women in the street after which i had the curiosity to press in among the crowd and was struck at my first entrance by the most moving scene of sorrow that i ever remember to have met with the widow had broke open her husbands letter in transport concluding that it brought her the confirmation of a reprieve which a former had given her hopes of but she was so shocked and overwhelmed by the sudden reverse of passion that her grief was a kind of madness she sat on the floor without headcloaths and had an infant cross her knees that was crying with great impatience for the breast it had been thrown from another slept in a cradle close by a little bed in which the grandmother sat weeping bending forward in strong agony and wringing her hands in silence the four eldest children were gathered into a knot and clung about the neck of their miserable mother stamping screaming and kissing her in a storm of distracted tenderness  the poor woman herself was in a condition past describing she pressed the letter of her dead husband to her eyes  her lips  her bosom  she raved and talked and questioned him as if he had been present  and at every little interval dried her tears with his letter and cast a look upon the company so wild and so full of horror that it cannot be conceived but by those who were witnesses of it  as soon as she saw me there she stretched out her hand and made signs that i should read the letter which i received from her accordingly and going back to my lodging with a resolution to send over some fitter person than myself to assist in the distresses of so disconsolate a family i sat down and took a copy of it because it moved me exceedingly  dear loving betty it is now nine a clock and i must be fetched out by and by and go to die before eleven i shall see my poor bess no more in this world but if we meet one another again in the next as i hope in god we shall we may never part afterward methinks if i could but only once more look upon my good betty before i die though it should be but for a minute and say a kind word to my fatherless children that must starve now if god dont take care for them i should go away with a good heart and yet sometimes i fancy it is better as it is for it would be sad to die afterward and i fear it would make me fainthearted and i should be wishing that i might live to get you bread and clothes for your poor precious bodies sarah tailor made my heart ache when she told me that you had pawned away every thing to make up that last fifty shillings that you sent me by will sanderson who is now in the room with me and sits down upon the straw that i laid on last night and is weeping for me like a child but god will make up all the money to you again that you have let me have to no purpose and i should be sorry that any unkind body should hit it in your teeth that i come to such an untimely bad end for i thought as little of it as they do but all the way as i walked up to london afoot i could not help having a fancy in my head at every turn that i saw my poor dear betty and my six helpless little ones hanging upon me and crying out bitterly that they had no bread to keep life in em and begging me to buy them some and so i thought that i would sell that horse and make you believe that i got money of your sister parker but she was too sparing for that and would never once look upon me  i pray to god to forgive her and if she would but be good to you when i am gone god bless her  loving betty remember me to my sorrowful mother and tell her not to take on too much and bid richard and harry take warning by my fall if ever they come to be men and for the poor girls they are too young as yet to understand any thing you can say to them gods goodness be your comfort and if you can dont think about me for it will make you only melancholy  i hope the old deputy will be kind to you and help you to do somewhat i am sorry i cannot write no more because my tears are come into my eyes  little did i think of this dismal parting  oh it is very sad  god bless you in this unhappy world dear dear betty  from your unfortunate dying husband r s ps nothing vexes me but when i think that it is a very hard case for a man to be made to die for a horse they say the king is to have him he is not worth much but if my poor betty had the money he could be sold for it would be some comfort however for then i should not have left you all so bare as you be now     i carried this letter with me to the assembly where it was universally agreed that there is a plainhearted honesty very manifest in all parts of it and a generous and manly sorrow not arising so much from his own desire to live as from a prospect of their wants whom his death was to leave destitute our clergyman in particular was greatly moved to compassion and proposed a charitable collection to be sent to the poor widow to which himself contributed first in a very liberal proportion  he related to us afterward an extraordinary dying speech of a very different turn which he heard made when a student by a housebreaker who was hanged for murder and a robbery  good people said the criminal since i am to serve you for a sight the least you can do is to be civil to the man that entertains you i ask nothing of you but the justice that is due to me there are some meddling tongues which i can hear among the crowd very busy to incense you though it is true i have committed murder yet i hope i am no murderer the felony i really purposed but my intention had no part in the death that i was guilty of the deceased cried for help and was so obstinate and clamorous that i was under a necessity to kill him or submit my self to be taken and thus i argued in my mind if i murder him i shall get off or at worst if i am taken my punishment will be no greater than if i spare him and surrender i can be but hanged for murder and i must be hanged too for the housebreaking this thought good people prevailed with me to shoot him so that what you call murder was but selfpreservation now that i should have died in this same manner whether i had shot him or no witness these two weak brothers here who look as if they were already at the other end of their voyage though they have not hoisted sail yet one of these stole some bacon and the other a wet smock or two the law must be certainly wiser than you are and since that has been pleased to set our crimes on a level be so civil or compassionate as to hold your silly tongues and let me die without slander we had several other stories on this subject of the public executions but none pleased me better than one which i shall close my paper with and which we were also obliged to the vicar for  the late king of sweden had condemned a soldier to die and stood at a little distance from the place of execution the fellow when he heard this was in hopes of a pardon but being assured he was mistaken cried his tongue was yet free he would use it at his pleasure which he did with great license accusing the king most insolently and as loud as he could speak of barbarity and injustice and appealing to god for revenge of his wronged innocence the king not hearing him distinctly inquired of those about him what the soldier had been saying and was told by a general officer who was unwilling to heighten his resentment against the miserable that he had only repeated very often and loud that god loves the merciful and teaches the mighty to moderate their anger the king was touched by the lesson and sent his pardon to the criminal but a courtier of an opposite interest took advantage of this occasion and repeated to the king exactly the licentiousness of the fellows railing adding gravely when he had done that men of quality and trust ought never in his opinion to misrepresent facts to their sovereign the king for some time stood suspended in his thoughts but turning at length toward the courtier with a face of reproof it is the first time says he that ever i have been betrayed for my advantage but the lie of your enemy pleased me better than your truth does the plain dealer no     trahit sua quemque voluptas dic mihi si fueras tu leo qualis eris mart monday may       there are in every mans life even the wisest and most fortified certain periods of weakness which demonstrate our common frailty and seem thrown into our nature as preservatives against pride and for the mortification of human vanity  that venerable sage of old who has left us this aphorism that no man should be esteemed happy till after his death might have extended his observation as well to our conduct as our fortune let no man during life be called resolute or prudent  could i ever have thought that after passing my giddy youth in a steady contempt of beauty i should be enslaved to it against judgment in my grand climacterick if the duty of a plain dealer did not indispensibly oblige me to the most rigid impartiality even to the giving sentence against myself with what face could i confess what i am ashamed when i but think of that i who am a staid old bachelor am afraid i am falling in love with patty amble the coquet who always seemed to me to have been born in a fit of laughter and never had a thought of gravity but when it furnished her with an occasion to divert herself at the expense of it  well if this should in good earnest come to pass i shall have a most uncomfortable time of it what reason i have had and from what time to suspect it i shall without reserve communicate in the progress of my papers but let it prove what it will the occasion of this preamble is from an unusual disorder in which i am come home this evening after a kind of frolicksome adventure with that young romp which has left me under an impression little better than witchcraft though at any time before last easter i should have thought it not worth telling  to day when she hoydend into the assembly the whole company rose together and received her with that pleasure which her gayety diffuses every where she sailed through us all with a swimming smiling port that was visibly affected but irresistably engaging  when she had fluttered and fidgeted and sloped her self forward and wheeled down her hoop to the widest swell of its unequal in a circular course of courtesies she tript sideways to her seat and i was just beginning to hope calm weather after such a whirlwind of ceremony when she rose as it were in a start with a look most whimsically serious and drawing a paper from her bosom paced demurely to my chair  she carried her head to the left side softly sweeping her right eyebrow with the knob of her fan and sinking forward when she came near me with a fantastical air of languishment brushed my mouth with her paper and began to play over her tricks in a long and mystical jargon of most womanish impertinence  and were they said she so naughty to leave it by it is nown self and did no body help it to write it is plaindealers and was it abused and overworkd and neglected well then let it be good and mind it is book and wash it is face and forget to be cross and comb it is head and throw away it is dirty stick and see what i intend to do for it there take it and print it and dont care a pin for the work they have put upon it for i love it and will think for it and bring it good things and if it would not look grim i should buss it and stroke it and chuck it under the chin and make much of it and play with it and  etc  etc  etc   after this silly rate she ran on with a ridiculous but lively and neverending volubility and perceiving that the company laughed out and were diverted at the grotesque figure i was making under her hands at length she kissed me outright and set em all in an uproar i would fain have looked peevish i turned my face from her and cried pish  and pshaw  and fiddle  and shook my head in a great heat and winchd in both shoulders and much pains i took to seem nettled and uneasy but to confess a foolish truth it was all but mere show for i was never so agreeably made an ass of in my life and while i felt the busy wanderings of her fingers about my face i was stung i cannot tell how with a kind of tingling delight all over me which being desirous to prolong i pretended to make efforts for pushing her away and under that pretense gave my hands the opportunity of touching her here and there  and i must own i was sorry when she put an end to her gambols  but as soon as i came home and looked into her paper i was not so much an ass far gone as i found myself but that i presently discerned her drift and i wish with all my heart that i had courage enough to return it her and tell her in downright terms i dont think it worth printing but whatever the cause of this strange alteration may be there is nothing so dreadful to me as the danger of disobliging this shecockatrice since therefore i am in this odd manner bewitched even take it in the arch flirts own words for it is no work of mine and i will have nothing to do with it  the ladies equivalent a tale with a moral to it in the reign of the emperor justinian the city of constantinople was much thronged with foreigners for whose entertainment unusual pastimes were invented the public theaters were embellished interlarded and embroidered with music magic and tumbling and such unspeakable additions as were fittest to give pleasure to the eyes of goths vandals and saracens to whom plays alone were insipid because acted in a language which they were in a manner wholly strangers to  theodora the empress had been formerly a comedian and was a liberal promoter of whatever could contribute to make pleasure pompous among the numbers who found their interest in this byas of the court there was a wily and egregious african whom for the flatness of his nose the tawniness of his complexion and a certain majestical brutality in the composition of his features the merry greeks had nicknamed the lion this man became rich by the universal encouragement that was given to an odd project of his starting  it was a kind of blindbuzzard or midnightmummery of which it is difficult at this great distance of time to conceive a clear notion but persons of the highest rank of both sexes met there disguised and under borrowed resemblances danced regaled and discoursed with each other at large and disengaged from all ceremony distinction or punctilio  it was generally allowed however by all but the lyons enemies that nothing passed in these meetings either scandalous or misbecoming every thing was magnificent ornamental and enlivening but no privacies were permitted nor indecencies connived at  it fell out notwithstanding most unfortunately for the lion that religion was at this time very flaming and watchful the good fathers of the church became scandalized and alarmed at the probability of impurities in this newinvented nightwork for it was dangerous they knew to allow such latitude to their female flock while their shepherds were at rest who kept the wolf from biting them they determine therefore vigorously to remonstrate against it but there was one considerable rub that lay full in their way the emperor himself was often present at these meetings and indulged them as an innocent and agreeable recreation  to remove this heavy difficulty the good fathers with great dexterity charged the motive of their fears upon the weakness of the women whose natures they said were liable to very dangerous impressions from those whisperings and squeezings and inflammations of their vanity they went on to assert that a womans defense against man lying rather in her dread of shame than her abhorrence of iniquity she should never be thought safe while under the hazard of temptations the men indeed they believed might be strong enough to resist but not their wives and their daughters weak vessels and brittle and which would break with a fall it were prudence therefore to place them out of the public reach and cupboard them up for the household use of their owners so they humbly represented that it would be an act of great piety and edification if his imperial majesty gave command for the total suppression of these new nurseries of debauchery  it is one thing to be pious and another to be wise the warmth of their zeal had not suffered them to consider that there were women of wit and spirit who would vindicate their sexs honor and make use of their powerful influence to oppose the good end of these reverend memorialists were it for no other reason but because the means were unmannerly theodora the empress was provoked to the last degree and after reproaching their partiality and the mean and false ideas which they had conceived of womens virtue fell to reason with them in this manner  how contemptibly would your sex compel us to consider them if all men were to treat us with so ungenerous a diffidence is it possible think ye that our persons can be won before our hearts have disposed of em and whenever we love passionately we have courage to act resolutely and make opportunities if we were not allowed to find em if you once confine our bodies you set our minds at full liberty our natures are too generous to deceive those who trust us but we think it a merit to make fools of the faithless the lion grinning horribly behind the empresss chair was ready to roar with delight at this rebuke to the fathers but steadfast and immovable in the piety of their purpose they were about to reply at large when the emperor who had meanings not to be traced on his countenance concealing his resentment returned this answer to their remonstrance  i thank you for this religious simplicity of your proceeding you are the eyes of our conscience and see farther than we can but i am not more pleased with your applying for redress of this formidable grievance than surpised at your overlooking another of like tendency and which your laudable zeal for removing temptations must excite you to thank me for resolving to see remedied  the women have a custom when they stand in need of absolution to send for their confessor and open their hearts to him in their closets were all your reverend order of equal sanctity with you this could possibly administer no just cause of scandal but since nature is depraved and there have been wolves in sheeps clothing i conceive it a design of much edification to abolish for the future this indulgence of the women and withhold their absolution till they come for it to the churches intending therefore to join these good purposes in one i commit it to your care to prepare an edict for both that i may decree it into law with as much speed as possible  the good fathers were so unexpectedly and beyond measure confounded at this overliberal extent of the emperors pious purpose that they stood long at a loss to find fit words to thank him but they did it at last with this hope in the rear of all  that his high and imperial majesty would not hasten them too much in two decrees of such importance since the empress had urged some arguments to prove one of them needless and who could tell when they came to examine things more closely but they might be mistaken in both of em  thus i have given you the coquets story and am well enough aware what the gypsys head was running on but if any body should desire to be made as wise as i am i shall tell em an old story and let em take it in satisfaction  a philosopher bought some meat and returning from the market hid it under his cloak an impertinent fellow met him and would needs know what it was  it is there said the philosopher on purpose that you should not know it  the plain dealer no     pr pari referemus cicero friday may        little follies which we but smile at in persons who are indifferent to us gives us sorrow and pain when observed in those we love patty amble is of late become of such importance that i watch her with a tenderness that interests me in all her actions for this reason i am frequently contriving to interrupt her when she lets her tongue run races that outgallop her reason but i always lose my labor my operations upon this gossip are like the winds upon fire i may blow till my breath fails  instead of putting her out i make her burn but the faster  i have succeeded however in what i failed to do myself by the assistance of ned volatile but not to assume more triumph than is due to me the stratagem i made use of was found out by shakespeare before me that poetical politican taught his richard the third among the rest of his surprising victories to conquer a womans tongue but it was by aid of one of his drums which no sooner beat up but the enemy was put to silence  we shall now enjoy some freedom and may all talk in our turns for ned and the coquet will be played off at pleasure when either of em grows troublesome we shall let loose the rival and like sulphur and saltpeter one shall blow up the other  patty amble came yesterday finely dressed to the assembly ready to burst with impatience for our admiration of her fancy she kept us silent above an hour while she was so kind as to open to us the labors and difficulties she had for fourteen days been fatigued by before she could unite so elegantly all her trifling varieties from her head to her foot she obliged us with the minutes of her whole fortnights history it was not to be expected that in the midst of so much business she could be at leisure to consider that after we had approved both the price and color of her damask it was of no great edification at least to the male part of the company to know what shop she bought it at but happy had it been could she have found rest so speedily nothing like it i assure you we were also to learn in what places she missed it yet for my own part i must say i was particularly edified by her critical remarks on certain differences to be found betwixt buying on ludgate hill or of the mercers about covent garden  but ill fare say i that unlucky word garden it put her fatally in mind of a fat freshcolourd country lady who could never be persuaded to make visits in any thing but garden silks though her arms were as big as a rollingstone then the unfortunate word fat brought as aptly to her remembrance poor old dimpley the laughing staymaker that used to work for her grandmother when first she was married and never laced our patty when she was a girl but she made her very neck ache with twisting it to look back at him at length after infinite disappointments and dangers she arrived safe at her hooppetticoat where being seized with a fit of gratitude for the parliaments strange good nature and extraordinary care of trade she was thinking to turn whig because they had taken off the duty that lay so heavy upon whalebone  well as to that however she was not altogether so positive but there was one thing of more consequence that she was absolutely convinced of she would venture any wager that not one person in the company could be able to guess what her ground brussels head had cost her a yard nor where nor by what particular odd accident she had been so happy as to light of it the duchess of m  r took coach in a fright the very moment she saw it to buy up the remnant but since she was sure we could not guess she would tell us the price her self and not name one farthing more or less than it really cost her she wondered for her part how women could be so silly for what signified after all the little vanity of being thought skilled in good pennyworths if she had a mind to be vain she need only believe what was said to her at the opera by a certain duke who must be nameless but one thing his grace was pleased with that she might venture to speak of and it was that fancy of her own upon her fan lord she remembered too he observed that there was something in a ladys fan much genteeler in its use than any part of the mens equipage  it was just in this place that i took pity of the company for i thought i felt their heads ache so tipping the wink on ned volatile he started up from his chair with such a stare of amazement that one would have thought he was apprehensive the house had been falling the coquet started too and holding her tongue till she could look round her ned with wonderful agility snatched the nick of that interval and resolving at once to bear down all opposition broke in upon her like a torrent with this sudden exclamation  ah madam madam what a trifle is a fan in comparison with a feather i should be sorry to dissent from any opinion you are fond of but pray let your reason be judge of this difference i have one in my hat here that all the african ostriches clubbing tails to produce the fellow of it might be moulting these thousand years and all to no purpose dear madam do but look on it the nearer you examine it the more it will charm you with all your wit now and your industry my life to one of your lappits it puzzles you these three hours to guess where i bought it i cannot be altogether so positive that you will not hit the price of it but upon my honor if you should i will acknowledge it to a farthing there is some pleasure in conversing on these critical affairs with so nice a judge as you madam why here is a coat i have worn this five weeks and not one in fifty has had the taste to take notice that all the wool it was made of is true unmixed spanish you were saying something about whalebone it is a useful commodity indeed as you ladies have managed it but what are hoop petticoats to the woollen manufacture  for heavens sake take breath cried the coquet swiftly fanning herself and half bursting with a windyness from suppression of meanings do but hear what i was going to say to you  never never replied ned he can never be a good subject who submits to hear any thing to the prejudice of the woollen manufacture mark the wonderful progress of this silly thing called wool but from the sheeps back to mine take notice in the first place of these few of the many mysteries which depend on this humble material there is the grazier for example and the shepherd and the shearer and the sorter and the comber and the carder and the spinner and the dyer and the scowrer and the fuller and the weaver and the napper and the presser and the stretcher and the carrier and the factor and the draper and the tailor and the packer and the merchant but mentioning the word merchant i must stop a little in my way and lay open to you the wonders and advantages of navigation i shall inform you clearly and distinctly under their proper heads and divisions to what different corners of the universe you madam are obliged for all those ornaments which are adorned by you i will begin like a good builder and examine first your foundation that glittering pair of shoes which we can but see the pointed tips of had a long and tiresome journey to the prettiest foot in the world from three most distant parts of it the silver in their lacing you are indebted for to america now you would ask me as i go along whence that new quarter of the globe took this name of america i shall come to it in its turn but first you must be acquainted with the fortunes of its chief discoverers spanish english french portuguese and hollanders and for clearing things more effectually to your apprehension i shall with as much brevity as possible trace the originals and histories of these nations but speaking just now of silver i am presented by that means with a fortunate opportunity to sail away with you for peru and when once i have got you there we shall never want amusements suited to the mercury of your spirit for in the first place madam i will carry you to the bottom of those mines which have enriched and embroiled all europe and because i know you are a lady of most unsatisfied curiosity i will now anticipate in some measure this improvement i design for you for i will enumerate in their proper order the subterraneous inhabitants of the whole mineral kingdom there is gold madam and silver and copper and tin and quicksilver your favorite madam and iron and lead and antimony and marchasites and lapis calaminaris and pyrites and vitriol and allom and brimstone and sal gem and crystal and marble and millstone and alabaster and bolus and ochre and talc madam and of all these i will immediately explain to you the growth and the operations and their strange and distinct uses whether in science or in trade and afterward i will take occasion from this wonderful provision of materials for our industry to demonstrate beyond denial how needless it is for man woman or beast to live idle and unuseful but first for i would be regular i must return to your shoes what i was in their second division to particularize was the silk which they are covered with i dare not be positive at this distance whether it is christian or eastindian but i will tell you immediately when i have examined it a little nearer  ned was risen from his chair and had levelled his eye at her foot when she made her advantage of the lucky opportunity which this pause of his afforded her and recovering her lost ground renewed her charge with a vigor that was fatal to her opponent   bravely shot cried she laughing but i am not so easily to be scared i assure you twill be time enough to listen to such wise harangues as yours after i have talked myself weary a most polite entertainment indeed you are designing us with your greasy generation of scowerers and woolcombers the assembly will be better pleased with the intricate prettinesses which are to be learnt in the art of lacemaking oh the dexterous disposition of the cushion and the pattern and the pins and the bobbins  she set us all to work but had no sooner entangled us among her threads and her bobbins when she flew on a sudden out of that subject to another and from that to a third she led us up so far back that we were present at her mothers labor and after having been merry at her christening she took us along with her to her nurses on bansted downs from thence to her fathers country house beyond canterbury after this we lived with her four years at a boarding school in hackney and returning thence with pleasure had the honor of her company to the very first play that ever she saw in her life nay she permitted us to take part with her even in the masquerade and at the opera but the worst of it was that before we were well seated we were drawn away in her aunts old coach and carried down the lord knows whither to make butter and cheese in warwickshire yet in this place to do her justice she kept us to our no small emolument for we grew as good housewives as her aunt was we all learnt to brew and fatten hogs and feed poultry but what i found most relishable were certain savoury instructions she was so good as to communicate insomuch that i who but yesterday morning could almost as easily have made a horse as a pudding am to day a man of learning as well in dishes as their garnitures i can read if i please when i meet with a person of good taste a long luxurious lecture on farces bisks and forced meats marinades puptoons and olios soops sauces ragousts puffs pastry and pickles tarts cheesecakes and custards jellies conserves and marmalades slops washes pomatums cold creams and cordial waters  but what was still more obliging not content to have enriched us with this profound knowledge she was liberal enough to talk on with such unceasing rapidity that we had no time to thank her till at length she saw ned volatile was preparing to take his turn and rose and fluttered her fan and scudded out of the assembly but we heard her tongue running all the way down stairs asking questions of the servants and answering them herself and for any think that i know she may be talking to this time while i am penning the narration  i am myself too a great talker only i sometimes love to listen and nothing is so strange to me as that since these pratlers are thus transported but by too much vivacity that very vivacity should not teach em to know when they grow troublesome i sometimes fancy them like horses which shutting their eyes in their swiftness pass the bounds of their course and never stop till they are beat backward by some wall which they run their heads against  the plain dealer no    neque cuiquam statim tam clarum ingenium est ut possit emergere nisi illi materia occasio fautor etiam commendatorque contingat

to frame an idea of any prospect so shocking and frightful to human nature as that which represents a mother who can look with indifference not to say with aversion upon the child of her body i was resolving the other day to form a plain dealer out of these two different characters  methinks i would not miss ranging the deformities of one parent near the beauties of the other because this manner of illustration by opposites in writing like shade and light in painting will make the moral appear with vigor and strike upon the eye of the understanding a more forcible effect  could i execute this design according to my wish could i make the draught just and give it the lively touches and warm colors it deserves it might perhaps be a valuable present and instructive family piece for the married part of my readers and some of their posterity might for ought i know have good reason to thank me for it  i was according to custom opening my mind upon this intended subject to the worthy major steadfast and telling him that i should be agreeably lost in pleasure while i was tracing in a good father the secret springs of a thousand little beautiful actions which would pass unnoticed by common eyes that are too incurious and indelicate on such nice and elegant occasions   here i paused a while with intent to name some particular observations i have made of these critical workings of a spirit truly parentile when this constant friend of mankind changed my inclination to speak into the greater pleasure of attending to what he began to say in this manner  there is no fear of your losing yourself in that delightful part of the contemplation but when you come to consider the unnatural mother i dont know how difficult a task it may be even for all your philosophy to account for it you will find yourself extremely perplexed if you descend to make enquiry what monstrous turn in the whole course of the blood what prodigies overruling the whole rational and animal system can eraze from a mothers heart all those fond records of tenderness which the hand of nature must have engraven there in behalf of the being which received its first principle of vitality so near it and its immediate preservation from it  you may remember that at your setting out i told you the expression which hit my taste the best of any in your first paper was that you would look upon yourself as every bodys father and i would rather see you acting like a father than describing one which said he giving into my hand a paper you may do by publishing those verses which according to my opinion want nothing more than their being known in order to their being applauded  the author is a young gentleman who though severe accidents and the rigor of fortune have thrown him into the condition of an orphan is still likely to prove a favorite son of the muses but a genius though never so promising will not readily make its way into esteem without the aid of a recommender or the encouragement of a patron  here i read over the verses and signified my approbation in very few words because i perceived the generous temper of the major inclined him to speak further in behalf of unfortunate desert when resuming the discourse he proceeded in this manner  you may guess by this little performance that those talents which were not happy enough to procure their possessor a competency from parents who lived in affluence may if cultivated and improved entitle him to the adoption of some great personage who observing a noble impartiality with regard to strangers and acquaintance may assist merit wheresoever he finds it it would really be pity that a person who has demonstrated that he has a capacity to entertain the world should not meet with a patron in it to give him a taste of its enjoyments whoever may be meant by horatius if he makes as handsome a figure in his reception of the poet as he does in the poets description he will be to him instead of a mecoenas and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you put the meritorious in a way to meet reward and administer an opportunity the most grateful that can be to a person truly great an opportunity of doing a graceful action  here a gentleman interrupted us and left me no room to make reply by word of mouth but the best answer i could since make him was to repeat in this manner what he said and to publish the following lines instead of the essay i intended  to a young gentleman a painter occasioned by seeing his picture of the celebrated clio by mr savage forgive an artless an officious friend weak when i judge but willing to commend fallen as i am by no kind fortune raised depressed obscured unpitied and unpraisd yet when these wellknown features i peruse some warmth awakes some embers of a muse ye

ether glow stain summer clouds or gild the watery bow she smiles she speaks  she blushes while we gaze i hear your colors and i feel their blaze more at each kindling touch your canvass glows till the full form instinct with spirit grows let the dull artist puzzling rules explore dwell on the lines and creep the features over you eye the soul the source of likeness find and through the meaning muscles strike the mind nor can one view such boundless power confine all nature opens to an art like thine now rural scenes in simple grandeur rise vales hills lawns lakes and vineyards feast our

scantiness in some mens souls that gives a distasteful air to their very favors and their praises what the mien is to the body the temper is to the mind and for want of this observation on occasions where it had been most useful some have lost their friends good will by an arrogant manner of obliging them and others praised men into a contempt both for their persons and their civilities  there must be visible in those who would say or do things engagingly a certain sweetness in the eye and a sense of pleasure in the deportment a compliment is an affront when accompanied with a sullen brow or a negligent an absent or supercilious behavior i appeal to my readers whether they do not always find themselves uneasy in the company of a person who seems more pleased with himself than with those he is conversing with  i was drawn into this reflection by reading the other day a little copy of verses which is printed with some poetical pieces of mr popes and was written by a person of very great quality and whose wit too was of the first mangnitude  on mr pope and his poems with age decayed with courts and business tired caring for nothing but what ease required too dully serious for the muses sport and from the critics safe arrived in port i little thought of launching forth again amidst adventurous rovers of the pen and after so much undeserved success thus hazarding at last to make it less encomiums suit not this censorious time it self a subject for satiric rhyme ignorance honored wit and worth defamed folly triumphant and even homer blamed but to this genius joined with so much art such various learning mixed in every part poets are bound a loud applause to pay apollo bids it and they must obey and yet so wonderful sublime a thing as the great iliad scarce should make me sing except i justly could at once commend a good companion and as firm a friend one moral or a mere wellnaturd deed does all desert in sciences exceed it is great delight to laugh at some mens ways but a much greater to give merit praise the good nature of mr pope must be as extensive as his wit if his esteem for this noble author was not lessened by so ignoble a start of his poetry it is a grudging haughty conscious reluctant and penurious encomium under pretense of praise to a friend it indulges spleen to his enemies it carries throughout a closer eye upon his own merit than upon his to whom he addresses it in four and twenty verses the four odd ones i think have some faint inclination to show respect to another but the twenty i am sure with a much stronger bent point directly upon himself  would this great man have applauded such a poet as he ought he should have forgotten or seemed to forget both himself and his rank in that reverence so justly due to an excellence which will do honor to our nation he should not have imagined himself over bountiful in his condescension the praise of mr pope will be a theme for wit and learning when all the dukes his patrons shall be lost in the dust that covers them the accidental advantages of birth wealth and title are so far from bestowing worth where they find it not originally that they serve but to make the want of it more obvious and contemptible whereas a genius like this gentlemans surmounts all the shadowy superiorities of fortune adorns dignity itself and makes obscurity illustrious  the great cardinal richelieu in a circumstance of like nature acted in so different a manner that i am always charmed afresh when i read over a letter which he sent to balzac a french writer whose merit was as inferior to mr popes as the grandeur of the prime minister was superior to the noblemans let a judgment be drawn from an impartial comparison  a letter from cardinal richelieu to monsieur de balzac paris february the  th      sir though i have often and openly declared what i think of your writings yet cannot i satisfy my self without sending you by this letter a more authentic approbation i never had any particular affection for your person and since therefore it is the prerogative of truth that compels me to my opinion i will take care that the esteem i profess for your works shall be no barren compliment for my praise shall be seconded by the applause of a whole people  or if notwithstanding my endeavors some low spirits shall be found who may affect to think otherwise time will make them but too sensible that the faults they impute to you are defects in their own judgment they are like people in the jaundice who see every thing of that distempered color which themselves are afflicted by  in the days of our ancestors persons of narrow understanding were implicit admirers of what was above their comprehension but now by a kind of elasticity in modern reason judgment extends or contracts itself to sit close upon our capacity and we approve but just as far as we are able to understand blasting every thing by our censure that we cannot reach by our practice yet i hope i do not presume too much when i say concerning your works that i see things as they are and declare em what i see them your conceptions are strong and the flight of your imagination outsoars every thing but your reason your language is pure and your expression strongly elegant  i will conclude with this caution that you will be guilty in the eye of god if you suffer such a pen to rest or if you employ it too idly you ought to apply yourself henceforward to grave and important subjects and i am content that you shall impute to me all the blame if when you do so you receive not the returns which will be due to you already i am meditating an opportunity to be known for  your affectionate humble servant the cardinal of richelieu   i am transported while i read this letter at the flaming intermixture of this statesmans lovely qualities what a glow of humanity what a consciousness of that care which is the duty of the great to draw up merit out of obscurity what a knowledge of a states true interest from the force of such examples what a genteel magnanimity what a spirited race of sweetness does there shine in this short letter  it is pleasant enough to remark that both the french encomium and the english had effects the very reverse of what was intended by their authors yet at the same time strictly consonant with justice and their different merits while the english applauder addresses to mr pope the praise he means to himself his verses are never read without lessening his own character whereas the generous french cardinal meaning nothing in his letter but the encouragement of monsieur balzac draws that honor on his own name which he would bestow upon anothers and becomes himself the readers idol while he is pointing him where to worship  it was impossible for monsieur balzac after being thus nobly distinguished not to strain his genius to the utmost to keep possession of a glory he must so justly have been proud of whereas neglect on the other hand has discouraged a thousand spirits which might have been capable had they been fortunate or supported by those who were so to shine out as living lights and illustrate the age they were born in through a long course of futurity camoens whom the portuguese call the virgil of their country has touched this subject very happily in the  th book of his lusiad  how sweet is praise and justly purchased glory

thirty years and claims the tucking me up as a privilege annexed to her office left open my windowcurtains last night which so early let in the beams of the sun upon me that i was waked from a dream which i could have wished to enjoy much longer  fancy had removed all my distance from youth and given me back those gentle flames which warm and brighten life in its morning i saw an adorable object which my soul methought had once been passionately fond of and of whose perfections i imagined myself to have been virtuously enamored but i had lost her as i fancied in death oh the pain of that imagination was terrible even in sleep i saw this lovely person adorned with all her sweetness i heard the music of her accents informing me she was my patty now grown kinder and more sensible i even felt her leaning over me and found the animating influence of her soulenchanting pressures with what ecstasy of fondness did i survey her lovely languor her eyes were meltingly relaxed and their beams serenely tempered with angelick softness and compassion her very soul seemed to shine upon me through the smile of every feature oh how beautiful is a chaste passion how sweetly does it remain upon the mind and appeal from death to the memory i never knew till this dear dream convinced me what i lost by not loving while my body as well as my soul could have done justice to the passion  while i was thus tenderly employed i wish some artist could have snatched my picture old as i am i flatter myself that love would have lent it luster i would have all my friends who are not resolve immediately to commence lovers the insipids who have never loved may be said to live as the greedy drink they swallow life without tasting it  but all transported as i was with this charming dream it was ravished from me by the sun yet did i not complain it had tuned my soul to harmony and transformed me from an old philosopher into a young and happy wanton i started from my bed and flew with vigor to the glass to which i have long accustomed myself to creep without transport old and wormeaten as it is in every part of its broad frame yet did it not alarm me i even saw my own face in it without the least mortification nay i took notice that my nightcap was not so white as it ought to have been which in more unpolite hours i should have thought not worth remarking but love adorns and improves us my bosom swelled with sighs and my eyes shone with pleasure i brushed up my mousecolour gloves and was wishing they had been yellow ones i powdered my short hair and combed it down to look longer nay i almost arrived at the foppery of spoiling my new beaver by inflicting the modern pinch on it at length i remembered that my youth was but a dream and my patty a coquet my arms at this thought folded sadly upon my breast i sunk into my easy chair and was some minutes quite lost there before i could recover myself how dreadful is the descent from airy pleasure to substantial misery it is not to be described in prose and since love both deserves good poetry and can inspire it let me see what my muse will say to it  oh lovely object whose dear form i keep in busy daylight and in silent sleep revisit fancy  to my sighs attend thou imagd shadow of my souls soft friend when i recall thy beauties to my mind how dead are all things thou have left behind study pride friendship languish for thy sake oh why did love from thy sweet tomb awake why move his pointed arrows in my breast in lifes descent and the cool vale of rest oh charm not thus my soul which is designed to flow down time and strengthen humankind well my readers should think as i do that all things are for the best i lost my dream and they find a poet the witlings will say a dreaming one but melancholy has its charms and i am sweetly sad in the remembrance of it  while i was indulging this mournful tenderness i heard a gentle rap at my door as if it feared to alarm me and the outside of it seemed to be swept by the rustling of silk a music i am not used to i opened it slowly for i was still lost to myself and was addressed by a lady in a modest but most enchanting manner she appeared to be near thirty and was dressed very gravely a little removed from the present mode but my heart sprung within me for all the beauties of my vision were more than verified in this reality the soul of a god seemed to stream through her eyes and the ideas of her wit and majestic understanding flamed and sparkled in her meaning softness there was something in her air that made the room seem to blaze round her i led her to my great chair but she gracefully declined it and seated herself at some distance not to show the respect she had to my age i hope but my writings after a preface of the sweetest praise that vanity could wish to hear she took a paper from her bosom and seemed to tremble while she gave it me as if it enclosed some declaration that her heart was concerned in how becoming is humility when such excellence condescends to wear it  she withdrew and from her manner i opened her paper with impatience and found in it what follows  good sir i wait on you with my own letter from the respectful desire i have to see the person of him whose soul i so much admire in the plain dealer i knew very well that the reverence you must inspire would prevent my speaking freely and i chose therefore to write what i wished to inform you of  i was the other day in an assembly of what the world calls fine ladies to which gay part of our species i have lately been a stranger so that i found their dress and their conversation entirely foreign to me though through all disguises i could discover the british beauty  the confusion of their fans and the loudness of their laughter alarmed and oppressed my ear as the new situation of their elbows drew my eye under astonishment one of the ladies who i fear for her own sake is what they call a toast was most lamentably delighted with a young gentleman who sat next her and who by the oddness of his dress surpised me more than the ladies did  his wig instead of gracefully adorning his shoulders was tucked up into a bag of the same content with his head and had two wings shooting from it so that he looked like a mercury reversed the little hair that escaped this bag because no hat was allowed to shield it was cemented by oil and powder to secure it against tempest the sleeve of his coat had removed the middle of his arm from the place i should have looked for it in and preferred the bend of his elbow to within three inches of his shoulder his stockings were so high embroidered that they left no shape to his leg and his hands to his fingers ends were entombed in a pair of ruffles he was buttoned up to the chin in a white dimmity waistcoat and wore a frock which i suppose he borrowed from one of his grooms to emulate the jockey air with the more elegance and propriety  as odd a creature as this was he seemed to consider me as an odder for i overheard him whisper his fair neighbor that by my ill dress and my neglect of the company i must be either a wit or a tory it was plain he said from my behavior that i was unlearned in the new world and he fancied for his part that i dropped out of the eclipse last monday  the favorite lady obliged him with a tender look and burst into a loud laughter i found that all his discourse was filled with arrogance and folly and a monster bred of both which they call double entendres at last he humd half a tune danced a step or two to his own music took snuff and leave together and hopt out of the company  the ladies were now at leisure to look a little at me but their hearts seemed strangely full of this ridiculous object whom they immediately fell a praising with a kind of miserable emulation mr flushcheek said the toast is sure the most delightful creature the finest and bestbred gentleman how witty how tender how polite and how severe he is he is the soul of sense and gallantry and the very life of the masquerade i started at their admiration and felt my heart sink into pity for em while i contemplated in silence the perfection of my adorable bellario  oh mr plain dealer that i had proper language to convey him to your imagination you would then approve my passion and i should be justified even to your reason his person is divinely formed tall and graceful his eyes which are full of wisdom wear a gentleness as if they grieved their own luster and were willing to decline themselves in pity to the beholders his lips are rarely opened but to praise or to improve though he has teeth which he might be proud of showing there is in the turn of his arms an inexpressible air of majesty i never look on him without seeing all the great men i have read of i tremble before him with a kind of religious passion for religion and virtue are adorned by his conversation so that i may say without falsehood that it is heaven to hear him his dress is disengaged and he knows all things but that he is charming oh that you were acquainted with his mind which is shining with every virtue amidst the throng of his beauties i forgot to tell you that he is a poet a most divine one believe me it is no fiction place him therefore before mr flushcheeks eyes and convert his fair admirers for they take in the plain dealer  i am with great respect sir your most humble servant cleora   the plain dealer no    qui fit moecenas ut nemo quam sibi sortem seu ratio dederit seu fors objecerit illa contentus vivat laudat diversa sequentes hor caetera de genere

votis ut praebeat aurem ibid friday may         i fell asleep the other night after meditating in my bed on our general dissatisfaction at the fortune that is alloted us and had again an extraordinary dream but very different from my last and so strongly distinct and entertaining that i flatter myself my readers will be glad to share its impression while it is new upon my memory  i was placed i knew not how on the top of a green hill which was very flowery and fragrant the world methought lay under it in a vast descent of cloudiness a thousand roads led up to it but with such intricate and mazy windings that my eye was unable to trace any of them distinctly yet they all opened at last upon the summit of the hill and poured out a mixed multitude of both sexes and of all ages and conditions who as soon as they had reached the flat hastened forward toward its center  i was wonderfully pleased to discover patty amble in the crowd and giving her my hand led her on with great composure she informed me that the place we were upon was the mount of fortune and that she was going to a fair which is held on it and called mendall market her business she said was to change her condition for a better and she doubted not but i might do the same if i pleased since i had found my way up the hill for all people who came thither were allowed the happy privilege to lay down their own burdens and take up lighter in the room of them  in the very middle of the plain we came at length to a kind of may pole which was bigger than the monument and as high as the pike of teneriff it was of a bright yellow or goldcolour but twinkled strangely at a distance and looked dazzling and transparent there hung off from it all about lovely garlands of precious stones with a mixture of the sweetest flowers the hues of which were changeable and varied every moment with a most bewitching delightfulness upon the pinnacle of this pyramid sat the goddess of the place very busily spinning but the thread she twisted off was too fine to be seen distinctly by us who stood so far below it the wheel in its motion made a musical sound but so rough and so loud that it shook the hill all round it it scattered while she turned it a sparkling shower of globules that were manycolourd but hollow and broke like empty bubbles in their descending over the multitude  what i observed with most concern was that the nearer we came the prospect grew less charming for the dust was so thick that our eyes and mouths were filled with it and our heads akd with the bustle and the noise of the tumult the commodities which were to be bartered for lay spread every where in heaps and all who passed between were invited to come and cheapen them  sweetmeats limonades and variety of the finest fruits were offered diligently up and down by little cupids with painted baskets and trumpeters jugglers ropedancers merryandrews and operamongers were exerting themselves on all sides to complete the uproar of the market but though i passed by all their stages i saw no more than two whose faces were well known to me and those were heidegger and doctor faustus  in the front of every pile rose an alabaster pillar whereon hung a picture filled with figures all in motion representing whatever was most tempting and desirable in the merchandise it recommended and at the foot of each pillar was placed an ebony chair on both sides of which stood young and beautiful women dressed like muses and graces some inviting passengers to take possession of the empty seat and others pointing up to a compartment on the top of it where was to be read in golden letters the name and quality of the merchandise  we made up to a heap that was remarkably higher than the rest and read there the word royalty we were agreeably surpised to see moving in the picture that hung upon this pillar armies palaces and navies crowds of men upon their knees and women still more prostrate  banquets treasures sports and triumphs all succeeding in their turns drew a mighty crowd of gazers who were struggling for the chair and pushed each other from it patty amble was very earnest to have had me put in for it but i winked upon her to be quiet and presently we saw a person breaking strongly through the crowd who with loud huzzas and concurrence placed him there and bowed round him  but no sooner was he seated when the tempting figures in the picture changed immediately into horrible ones  cares dangers hatred restlessness and a thousand sooty furies rolled unquietly about him the muses and graces were transformed into serpents and satyrs that hissed grinnd and pointed at him and when he would have gladly escaped and sprung out of the chair he found himself held down in it by a troop of meagre phantoms that frighted us away from any further observation of him  the next place that we stopped at was the column of beauty we looked up to the picture and saw moving in it a mixed and confused bustle of coaches footmen and coronets men with their hearts in their hands and an indistinct cavalcade of shapeless things without heads called smiles sighs vows desires faintings languishments and adorations there came up to this place in great hurry a fat but sprightly young woman with a bundle under her arm which she laid down by way of barter and which we observed as she sorted the goods to be filled with large legs red hair brown skin big breasts and smallpoxmarks in abundance the attendants at the pillar having agreed to the exchange were inviting her into the ebony chair when i who by this time began to suspect their fair appearance turned the picture with my stick and exposed its other side to the shemerchant which was to be part of her bargain and consisted of scandal spleen jealousy anguish perjury and ruin she no sooner saw the faces of this ugly nest of monsters but snatching up her own bundle she ran as fast as her thick legs could carry her tumbling head over heels at every heap in her way and getting up as she best could without staying to look behind her  while we were diverting ourselves at this pleasant flight a person whom nature had designed and limbed for a plowman had been seized with an ambition to be made a minister of state and having thrown down his burden of toil penury and dirtiness before the pillar of power had seated himself triumphantly in the chair at the foot of it but was frighted out of his wits by that time we came up to him for we found him almost smothered under an unmerciful load of slanders terrors axes and halters which he had much ado to crawl out from and was bawling with great earnestness and distortion of muscles to have his own goods restored him  in the next compartment we examined we found written the word titles we saw there a beau with six footmen behind him very earnestly perusing the moving trophies in the picture my coquet felt her heart beat at the sight of so fine a gentleman and whispered her opinion that i need not turn that picture for sure there was no ill to be apprehended there  i did it however and the beau fell into fits at the sudden rushing out of a whirlwind of ignorance conceitedness scorn luxury and diseases  i frighted an honest citizen in much the same manner from the standard of wealth he had taken a fancy for preferment and was wishing extremely to be erected into an alderman  he had counted out for the purchase a lifefull of ease a small parcel of understanding and ditto of conscience but the very minute i turned the picture there flew into his face dullness cuckoldom and clumsiness upon which he took to his heels and left his own bag behind him  at the column of wit i was agreeably entertained among a large circle of gapers who were admiring the wonderful mechanism of the picture that was hung upon that pillar  cities mountains oceans woods skies meadows gardens gods and goddesses giants mermaids cupids dragons mistresses witches enchanted castles fields of air and seas of fire all delightfully intermixed and confounded rose and charmed the observation  but the crowd dispersed immediately on my discovering to their great terror and amazement that there lurked behind all this gaiety a lean society called envy malice poverty dependence and calamity  i walked quite through the fair and wherever i wandered perceived it was in all parts alike they who brought complaints to exchange against goodfortune chose to carry their own back again rather than conclude a new bargain there was something in every heap that they were inclinable enough to purchase  but there was something too that must go with it which they could not bear to be troubled with so they went murmuring away and bestowed their curses in great plenty on the goddess who kept the market which was never the thinner notwithstanding for still new crowds supplied the places of those who returned dissatisfied nor could the warnings they met with from such numbers who had been disappointed prevail with these new comers to believe they should go back again without being the richer from a mart that was stored so plentifully with all that the world calls valuable  among the infinite variety of temptations which glittered every where about me i was in danger but once and that was at the pillar of fame i saw when i turned that picture that the weight of the counterbalance lay chiefly in these four evils  death time detraction and uncertainty yet so strong was my desire to float my name through futurity that i was resolutely determined to take possession of the chair  but having nothing of value about me but my oaken stick and mousecolourd gloves the first of which they refused because of the mischief it had done em in turning up the wrong sides of their pictures and the second because not fine enough to be fashionable in that region i was forced upon an expedient which i am almost afraid to confess for fear of losing for ever the good opinion of my female readers  to say all in a word i was heroically resolved to give up my love for my glory so taking patty amble by the hand i proffered her in barter having no other commodity the attendants who watched the pillar were just ready to take hold of her when she threw her arms about my neck and conjured me by all the ties of honor and of gallantry that i would not leave her a sacrifice to so empty a divinity as the regent of that mountain she begged that i would return with her to the lower but happier world and whatever i should ask of her she would grant me by way of recompense i took her suddenly at her word and asked her heart for a fairing  nay spare me but that one thing said she with a languishing reproachfulness and take any thing else about me  unfortunately overjoyed at this bliss which methought befell me the sudden flow of my spirits under a sense of the promised transport caused so violent an agitation that waking on a sudden i dropped out of her arms and perceived myself in my bed in barbican  the plain dealer no    non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites et vitula tu dignus and hic  vir monday may         i pass some agreeable hours now and then at the house of sir portly rufus an old and wealthy acquaintance who lives a few miles out of town and having got his estate by a long and busy life spent in trading adventurously to most parts of the world is now retired from its hurry and enjoys it with a graceful ease and undesigning hospitality the only inconvenience i have to complain of when i am with him is that the company i meet there is not so delicate as i could wish it but mixed with that ineligance which must be expected and submitted to among men of business whose friendships are formed for the most part not on sympathy of minds but mutual commerce of interests  yet as there is always something to be learnt from the most inconsiderable accidents we can meet with i never returned from dineing or supping with my good friend sir portly but i brought away with me as strong a proof as i could any where have met with that the reason why in mixed companies we seldom find much pleasure is because every person not under some immediate guard of hope fear or reverence keeps only himself in view and directs his discourse and behavior not to the taste of those he should entertain but to the particular bent of his own humor or capacity  one of the most constant guests at sir portlys is tony gingle his sisters son who has a great genius for poetry he makes very good verses and pronounces gracefully enough those he repeats from other writers  so far all is well but the worst of it is that tony has studied nothing but poetry he is quite dark in the useful doctrine of times seasons and places it is the same thing to him when the muse bites whether he quotes tragedy to a man of letters his taylors wife or a stockjobber the chimes of his numbers are for ever ringing in his fancy and all who chance to sit near him must have their share of the melody he has taken it into his head that because he can make a considerable figure as a poet there is nothing considerable but poetry and it is a very pleasant scene to observe tony studying at one of the tables of a full coffeehouse in the midst of the city scanning verses on his fingers conceiving writing and blotting out and humming them over to himself with all the rapture and gesticulation of tone action and passion regardless that he is stard at and remarked all the while by a dozen or two of thriving citizens who shake their heads and pity him as a man that has lost his wits even while he is under the operation of being witty  he has never permitted his brain to grow cool enough to reflect that wit in dull company is the dullest subject in the world and that it is a folly to talk of homer horace or pope among grave fellows within ludgate who when they hear of a great poet will tell you a story of tom brown and feel no difference in the power of tony gingles own works and the humble labors of their bellman  jack juniper the apothecary and tom tiresome the haberdasher living both in the same street ride down together twice a week to take a bottle with my friend sir portly  jack juniper reads us lectures on the new improvements in botany and the rise and progress of inoculation which are accurately answered by mr thomas tiresome with the price of the stocks and the mournful decay of the spittlefields weaving  as soon as this very able apothecary has opened and explained to us the circulation of the blood the punctual haberdasher repays his kindness with the course of exchange if some patient of the one has taken physic for her complexion some lady who is the others customer has with equal advantage to her skin fallen into the wear of his new blushcolour  but in the very height of their elucidations tony gingle never fails to wedge in between em both some six dozen of quotations from a poem called the dispensary though the intelligent mr juniper is continually interrupting him with the true history of every weighty occurrence in apothecarieshall which provoked the muse of the merry doctor while poor tom tiresome when he has yawnd and listened in vain to the full extent of his patience for an opportunity to grow eloquent on the use of colchesterbays falls asleep in his chair and snores at us in revenge to maintain his part in the conversation  honest sir portly would be often at a loss to shape such stubborn obliquities into any direct line of society if he had not always at his elbow the goodnatured mr william weathercock a gentleman farmer in his neighborhood who has a large but empty understanding  the mind of will weathercock is like the sail of a great ship that has room to contain much wind but having none of its own producing is swelled out by turns from all the quarters of the compass will hits every mans taste and is of all peoples opinion he is so desirous to oblige that there is not a point in the circumference but would serve him for a center he is this moment in your sentiment and the next will before your face be of his opinion who contradicts you but if a third affirms you both to have been in the wrong and appeals to will weathercock  will with the bestbred agility in the world shifts immediately to his side too and thinks it as clear as the sun that you were all three in the right of it  this pliable ductility in the reason of will weathercock hitches in and chains together the most repugnant ideas and uniting them into an active body like the hooked atoms of des carts gives em strength fluidity and consequence such a lively effect have the very weaknesses of humanity beyond the force and subtlety of ill nature and selfinterest  tony gingle the last time that i saw this company together was so put to it for an opportunity to repeat some verses he was big with that in order to bring em in with a tolerable appearance of propriety he began to compliment sir portlys lady on the fineness of her shape and skin and inferring from their being praiseworthy that they should lie open to observation took occasion by these lines to enforce his kind opinion that it was necessary for her to go naked  can forms like yours want ornament of dress beauty like truth shines most in nakedness dressing may skreen deformities from view but even adornment does but shadow you most but by what they wear are lovely made you madam lose whenever you seek such aid while others dress their lovers hearts to warm you put off nothing but what veiled a charm the lady blushed and smiled sir portly laughed aloud and begged to hear em over again for my part i was doubly pleased with the turn of the verse and particularity of the fancy tony gingle himself was in raptures which he could not hide at the applause his muse had met with  but tom tiresome had been weighing with the foresight of a prudent citizen the ill consequence of going naked to his good friends the weavers and felt a commendable indignation against the tuneful mr gingle insomuch that in the heat of his resentment he called him madman and balladsinger  pray what do you suppose said he would become of many thousand honest people who live by making petticoats and what belongs to petticoats if all handsome women were to go impudently naked  out upon it methinks i see em and am ashamed of you it is scandalous and indecent and to say nothing of the plot which may lie concealed in it against trade it is the whim of a heathen turk and not fit to be thought of in a christiancountry  tony by this time had fathomed the depth of his antagonist and began to play upon him from his batteries of poetical artillery the war was growing hot and threatened dangerous consequences when will weathercock put in between em and taking part with the wit because he observed him to be a favorite made this charge upon his opposite like a brave and faithful auxiliary  you are certainly in the right most diverting mr gingle  nature never would have covered women with such white and tempting skins if she had not meant em for a public ornament the ladies are natures favorites and can we suppose her to have been less liberal to those favorites than to the beasts which she placed below em  she never sent us a calf but he came into the world with his coat on an ox has no breeches to pull off when he goes to bed weary the lamb is born ready dressed with her freeze coat about her and who ever saw a sow drawing off her shoes and stockings  none sleep softer than the birds do yet they rise in the morning with their featherbeds upon their backs  the most excellent of the virtues are always painted like women but it is like women without clothes on and what does this mean but to insinuate to the sex that all who love virtue should despise hooppetticoats and go naked  there is this manifest absurdity in womens dressing that it involves them in perplexities which make the chief end they dress for much more difficult than it need be for as they order the matter they are to be taken to pieces like watches before a man can come near enough to examine the wonders of their workmanship  fashions differ in all nations and what is a fine dress in one place is a frightful one in another but were women once uncovered all mens judgments would agree about em  in a word since the sun moon and stars

nature dressed the hills and the meadows in their fine embroidered mantles it was she that spangled over all that glorious veil of heaven  who but nature spotted the ermin and gilt the scaly skins of fishes and of serpents  man indeed she sent into the world plain and naked  not that she meant he should remain so  but because she adorned all things else for his reason to choose a dress from what

flowers round the summer house we are sitting in so delightfully sweet and fragrant but to teach us that we should perfume our selves and to what end can we suppose they were made so various in their colors but to give ladies the happy hint of employing dyers and silkweavers  tom tiresome broke in upon him at those two inspiring words with a loud and triumphant hollow and filling instantly two bumpers drank prosperity to trade and health and happiness to mr weathercock  his toasts went round the company and both parties were so well satisfied with the share each had in his decision that neither of them appeared shocked at the manifest contradiction of his reasoning but tony gingle went away the most pleased of the two because sir portly desired him at parting to repeat his verses the

that of a wise and good father with respect to an only son who possesses and deserves his indulgence  that lover of mankind hortensius gave us lately a fine example of the force of this truth but i look back upon it with anguish because i judge of his present pain by the excess of his past pleasure  though hortensius had properly but one son he was in some sense the common father  nothing ever was carried higher than the manliness of his heart except its sweetness and humanity for he was softened by the benevolent overflowings of a pity that touched him at once in the two extremes of sensibility his own joys were damped by other peoples afflictions and his private sorrows cheered by the prosperity of those who hated him  he not only forgave readily the most malicious of his enemies but that he might be sure to do it generously he forgot the very injuries  even his faults were no other than the unsuccessful result of his virtues for acting rather by the measure of his mind than of his power he provoked the disappointed to whom the will is no obliger  his wit could fear no rivals but his courage and his honesty  and every person who shall read this faint character of his excellence has been obliged by the effects of it with regard to the public interest and the ornaments of society  such was hortensius  and such hortensius is if yet he may be said to be after the death of that dear son he lived in and into whose fine mind he had poured out and transfused all the fullness of his virtues with a kind of hope in him and his to have immortalized his very body and to receive from future ages in the honors paid to his descendants the tribute of that praise which his own declining life is now too scanty to make room for  he who knows the fathers prospect and how suddenly death has blasted it having snatched away the son when just blooming into manhood and already the companion and the friend of his father never looked on without joy  never obliged without gratitude  never thought on without tenderness  never hearkened to without wonder must be touched with a lively sense of what that fate brought with it which tore from such a parent who before had lost the mother such a son to leave him joyless with the future world before him like a bleak and barren desert  and the past more dreadful still by a thousand goading tendernesses which cling for ever to the memory and torment and sting reflection  what is life when we consider it under the accidents it is liable to but an unresting conflict in the dark with labors doubts and disappointments  one such loss as hortensius has sustained in this loved son and so felt too as hortensius feels it serves for ever to imbitter hope and draws gloom enough over the mind to put a stop to our wild pursuits of riches power and reputation  when i compare the present calamity of this gentleman with the satisfaction he is fallen from  with that ripening expectation  that observing vigilance that unspeakable succession of little transports and tender triumphs  and all that train of noble weaknesses which warm and open the human heart upon these dear and soft occasions i confess to you that i am lost in too quick a sense of his misery  and i tremble while i learn from it that we are exposed to it most dangerously on that strongest and unguarded quarter whence we look for our sincerest happiness  i met hortensius some time since and letting down my glass by accident just as his chair was passing me my soul was wounded through my eyes at the moving majesty of his sorrow  he endeavored to have skreend it behind the greatness of his spirit and put me in mind when i was gone by him of this fine and natural stroke in shakespeare  she never told her pain but let concealment like a worm in the bud prey on her damask cheek  seemed all unmoved and sat  like patience on a monument smiling at grief   if a man who had embarked himself for some long voyage with his friends and his whole family should have the miserable deliverance to escape alone from a shipwreck and be thrown ashore upon some barren island whence he could discern no object round him but the swelling of the sea while it was covering the sinking heads of all who were near or dear to him and to preserve whose cherished lives he would himself have died with pleasure  could such a dreadful distinction be considered as a blessing to him  or should we not rather pity him as the person of the whole number whose lot was least supportable and to which a thousand deaths were preferable  yet methinks mr plaindealer though to lose a worthy son must be acknowledged a trying misery it is a fate severer still to be the father of an unworthy one   and live to feel how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child shakespeare in king lear  show me a good man whose paternal care has been rewarded with contempt from the ungrateful object of his tenderness  who sees his name disgraced by the sordid qualities of an heir from whose expected excellence he had promised himself an increase to its reputation  who lives convinced that he is hated avoided and wished dead by a wretch whom he has given life to and from whose virtues he had flattered himself that his old age would find a comfort and his memory retain a glory  such a father shall look with a kind of envy on hortensius and be the only person capable of weighing his distress without agony  the impartiality of time and reason placing in the same degree of fame those who polished and instructed nations with those who governed or conquered them hortensius need not blush to see his name ranked with princes  i will therefore instance an example of a vaster misery than his own in the greatest monarch of our age why did i not say of any age i mean the czar of russia  a prince whose actions will draw after him a blaze of glory and astonishment through the latest depth of time and warm the hearts of posterity with the same generous reverence for the name of this immortal emperor which we now feel at mention of alexander the great or the first and noblest of the caesars  there can be very few of your readers who have not heard the czar accused of one of the most shocking kinds of cruelty with regard to the death of his son the late prince royal  but most of em i believe are ignorant that this great and generous sovereign was so free from the guilt of that illgrounded imputation that he pardoned his condemned son in person in the most tender and moveing manner after he had been sentenced to death not by the czar himself but by a convention of the senate and states of russia ecclesiastical  civil  and military  for having to use the very words of the sentence formed a design to get the crown even in the lifetime of his father opposing and undermining all his glorious improvements and soliciting insurrections of rebels at home and the assistance of a foreign army to accomplish the destruction of them  i could produce the most authentic and undeniable evidences that throughout the whole course of this great and private affliction the czar discovered more of the vastness the humanity and the firmness of his soul than in all the public torrent of his dangers and his victories  and i think i may challenge the most partial admirers of antiquity to produce any thing so humane so heroic so godlike as this letter even from their greatest and most honored characters  it was writ and delivered by the czars own hand to the prince royal his son on the   th day of october in the year       extract of a letter from the czar of russia to his son the prince alexei my son you cannot be ignorant since it is known to all the world to what degree our people groaned under the swedish oppression we saw by the loss of our maritime provinces that we were cut off from all commerce with the rest of the world you know too what it cost us in the beginning of this war to qualify ourselves to give a check to so implacable a violence but god led us by the hand till we were worthy in our turn to make that enemy tremble before whom others had long trembled  we owe this next to god to our own unwearied toil and the affection of our best children our faithful russian subjects  but if while i am viewing this prosperity of my native country i turn an eye to my own posterity my heart is oppressed with grief that is too heavy for my glory  i see you my son rejecting all the means of becoming able to protect or govern what i leave you  you will not so much as hear of warlike study though by that only we broke out of the obscurity we were involved in and made ourselves noticd among nations  i do not exhort you to make war without reason  i but press you to learn the art of it i could place before your eyes many proofs that this is necessary but i will name the greeks only for they are united in the same faith with us  what but neglect of arms was the occasion of their ruin rest and idleness had weakened them till they could submit even to slavery you mistake if you think it enough for a prince to have good generals men look up to the head they examine his inclinations that they may conform themselves to his genius  my brother in his reign loved magnificence in dress and horses the nation  before not at all inclined that way formed their taste upon their princes for they imitate us as well in our good qualities as our evil  you hate war  you neglect it  you will consequently never learn it  how then can you command others  how judge of the rewards which should encourage the deserving or the punishments which must be held out to the eyes of the unworthy  you will see and hear for ever with the eyes and ears of others and resemble a young bird that holds out its bill to its feeder  i am a man my son and i must die  to whom shall i leave the accomplishment of my labors to whom shall i commit the protection of my people  to one who like the slothful servant conceals the talent he should employ  and falls back from the glorious trust which god has distinguished him by  remember your long obstinacy  and become generously ashamed of this perverseness in your nature  how often have i reproached you nay sometimes you have compelled my affection even to punish you  for some years past i have scarce spoke to you  yet all this availed nothing  it was losing my time  it was striking the air  all your pleasure consists in indolence things of which you ought to be ashamed because they make you contemptible compose your dearest delight  nor do you concern yourself for the consequences it may produce to your country  after having weighed in my secret breast the fatal tendency of your proceedings  after having reflected how long in vain i have endeavored to redeem you i have thought fit by my own handwriting to give you the last result of my will  with this determination however  to wait still some time longer before i put it in execution to expect or hope your amendment  if not you are hereby to know that i will deprive you of the succession as a man would cut off a gangrened member  do not fancy that because i have no other child but you i only write this to terrify you by gods pleasure i will most certainly do it for since i spare not my own life for the welfare of my people why should i regard your honor who are not framed for becoming it  i will rather transmit my dominions to a stranger who shall be worthy of them than to my own unworthy son who can neither defend nor adorn them  signed in the original with the czars own hand peter    i will close my paper here and revere the soul of this great prince in silence for to say any thing in praise or explanation of such a letter were to treat my readers like insensibles  if there lives any one person who can consider it without love and veneration for its writer his apprehension must be so grossly covered with a cloud of dullness and stupidity that he is destined to remain impenetrable by honor justice or humanity  the plain dealer no     natio comoeda est  ridiculum acri hor monday june        the coquette and ned volatile have been indulged in their propensities to talk and enjoyed their humor and pleasantry nay they have been permitted to break in upon one another sometimes with unexpected vollies of raillery which might perhaps have been carried to unwarrantable lengths and attended with ill consequences if they had not been overawed by the presence of us of a more sedate turn and sometimes seasonably parted by the interposition of the major and timely relieved from one another in those brisk onsets  if an account of the little infirmities of this pair of scufflers has had its proper tendency toward the cure of any noted impertinents of either sex who have a flux in their tongues i shall not think that i have as yet offended the gravity of my character or lost any time in penning down such levities the knowledge of which rightly conveyed produces consequences of so much importance to the quiet and repose of the more serious part of the human species thus far i can say from what has fallen within my own observation that several gay parts which i have discovered of the conversation between ned and the coquette have excited an unusual vein of merriment among many of my young readers but though i must confess i had a secret pleasure in finding them pleased i should have been delighted in a more exquisite degree if my writings taking a better effect had stirred up in some of them whom it would have become a little more selfreflection and less laughter they who only laugh at the follies of others give me the worst half of their applause i shall never be completely pleased till i can teach them to laugh at themselves they think me a pleasant and facetious old fellow but i would be at the same time a useful and a profitable companion  i lately saw the most penetrating pair of eyes that ever shone upon paper very busily employed upon that plaindealer wherein i described the last tongueskirmish between the two talkatives of our assembly she read it to herself and ever now and then laughed out heartily i could guess by observing her eye what passages tickled her the most and found em to be those which threw the forward humor of the two combatants into the strongest pitch of ridicule i was in hopes that if any of that female infirmity which she so heartily laughed at in others fell to her share she would ever after carefully avoid appearing in the same light in which she had seen her neighbor make so ungraceful a figure and whom she confessed by such sensible signs to be a proper object of ridicule but to my very great wonder she no sooner laid the paper out of her hands but she incontinently exercised those lips with ten times more velocity in talking than they seemed to have in the course of their reading her tongue outgallopd the coquettes and i am persuaded if ned volatile had been to start with her upon equal terms she would fairly have distanced him he would have lost sight of her in the first flight up got i no room being given to take leave and marched off as fast as my oakenstick would help me and have been mightily discouraged to see the little effects of my performances  i warrant this gossip told the next company she fell into that she read my paper and the moment after in utter contempt of the moral palpably contained in it bolted away into numberless fooleries and as many impertinences as before but can this pert fairone be properly said to have read the plaindealer no she saw it but did not read it at this rate i must be obliged to turn lecturer upon my own works and where there are any genteel hints substitute rougher and coarser in their room that they may not be too delicate and escape observation it is the sign of a wellmannerd writer just to touch upon the verge of a severe truth and leave the rest to a readers private meditation but if this method proves ineffectual it is next to impossible to preserve the character of a plaindealer without saying something that may penetrate more violently i shall therefore for the future without scruple declare that any eyes let them appear never so beautiful which at once look over and overlook these papers are in a manner as bad as blind and that the only grace in beautiful lips which are almost always in motion and scarce ever to the purpose consists in the propriety of their color which shows as if they blushed with a sense of their own impertinence  the gentlemen run over my papers as well as the ladies without reading them they conceive a jest on some particular person then laugh and become more a jest themselves yet will not consider till they are told in plain terms that each of them is that particular person  the odd spark whom my correspondent fair cleora very properly likend to a mercury reversed is the same odd spark he was and what is worse has since that time brought over hundreds of proselytes to the same silly fashion so that one would be apt to imagine there is nothing more wanting to make a dress very popular but showing it first to be very ridiculous there seems to be a general emulation among the fashionmongers which of them can be the most whimsical as the only sure way to be the most taking and successful  these mercuries consist mostly of your smat dapper blades though some very tall men have condescended to come into the fashion which makes them appear to have no heads at all or as if half the head lay hid in the bag behind it  it is an extraordinary entertainment to see the whole mall crowded with this kind of puppets and yet more so when examining these childish figures you read in their faces that they generally consist of persons from five and twenty to upwards of forty years of age some fops of fiftyodd make the first decays of age remarkable in them by this dress which would be otherwise unnoticed a jolly old friend of mine was taking an airing with me in the park the other day what must be in these peoples minds said he that in order to look gay appear hoary like the pictures of old winter when every thing looks flourishing about them the very breezes blow to refresh them and sweep away the load of dust which would swelter them if they had not ingeniously prevented it by a cement of orangebutter  can any of these sparks pretend to read my papers who without looking into their minds continue to cultivate the outside of their heads after such a prodigious and preposterous rate as to the powderers of fifty i must tell them that even i who am in my grand climacterick and have gone through the snow of so many winters am not half so much powdered as they and that therefore it cannot look decent in them  if we survey from the head downwards every part of their dress there is not one but what is preposterous  if a man for example was to take a review of the officers and soldiers provided they had sleeves of the modern cut he would take them for an army of invalids the company of tailors seem to have forgot themselves and want the assistance of the barbersurgeons to instruct them in the rules of anatomy without which the elbows of men are visibly out of joint and can never be set cleverly  the young fellows have dropped down the flaps of their coats very near as low as the clocks of their stockings so that scarce any thing of the leg is to be seen but ancle and they seem to be pulling them still lower and lower that they may be more and more like petticoats which the women are gratefully tucking up shorter and shorter that there will be a decent necessity for converting them into breeches  but i observe that the ladies go openbreasted in winter though the dappers button up to the chin in summer and have garnished the folds of their coats with supernumerary buttons the use of which i cannot possibly learn though i have applied to those who are very deeply read i would propose buttons and buttonholes down the seam of the back that they may be buttoned up to the poll as they are to the chin which will be of great use when they are lazy for they may be unbuttoned as ladies are unlacd behind by a servant  if these alterations should be carried on a little further my friend gunters predictions concerning the mutation of sexes must be allowed to be punctually verified  what i most fear is lest our merchants and others whose affairs have kept them many years beyond sea should be surprised at their return to find us dressed after the present mode hear our officers sing italian our beaus compliment one another in high dutch our old women talk politics in french and not believe us to be the same generation of people they left behind them in this island  the plain dealer no    sed tamen amoto quaeramus seria ludo hor in facinus jurasse putes ovid o pulchra ista pars quae actiones vitamque been format ac diriget  tacit friday june        it has been remarked in the course of these papers that among the wise there are none more foolish than the witty may it not with great truth be said that among the merely witty none are more ridiculed than the wise if a clergyman offers to speak the witlings foretell dullness  but the case is quite otherwise with persons of a serious cast of thought who know that as truth is the only mean by which divines can surely instruct so their style must be peculiarly clear which without stopping at brightness pursues solidity i am therefore fully satisfied that that grave class of my readers whom i count doing me an honor when i see them clap on their spectacles to read my works as if they thought they could meet with improvement from them after their own long experience of the world will be pleased with the following discourse which the clergyman made the other day upon that virtue called plaindealing  when we consider that every body said he is continually recommending the subject of your papers in common conversation one would think there was little need for a writer to employ his time upon it but when we reflect how few practice it no subject requires more pains to enforce it people praise it every day and violate it every hour and common honesty like common sense is boldly pretended to by every body but really possessed by few  it must be worth a little of our meditation to inform ourselves how this quality comes to be so valuable among us and yet we so frequently and so easily part with it in short by what mystery in our conduct such numbers of men would appear to be what they are not  we see upon the first moments reflection that plaindealing is the soul of friendship it is the necessary essence of it and when that is once gone the most warm and lively intimacies can no longer subsist they grow cold and dye at once now friendships we all know are the very bonds of society again we as clearly comprehend that what we call a good understanding among public bodies of men which cannot be maintained but by fairdealings is the prop and support of every civilized government since we are so soon and so perfectly convinced that plaindealing carries along with it such advantages it is no wonder that we should desire to be reckoned the possessors of so valuable a good it is natural for us to desire it it is in this sense scarce a virtue for morally speaking it is what we cannot help desiring every mortal breathing has felt the first principles of honesty very strong in his heart and even he that departed from it knows his struggle was very great it is the quality he covets to find in every one with whom he converses and he secretly adores the man in whom he happens to meet it  on the other hand if plaindealing had not all these attractive charms yet there is something so ridiculous and unpopular in playing the double upon mankind there is such a baseness in the doing of it such an impossibility of doing it often without being discovered such an irretrievable ignominy such a quick and painful remorse that a life of dissimulation is full enough of horror to fright men from it if a life of honesty had not charms to tempt and invite us  sure then it is a riddle that we are not like the people we love but the people we hate the meanest slave cannot bear to be called a dissembler and yet the greatest princes do not blush to dissemble qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare is grown their political motto statesmen originally meant the same as faithful servants of a state they are now adays called politicians and politican is little more than a new name for deceiver even religious persons have entered into a conspiracy against plaindealing dissemblers in holy orders have caused in verbo sacerdoti to signify a falsehood and nolo episcopare to stand for desiring earnestly what a man pretends to decline  upon the whole it is nothing but folly and cowardice that seduces men first out of the plain road of honor and virtue into the byways of doubledealing and when once cunning took the place of wisdom in mens minds and fear instead of resolution governed their hearts they at length brought doubledealing which was at first a crime by accident through a long and constant habit to be no less than an art and profession  such a duty as plaindealing cannot be too much known and nothing is learnt more easily but then in a corrupt age nothing is so easily lost in a depraved and impious company nothing is so readily parted from  the clergy have a right to diffuse among the people this spirit of honesty by precept and a more particular duty incumbent upon them to enforce it by example but too many among them have such a taste for worldly interest as to have lost the relish of primitive religion and while they profess themselves priests appear ashamed to be thought christians  as there is nothing nobler than a good priest so there is nothing so shocking and ridiculous as to see a base man of that profession which annexes reverend to his name a layman that does not reverence a good pastor is a profligate but a wicked man in holy orders is a monster the ancients when they drew the pictures of beauty and ugliness took pieces from several objects the better to complete their design in order to excite true horror against wicked prelates i shall use the same liberty and draw from the wickedest i have heard of a kind of ecclesiastical caligula and suppose him to be a bishop to give him the fullness of his deformity i shall then give the sketch of a virtuous ecclesiastic but must remark for the honor of priesthood that the ill character is compounded of a great many doubledealers and that the good one did really belong to one good man  umbra was always a great pretender to virtue and piety but never possessor of common honesty he made godliness his gain and never espoused the interests of virtue but with the view of pushing his own umbra canted inordinately but never once prayed heartily in order to ingratiate himself with great families he applied himself to learn a false kind of oratory and grew a famed panegyrist and composer of funeral sermons in which he would salve up the vices of great men in favor of deathbed repentance and demonstrate very elaborately how the virtue of a moment could atone the impiety of an age if he dined at a noblemans table he said a scanty grace to a full meal and would just dip down his head to the great author who multiplies food for the use and benefit of his creatures but before he seated himself would make a profound reverence to the debauchee that entertained him when he grew by these means acquainted with great men he turned politician and raised himself up on the blind side of one by setting him at variance with another he next became a state preacher and changed his note as the times changed so that there were many sermons of his direct contradictions to each other he sold the gospel by retale and lived long in grandeur by debasing christianity he has sometimes taken delight in abusing the very priesthood and triumphed in a bishopric when he deserved to be excommunicated thus vested unhappily with prelatical authority he would ruin his honest inferiors and if they sought justice terrify them by his privilege this doubledealer with a mitre on his head lived prevaricating for many years and then died as he lived leaving such falsehoods under his hand on his deathbed as if the measure of his days had been too short for his prevarication  there was such a person lately living as cordatus who had an honorable post in the church he belonged to a great cathedral and was really a person of quality joining the gentleman with the christian he was both religious and polite he had this peculiar felicity in his temper that though he lived in an age of faction he judged many of a different opinion from himself to be honest and wellmeaning men and by treating them as such won them over to his opinion he never used his authority but to quiet animosities to make or renew friendships and to establish peace good will and union he was learned and wise and though he had an impediment in his speech he preached clearly to the understanding he never chose that oratory which tends more to nourish pride in the speaker than to instill virtue into the hearer he knew it his duty to instruct the ignorant and therefore studied perspicuity in all that he delivered from the pulpit he made virtue the study of one part of his life and the other was taken up with the labor of communicating what he had learnt for the use and instruction of others he never concealed any thing that might make other men better save one and that was his charity all knew he recommended what he acted and finding the preacher in earnest the hearers were so too nothing among his parishioners was delivered over to shame but impiety he lived thus for many years a general blessing and his death was a common calamity the poor lost a benefactor the rich a valuable friend and every individual man of his acquaintance an exemplary companion  i must before i conclude advise all clergymen not to fix any parts in the description of umbra upon any particular persons they may not think well of because that will be showing they have some of his spirit let them rather study to live like cordatus that they may die with his character what signifies finding out who is meant by umbra or who is cordatus the profitable search will be to examine what parts they have acted like umbra and amend them and in what they have personated cordatus and improve them if they do otherwise they will imitate the dog in the fable and by catching at the shadow lose the substance of my dissertation  the plain dealer no    helleborum frustra cum

till now in my good friend mr jyngle and which he held it seems like the flint that never sparkles till it is struck upon  old favorite how little did i think when you professed yourself a plain dealer that you would so soon become a tatler pray dont mistake this for a compliment i am not in so obliging a humor i assure you i find men must be cautious when they keep communicative company for there are a kind of talkative old gentlemen who never know when to have done with their acquaintance but will carry a man about with em for half an age after his funeral however to go at once into my matter  i have a very particular regard for sir portly rufus nor do his commands want their due weight with me but as a certain poet somewhere expresses himself all duties must to selfdefence give way for injured honor cannot brook delay   let the ladies therefore wait for their swanskin breeches my muse may perhaps be at leisure against winter and none but a hasty prude or two can want em this warm weather so i shall have time to stand justified against your false accusation that i study nothing but poetry tom tiresome a heavy blockhead can talk of nothing but the stocks but mr juniper is a man of learning let him speak of me from his own knowledge or i might appeal to will weathercock against whom i often maintain arguments whether there is any truth in your accusation but as another poet says upon some occasion or other in some place that i have forgot in vain are toothless satires writ against him who feels himself a wit   i shall scorn to owe my vindication to any hand but my own and hope to convince you before i end this letter that i have more in me than poetry  pray who taught you in the first place to be witty upon your friends before you could spell their names right all the men of erudition who have been numerous among the jyngles wrote themselves with an j consonant a soft and shapely letter which you have barbarously demolished and built up in the place of it a broadbackd gothic g a rough and choking guttural that is scarce fit for any thing but to gargle a germans throat with every graduate duce take this g every student in orthography knows the manifest difference between jyngle and gingle what though jilt sounds like gentlewoman and jackanapes like gingerbread if our language is a doubledealer and for want of settled usage and a limited acceptance gives encouragement to idle people to run divisions on the alphabet that is nothing to me all i mean by it is to convince you that i understand something besides poetry  this however en passant only for i am master of better sciences such as are new even in theory but not to triumph too much over the mistake of a friend since it is a very common error to think too meanly of the merit we are familiar with i will open upon this occasion but one vein of my skill and let it flow to your shame till it shall be stopped by your conviction  i am you must know then a kind of immaterial anatomist i can dissect an imagination or disembowel a quality i am about to make public profession of my art and having my chariot as good as ready the rest of my apparatus will be comparatively of no consequence i shall drive fast into practice but the chief scruple i labor under is by what title to distinguish myself i would make use of the word doctor but that the college of physicians who place much learning in privilege would have me ascend by degrees to that dignity which is too phlegmatic a prescription to agree with my temper i am therefore inclinable since very much of my practice will lie among the ladies to call myself a mindmidwife insinuating by that hint that i can see em as safely brought to bed of their affectation and other spiritual conceptions as they can be assisted in their matrimonal pregnancies by the bodily brothers of my profession  the first patient i propose to lay is a pregnant male member of that learned college i was mentioning to be a doctors doctor is to cure in the best light possible and i would emulate the example of that memorable magician zyto who was sent for says a grave historian by the emperor charles the ivth to try his skill against a high german conjurer zyto who was a white wizard and worth a hundred of your faustuss stood in presence of the emperor and with inflexible composure observed the instances of his rivals art who swallowed at last a burning horseshoe and defied our zyto to do it after him but zyto chose rather that he might end the dispute at a morsel to swallow the conjurer himself and expanding his mouth into horrible and inhuman wideness snapt him up like a radish but when he came to his dirty shoes and disdained to swallow farther he ran with him to a horsepond hard by and launched him out into the middle of it to the no small entertainment and satisfaction of the company  the name of my future patient is sir clouterly rumble a professor of the equestrian as well as the medicinal order he carries on his countenance the clearest symptoms of his grievance which is a distemper that some moral doctors have distinguished by the name of vanity it operates with most violence on the head and the heart though it affects the limbs also and sometimes swells the whole frame into the most enormous turgidity it shakes the fingers of this afflicted gentleman with a yearly convulsion of the nerves during which fits it is dangerous to let paper lie in his way for he applies himself with the wildest ecstasy to strike it over at random with odd lines crooked ciphers and characters wholly unintelligible to the pitiful disquieting and perplexity of his brain which becoming heated praeternaturally by such extravagant agitation inflames and nourishes his malady  it was a laudable accomplishment that of calculating distempers by examining the patients water in imitation of this good custom i poured out before me a large quantity of the sick mans prosaic and poetic emissions and upon inspecting the label annexed to one of em which he addresses poor gentleman to an illustrious young prince in germany with as grave and serious an air as if it was really something fit to be looked upon i presently discovered both the distemper and his proper cure for it the tokens as far as i can remember were strongest and most evident upon the following eruption of purulent matter from a complication of scrophulous humors which the greeks call  but the name the patient himself would have it go by is alfred it is in short a most malignant and virulent species of the epic or narrative cacoethes see a part of it  the glory of a people depending on the excellence of their king he who loves his country cannot better promote its happiness than by teaching this king to govern it i know that your highness is well enough taught already but examples being better than precepts especially when presented in the works of celebrated authors men of copious invention and a fruitful imagination it was for that reason sir that i wrote the following poem having had the honor to contribute more to the succession of your illustrious house than ever i boasted of because i did it for the service of religion and the glory of my country no spots in a purple fever were ever thus morbidly significant if there were not in the nature of the symptoms something opposite to contagion i should have judged sir clouterlys distemper to be most putridly pestilential  the poor man in fine is extremely far gone and would certainly have been irrecoverable under any hand but mine  there is but one cure for so exceeding foul a stomach and that must be to ply him with emetics till to speak in a physical phrase i have made him vomit his heart up  i have a pill to purge vanity a specific and a nostrum which will do his business effectually and it shall be the first of my operations as soon as my horses are harnessed  for a man would not become noted you know till he is in a readiness to be sent for i am in prose you see as well as in poetry  your humble servant however tony jyngle   by a very unlucky accident this letter before i received it fell into the hands of tom tiresome who has writ to me about it in very high terms and what the consequence of it may be i know not  mr edward plaindealer sir taking it for granted that you know and every body knows as bad as the world is there is some difference still it is to be hoped between a poet and a haberdasher i would have the conceited mr antony jyngle junior to know that as witty as he thinks himself i am wittier than he by every penny i am worth for sir portly said twas pity that all his money lay in his brains and i say that his brains are addled to go in that manner and write blockhead about one that he has nothing to do with  no  nor shall have nothing to do with for if ever he talks tragedy in my house again i will be bound to say as one of my foolish daughters does that mr jyngle is a pretty gentleman which if i think or ever will think in the humor i am in never more give credit to  your friend to serve you thomas tiresome   while i was at a loss how to account for the cause of this great misfortune the following from will weathercock unriddled the whole mystery  dearest sir honest mr jyngle our good and agreeable friend put into my hands yesterday a copy of that comical letter which he sent you about sir clouterly rumble and i being wonderfully pleased with the fancy must needs be showing it to alderman blunder who dined with us at sir portlys the alderman laughed immoderately and was so taken with it that all dinner time he could talk of nothing but tonys pills to purge vanity but tom tiresome unluckily came down in the afternoon and the first thing the alderman said was oh mr tiresome here is the pleasantest letter  nay you must see it for twill make you laugh till you cackle again  it was in vain to endeavor at diverting him by other subjects the letter was all his cry mr tiresome must see the letter in short he did so and the only remark he made was that he found himself called blockhead in it well you cannot imagine how angry he is about it pray do your best to reconcile em or we shall have sad work at sir portlys shall i give you my opinion which is most in the wrong certainly mr jyngle for why should one man call another names  yet mr tiresome was most to blame because these things are common among friends but be it as it will i thought it absolutely necessary to write you word of it and my own opinion of the difference who am  your most faithful and sincere servant william weathercock   i am afraid i must close in with my friend wills opinion that they are both in the wrong but what shall i do with this unlucky alderman blunder the odd creature has no harm in him but he does more harm than a stockjobber he has a plain and open heart but wants both foresight and reflection he is mischievous not malicious and errs on without ill purpose from a natural clumsiness of mind and healthy coarseness in his understanding he overturns things without feeling em like the elephant of africa that walking gravely in the night among the villages of the negroes does not disturb himself in the least about the houses that stand in his way but keeping straight forwards oversets em says a dutch author without intending it as if they were so many nutshells  when i took him with me the first time to drink tea at patty ambles after she had prattled and trifled him into an ecstasy at her wit and beauty he turned from her in a start of rapture and said to me aloud how could you be so mistaken as to tell me she was not handsome i shall never forget the extraordinary look she obliged me with upon this fine question i glossd it over as well as i could by telling blunder that he misrepresented my words which were not that she was not handsome  but that she was more witty than handsome he had found out by this time that he had done a ridiculous action and looked as like an ass as any reasonable man could have desired him but he repented as most men do when it was too late and to no purpose and i verily believe i am doomed to great afflictions if my passion should continue for that dull start of mr alderman blunders  the plain dealer no     micat inter omnes julium sidus velut inter ignes luna minores gentis humanae pater atque custos orte saturno tibi cura magni caesaris fatis data tu secundo caesare regnes  friday june         sir having observed that my extract of the czar of russias letter to his son which you published in your  0th paper gave a very great surprise to the generality of your readers who had formed upon common rumor an opinion of that princes death extremely different from the truth i now send you as brief an abstract as possible from a relation which was published in high dutch by the minister of a german court not likely to be partial in favor of the czar and who was present and an eyewitness of the facts which he publishes  the czar had long inclined to ally himself with some powerful family of germany by the marriage of his son whom he hoped to reclaim from his indolence by the conversation of a princess of high extraction and a noble education for this prince had by a continual associating himself with the vilest company contracted such corrupt habits as could not fail of producing an aversion to him in all honest minds he was so far sunk in sensuality that no representations no pains could recover him so that the czar being at length by his sons perverse conduct almost brought to an abhorrence of his person began to drop intimations that he would cause him to be shaved for a monk and shut him up in a convent  the princes own favorites were alarmed at the danger and earnestly entreated him to have his welfare at heart and to conceal if he could not suppress his rigorous hatred against foreigners this disposed him to fall in with the czars proposition and he was married as is well known to a princess of the family of brunswick wolfenbuttel and sister to the present empress  but after he had brought her to russia he showed not the least complaisance nor endeavored at all to divert her  on the contrary i observed that on all public occasions he never exchanged a word with her but industriously shunned her company the prince had the apartments of the right wing and the princess those of the left but they saw each other scarce once a week and had not the prince considered the begetting an heir as the support of his own safety he would have made himself entirely invisible to her he even neglected the repair of the house to that degree that the princess lay exposed to the injuries of the air and weather in her own bedchamber  when the czar expostulated with him concerning these proceedings he loaded her with reproaches as if it was she who had accused him whereas that wise princess submitted to her hard fate with the firmest constancy and resignation nor had any other witnesses of her tears but the princess of eastfreisland her companion and the walls of her own apartment she lived four years in this manner and was then seized with an indisposition so dangerous that her recovery was immediately despaired of  when she perceived her end approaching she desired to see the czar who was at the same time indisposed but he caused himself to be carried to her in a machine moved on wheels  the princess took her leave of him in the most moving expressions and recommended her two children to his care and protection embracing them in the most tender manner possible and almost melting away in tears then she sent for her servants who to the number of two hundred persons and upwards lay prostrate in the antichamber imploring heaven to assist their dying mistress in her last agonies  she comforted admonished and gave them her blessing  the physicians would still be pressing her to take some medicines but she threw the glasses from her crying out with great emotion  do not torture me any more  permit me to die in quiet  for i am resolved to live no longer  she expired in fervent prayer and departed an unfortunate life before she was quite one and twenty years old  it was soon after the funeral of this princess that the czar gave that admirable letter which you published in a late paper into the hands of his son and what follows is the unequal answer which he had the mortification to receive from him  the answer of prince alexei of russia to the letter of the czar his father most clement lord and father i have read your majestys paper and have nothing to reply to it but that if your majesty will deprive me of the succession to the crown of russia by reason of my incapacity your will be done i do not think myself fit for the government the rule of so many nations requires a more vigorous man than i am  i will not pretend to the succession for the future of which i take god to witness and swear it upon my soul desiring nothing more than bare maintenance during life  your most humble servant and son alexei   many further attempts the czar made on his sons obstinacy but the consequence of them all and of his pretended resignation was his flight to a foreign protection and a plunging himself into those high crimes which are particularized in his sentence  the czar upon this extraordinary and melancholy occasion convokd a high court of justice consisting of all the chief of the states  he lay for eight days successively many hours on his knees imploring god with tears to inspire him with sentiments becoming his double duty  as a monarch and as a father  the prince was brought into court under guard of four officers and proceeded against in a manner too tedious and circumstantial to be particularized in so short a compass  the court upon the whole having pronounced a formal sentence and condemned the prince to death the violent surprise and terror of his mind and the disorderly conflict and fluctuation of his passions threw him into an apoplectick fit the czar no sooner heard that he was in this danger and that he was desirous to see him but he visited his dying son with the most visible marks of pity and a proof of paternal tenderness  the prince at sight of his father burst out into tears and with hands raised and folded said he had grievously offended the majesty of almighty god and the goodness of the czar  that he had not even a wish to recover from his indisposition being unworthy to live longer he begged his majesty for gods sake only to take from him the curse he had laid on him at moskow to forgive him all his heavy crimes to impart him his blessing and to cause prayers to be put up for his soul  during these moving words the czar and the whole court almost melted away in tears  his majesty returned him a most noble and pathetic answer he represented in a few of the mildest words he could select all his length of offenses and then gave him in the most touching manner possible his forgiveness and his blessing after which they parted with abundance of tears and lamentations on both sides  very late in the night came a messenger to acquaint the czar that the prince was extremely desirous once more to see his father and his majesty had just stepped into his sloop to go over to the fortress when another messenger brought news that the prince was already expired  he was deposited in the new buryingvault of the czarish family and placed next the coffin of his late consort  the czar among the mourners carried a lighted waxtaper in his hand and was observed to be bathed in tears during the procession and in particular at the church service where the priest had chose for the text of his funeral sermon these words of the mournful david  o my son absalom  my son  my son absalom  you see sir how different this great monarchs conduct in so nice and trying a circumstance really was from the clouds which rumor blew upon it to shade and blacken an unequaled character  the roman fierceness has been celebrated in men who not only condemned their sons but stood by and saw em executed in the most severe and shameful manner for the love and safety of their country yet there was a brutal inflexibility and a kind of politic necessity in the actions of those roman fathers but this prodigious modern prince under no influence of fear dependence or obligation chose to set aside his own blood for the future glory of his people only with this fine difference from the roman that what was there done with a stoicism that gave suspicion of insensibility was here adorned with pity and the most manifest strugglings of an amiable weakness that convinced his subjects how dear their prosperity must be to a sovereign who could thus provide for it by a sacrifice against his nature even of his private and domestic comfort  having shown in the foregoing instances the afflicted side of the czars behavior it is but just that i should change the light and surprise you by a view of that unshaken firmness with which he regarded the danger of the conspiracy while the reflection who was the author of it gave him so moving a misery  upon the examination and confessions of that infinite number of confederates who were engaged in the princes projects it appeared that the defection was so wide and so general that many of his nearest and most trusted servants were embarked in it and such also in whose hands lay great part of his wealth and power so that he was congratulated in form by the ambassadors of foreign princes upon his discovery and prevention of so endangering a combination to which he gave this noble answer  dangers always are strong if they are weakly resisted  where a fire meets with straw it soon spreads and burns through it  but if iron lies in its way it falls back and is extinguished   the plain dealer no     uterne ad casus dubios fidet sibi certius hic qui pluribus assuerit mentem corpusque superbum an qui contentus parvo metuensque futuri in pace ut sapiens ap erit idonea bello hor monday june         with the leave of the grammarians i shall venture to put one of their moods a little upon the rack while i affirm in a kind of riddle for the use and pleasure of my reader  that though every body may be happy yet scarce any body can be so  there is no definite point that we can fix at when we would describe what happiness is yet the road to this great journeys end is very short and obvious one would wonder therefore how it comes to be so universally mistaken if it were not easily observed that most men are under an error even as to the very placing it  happiness is seated not in power but in will  though very few can be fortunate yet all men may be satisfied and they who lessen their desires have in one great point the advantage over those who enlarge their prosperity for allowing both to be equally happy yet the first at least are happy with less danger and encumbrance  whoever can be so wise as to content himself with his present lot while he patiently hopes a better will escape the common fate of tasting with disrelish what he finds within his reach from a restless and devouring thirst after what is future and uncertain  life slides from the impatient like the motion of a murmuring brook where the current wastes much faster than if the surface had been smooth and silent  when we are upon the brink of the grave we start  and wonder at our situation and then first begin to look back with shame and sorrow at the too little we have done in life and the too much we have wished in it  oh greatly blessed who can as fate requires by ductile wisdom temper your desires balanced within you look abroad serene and marking both extremes pass clear between oh could your loved example teach your skill and as it moves my wonder mend my will calm would my passions grow my lot might please and my sick soul should think itself to ease but to the future while i strain my eye each present good slips undistinguished by still what i would contends with what i can and my wild wishes leap the bounds of man so complained a friend of mine to a gentleman wiser than himself by as much as his desires were more moderate  it was in a poem which he called his choice but his mind was so discomposed by a tempest of ungoverned wishes that he scarce knew what to choose even when his choice was the subject chosen  if in my power it lies to limit hope and my unchaind desires can fix a scope this were my choice  oh friend pronounce me poor for i have wants which wealth can never cure mean is that soul whom its own good can fill a prosperous world alone could feast my will he is poor at best who others misery sees and wants the wished for power to give it ease he is rich who solesupreme and unconfined can with unbounded influence bless mankind a glory this unreachd but on a throne all were enough  but less than all is none this my first wish  but since twere wild and vain to grasp at glittering clouds with fruitless pain more safely low let my next prospect be and lifes mild evening this fair sunset see far from a lords loathed neighborhood  a state whose little greatness is a pride i hate on some lone wild should my strong house be placed surrounded by a vast and healthy waste steril and coarse the untried soil should be but forced to flourish and subdued by me seas woods meads mountains gardens streams and skies should with a changeful grandeur charm my eyes still where i moved new marks of my past pains should plume the mountain tops and paint the plains greatly obscure and shunning courts or name widely befriended but escaping fame peaceful in studious quiet would i live lie hid for leisure and grow rich to give i am sure i wish no ill to the author of the manuscript from which i took these verses because to say truth he is the most intimate of all my acquaintance  yet i foresee an inexhaustible provision of disappointments in store for a mind that is so unstable as to afflict itself with others sorrows when there are domestic ones more than enough in the happiest mans condition to interweave and make checquerwork of the richest robes of fortune  i remember a pleasant fancy in plutarchs feast of the seven wise men concerning the limits we should set to our desires  if a person says the speaker is a man of wisdom and gravity he wants no rule but his reason to prescribe him a proper measure but if a fool were to ask me the question i would tell him this story  the moon upon a time was very earnest with her mother that she would make her a new petticoat that might sit handsomely about her and be neither too short nor too long for her body  but how is that possible answered the mother with some emotion when thou art always changing shapes and never contented with thy own figure  there is a restless and universal circulation of discontent in all degrees and conditions  the rich man is miscrable because he has no heirs and wishes himself but so blessed as the poor labourer who cries out while he trims his hedges that he could be happy and live comfortably if he had no children to provide for  the citizen sighs with envy at the smell of a new haycock and longs to wind himself out of business that he may enjoy life in the country  the country gentleman finds his time the most heavy of all his cares and dreams for ever of the delights which he could pass it in at london  the great man complains that he is wretched from too much notice and the good man is really so from too little  command is full of cares and dependence pinched with miseries every body repines at some deficiency in his own fortune and has something to wish for from another who is still less satisfied  distant prospects are most pleasing but they seldom fail to deceive us the rough lines and ruggednesses which look smooth a great way off perplex and entangle us when we find ourselves among them  i have often been entertained by an ingenious italian emblem where to satirize the levity of this insatiate disposition boys are painted very busy running about with erected faces to pursue and catch at bubbles which are blown down among them by a monkey with a long pipe and a basin  the boys who are supposed to have grasped some look amazed and disappointed that they are vanished in the catching and the motto underwritten is  he who reaches me loses me  perhaps it might deserve to be remembered as a maxim that nothing ought to afflict us which it is absolutely out of our power to remedy  if it were as easy to regulate our lives by this rule as it is reasonable to approve it much the largest part of our calamities would at once be cut off and effectually prevented for the future  it is certainly an ambition not only just but noble to pursue the honest calls either of fortune or of glory but if we could pursue em with such patience and moderation of desire as not to lose in the interim all relish of our present condition not to place our only happiness in attempting to become more happy but content ourselves with what we are from the prospect of what we hope to be  all the bitterness of adversity would lose its taste in our use of it and prosperity become less envied than peace of mind and tranquillity  but this however possible to nature is impossible to pride and custom  things indifferent in themselves become hateful or amiable from their consequences  the reputation that follows wealth gives the sharpest pain to poverty and a man who is brave enough to provoke danger and death shall want courage to bear contempt though but an imaginary evil  hatemtai says the arabian history was the most bountiful of all mankind and was flattered by a train of followers with continual flights of praise and congratulations of his good fortune  they were asking him one day whether ever he had seen or heard of any man who had so noble a soul as hatemtai  he smiled and returned this answer  i walked out into the fields on a certain time when at a sacrifice of a hundred camels my house was filled by my order with all the poor and the miserable who could be found in the space of many miles round my dwelling  some of the lords in my company discerned at a little distance a man who was very busy in gathering up a bundle of dry thorns to sell at the next village we went to him and asked why he was not among the number of his fellows who were feasting at the house of hatemtai  because answered he a man who can provide himself with bread by his own labor needs not be obliged to hatemtai  this man said he had a nobler soul than hatemtai  i walked lately into the city toward the close of the day and observing a church open went in to evening prayers i sat near a lady whose fine face methought appeared like the seat of a long war between beauty and affliction she saw that i had no prayer book and modestly offered me her own i kept it during the service and took pleasure to charge my memory with the eight following lines which were written in a womans hand on a white leaf at the beginning and were i believe of her own composing  here tracing dutys path redeemed from care i heal my sorrow with the balm of prayer patience that arms the mind for every state has taught me not to feel afflictions weight they who can bravely bear the woes of life steer safe and steady through a sea of strife while they who pine their hope to feed their grief embosom anguish and resist relief this was a fine and useful lesson and not improperly placed but it was pity that she learnt is not soon enough to protect her against those passions which had left their traces too visibly on her eyes her air and her complexion  the world upon the whole may be divided into two classes  the one seldom find what they are always painfully seeking the other find it easily but are never the more contented  among many remarkable proverbs which are proper to the eastern people they have one to our present purpose   there are only two things which can fill the covetous mans eye  discretion  or the earth that his corpse must be covered with  after all that can be said of riches or that is the consequence of their possession  content is the surest comfort  it is luxury that creates poverty and they are rich who desire nothing  the plain dealer no    si quis nunc quaerat quo res haec pertinet illuc dum vitant

call it  one of those people with an illfavored name like the ugly folks in the bible that waited on king ahasuerus  i thought i could have sworn i had been proof against man but alas  he is not man  he is a being more refined and i am wretched without remedy  i have heard some people report things to his prejudice but i dare swear it was all envy  the men to be sure could never endure him because the women were so pleased with him and besides he sings so much finerthan they can  but do you think mr plaindealer that a man that sings finely may not be a good man for all his singing  i would fain know what they mean by laughing when i mention the value i have for him and saying with a waggish look that no lion will eat a lion  however heartily i love him i did not tell em i would eat him  but i suppose they mean something that i fancy is not true no body i am sure would think it who has seen how he makes love in the operas  i know where i can sit by him every day but i dont know what to say to him for i cannot speak one word of italian but only bravo  pray if you know what one should do in this case oblige with your advice  your disconsolate admirer fidelia   perhaps this ladys case is not so bad as she thinks it  let her only find out what it is she would do with him and for what she has to say to him she may take a hint from the following verses  they were written in italian by milton when he was at florence in his youth and fell in love as fidelia has done with a person whose language he understood but little of  they were addressed to his italian mistress  i when in your language i unskilled address the shortpacd efforts of a trammelld muse soft italys fair critics round me press and my mistaking passion thus accuse ii why to our tongues disgrace does thy dumb love strive in rough sound soft meanings to impart he must select his words who speaks to move and points his purpose at the hearers heart iii then laughing they repeat my languid lays   nymphs of thy

customers are so pleased with them that i take it for granted they are worth the money but what i think i have just cause to complain of is that when a gentleman calls for a dish of coffee and the plain dealer if he finds any thing in the paper that he is mightily taken with he makes no scruple of convincing me that he is as taking as the paper  that is to say he puts it up and carries it away with him to divert his club or his mistress  so he has twopence in wit and twopence in liquor yet pays me only for the liquor  as if wit were worth nothing  i am served thus so often that though your papers come out but twice a week i take em in twice a day as my accountbook can make appear by very woeful experience  now what i want you to say to these lightfingerd purchasers is that a man who has

plaindealer that the party i mean may take notice how i think of him  i discharged some random shot among the wildfowl at our last horseraces but the only two i wounded were a buzzard of the foot guards and a canarybird called a templer  the templer was a wit and i speak it with a sigh  a charming one  he was vain conscious cheerful and as false as my own smiles were  my foot officer was serious honest friendly but i thought he was too dull  i received both their addresses but not with equal sensibility the soldier i slighted but the wit became triumphant  now first my heart felt warmth enough to beat with real passion and had just impressed the image of this gay this loved deceiver when news was brought one morning that he had bid farewell to epsom without taking leave of me to follow a flirt of a fortune that was hoydend away to london  but what gave me a double sense as well of my error as my shame was that the evening before this happened my honest lover the soldier

most catonick adherer to the old english simplicity the virtue the bluntness and the liberty which were the ornaments of our ancestors  i have taken some pains to prove that we britons should not only be left free but that we ought to be left rough too  i am not able therefore to resist the indignation that rises in me at the too visible increase in the number of our courtiers  it is natural for our gentry to love to shine in that gay light but why should tradesmen be corrupted by the taste of undue dignity  i cannot walk the streets but i see fresh instances in every corner of the spreading power of preferment the court verge of old reached i think but to charing cross  of late it is ekd out to whitechapel and nortonfolgate nay i have been credibly informed that there are courtiers of great eminence in and about hockley in the hole  i should not be so averse to this increase of the royal retinue if his majestys ease or interest were proportionably enlarged by it  thus it is neither useless nor uncomely for a prince to have his cowhouse but there is another court establishment which little can be said in support of and that is the kings asshouse  his honor of this office holds his residence in the road to hideparkcorner it being decent he says that his dwelling should be near his duty and where he may be under the eye of his fellow statesmen  i was the other day at an odd christning in one of the horns of this huge city where a newly preferred court lady was complaining to her sister gossips how unavoidable it is in divided times for those who are distinguished by court favors to have the disaffected for their enemies  i whispered a grave gentlewoman to know what post that great lady held and was answered with becoming seriousness that she was married to the kings mustardmaker  his majestys oculist in extraordinary lately departing this life i am glad it has been resolved to abolish that high station nothing being more dangerous to the peace of a body politic than to multiply officers without office  yet there are not wanting imprudent people who have hopes of instituting a royal mantuamaker in place of the defunct oculist  now it is quite a different case where commissions are really useful no good subject for example can think much of the kings puddingmaker and a great deal might be said in honor of the kings punchhouse  the royal chimneysweeper is a minister not of rank only but necessity and something like it may be offered in behalf of his majestys butterwoman  but i would be glad to be informed what serious pretense can be urged by any man who makes a conscience of his arguments in defense of the royal ginshop  or who can assert the benefit or indeed the propriety of the kings royal ridinghood woman or his majestys sworn staymaker  to speak with the good old bluntness of a briton these are some of the luxuriant excrescences of monarchy and would in the watchful times of our forefathers have been pared away for the public benefit and i will take it upon me to averr that unless some seasonable restraint be soon put upon this growing evil the courtiers will set up shops in the very heart of the city where if

i am a woman who by the help of a little reading am so far at least more learned than the generality of my sex that a hard word does not fright me but my husband is a person of great goodness and little knowledge he has a small estate in essex and is only what they call a sportsman  we came to town last week where my poor dear drank hard and fell so ill that i was alarmed for him  the lady whose house we lodged at would needs send for doctor fossile who is i find upon enquiry a man of excellent learning but to borrow a phrase of shakespeares it is sicklied over with affectation  when he had felt my husbands pulse and gone through his course of questions he turned from whispering mr juniper who was in waiting at his elbow and said to me with a physical air not the air of a physician  maam  i have ordered mr what is his name here your spouses apothecary to phlebotomize him to morrow morning  to do what to me cried my poor husband starting up in his bed  i will never consent to suffer it  no  i am not i thank god in so desperate a condition as to undergo such a damnable operation as that is  as what is my dear  answered i half smileing  the doctor would only have you blooded  ay  for bleeding replied he i like it well enough  but for that other thing he ordered i will sooner die than submit to it  now good sir  cannot such a useful mass of learning as distinguishes doctor fossile render him capable of discerning and correcting this odd weakness  it exposes him to the ridicule of malicious persons who hating a merit they despair of ever equalling are glad to depreciate his character by making the worst of his particularity  since ars est celare artem the doctor would be thought more learned if he less endeavored to display his learning i know i have made a forced application of my little latin sentence yet it will do well enough too in the sense that i have given it  i am  good mr plain dealer your constant reader and servant laetitia lovelight   the plain

of the rehearsal puts into the mouth of mr bays with regard to the good to be extracted from books by the most indifferent hands a truth that might have been spoken by a person whose air of gravity was not like that of mr bays intended to make him ridiculous  how far was i from thinking mr jyngle the most eligible companion in the world when i met him at sir portlys and yet this very mr jyngle for i will take heed how i anger so touchy a philologist by misspelling his name any more with a broadbackd gothic g as he calls it no sooner became my correspondent but he proved himself a man of more than ordinary parts and one whose talents are new and uncommon i may liken him to some curious engine of great use to me in my writingcapacity and very necessary in the machinery of some inventions which i shall make known in the course of these papers for the benefit of those who have contracted an ill habit of humor and are sickly in their understanding  i express myself with much seriousness when i declare as i here do that i know not one science so advantageous in theory as mr jyngles new system of mind midwifery if this lucky gentleman can but make it answer in practice according to the vast ideas i conceive of its excellence and use he will be as much superior to hippocrates as the soul is to the body now hippocrates as sir clouterly rumble in one of his physical treatises informs us was complimented with divine honors just as his predecessor aesculapius had been erected to the dignity of a demigod from so low a setting out as that of a toothdrawer as mean a conception therefore as i or any of my readers might have too hastily entertained of mr jyngle as a mere repeater of his own rhimes there is now ample room for forming great ideas of his abilities and of the preferment he may come to since he is the inventor and will in all probability be the perfecter of this more noble art of healing and if in the very infancy of his science he makes a thorough cure of his desperate patient sir clouterly i do verily think after that there will not be the least room for any sick minded person whatsoever to despair of success under his regimen  however since a person must be in a painful way indeed before he cries out for the physician i would propound a kind of diet to those who discover symptoms of any approaching spiritual malady which will serve them by way of prevention this method is certainly preferable to the common way of delaying till the disease is actually upon them which is then in danger of not being removed without recourse to violent remedies in sir clouterlys case the prescription of mr jyngle is so very ungentle that fair ladies who find themselves a going into any immoral habit should one would think take early care to stop the progress of it for fear of lying under the necessity of such dreadful emeticks that it seems which the titled patient must be forced to undergo for the cure of vanity only and what person with a title thinks vanity so great an ill will he confesses be attended with such violent workings that it will make him vomit his heart up now who would not avoid this rough handling by taking things in time when they apprehend a disorder to be rising and observing a regular minddiet  i shall proceed to lay down some general rules and short recipes by way of specimen that the ladies especially may encourage a pocket volume which i intend shortly to publish on the subject of mindlabours and deliveries and which i only wish may be dispersed into as many hands as culpepers midwifery for i am sure i may say without boasting it will be a more useful and valuable treatise  persons who have any consideration for the health of their minds are desired to reflect seriously that all excessive passions are distempers of the mind and but forerunners of diseases in the body let them know that nothing conduces more to the restraint of these humors which grow peccant and pernicious the very moment they become inordinate than exercise in the thinking faculty  reading the salutary maxims of wise men with attention digesting them by meditation and imprinting them on the memory by frequent recollection is a minddiet or regimen which will in a short time restore health to a decayed constitution and add incredible vigor to a weak and languishing understanding minds the best armed are not always invulnerable there are constantly some peevish accidents some cross and fretful disappointments in the rugged road of life to throw a cloud over the serenest and discompose the most equal tempers but there is not methinks a quicker or sweeter remedy than to step to the closet and take down a moral draught which will smooth us into the most perfect calm gallus tibullus ovid catullus will afford us lenitives and horace juvenal and persius will furnish us with corrosives so that we may find a cure for every distemper there are not any infirmities pains or sufferings of the mind but what the writings of some of these doctors contain proper specificks for the best of this method of prescribing is that the physic is easy and delightful for what does it consist in but exercising ones wits with some of the best company in the world whom even ladies cannot go to for diversion without finding them at the same time useful or visit for instruction without finding them agreeable dryden congreve etc have made them refined englishmen and our modern beauties have the same advantages in their translations the roman ladies had in the originals  why should it not be the care of professed visiters not to contract ill habits which are always very catching and fill the mind with spots and blemishes a toast that never had the smallpox would be in a pannick at the appearance of a face newly marked and persons who break out with detraction have the smallpox of the mind and are frightful when the marks are upon them  you shall see a young creature torture herself into beauty punish herself to please her lover and skin her face for a complexion and yet though she knows she is a little vixen in her nature she shall not so much as once after she is married to him endeavor to learn how she may avoid the praeternatural palenesses and flushings which anger excites in a beautiful countenance giving the whole form of it such a contrary cast that it is enough to terrify all beholders whenever any of these blooming bustlers begin to bluster the husband may be the physician for when the fiery particles within them betray any of the soft things to an unbecoming fit of rage the sight of a lookingglass at that critical minute of deformity has been prescribed by our forefathers with admirable and neverfailing effect but this is only a transitory cure and does not go to the root of the disease there are passages relating to the effects of anger in a married state that would place their inside as clearly before them a lady whom this practice would not work into gentleness of temper could never be cured of so violent an inflammation but by one of mr jyngles severest operations  is a lady jealous and will she not have sense enough to blush at the follies of jealousy when she is reading them in private and save herself from the inconveniency of looking frightful in public company she stands highly in need of mr jyngle who that could not read away a fit of the spleen in that excellent modern poem the rape of the lock could be otherwise than given over as quite lost unless mr jyngle appeared to carry it off by his new invention those ladies who have wit enough to plead their being of the unfortifyd sex in so artful a manner that if weak women go astray their stars are more in fault than they have likewise wit enough to fortify themselves by proper lectures against the attacks of passion and folly therefore after this seasonable warning mr jyngle is the word and if any wild disorderly pretty creatures will steal away from these precepts and run gadding after their own inventions till they hurt their health and quiet care shall be taken to send mr jyngle with all convenient speed after them and he may drive as fast as he pleases into practice  the

than any other puts our patience to the trial and breaks in upon human nature with a violence not to be resisted all the looks words and actions of those who were dear to us in their lifetimes rise like ghosts to haunt the memory but with this difference from their effects before death had interposed that we now remember with a kind of pleasure the wrongs and slights we may have suffered from them as the only remedy we can have recourse to for some mitigation of our sorrow whereas their virtues their endearments and the good offices they have done us are like tortures to the imagination and the most painful enflamers of our misery  but the tenderness of the lovelier sex maintains a generous superiority over ours in the warmth and softness of their sorrow there is a sweetness in a mothers grief when she drowns her charms in tears that raises beauty into majesty and mixes reverence with our fondness for her it is her soul we are then enamored of and the husband son or father of such a mourner considers with an inward triumph the interest he is proud to hold in a heart so graced by pity and so sincerely sweet and sensible  the force of natural affection has its strongest effect in mothers from the great necessity there is for that long care and patience which are the supports of the human species during the wants and helplessness of infancy and the most unreasonable partialities of fond mothers to their children are not only pardonable but beautiful when we consider what good effects are owing to the influence of this charming weakness  shakespeares tragedy of king john has i hear been lately altered with design to bring it on the stage next winter i doubt not but the alterer has been careful not to rob us of the grief of constance for the loss of her son arthur when in the hands of the king who designs to murder him  being told that she is mad not sorrowful she replies i am not mad oh would to heaven i were if i were mad i should forget my son  i have heard em say that we shall meet and know our friends in heaven if so i yet may see my boy again  but sorrows canker will have eat his bloom till he looks pale and meagre as a ghost and dies so changed that when in heaven we meet i fear i shall not know him   this thought of her sons sorrow and his becoming so altered by it as not to be known if she should meet him in heaven has so natural a mixture in it of the tender and the wild something so exquisitely adapted both to her character and her condition that i have always considered it as one of the liveliest strokes in the tragedy though it is finely supported by what follows  grief fills the place up of my absent son lies in his bed walks with me up and down puts on his pretty looks repeats his words swells out his vacant garments with his form  but memory smarts to miss him how much easier and less lovely would this constance have appeared under the affliction of her sons loss had she regarded him with the cold indifference of a modern mother whom i am glad for her own sake not to find named in the following letter  sir i have the pleasure of a very intimate acquaintance with that unhappy young gentleman whose verses to a painter you printed in one of your plain dealers with a generous remark or two on the merit of the poor gentleman himself and the uncommon cruelty of his mother  perhaps few things could be more surprising than a history of his birth and usage  of two fathers whom he might have claimed and both of them noble he lost the title of the one and a provision from the others pity by the means alone of this mother who as if she had resolved not to leave him a single comfort afterward robbed him of herself too and in direct opposition to the impulse of her natural compassion upon mistaken motives of a false delicacy shut her memory against his wants and cast him out to the severest miseries without allowing herself to contribute even such small aid as might at least have preserved him from anguish and pointed out some path to his future industry  but i forbear to be too particular on any of these heads because i know it would give him pain for whose sake only i remember them for while nature acts so weakly on the humanity of the parent she seems on the sons side to have doubled her usual influence even the most shocking personal repulses and a series of contempt and injuries received at her hands through the whole course of his life have not been able to eraze from his heart the impressions of his filial duty nor which is much more strange of his affection i have known him walk three or four times in a dark evening through the street this mother lives in only for the melancholy pleasure of looking up at her windows in hopes to catch a moments sight of her as she might cross the room by candle light  his good qualities which are very numerous ought the more to be esteemed and cherished because he owes them to himself only and without the advantage of friends fortune or education wants neither knowledge nor politeness to deserve a mothers blessing and adorn rather than disgrace her  i am strongly persuaded from the character which upon all occasions he has taken pleasure to give me of the ladys humanity with regard to the rest of the world that nothing but her having much too long already been a stranger to such a son could make her satisfied to continue so  it is impossible at least that she should not distinguish him by some kind notice some little mark of her returning tenderness if without regard to his merit she knew but his manner of thinking of her which is itself a shining merit and a surprising instance of generosity if considered against those reasons which might excuse a different treatment of her  he writ the following copy of verses and several other on the same subject at a time when i know not which was most to be wondered at  that he should be serene enough for poetry under the extremity of illfortune  or that his subject should be the praise of her to whom he owed a life of misery  hopeless abandoned aimless and oppressed lost to delight and every way distressed cross his cold bed in wild disorder thrown thus sighed alexis friendless and alone  why do i breathe  what joy can being give when she who gave me life forgets i live feels not these wintry blasts  nor heeds my smart but shuts me from the shelter of her heart saw me exposed to want to shame to scorn to ills  which make it misery to be born cast me regardless on the worlds bleak wild and bad me be a wretch while yet a child where can he hope for pity peace or rest who moves no softness in a mothers breast custom law reason all my cause forsake and nature sleeps to keep my woes awake crimes which the cruel scarce believe can be the kind are guilty of to ruin me even she who bore me blasts me with her hate and meant my fortune makes herself my fate yet has this sweet neglecter of my woes the softest tenderest breast that pity knows her eyes shed mercy wheresoeer they shine and her soul melts at every woe  but mine sure then some secret fate for guilt unwilld some sentence praeordaind to be fulfilled plunged me thus deep in sorrows searching flood and washed me from the memory of her blood but oh whatever cause has moved her hate let me but sigh in silence at my fate the god within perhaps may touch her breast and when she pities who can be distressed they who are deprived by death of their dearest friends and relations are left wretched in the want of them but they have this comfort however  that before those deaths they were happier  whereas this gentleman on the contrary is unhappy by his mothers loss while she is living gay and fortunate and only dead to that affection which other mothers chiefly live for  if you mr plaindealer would give us a paper on these heads it might i believe have some effect for the service of a too early sufferer whose merit and the wrongs he has sustained from his parents cruelty entitle him to the hope of finding better parents among strangers to the open reproach and dishonor of a mother who since she has so many fine qualites wants perhaps but to be touched into a sense of her mistake to atone for it by a generous change in her regard for him for the future i am  sir your most humble servant amyntas   i am sorry that in a nation justly famous for goodnature we have so strong an exception as may be taken from this letter but i will forbear with my correspondents leave to address any arguments to the lady since if she is not hardened beyond nature the generous sorrow and the sufferings expressed in her sons sentiments will melt her heart into pity for him and move her more effectually than any thing that can be morally offered to her  i will turn my advice therefore to the service of those sons and daughters who are neglected and made unhappy by the aversion or partiality of the parent they depend on a case too common in most families and which stands in need of all the comfort that can be poured upon their affliction  it is a very melancholy circumstance when this happens as it often does to the finest spirited child of the whole number but it should be ground enough for consolation that such sufferers owe the wrong position they appear in to a weakness in the parents reason a kind of deception in their judgments sight as when we see our shadows in the water our heads seem to hang downwards and our lowest parts are preferred to look unnaturally uppermost  time will certainly bring a remedy to those who bear this trial with temperance for submission disarms the rancour that would gather strength from exercise by an imprudent opposition none whose injuries are received with mildness and returned by acts of affection can be long without discovering and repenting their ingratitude whereas by permitting ourselves to revenge the wrongs we suffer we furnish our oppressors with an appearance of justice and only make them more blind when it is our interest that they should see clearly  impatience under this or any other affliction does but double our mortification how languid would life be to the largest part of the world if expectation did not quicken it hope is the sweetest of all companions  if it leads us not to the road which we are most inclined to travel in its conversation however is so entertaining and agreeable that we can never tire in the journey  when a wicked man is happy he seems unworthy of his happiness but where virtue is unfortunate it looks the larger for the clouds we see it through  there is a courage in adversity that can put fortune out of countenance  men are not despicable by their fate but by their manner of supporting it the lion has more majesty in his chains than when in the forest his fierceness is reduced and softened by the restraint of his condition and what was terrible in him before becomes venerable by his calamity  but we should not only bear our misfortunes with patience we should sustain em too with silence  complaints are weak mens weapons and there was something delicate and finely judged in the conduct of a persian merchant i have read of who finding himself on the brink of ruin by a race of losses that befell him gave strict orders to his son that he should speak of it to nobody for otherwise said he of one misfortune we shall make two  the loss itself which we complain of  and our enemys rejoicing at it  but as the most perfect pleasures in the world are always mixed with afflictions so the sharpest afflictions have their uses and their pleasures  a mans best friend is his enemy since by mortifying his vanity he adorns his nature with humility and teaches him to shun the practice of those ill qualities toward others which he finds so unjust and hateful while he himself is oppressed by them  but while i talk of humility i blush at my own pride who would teach others a science which i am myself but a learner in  my reader in this case must be so good as to compare me to a blind man with a torch in his hand  though i see not my own way i carry light enough along with me to guide the steps of those who follow me  the plain dealer no     pudet haec

weather does not allow me to take the air in the open fields i measure my landladys hall floor so many times for a breathing that i can walk twenty miles without stirring out of my lodgings  i was meditating yesterday morning in one of these reverted perambulations when i heard the sound of a horses feet on the pavement before my door which was followed by a loud rustic whistle and a thumping against the porch with the handleend of a whip  i looked out and was saluted by a country servant of will weathercocks with this simple and hearty address  that master remembered his love to me and had sent him up with a letter i dispatched my friends courier and shall lay before my reader the contents of this intelligence  dearest sir the good company at sir portlys are at a sad loss in your absence mr tiresome and our friend tony will not drink one anothers healths yet but mr juniper has done as strange a cure upon mr jyngle as mr jyngle himself intends to do upon sir clouterly rumble  tony has never been right as he should be since you made him so ashamed of shooting his poetry at random he looked very pale yesterday and complained of a pain in his stomach there was something he said lay like a load at his heart and he had much ado to draw his breath for it  mr juniper felt his pulse and said he hoped there was no danger asking him at the same time if he had made no verses for this week past mr jyngle told him yes  and repeated six hundred lines of a poem he has made a beginning in the verses i must needs say sounded as fine as ever i heard any but what i thought strange was that as soon as he had done repeating mr juniper bid him hem  and go cheerfully about his business for his oppression he said was removed  and it really proved as he said  mr jyngles color returned immediately and he breathes as freely as ever he did  but i fancy for all this he is not quite cured yet his distemper i doubt works inward and unless it has constant vent may blow up into his brain and do more mischief than we are aware of for i observe though he says nothing the suppressed spring of his fancy twitches his eyebrows up and down and moves his lips like a rabbits  he has got an odd whim too  the effect to be sure of his melancholy of untying the knots of peoples periwigs who happen to sit within reach of him he will do the same by the ladies apronstrings and has made an attempt or two at their garters yet is musing all the while without meaning any harm in it  pray send me word by humphry who rides old robin to town on purpose whether you dont think this untying wigs and apronstrings an untowardly symptom in poor mr jyngle  methinks i would not for a great deal that his brain should have any thing in it  pray a word of your advice to dearest sir  your most faithful servant william weathercock   the answer i returned to this apprehensive humanity of will weathercock was that i could determine nothing suddenly in so doubtful a case but i desired him to tell tony the following story the first time he should catch him at a wigknot or an apronstring and from the effects of it i might judge better  an arabian physician of great learning went to visit the caliph who took pleasure in discoursing with him concerning diseases and their remedies the physician was demonstrating the necessity of binding madmen to prevent danger from their extravagance and the caliph who sat involved in the profoundest attention had insensibly applied his fingers to the bottom of the doctors gown which finding a little unstitchd he had ripped it to the very girdle the doctor observing it made a pause in his narration  the caliph then asked him by what tokens they knew when it was time to bind a madman  we bind him answered the physician when he pulls peoples clothes to pieces without the smallest provocation june the  th      sir going last sunday in the afternoon to a church not far from the temple to hear an eminent and learned divine who is remarkable for his good preaching i found the manifest necessity we are under of a plaindealer since most of our wellbred enormities which were suppressed during the reign of your great predecessor venerable spec of immortal memory are crept again into practice  layparishioners for example repeat the absolution with as much loudness and assurance as if they were all in priests orders they barbarously drown too in their responses the vocal zeal of the parish clerk to the disgrace and utter overthrow of that ancient and useful office  the psalms which were sung plainly in the simple worship of our forefathers are now most musically warbled by gay powdered choristers who have their ears refined by opera with such a rapturous italic quavering that every syllable pants and trembles with the sighings of a broken spirit  the reverend doctor declaimed on pride but neither the terror of his reasoning nor the awful gravity of his person could restrain a giddy covey of young female goldfinches from fluttering their fans into a whirlwind that blew grace and edification quite out of the church windows  these indecencies fall more properly under your cognizance than the pulpits therefore at your leisure i hope you will animadvert on their growth and consequence a nod from you will startle them for they fly plaindealing like a pestilence i am  your hearty wellwisher etc j h   mr plaindealer i am one of those lightfingerd purchasers complained against in a letter to you from the keeper of a certain coffeehouse for filling my pocket with wit of another mans paying for the truth is i did it but it was by way of revenge only for before your paper became established i went a dozen times to his house with no other intention than to read over the plaindealer but the answer i always had was  they did not take in the paper at last his customers so often asked for it that he was ashamed to be longer without it and i continue to drink his coffee for the pleasure of reading your paper but in order to be even with him i kept a private account how many twopences i spent in vain while i was disappointed by his avarice and just so many plain dealers i am determined to pocket up that i may bring things to balance after that i will content myself to carry off in my memory what i now bring away in my pocket and this is the true state of mr d bs complaint to you  but since coffeemen must be murmuring i will put you in a way to mortify some of the backward ones of that fraternity who care not how little wit they lay in for their customers because themselves have no relish for it and they love to deal in nothing but what they can come in for a taste of you must know sir that several of them are resolved to wait till winter before they take in the plain dealer as if cold writers were fittest to refresh their summer customers but your disciples are so numerous that if you only give the word that none who have wit or breeding shall drink even a single dram at any coffeehouse that is not licensed by the stamp of the plain dealer then these friends to money and dullness who to save a groat a week lose twelve pennyworth of improvement would take it in for their profit sake though they have no concern for their unstanding and by that means extend your influence to many thousands of his majestys sober subjects who now sit and sleep in the corner of a dusty coffeeroom for want of matter to be kept awake by i am  sir your humble servant vindex   upon opening some late letters which have been sent me by my correspondents i found enclosed in one the following learned proposition for unravelling the occult sciences  proposals for printing a book entitled the mystery of modern gameing being a description of the abuses in games at dice proving by calculated tables that hazard is an unequal game exposing the nature of unfair dies and boxes with the operations of loaded dies scoopd dies flat dies chain dies and linked dies the art of working with a grate box eclipsing sighing waxing and topping  a dissertation on pharo basset picquet wisk and other card games proving that a pack of cards may be shuffled cut dealt away and afterward disposed to your interest notwithstanding with a particular description of a pharobank its attendants and expenses calculated for the meridian of those two famous universities bath and tunbridgewells  the book will be printed on fine paper octavo with a new dutch letter and neatly bound price one guinea half down as usual it is now ready for the press and any subscriber shall if he pleases see the copy to convince him that it deserves encouragement subscriptions are taken in at mr william leverlands at the goldenkey in king street covent garden  i am ignorant with what intention this proposal was enclosed to me there having been no letter sent with it but i take it for granted that it is the wish of the undertaker to have it noticd in the plain dealer and i recommend it with the more readiness because if this work is any way answerable to its title the author will deserve to be considered as a patriot and may by opening the eyes of those who are fond of that vile art called gaming become the means of more good to his country than the care and wisdom of our parliaments have yet been able to accomplish  worthy sir i my own self am a barber by trade but my wife takes in plainwork i could never endure to be idle and therefore when we rented a little house in the newbuildings i hung a board at my poles end with these words writ upon it in great letters shave for a penny though i say it that should not i have a clean stroke with a razor but because i love a stirring trade i thought it better to work for a little than stand still and get nothing now it is a strange thing to consider how little encouragement honest industry meets with  one evening last week a beau with a great blackbag at his back was set down out of a stagecoach and fixing his eye upon my pole put his hand to his beard and came directly to my door as if he meant i should shave him but as soon as he read my rate that was written on my show board he turned short upon his heel and cried out with a silly oath that six pence he thought was too little for a clean shaving but if a man must pay for being flayed a penny was too much in conscience  i was quite out of heart at this unexpected return for falling the price of my practice and my poor wife who overheard it as she sat at work fell a crying at the ill nature of it but presently we heard a jolly voice in the street come let us go in  i will encourage this honest fellow though i have been shaved once to day already so there came into my shop a grave welldressd gentleman and a pretty youth with him he was kind and talked very familiar to me and had so goodhumored a face that i loved dearly to look upon him when i had done with him he said that i had the soft sweep of your turkish barbers and as he was going out of my shop he gave me a crown piece and told me that such industrious men as i ought to be paid as we deserved and not as we expected and that no body else should shave him as long as his beard grew in london  as soon as he was gone my wife fell a crying again  but this time it was for joy that in spite of beaux and blackbags there is some good nature left in the world yet  if you will put this into your plain dealer and accept of a shaving the next time you come our way you may command the ready hand of  your obedient humble servant latherlight edgely   the plain dealer no  0  nec vox hominem sonat o dea certe vir friday july        it is said by a vulgar error that the english are fond of novelty  i have wondered a thousand times how this notion became established for that nothing is more false in fact may be proved from our oldest histories and is every day remarkable in our modern and familiar practice  though ten englishmen in twelve are the descendants of foreigners and the very name itself of england is foreign yet the notion of a foreigner has been always ridiculously distastful to us  innovations were ever odious to us and we chose rather to neglect advantages than to try an untrodden path for em  what lost england the first possession of that gold and silver world in the spanish west indies but her disposition to discredit novelty  our very laws depend on precedent  and the defense even of rights in parliament is supported upon what has been and seems unconcerned in why it was those scandalous oppositions which are so obstinately given to the clearest bills for public benefit such as making our rivers navigable  putting our lands under a register  promoting untried trades  and establishing national fisheries are all convincing instances that no nation under heaven have so fixed an aversion to novelty which yet every body is imputing to us as the reigning humor of our country  but we have a present example that will confirm my remark and for ever put to silence those who accuse us of the love of novelty i mean the new practice of inoculating the smallpox on bodies purposely prepared to receive it so to prevent the usual danger and malignancy of that distemper and sustain it without the terror the fatality and the sorrow which have heretofore gone along with it  it was a generous undertaking in that publickspirited member of the royal society who resolving by clear matter of fact to establish or explode this practice has with an unwearied application and the most steadfast impartiality informed himself of its success throughout all parts of the kingdom and given the world an account of it in his pamphlet lately published a treatise which deserves the eye and most careful consideration of every parent who has reason or who would save a favorite child the promised comfort of his life from being snatched away perhaps in its bloom by the sweep of this distemper  it is demonstrated in the mentioned treatise from a forty years examination of the bills of mortality that the smallpox carries off at least one in every six of all whom it seizes in the natural way whereas not one in fifty scarce one in many hundreds of those who receive it by inoculation have been found to die under it  the whole number of persons who have been so much as suspected to owe their deaths to it ever since its first introduction in england amounts to nine only  they are all named in the printed account and there is scarce one among them for whose death a clearer cause than the inoculation is not assigned and attested by the very physicians and surgeons who directed the operation  so that providence seems to have guided and enlightened art in this practice to assist and relieve nature for the preservation of the human species  yet with what violence and malice has it not been railed at and opposed  how many false affirmations have we seen with unblushing boldness insulting truth in our public newspapers  nay the pulpits too have trembled under the zeal of reverend railers who in the holy blindness of their passion have shown us job upon his dunghill inoculated for the smallpox by the devil of a surgeon  it has been represented as a wilful murder a new and wicked presumption an assault on the prerogative of heaven and a taking gods own work out of his hands to be mended by mans arrogance  but the common arguments however despicable give me diversion and entertainment  when i hear a pious old woman wisely wondering  what this world would come to and concluding her remarks with this great maxim of resignation that gods own time is best i compare this force of female reasoning to the representation which a late writer tells us the old boyars or grandees of russia gravely made to the present czar when he attempted a communication by diging a canal between the volga and the tanais   the design they said was great  but they humbly conceived it impious  for since god had made the rivers to run one way man ought not to turn them another  it is an established rule amongst gamesters that losers should have leave to speak and for this reason i rather pity than grow angry with an unmarried prude or coquet when i catch em railing at inoculation with a thousand excuses for it in their faces  as it is a comfort to the miserable to have companions in their misery so it must be a provocation to these fair invalids to hear of a preservative for others beauty when it is too late to save their own by it  yet these good ladies unmindful that they carry about with them the cause of their own peevishness treat an innocent practice when they join the chorus of railers as the indian did the lookingglass which he found on the seaside  he was frightfully ugly and starting back from his own image threw away the glass in great rage with this comfortable observation  i might have guessed thou were good for nothing thou would not have been left here else  it is the observation of some historian but i forgot where i met with it that england has owed to women the greatest blessings she has been distinguished by  in the case we are now upon this reflection will stand justified  we are indebted to the reason and the courage of a lady for the introduction of this art which gains such strength in its progress that the memory of its illustrious foundress will be rendered sacred by it to future ages  this ornament of her sex and country who ennobles her own nobility by her learning wit and virtues accompanying her consort into turkey observed the benefit of this practice with its frequency even among those obstinate praedestinarians and brought it over for the service and the safety of her native england where she consecrated its first effects on the persons of her own fine children and has already received this glory from it that the influence of her example has reached as high as the blood royal and our noblest and most ancient families in confirmation of her happy judgment add the daily experience of those who are most dear to them  i have seen a short poetical essay on the occasion we are now treating of i would say if i meant the verses an encomium they should be envied for that their subject need not blush at them  on lady mary wortley montagus bringing with her out of turkey the art of inoculating the smallpox when greece reviving into short delight felt pride and comfort at our muses sight the rivaled nine no sooner saw her face but even their envy gave their wonder place charmed into love of what eclipsed their fame they waked apollo with her powerful name see  god of grecian wit urania cries how sweet a muse the western world supplies say should she ask some favor from your throne what could you bid her take that is not her own sparkling in charms the heavenly stranger view so graced  she scarce can owe a beam to you beauty with love her power to yours prefers and wit and learning are already hers roused at her name  receding from her eyes the gazing god rose slow in soft surprise fair miracle he said  and paused a while then thus  sweet glory of your envied isle charmed and obliged lest we ungrateful seem bear hence at least one mark of our esteem one of my three great claims your wish may fit whose voice is music and whose thoughts are wit physic alone remains to grant you here  a skill your godlike pity will endear formed to give wounds which must no ease procure atone your influnce by new arts to cure beautys chief foe a feared and fierce disease bows at my beck and knows its gods decrees breathed in this kiss take power to tame its rage and from its rancour free the rescued age high over each sex in double empire sit protecting beauty and inspiring wit a journey into greece being the subject of these verses parnassus lay a little too directly in the way  i should else have been out of humor that the force of the authors fancy took its turn from the pagan system and does apollo as much honor as the lady who is worth a thousand of him but it is an uncommon misfortune to her genius that the only thing in the world worth knowing and not known to her is her own prodigious excellence  so she is neither able nor willing to describe it herself and no verse but her own can soar high enough for her merit  the sweetest of our english poets has endeavored it with less success than attended any of his other compositions and if a nameless one has missed it after him he has at least this consolation that he miscarries in such company as it is a kind of honor to go astray with  i would not however be mistaken in this censure  the verses i mean abound with wit  they have only an air of wanton levity that looks too merry to be enough in earnest and gives the turn of a smiling satire  praise ought always to be serious when it is addressed to the person praised and where the subject is of weight and dignity  there is i know a pert species of panegyric which has been admired in the examples of balzac voiture and other french writers who when they would praise kings and heroes took em ironically to task and chid em by way of commendation  but to speak like a plain dealer such familiar and smart encomiums imply something like a sense of superior qualities in the overconscious bestowers of em  some of the verses just now hinted at have a little too much of the sportive but nothing of the french arrogance  then bravely fair dame renew the old claim that to your whole sex does belong and let us receive from a second bright eve the knowledge of right and of wrong but if the first eve hard doom did receive when only one apple had she what a punishment new must be found out for you who have tasted and robbed the whole tree this is exquisite and lively wit but it is wit of too brisk a species for the purpose it is applied to  if a barrister should take a fancy to dance in his pleading would the judge admit his skill in excuse of his indecorum  this praise so gayly given would have surpised like a flash of lightning where instead of being the professed subject it had been struck out unexpectedly  as it is it looks like trifling and misrepresents the author as not charmed into reverence of the worth he celebrates it speaks him regardless and but half intent  and is like tripping antickly over a drawing room when it is prepared for the steps of majesty  if ever this remark should fall in the way of that excellent writer and he should not himself think as i do i shall fear i have been mistaken but it is the duty of every man when he assumes the critic to speak frankly his opinion what is an error and what an excellence that his reasons being weighed by the readers impartiality may contribute to produce that judgment which is the sole good end of criticism  but to return to the lady from whose extensive benevolence we received the art we have been speaking of  it is a godlight delight that her reflection must be conscious of when she considers to whom we owe that many thousand british lives will be saved every year to the use and comfort of their country after a general establishment of this practice  a good so lasting and so vast that none of those wide endowments and deep foundations of public charity which have made most noise in the world deserve at all to be compared with it  saadi the persian author of the work called gulistan tells a story of three sages  a greek an indian and a persian who in presence of a king of persia debated on this question  which of all evils was most grievous  the grecian said old age oppressed with poverty  the indian answered pain under impatience  but the persian decided it to be death without good works before it  if the want of good works is all that makes death terrible the great bestower of the mentioned blessing cannot fail to die with cheerfulness  it must be impossible for her to want joy at her last moments but it may be feared she will carry it away with her to the other world  for this will be left in sorrow  the plain dealer no     teque his infaelix exue monstris ovid friday july        good mr plaindealer i am a young widowwoman that was bred and born in wapping and had one of the best of husbands that was master of as good a ship as ever used the guineytrade but he died in his last voyage as he was bringing home a great elephant for a token and i have taken a strange fancy to the beast because he puts me in mind of my poor husband  most of our africancompany have been to see him and they all agree there is more in him than in a whole court of assistants  but for all he looks so big there is no manner of harm in him he is as tame as one of us women and plays twenty clever tricks to make people merry that make much of him  one could not forbear laughing though one lay a dying to see how the goodnatured clumsy beast will dance moll peatly he will so catch up his feet and frisk round in a small compass and thump the floor to keep time and move his backside to the music and in short your other end of the town dancingmasters are no body at all to him  he plays at trapball in a ropewalk by our house and strikes out the ball with his snout and is the comicalest poor creature alive to be sure  a gunner and a man of wars chaplain of my acquaintance are now very busy in teaching him to dance upon the ropes and i must needs say he comes on very towardly only he looked a little silly at first and tumbled off when they cried jump for the king and could not keep steady for the life of him  he cracks nuts with his nose and makes a woeful splutter when he gets loose among the herbwomens applebaskets  all my neighbors love him and tell me that he will bring in a world of money if i would but make a show of him  pray what is your opinion and whereabouts do you think it will be best for me to set up with him in answering this you will do an act of great kindness to  your afflicted humble servant susan softly   honorable sir observing by some of your plaindealers that you are a great admirer of the czar of muscovy i humbly presume to acquaint you that i am lately come out of his country and have brought with me a commodity called a russian bear  he has shared very largely in the improvements of his fellow subjects for he can fiddle as well as any body he sits bolt up on end and holds his kit in one paw with the butt end against his belly and with his fiddlestick in the other paw tunes it away after the italian manner with his head of one side all in raptures at his own harmony  it would do your heart good to look at him when he is splitting a note into graces for he shakes his nose and his paw together with such a variety of melodious quavering that his ear must be confessed as delicate as if he had been a subscriber to the opera  but there is one thing that i take to be a very particular happiness to him he looks when he is grave for all the world like that ingenious swiss gentleman that has so many diverting fancies to get money by making ladies and gentlemen merry together if they were to be dressed both alike i am confident there would be no knowing em asunder may be that may go a great way toward making the poor things fortune  i have him here in town but he is out of business at present so if you could but be so kind as to put him in some way of preferment he shall wait on you where you please and entertain you with a sample lesson which is all that offers at this time from honorable sir  yours to command jonas queer   i tack this extraordinary pair of epistles together because of a manifest resemblance in their contents and for that i am desirous to promote a union between mrs softly and mr queer  their beasts at least if not themselves must be subscribed into a joint stock for the better carrying on of their trade  they may afterward debate at leisure concerning the incorporation of their persons but certain it is that two animal artists of such sagacity as both the african and the russian stranger could never have honored london with their residence at a properer time than this or with a fairer promise for their own benefit  some statesmen who look deep into national consequences and discern at a distance the fate of mightiness and ministry have pretended to foresee the sudden downfall of opera  who knows if such a melancholy revolution should befall the polite world but these two qualified performers may take possession of that deserted theater and under the auspices of so noble and so unanimous a board of directors outdo even the surprising things which have already been heard and seen there  or suppose it were yet a winter before the haymarket will be in a condition to receive them they cannot fail in the mean time to meet with more than reasonable encouragement if they but apply themselves to the managers of either of our theaters in one of which they labor under such a want of good actors that two such accomplished comedians having the advantage too of being foreign ones may certainly make their own terms if they are inclinable to strengthen the youngest company or if fortune against her usual custom most propitious to her old favorites should dispose their choice another way they may be entertained as friends and allies upon the foot of wellpaid subsidies the commanding officers of those veterans entering lately with much vivacity upon new plans of action which fall immediately within the genius of our fourfooted virtuosos  having barely touched this hint for the service of my correspondents who are persons of great parts and industry i come now to say a word or two in my own person to the stages  much of the summer is yet before us and winter being the season of our theatrical campaigning i shall prepare myself against that time to take the field at their first marching and move with one or other of the bodies during the whole course of their operations my readers may then expect to be entertained from my private journal with the good or bad discipline of both armies and the personal conduct of their generals in the exercises evolutions sallies stratagems or engagements they shall at any time be concerned in  let em therefore stand warned and assure themselves that i shall animadvert on their behavior with a frankness they have been little used to and lay em open like a plain dealer  but to enter on another subject i have received several letters from the female part of my care to complain of my odious title so they call it of plain dealer  they had heard of me it seems but did not dream i had any thing in me  they took my business to have been politics  they little thought me the man they find me  instead of humor and wit they looked for bluntness and malice from a surly old fellow that was setting himself up for a cynick  with a great deal more to the same purpose but one arch flirt among the rest is for forcing me to declare myself that people may know what to make of me she is at a loss how to think or what to say of my papers and can neither like nor dislike with any manner of certainty till she hears whether i am a whig or a tory  she adds in a postscript that perhaps i may think indifferently of both and pretend to an impudent neutrality like the old grasier in our civil wars who when he was met on the road by either of the opposite parties and asked for king or for parliament told em  for neither till both were wiser  the hotheads and testimonies of this present generation think it a disgrace to their vivacity not to be as briskly in the wrong as their ancestors and i pity very heartily the condition of the kings poor subject who has sent me the following letter  master plain dealer i wish you would lend me but one lash or two of your plain dealing for some folks in redcoats and others in no coats at all for if things go on as they stand now an honest man will not be able to travel the road pro and con for a set of silly busybodies that must be meddling with us about things that we have other matters to do than to think of for you must know master plaindealer if you please that i drive a peaceable wagon of my own and have done so these thirty years without being molested in my calling till now lately that a pack of strange people have got a whim into their heads to make us englishmen all of one mind  but if ever they bring it about i will be hanged for em  about six a clock in the morning on the nine and twentieth day of may last i and my wagon were met near a woodside by a knot of fifty or sixty roaring fellows stuck all over with oaken boughs and loaded with branches of the same  they stopped me in the road to know whether i loved the memory of king charles the second  i said yes with all my soul  at that word they fell a dancing and set up a loud huzzaing waving their hats and their boughs till my team became frighted and took em all to be bewitched and was within a hairs breadth of running away with my wagon then they handed me a two quart brandybottle and bid me drink a dram to the glorious memory of the restoration and as soon as i had got it down they gave a great shout again stuck my horses and my wagon all over with green boughs said i was a very honest fellow and had a heart of english oak and so we parted with much ceremony and satisfaction on both sides  but before eleven the same day as i was driving into a town where my wagon was to dine there came up in a great rage seven or eight of the troopers that were quartered there and asked me what i bushd out my horses for i told em to drive flies away but they said i was a jacobite rascal  that my horses were guilty of high treason and my wagon ought to be hanged  i answered that it was already drawn and within a yard or two of being quartered but as to being hanged it was a compliment we had no occasion for and therefore desired them to take it back again and keep it in their own hands till they had an opportunity to make use of it  i had no sooner spoke these words but they fell upon me like thunder stripped my cattle in a twinkling and beat me black and blue with my own oaken branches  this went off and i thought no more of it till the tenth day of june came i was then innd in london and from where my wagon lay in holborn i went to soho square to deliver a little parcel that i had brought up for my landlords lady  she ordered that i should have as much strong beer as i could drink and that i should drink a health to her inclinations  she smiled at me and was so kind as to give me out of her own hand a fine nosegay of white roses i was very proud of my nosegay for my ladys sake that had given it me and went along the street smelling to it thinking all the way as i walked how pretty it looks in your gentry to be so free and goodnatured with a poor man as i am when all of a sudden a scarecrow lean man in a fine laced coat snatched it out of my hand and another gentleman in red who was along with him lent me a cut cross the shoulders with a cursed smarting cane and told me  that he would teach such a dirty dog as i was to be smelling to tory roses  if i could have got one of these fine fellows all alone with me in my wagon i should have made him know his driver  but as it was i thought it best to show him a good pair of heels for it  which of us might have run fastest in a fair field of battle i can but give a guess at  upon this occasion it was my luck to be nimblest and outstrip both of em  i dont know for my part what to make of all these doings they are strange times we live in and as i love to be musing when i have nothing else to do methinks very often as i travel along the road from one end of the kingdom to another and find the people of such different notions i fancy my wagon and i are moving upon a draft board old england is turned checquer work and mixed black and white all over so wishing things would mend i rest master plain dealer  your humble servant to command ralph dobbyn   the plain dealer no    verane te facies verus mihi nuncius affers vivo equidem vitamque extrema per omnia duco ne dubita nam vera vides vir omnem creed diem tibi diluxisse supremum grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora  friday july  0      i made a visit the other day to a gentleman who has a country house near london and while we refreshed ourselves with a social glass in a summer bower which he has raised above the corner of his gardenwall i observed him to fix his eyes with much attention on the gate of a stately building that stood on the opposite side of the road  the mistress said he of that fine house has been charming me all this morning in a poem which was written in praise of her extraordinary beauty by a very celebrated english genius  the warm and lively imagination of the poet has placed her exactly before me i feel methinks the influence of her eyes i am enchanted by her air and movement  but i lose my self in rapture while i seem to gaze upon that spring of youth which he describes with so much wantonness that living thinking bloom that quickens her soft languor and adds health and joy to loveliness  but see  look yonder the very charmer comes this this is she this gay young wished adored dear masterpiece of nature whom i have been reading of with so much transport  i started up in great amazement and inflamed by eager curiosity looked out to see this prodigy  but i beheld no other than a thin withered stooping old lady whom two servants with much seeming difficulty supported and were leading along between them toward a coach that waited for her at the gate her head and both her hands shook strongly with the palsy but every other part seemed motionless and quite insensible  i sighed at the appearance of so mortifying an object and recalled my eyes from aching at it to fix em reproachfully upon my friend for his illpointed levity in sporting with the weakness and misery of human nature  yet this said he was once so changed as we now see her that divine that godlike that resistless miracle whom to contemplate in drydens warm description of her influence when the hearts of a gay monarch and a court of rival lovers were the trophies of her beauty who could think that time would thus reduce her to a contradiction of all those flourishing attractions which though perished in the changed original will bloom for ever in the poets picture  i protest the sudden shock which this malicious artfulness of my good friends morality surpised and struck me with quite damped and overwhelmed my cheerfulness  i sickend at this too near and naked view of life without its palliatives  i resolved to drink no more  your wine said i has lost its relish and your society is grown insipid from the tingling thoughts which you have filled me with  so rising for my hat and gloves i took my leave abruptly and walked homeward cross the fields oppressed with musing melancholy  i have not to this moment lost the weight of its oppression and shall never cease to wonder that the young reflect so seldom on the shortness of their spring when yet the old are always near us and the younger coming up behind to push us forward into winter  it was a sharp and startling answer that of the armenian beggar who leaning double on his staff was asked by a young jesting coxcomb how much that bow had cost him for i would be glad said he to buy one  have patience answered the old man and if god prolongs your life you will have as good a one for nothing  there is but one thing here that can deserve our constant thoughts and that is the very thing which we most hate to think of  what ought so frequently to busy our remembrance as the only sure and unavoidable common lot of all who ever lived who now do live or who shall live hereafter  where are now times past  we toil and strive and labor on through life as if to live were our chief business unmindful all the while what empty shadows we are grasping at and for how short a time and how uncertainly they can be ours when we have gained them what is become of all those busy bustlers who have lived and died before us are they not vanished and forgotten they have made their way through life as an eagle does through air and their path is closed up after them nor have they left a track to follow by  time is the greatest of all deceivers but deceives us without flattering us  it has a tongue in every steeple and points its finger to the dials shadow to alarm and give us notice but we neglect its hourly summons we trust its gentle pace against the harshness of its warning yet were we wise we should think time a smooth but precipitate current that carries us down to death whether we are bound thither or no and he will always have the roughest passage who instead of gliding quietly will be struggling to swim against it  life has nothing that is truly desirable but the presence of those we love yet this of all its pleasures is most precarious and unstable  are we charmed by the power of beauty let us learn from such an object as the once blooming lady whom i have been speaking of that it is a false and fluid prospect  it is changed since yesterday and will be further changed tomorrow  all that is ours is mutable we still indeed live on but we are no longer what we have been nor can we continue what we are though the river is still known by its old name its waters today are not the same waters that were yesterday not our blood alone is flowing and in constant motion our faces strength health comforts fears joys miseries and dangers all move and mix us in one gulf eternity  i know nothing so ridiculous as what is called being serious nor is any thing more idle than what we usually term business  we would be fortunate loved feared great every thing but what we should be  for whoever in this life proposes to be completely happy hopes to build like the men of babel and would raise a pile as high as heaven without foundation to erect it on the world is too narrow to allow dimensions for a basis where the wildintended height is so unproportionably extravagant  the mahometans who affect after the ancient manner of the eastern writers to express their moral doctrine in a kind of proverbial chain of parallels say there are six things which a wise man will ground no hopes on  the color of a cloud because imaginary the friendship of the covetous because mercenary the love of women because inconstant beauty because frail praise because airy and the pleasures of this world because deceitful  it is equally to be wondered at since life is so little valuable and death so certain and unavoidable that we should be so unreasonably fond of the one and so fruitlessly afraid of the other there is no harbor on this side death and the nearer we approach to those shining follies which we pursue with such dangerous eagerness the more we multiply our cares and distract and weary our own purposes the whole earth is not broad enough for two proud fools to quarrel in whereas death is the end of contest the weary mans repose the great mans glory the sick mans health the poor mans comfort and a shelter against wrongs and misery  since a traveller can enjoy pleasure by often thinking on his journeys end while he is yet but upon the road toward it why might not death be made familiar to us and disrobed of its false terrors by accustoming ourselves to look out for it to acquaint our selves with it at a distance during our journey through life to it life is properly a journey but differs from our other journeys of less consequence in this surprising particular that we are traveling as fast while we are sleeping and intend no progress as when we are awake and know we are moving  life then being a journey death i think may be considered as an inn at the lands end and since the traveller when he comes thither is still obliged to go farther and must set out for discoveries upon a deep and unknown ocean if he takes not along with him fit provisions for his voyage he must be either a fool or a madman  the difference between the great man and the good man is never so plainly seen as when they both come to die then the one shuts his eyes and steps trembling and in the dark into the dreadfulness of uncertainty while the other smiles with joy upon the enlargement of his opening prospect and comes out of a miry labyrinth into daylight and a boundless champian  i sometimes take pleasure to consider the birth of man as a commitment of his soul to prison where during the life of the body it is chained short and can move but a creeping pace and in limited and dusky stages but it is set free and unfettered by death and at one spring reaches heaven  such discharge is to the soul what light is to the eye when it opens colors and objects which before were concealed in darkness  thus then when it is said we die we are rather born into real being we are infranchisd by the grant of death and incorporated among the millions upon millions who have died before us those we leave are a number very small and inconsiderable in comparison with those we go to the patriarchs the prophets the apostles the heroic conquerors the shining poets of antiquity and the whole assembled congress of longknown and glorious characters who have flourished from the worlds creation are to be the company to whose familiar converse death will introduce us  and that we may add one charming hope to warm and sweeten all the rest there too we shall perhaps embrace and be restored to those lost friends we loved most dearly and whom we never more expected to have met with  but i will now relieve my readers from the severity of these reflections by entertaining them with a copy of verses which i am assured were really written to a lady eminent for her wit and beauty by a gentleman who thought it no disgrace to her loveliness to mix his admiration of it with the memory that she was mortal  to clelia in the country on the pulling down st martins church while from the noisy crowd you lean retired in silent shades by love of thought inspired i vexed by varied cares to business chained mourned your lost converse and in town remained dark as the midnight world your sunshine gone guideless in sullen gloom i wandered on passions wild influence ebbed and flowed my mind as seas drive different with the changing wind but to what point soever my will was bound in vain i turned thunresting compass round doubtful a while the wavering needle hung then trembling backward to your image sprung pensive i viewed a sacred pile of late which falls like man to rise in nobler state the doors thrown wide it seemed unveiled to lie and reverend ruin struck my startled eye entering amidst the busy hammers sound i saw times dusty trophies scattered round each violated pillar stood bedewed and wept in solemn grief a fate so rude from tombs by force disjoined reluctant stones rolled mixed with clouds of dust and human bones from faithless walls defaced inscriptions fled and to long night consigned the nameless dead the pews pale squares in their whole lengthened row gave way and opened a sad scene below beauty youth wealth and power reduced to clay larded with bones yet moist unshelterd lay remnants of eyeless skulls with concave stare mocked the proud looks which living charmers wear coffins rose broke unfaithful to their trust and flesh flew round me in unjointed dust scarce a short span beneath that opening floor where kneeling charmers prayed the week before where forms like yours rejoiced the admiring eye forms once like yours in naked atoms lie o fate of failing life o flattering dream what wintry sunshine is thy shadowy gleam thus while i mused thy soul approached my ear thy softwingd soul that always hovers near see thou it sighed how these sad relics lie and do thou fear that clelia thus can die no she is all mind and her immortal name eluding deaths short reach shall tread on fame tongues yet unthoughtof clelia shall adorn and charm adoring nations yet unborn heroes at whose resolves the world will shake shall treat thy sex with reverence for thy sake and each fair tyrant who would empress be form but one wish   to think and look like thee the plain dealer no    ostendit tibi te  hor monday july         among some extraordinary epistles which have been lately sent me i had the honor to receive the following from the right worshipful mr alderman blunder but not thinking fit to reply to it explicitly i have only taken it ad referendum as our good neighbors the dutch states receive petitions which they find themselves inclinable to answer with the political eloquence of saying nothing  sir i and mr weathercock were at a tavern with ned volatile who may have wit for any thing i know to the contrary but as for money i dare be positive that the first time he saves sixpence will be when he has but a groat in his pocket and yet this extravagant young fellow as i have lately been well informed has the underhand impudence to make love to my daughter  a whim took him while we were merry together that he must set himself forsooth to scribbling  presently it comes into my head that he was writing a loveletter to my daughter and so pretending to mind nothing but talking i leaned back in my chair and overlooked what he was doing  but as if the young rogue had had eyes in his elbows he broke off what he had begun and writ thus in a new place  if an impertinent old fellow that sits by me did not overlook what i am writing i should have told you a pleasant secret  i let him alone as far as this but then being thoroughly provoked at his calling me names i told him roundly that he was a liar and an unmannerly young coxcomb to pretend to write folks word that i overlooked his letter when i had not so much as seen a single word he had been writing  the only answer he gave me was to laugh till he tumbled out of his chair but i would have him to know that this is no laughing matter mr weathercock says he is in the wrong but that he was in the right of it too i dont much like this decision because i cannot tell what to make of it so i resolved to refer it to you and pray tell the pert young jackanapes his own which is the needful  i rest yours to serve you habakkuk blunder ps mr thomas tiresome has something to say which he will write by the same hand     worthy sir my good friend the alderman saying he was to write to you upon extraordinary business makes me lay hold on this opportunity to ask a little of your wise advice what i shall do with the sum of twelve hundred and ninety three pounds sterling which are come back upon my hands by selling out my india stock very seasonably upon this melancholy story that is whispered about so cautiously concerning the great moguls entering into an alliance against prince tockmas and the czar of muscovy  my broker is for south sea dipping because now says he it is low water in those parts and the danger of drowning not half so great as it was formerly but i believe i shall stay till their new house is quite finished and then perhaps i may for any thing i see to the contrary stay still a little longer for the young king of spain seems to have more in his head than ordinary they say he is angry with the irish already because of the bustle they made at cadiz lately and if the next he falls out with should be the english south sea will go near to pinch for it  besides who can tell you know what may happen upon the choice of this new pope he will not let people wear good clothes and some of our public prints say that he is so horribly covetous that he makes the cardinals go baldheaded to save the charge of buying perriwigs pray what can be his meaning in all this but only to ruin the protestant ininterest and make stocks fall to destroy trade in downright spite to old england the poor baysmakers at colchester seem to suffer for it already and the weavers that are up about columpton have much ado to be kept quiet at it  then again what could the french king mean by calling home the marshal de villeroy i make no doubt but there is some mischief in that too  in short while things stand in this ticklish posture a wary man will think twice before he runs into the stocks  indeed if the king of prussia should come over there might be some reason for venturing but as it is i am afraid i must lay out my money in lottery tickets for when all comes to all that is the only absolute certainty  knowing you to be a longheaded man would be glad to have your opinion in a matter of such extraordinary difficulty  your friend thomas tiresome   mr plain dealer i am a good agreeable young woman of a very loyal family and have a most mortal aversion for a

dear spouse is taken sick of a sudden and stands in need to the utmost degree of that experience in mindmidwifery which you gave out bills about in your xxviith paper  pray let doctor jyngle be sent for immediately and beg him to come away whether his chariot is brought home or no  we must have him though he comes in a wheelbarrow  the bearer knows how to bring him and pray let his emetics be such as will work deep and fetch up choler as well as phlegm  rageing jealousy is the distemper and if the bitter and green and yellow that lie as low as my poor fubsys heart is not all brought away by it he had even as good give her a caudle  but unless doctor jyngle has better physic for sick minds than those poetical pills which you prescribe out of the classical dispensatory i shall have little faith in his modus of practicing  i have tried to no purpose an admirable modern doctor who has given us finer recipes of that kind for cure of either the hot or cold fits of jealousy than the whole college of your ancients greeks and romans put together  i love him at my heart and have most of his lectures without book and i am sure he is profoundly skilled in my dear loves distemper by this feeling force with which he speaks of it oh jealousy  all other storms are calms to thee  thou conflagration of the soul   that word conflagration is the very picture of my fubsys symptoms  i had prepared from the salutary works of this learned gentleman a healing linctus that i thought infallible if my afflicted deary could be persuaded but to apply her tongue to it now and then in order to dulcify her picquant palate when the acid particles should rise too vehemently i had got it ready written upon a sheet of her own gilt paper and the last time she was taken i gave it kindly into her hands and desired her to apply it moderately she looked it over with great composure and i began to conceive such hope that i took up an untasted sillabub that had just been set before us and entreated her if the physic was too bitter that she would wash down the taste of it with a sip or two of that emollient sweetner but the spout was no sooner within a foot of her pretty lips when the conflagration abovementioned blazed out at both her eyes and with a frightful flaming face she tore the recipe in a thousand pieces and burnt so strong and so outragiously that fearing i should be scorched as she flew toward me and not being just then provided with one of mr godfreys chemical extinguishers i had no way left to quench the fire but by affusion of my sillabub which very fortunately put her out by the copiousness of its adhesion but i was so frighted at the ebullition that ensued immediately upon it that i ran away as fast as i was able having left her a good deal cooled and in a fair way to be extinguished  i thought it proper to give you this intelligence how far i have failed that doctor jyngle may come prepared with more powerful and searching remedies  let him make but a thorough cure and i will warrant him we do his business there are nineandthirty ladies of quality of my fubsys particular acquaintance who are all down at this very time of the selfsame distemper and all taken too with the conflagration exactly as she herself is he shall never want good patients if his emeticks but go to the bottom  i am in no small impatience  dear pleasant ones thine most expectantly gregory dingle knight   oxford july        mr plaindealer i have a wonderful piece of news for you and desire that you will apprize the world that wit may be worth something when a little good fortune goes along with it  my muse was so long my mistress that i began to grow weary of her and she has been so kind in the very nick as to help me to a wise  i had been in love above three years and never got three good words from the dear tyrant till i went a fishing with her one hot evening in the middle of last month  she delighted much in angling out of an old summer house over a river that makes part of her own royalty  upon these occasions you must know i was always her humble trout and it was my business to bait her hooks and sit and read to her while she watched her fishing rods but that happy evening abovementioned i had upon a hint out of doctor done composed three little stanzas and hiding the paper they were waitten in betwixt the leaves of one of the volumes of drydens miscellanies i read her the title and verses as if they had been part of the printed collection  to a lady who loved angling some by the bending reeds slow aid may boast the unwary fish betrayed others may finny shoals beset and sweep em with the treacherous net but why should sylvia use deceit who is herself her own best bait step but undressed within the brook and smile at every needless hook each willing fish will round thee swim gladder to catch thee than thou him or if one fish uncaught goes by that fish is wiser far than i she was taken with em as i could wish and without dreaming that they were mine cried out to hear em again for nothing sure was ever so pretty but observing me very careful to conceal the inside of the book she snatched it out of my hand and discovering her mistake blushed and cried pish  and looked most charmingly silly  but in short my bait took so well that i have now got her on a hook that she is never like to slip off from till one of us has done with fishing in this world which has at present no happier creature in it than  your most fortunate humble servant peter trout   sir it is said that england within this last century is grown richer and more potent beyond comparison than in the days of our forefathers i verily believe it is so because the increase of rank weeds is a natural indication of strength in the soil that breeds them i was reading the other day that in the reign of king edward the second the number of attorneys was limited and one hundred and forty declared sufficient to serve the whole kingdom  what a surplusage of rapacious claws has this nation then to spare if we were disposed to cut our nails and send the parings to our neighbors  put the case mr plaindealer that yout friend the czar of russia were to borrow thirty or forty thousand of our inns ocourt laborers to help his own clumsy subjects in digging that canal for joining the two great rivers you were mentioning i can but smile to think how happy they would make him  let his rivers be never so distant they will bring em together by the ears and work away every inch of the firm ground between them  you cannot think what an admirable talent they have at your dirty work for wherever they find a hole they never leave it till it is past stopping  so pray use your interest to procure a transportation in that monarchs favor of these rootandbranch pioneers for it is pity so great a prince should want an assistance that we could lend him without doing ourselves the least hurt by it i am  yours as far as is left of me goose featherless   the plain dealer no    notus in fratres animi paterni hor friday july         i never waked in more harmony and composure of mind than i did yesterday morning when rising cheerfully with my spirits more diffused than ordinary i visited my friend the major whose face as often as i see it makes me happier than i was before from his firm and steady temper i learn to break the force of my disappointments by the patience with which i receive them and i am taught by his generosity to feel the weight of no misfortunes but those which oppress my friends whom i love without being able to comfort  when i see this gentleman despising and even adorning himself by his afflictions i am ashamed to have ever murmured or considered my own as burdensome  i found this faithful friend reading one of my printed papers and entertaining his little family with all the cheerfulness of the fortunate  he rose and received me smiling i have been reasoning away some pain said he by the influence of your plain dealer how powerful are your thoughts and how happy am i in your friendship what a force of delight comes with the praise of those we love it is music to the mind and our cares dissolve before it  the generous fullness of his heart was prepared to say much more if i had not interrupted him by proposing a walk into the fields  it was one of those sweet sunless days when though no place was sheltered yet every place would be shady we had wandered without designing it till we found ourselves by chelseacollege the grandeur use and beauty of that building charmed us into a short silence which the major broke agreeably by these apt and just reflections  though charity is last in rank when we name the three great virtues it stands first methinks in dignity for it seems to include the others there may be faith and hope where there is no charity but there can be no charity without both it imploys faith in the easy credit which it allows to affirmed and rational appearances and it applies hope to its own and others benefit by indulging an expectation that all that is amiss will mend and ills produce good consequences the common notion of this virtue centers in a contracted beneficence toward the support of the poor and needy and that too for the most part when the bestower has no longer the power of enjoying what he parts with whereas charity in its noblest sense requires a return of good offices to the very malice that oppresses us for it teaches us not only to act well but also to think generously  it banishes from the human soul all its sordid affections all partiality to our own interests all attachment to our own opinions all jealousies and low suspicions concerning the designs words and actions of those we hear of or converse with it is in short the great refiner and ennobler of the mind it swells the heart with pity friendship justice pardon openness and magnanimity and stifles the inward struglings of selfpreference revenge distrust pride avarice and ignorance  though it is certain answered i that charity at full extent is no less than you describe her yet even in the sense most limited her influence is sweet and amiable how wretched would many thousands be through want of the most common comforts if ostentation did not borrow the white robe of charity to disguise her pride of heart in the appearance of humility and if the miser on the brink of life did not fill his trembling hands with benefits that bless the destitute as effectually as if his will and not his penitence had urged him to bestow them  how many want the pity which even an hospital can give them how many return hungry cold weary disappointed and despairing to their famished and unfriended children what double death would it be to an unhoping wanting husband to see the breast of a loved wife dried up with killing want and a dying infant held in vain to her insensible exhausted bosom  i know you feel not that you can be miserable till you think of the more miserable and i should not therefore haunt so apprehensive a reflection with apparitions of imagined sorrow but how frequent would such lots become if not prevented by the late indeed yet always welcome bounty of those founders even of our common houses of compassion our monuments of deathbed bribery to which for the examples sake this world allows the name of charity  it has been remarked but i hope it was unjustly that the charity of women is much narrower than that of men  if this is true it is an accident which must be owing to some error in their education for nature meant it otherwise and softened their tender minds to fit them for impressions of a mild and pitying quality  in all the sculptures and fine paintings of antiquity we see charity represented as a smiling woman to show it is the sexs virtue and that sweetness grace and bounty should adorn a ladys loveliness  when i see a woman fortunate yet narrowminded and unmerciful i look with scorn upon her beauty and think most upon the dross it covers i grow angry at beholding such a gay and gilded sepulcher and turn my eyes from her shining dust to the more grateful earth which it was taken from  how different replied the major from such a woman as you are describing is the charming belvidera i have seen her lovely features which give new joy to the triumphant languish and look comfortless when she has heard of the unhappy  her voice which wakes the soul and calls it up into the ear with all the music of a trumpet falls and trembles when she talks of wretchedness which she is sensible she cannot remedy the numbers whom she obliges have two rival benefactors which divide and perplex their gratitude for they know not which most merits it her manner or her bounty  to such a sweet excess of tenderness does belvidera raise her charity that she would be old unseen unlovely rather than adorable as she now is because she pains where she must only pity  she is at once the most charming and least conscious of all women  while we were speaking of her we were surprised in the most agreeable manner possible by the sight of her chariot passing us  she bowed very humbly and ordered it to stop and while her servants retired with a politeness and sensibility which i have very seldom remarked in persons of their low condition she received us with an air of sweetness that resembled the idea which we have of a descending angel  she lamented that she was in her chariot because her coach she said might have held us all she would therefore leave it to bless our walk the major offered her his arm at which i felt a kind of foolish envy which i knew not how to reconcile with my growing passion for patty amble  how attractive is beauty when it is softened by the humblest modesty and yet dignified by wit and majesty  she busied and delighted my soul and i was so transported by her voice and sentiments that i fell in love with my own silence because it prolonged the pleasure of her speaking  we were joined in this place very unexpectedly by ned volatile who had inquired for us at the majors and rambled hither in pursuit of us he had never seen belvidera nor so much as knew who she was yet came up with his usual air of brisk assurance and sufficiency  what cried he my old friends engaged in a confederacy against my liberty then he retreated with a kind of counterfeit astonishment and lowering his voice went on thus looking with a genteel levity upon the lady i dont know madam what undeserved good opinion you may have of these grave gentlemen but i shall never be brought to think patiently of em again  twas ungenerous and unpardonable to give a poor wretch no warning but draw him in with an unguarded breast to stand the mark of all these charms where it is impossible but i must fall by some of em  believe me sir replied belvidera with a mixture of disdain and compassion the danger you complain of is too small to excuse your terror  however open your heart may lie few first blows reach thither  if you are wounded at sight the hurt was only in your eyes and the armor you should have been defended by was not a breast plate but a headpiece  i shall never forget with what an air of surprise and awe poor ned volatile started back at the piercing voice of belvidera and from the smiling sharpness of her satire but i love the young rogues virtue and i own my heart triumphed for him under the mortification of this retreat for it sat on him methought more gracefully than all his natural gayety  he kept behind us all the way in a sincere and becoming confusion listening attentively to belvidera without one attempt to rally but i observed him at length draw out his pocketbook with a sigh in which he writ for three or four minutes and then giving it into my hands i found he had been penning down his dying speech with a woeful warning to all christian people to take example by his suffering  let rash young fools for what i now endure learn never to believe their hearts secure once o ye gay a striking hour may come when mirth shall cease to smile and wit grow dumb the light low jest the giddy repartee the cheerful triflings of the vain and free when loves warm hand shall wake the wondering heart will shame the memory and increase the smart oh love  from midnight mirth wit friends and wine take my snatched soul from this soft moment thine i could not resist the temptation i was under to make atonement for neds impertinence by presenting his poetic penitence to the divine belvidera she perused it with a conscious blush and an air of eloquent disorder which has given a reviving hope to the distress of her new lover but it robbed us too soon of her company for she took leave presently after and permitting her hand to ned volatile stepped again into her chariot and left us melancholy and dissatisfied  the major and i were for returning to our first subject and had resumed the discourse of charity but ned would have nothing but love his whole soul was filled with the image of belvidera and a passion which till now he could never mention seriously was become on a sudden the darling theme of his conversation  groves brooks and belvidera were the objects of his enamored fancy  silence thought shade solitude things which he had never before a notion of presented themselves to his imagination as the most desirable delights of nature  the major obliged him beyond acknowledgment and won all that remained of his heart by talking to him of a poem which he could show him when he came home called the picture of love and repeating out of it some lines the most adapted to neds new circumstances  cautious ye fated who frequent the fair your breasts examine nor too rashly dare curb your untrusted hearts while yet they are free love is resistless when you feel it is he small is the souls first wound from beautys dart and scarce the unheeded fever warms the heart long we mistake it under likings name a soft indulgence that deserves no blame a pleasure we but take to do her right whose presence charms us and whose words delight whose sweet remembrance broods upon the breast and whose dear friendship is with pride possessed excited thus the smothered fire at length bursts into blaze and burns with open strength this image which before but soothed the mind now lords it there and rages unconfined mixing with all our thoughts it wastes the day and when night comes it dreams the soul away pungent impatience tingles in each vein and the sick bosom throbs with aching pain ned was impatient to learn more of a lesson which he found so fit for him but the major with much difficulty came off by assuring him that though he could remember no more at present yet he had it at home in manuscript and would show it him all another time  he then grew quiet and walked on contentedly till the full advance of the day put us in mind that if we returned we might perhaps find dinner waiting for us  the plain dealer no     davusne ita davus amicum mancipium domino  hor monday july  0      when souls of a superior form look abroad and discover among their honest inferiors minds capable of the finest impressions and only in danger of being rendered barren by poverty ignorance and injuries they take a godlike pleasure in communicating their own virtues they strive with the most praiseworthy charity to substitute the more influencing power of their own good example in the room of evil patterns by others till by turning injuries into benefits they raise their obscure neighbors to bright images of themselves  all persons who are favorites of fortune who shine in exalted stations who are gifted with large possessions and surrounded with a multiplicity of dependents have the blessing i have been speaking of in their power they may choose for their domestics the distressed of both sexes whom poverty has rendered humble enough to wish to become servants and whose discretion adapting their nature to their condition has taught them the spirit of obedience and diligence  a good master may be considered as the soul of his family who communicates action and dignity to all who are under his influence and animates them by his own example to be in some measure like himself his house will be the habitation of wisdom virtue and honor if such a master be at home and a stranger wants access to him that stranger will be prejudiced in his favor even before he beholds him for it is easy and natural to read in the voices looks and gestures of the people below stairs what sort of a person one may expect to meet with above nay suppose him even absent he remains in some measure at home leaving so much of the force of his presence in those who represent him he reigns in the obliging deportment of his domestics and their grateful manner of receiving all persons who inquire after him proclaims the goodness of their master all the honor or dishonor of a family reverts to the source and either clears or pollutes the fountain  there are too many haughty flutterers in the world made giddily vain and unthinking by too much prosperity who dream that people of low condition ought to be overlooked and that servants because servants should not be treated as of the same species with themselves these gentlemen as they must be called have understandings abundantly too coarse to be come at by railery they ought to be bluntly told that good servants might make good masters and that theirs possess good qualities of which themselves appear to be destitute they ought in very plain terms to be informed that reason has placed their servants above them though themselves are pleased unreasonably to despise them because fortune without demerit of theirs had placed them seemingly lower  a low and obscure birth has been often the lot of a high and noble spirit it seems to be the victory of nature over fortune that she can produce such valuable creatures in the most abject state of servitude a plaindealing faithful servant is a jewel of inestimable value  the compassion due to honest men on account of their poverty must after having approved their integrity be refined into regard and esteem i have for this reason considered it as a wellspirited piece of advice in monsieur bruyere who writes like an accomplished gentleman when he counsels all of that rank to treat a good old domestic rather like a friend than a servant and truly it is far from impossible but that a master may stand in need of such a servant for his friend and find him upon trial a much better than those inconstant comrades whom the world in their mistaken phrase would be apt to call his betters  i lately had a story told me to this purpose and if it affects the reader as it did me he will not be displeased that i give it him by way of example  a gentleman named belmont a person of distinction filled an honorable post in the army and behaved himself well during the late wars in flanders he is honest brave hearty sincere generous and affable was generally courted for his company by his brother officers and universally beloved by his soldiers in those sunshine days of his prosperity belmont held dear as his bosomintimate a gentleman by name celsus and had one particular servant whom on account of many rare qualities he loved above the rest and treated as monsieur bruyere advises and whom for the sake of his fidelity to his master we will call fido  belmont and celsus lived indeed like true friends and as if each thought the others interest his own they commutually as exigences on either side required furnished one another with money and desired no interest or security at length when they had long loved and lived together celsus was called to another quarter never did soul and body part with more reluctance than these friends being less certain when and where and how they should meet again much about the same time fido having been bred to a trade and got a little stock by his master had thoughts of setting up in the world his master when he discharged him added to the salary he paid him a handsome present and wished him good fortune with such familiarity and condescension as made the wish more endearing than the present  after this if we behold belmont it must be under a cloud of evils he met with cross and severe accidents which reduced him to narrower circumstances than suited so liberal a soul he who delighted in extricating others out of troubles and perplexities was at length involved in difficulties himself in a word his affairs were brought to that extremity that a certain sum must be punctually paid on such a day or belmont be exposed to such an indecent distress as it is painful but to think of  many measures he had tried in vain to make provision against it he was acquainted with many persons of fashion who had been lavish of their vows of friendship and profuse even to prodigality in offering him their services at times when they well knew there was no danger in the offer he tried them all in their turns and found them all false alike  how will it go with poor belmont who has the illluck of such acquaintance why the reader will be pleased to hear that celsus is returned to england as much in the abundance as belmont in the want of all things and settled within a mile or two of london on him were belmonts eyes turned from the sad scene that threatened him here he is sure to be right here his address must prevail i fancy myself walking over the fields with belmont i hear him say he is no longer to groan under his misfortunes than till they can reach the ear of celsus they want nothing toward being relieved but being barely laid before him then belmont is to astonish him with the falsehood and meanness of his other acquaintance thus soothing his imagination he arrives at the house of celsus is received with the warmth of friendship he opens his complaint and tells the story of the usage he had met with here the reader will be stunned  the story was as unprofitable in the ear of celsus as if their friendship had been a fable  as belmont was returning home cross the fields loaded with heavy reflections with whom should he meet but his old man fido walking out with an intention to lie that night at his countrylodgings for the benefit of the air fido would walk back part of the way with his master and finding him very melancholy implored him to tell the cause of it  at length belmont half smiling said thou can not help me in it honest fido and yet with a sigh said he now i think on it i will tell thee for thou know celsus  thou must remember him  sir replied fido and ever shall  i cannot forget your best friend i hope he is not dead  belmont told him the whole story just as he had finished it they reach a little public house on the road  fido without answering begged him to walk in called for pen ink and paper and wrote a note for the money and giving it his master said thus i am glad at my heart it was a sum within my power without breaking in upon my stock because i should have parted with it all for sir i owe it all to you  let us consider celsus and fido celsus a friend and a companion fido a menial servant fido a weaver of fine silks celsus a wearer of finer how then shall we reconcile this matter that celsus after all this difference in substance and figure should be only gentleman in appearance fido in reality it is easy to answer that the stage of life is like the theater where the principal parts acted are not always the best it is not what part we act but how we act it that gives us applause i have frequently known a servant the chief ornament of a play it is the same in the world where they often make considerable figures  the plain dealer no    admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum virg friday july         i am never more delighted than when i meet with an opportunity to unveil obscure merit and produce it into notice there being nothing that more easily deceives us than our judgment on the wit and learning of a cotemporary writer when we take not our measure from our own examination but rely on the authority of public rumor  a pleasant vein a busy meddling talent acquaintance importunity preferment or any outward and accidental advantage shall throw forward an assuming trifler into distinction and popularity while a great and modest genius is neglected and unfamd because not one in fifty of our men of fashion or of quality as they call themselves has an understanding that is able to go alone they are forced therefore to wait till they have their sustainers opinion to lean against before they dare venture upon the praise even of what they are inclinable to think favorably of as far as poor weak wards can presume to think at all whose wits are out in guardianship and under other mens disposal  it is owing to the multiplicity of these overgrown infants that our eyes and ears are fatigued by such impertinence of mistaken encomium insomuch that to those who inspect the things and persons which are most praised among us we appear a nation of grotesque thinkers whose idea of our writers excellence like the dutchmens taste of painting seems to be nature in a fit of distortion where grimace is placed for dignity  by a custom that has prevailed too much since the cheerful times of king charles the second when they ran into the contrary extreme to that which they had suffered by and confounded the serious with the humorous treating the most solemn subjects after a light and wanton manner we have established a false taste of wit which has insensibly like an unnoted current declined us from our right course and brought us so far out of our way that it will be some time before we find ourselves restored to our old relish  the slender shape of the modern muse is made for becoming the hooppetticoat but there was a charming majestic nakedness in that nervous simplicity and plain soundness of pathetick nature which went to the hearts of our forefathers without stopping at their fancy or winding itself into their understanding through a maze of mystical prettinesses  but though this venerable undressed nature is seldom to be met with now and has indeed been lost among us for above a century it was so frequent two or three hundred years ago that their lowest class of poets the composers of our good old ballads have left us some of the noblest examples of the sublime in its most striking energy but in the present practice it is stifled as the roman maid was under the oppression of golden earrings bracelets jewels and heaped heavinesses of the gothic armory yet now and then we start upon it in the writings of our modern poets as i did the other day in an ode on the power of music which was written by a young scots gentleman who has conveyed in a naked grandeur and in the utmost degree of plainness the following aweful thought which carries a terror that will shake the soul of every attentive reader  when living men shall die and dead men live and order is again to chaos hurled thou melody shall still survive and triumph over the ruins of the world a dreadful trumpet never heard before by angels never blown till then through all the regions of the air shall roar that time is now no more but the accident which has drawn me into this lamentation for the loss of nature in our works of wit and poetry where she ought most to show herself is my having taken up in a late perambulation as i stood upon the top of primrosehill a torn leaf of one of those halfpenny miscellanies which are published for the use and pleasure of our nymphs of low degree and known by the name of garlands  that part of it which first caught my eye had its turn a little too modern as well in the matter as the poetry and celebrated the midnight triumphs of some straggling female of whom i had no knowledge but one it should seem of more beauty than delicacy who took the place of ladies bright and with their lords lay all the night who pleased them with her humor free oh the charming sally salsbu  ree   but i passed lightly over this lyrick fragment as too ludicrous for a person of my gravity and fell unexpectedly upon a work for so i make no scruple to call it that deserves to live for ever and which notwithstanding its disguise of coarse brown paper almost unintelligible corruptions of sense from the blunders of the press with here and there an obsolete low phrase which i have altered for the clearer explanation of the authors meaning is so powerfully filled throughout with that bloodcurdling chilling influence of nature working on our passions which critics call the sublime that i never met it stronger in homer himself nor even in that prodigious english genius who has made the greek our countryman  the simple title of this piece was william and margaret a ballad i when hope lay hushed in silent night and woe was wrapped in sleep in glided margrets paleeyd ghost and stood at williams feet ii her face was like an april sky dimmed by a scattering cloud her claycold lilly hand kneehigh held up her sable shroud iii so shall the fairest face appear when youthful years are flown such the last robe that kings must wear when death has reft their crown iv her bloom was like the morning flower that sips the silver dew the rose had budded in her cheek just opening to the view v but love had like the cankerworm consumed her tender prime the rose of beauty pald and pined and died before its time vi awake she cried thy true love calls come from her midnight grave late let thy pity mourn a wretch thy love refused to save vii this is the dark and fearful hour when injured ghosts complain and lovers tombs give up their dead to haunt the faithless swain viii bethink thee william af thy fault thy pledge of broken truth see the sad lesson thou have taught my unsuspecting youth ix why did you first give sense of charms then all those charms forsake why sighed you for my virgin heart then left it thus to break x why did you present pledge such vows yet none in absence keep why said you that my eyes were bright yet taught em first to weep xi why did you praise my blushing lips yet make their scarlet pale and why alas did i fond maid believe the flattering tale xii but now my face no more is fair my lips retain no red fixed are my eyes in deaths still glare and loves vain hope is fled xiii the hungry worm my partner is this winding sheet my dress a long and weary night must pass ere heaven allows redress xiv but hark  it is day  the darkness flies take one long last adieu come see false man how low she lies who died for pitying you xv the birds sung out the morning smiled and streaked the sky with red pale william shook in every limb and started from his bed xvi weeping he sought the fatal place where margrets body lay and stretched him over the greengrass turf that veiled her breathless clay xvii thrice called unheard on margrets name and thrice he wept her fate then laid his cheek on her cold grave and died  and loved too late   i am sorry i am not able to acquaint my reader with his name to whom we owe this melancholy piece of finished poetry under the humble title of a ballad  such ballads were the reverend fragments of disjointed homer when they were sung about the streets of the grecian cities before lycurgus caused the limbs to be assembled into union and so piecd redeemed and consecrated them to the end of time as we now see em in his iliad  yet the common fate of merit is so unequal to its claim that one might almost venture to conclude that this great genius whoever he was lived poor and died unknown in want perhaps of ease and comfort while he had excellence that merited a nations gratitude for the honor he might have lived to do it  from an air of impressive earnestness that is distinguishable through this piece i am of opinion that it was founded on the real history of some unhappy woman of the age the author lived in who had the misfortune to die untimely by her lovers insensibility or rather by his ingratitude  i please myself with an imagination that this sonnet might be one of shakespeares a hundred worse are imputed to him and there is his peculiar solemn power to touch this churchyard terror very visible in the ghost of this ballad  but whoever the author was his judgment appears to have been as extraordinary as his genius as is finely visible in his conduct of this little poem  when the ghost has glided in and stands at the beds foot of the sleeping lover had the speech begun immediately the reader must have been hurried too fast away from the impression which the apparition was designed to make on him he is therefore judiciously detained in this place by a description of her face and posture so strongly painted that we really seem to see her and after a short moral reflection which follows aptly in the third stanza we are acquainted during this artful interval with her character her youth her beauty and the cause of her unhappy death and by that time we are prepared to know her and to pity her the speech is opened with this sharp and startling summons awake she cried  thy true love calls come from her midnight grave   but nothing was ever juster or more strikingly imagined than his comparison of the ghosts face to an april sky which is at best but faintly shining and is here made fainter still by a scattering cloud that dims it to the shadow as it were or thin resemblance of a light not visible this is an image so true to the meaning so poetical and welladapted that it greatly deserves notice as does also that claycold lillyhand that holds up a sable shroud the opposition of the shrouds blackness to the lilly whiteness of the hand is a delicate and graceful stroke and very judiciously heightened by that epithet of claycold which makes us shrink as if we felt what we see so very strongly  to wake us from this horror in order to make way for that pity which he is preparing to move in us we are by a sudden yet almost imperceptible transition carried away from what she is to what she was before love changed her her bloom was like the morning flower that sips the silverdew   i am charmed by a stroke in this sweet simile which is touched with so much delicacy that it would go near to escape the observation of any reader not skilled in poetry i will therefore take notice that her exact time of life being directly pointed out by the morning rose just opening to the view that expression of sipping the silverdew is peculiarly just and elegant for where a flower is full blown the dewdrops have free admission and are taken in as it were by large draughts but a budding flower receiving no moisture but on its edges is with the finest propriety said to sip it  a second excellent simile is that where he compares a secret love in a womans heart to the cankerworm in a bud that fades and destroys it and this again has the air of shakespeare who has the same allusion for grief in one of his tragedies  there is something exquisitely touching in that noble tenderness of her reproach in the eighth stanza  that erotema or figure of questioning which takes up the ninth tenth and eleventh is pursued with the most pathetick emphasis and at last broken off with an aposiopesis so natural and so moving that i have seldom seen a beauty more distinguishable it is where after all those passionate whys with which she has been upbraiding her lovers falsehood she interrupts them on a sudden with this selfaccusing question which strikes out the moral too in a surprising flash of warning where it was least to be expected and why alas did i fond maid believe the flattering tale   but it were endless to particularize the beauties of this charming ballad the whole may be said to be one continued beauty and i believe it will not be possible for any serious reader to peruse or hear it without emotions in his blood that will speak more in its due praise than the most regular critique on it  it is a plain and noble masterpiece of the natural way of writing without turns points conceits flights raptures or affectation of what kind soever it shakes the heart by the mere effect of its own strength and passionateness unassisted by those flaming ornaments which as often dazzle as display in poetry this was owing to the authors native force of genius for they who conceive a thought distinctly will of necessity express it plainly because out of the words which arise and offer themselves to embody a meaning they find no use for the superfluous but to darken and confound their purpose  the plain dealer no    propria quaemaribus  lillys grammar interea volucres pyrois and eois and

remarked an impropriety in our use of common names which cries out aloud for redress and i am absolutely determined to proceed ex officio and without waiting to receive complaints in giving sentence against certain nimbletongud married females who have taken it into their fancies so far to invert order and distinction among the animals which they are possessed of as to bestow upon their dogs the names of heroes gods and goddesses and apply plain puppy to their husbands  i know not how it comes to pass but an enormity of like nature has had confidence enough of late years to creep into his majestys navy to the most manifest hazard of bringing a bad name upon many a shipfull of good mariners  what a hardship for example must it be for a crew who can fight like lions to be sent to sea in

the very names of these ships carry a report like their artillery but who would dream of a man of war in the hare or the roebuck in the hind or in the weasel  i was at a loss how to account for these

honor of my acquaintance with so many horses of quality who are worthy i make no doubt of all the friendship that is shown them by those grateful allies and confederates their masters the boy came up to my appartment with a petition and a paper of gunpowder which he desired i would instruct him in the mystery of making out into crackers and i busied my self for half an hour with becoming gravity and application enjoying all that pleasure which i perceived i gave my pupil whose powder being applied to the important use which he had bought it for the paper it was wrapped in happened to be left upon my hands and seems to have been an original letter from some honest poor fellow of the inferior class of horsecoursers if any certainty as to his rank may be drawn from his bad spelling  the beginning was torn off with the date and place it was sent from but what remained was as follows   it was early in the morning the thursday before our races was to come on as all us horses in the field started together for a breathing but mad work we made amongst us for that same coneyskins that bit tom varney by the shoulder at barnet kicked betty williams in the belly before she had run a stroke and dryboots with me upon his back started close against captain colliers pig and bid fair for half the course to bite him by the tail if i had not not been thrown out by a cross fling of

meant any more than nell clapton does but pray be down a friday for never was such rare work as we are like to have at the assmatches  so no more for now but i rest your loving kinsman till death seth thomson   fishstreet hill july         mr plain dealer i belong to a club of friendly citizens and we meet every monday night to discourse of such things as may entertain and improve us in a way most suitable to that industrious and unambitious honesty which men of trade propose to thrive by but our diversion has been often spoiled by a great scholar who is got among us that makes no more of greek and latin than if it were only plain english  ever since he was introduced he has had all the talk to himself but was never understood above three times from the first night he came into our company he is great mogul of our club and reigns absolute and without a ministry publishing his edicts in a language peculiar to the throne and which being unintelligible by any of his vassals can neither be contradicted nor disputed against  he expatiated last night with a style unusually florid on the verbosity loquaciousness and propension to garrulity of a worthy commoncouncilman whom we were commending for a ready speaker and when one of us by way of atonement mentioned my neighbor hushly the cheesemonger as the silentest man in london he answered that taciturnity was a quality as ineligible as excess of narration for it dehominated those persons who were obnubilated by its umbrageousness and involved their comprehension in a labyrinth of internality  it happened fortunately for the club that an honest drunken officer belonging to the east india company was among us upon this occasion  he was now what we call half seas over and stard at our man of oratory for a minute without motion at last he began to tell him with the most composed face in the world that he was charmed with this opportunity of discoursing with a gentleman of so much wit and learning and hoped he should have his decision in a point that was pretty nice and concerned some eastern manufactures of ancient and reverend etymology modern critics he said were undetermined about them but for his part he had always maintained that chintz bullbull morees and ponabaguzzys were of nobler and more generous use than doorguzees or nourfurmannys not but he held against byrampauts in favor of nicanees and boralchauders only he wished that so accurate a judge would instruct him why tapzils and sallampores have given place to neganepauts and why bejatapoutz should be more esteemed than the finer fabric of blue chelloes  there was not one of all the company except the grave banterer himself but laughed out aloud at this humorous retribution of the scholars affected language he looked a little out of countenance and sat silent for some time but he started up at last with a smiling air of good humor and filling out a brimmer drank the health of the east india officer and then spoke to him as follows  sir i find myself much obliged and return you my public thanks you have held to me so true a glass that i see and am ashamed of the image of my vanity i was weak enough to be growing angry but upon a short recollection find you have used me no otherwise than i have treated the club and been forgiven for it these six months in short sir you have redeemed me from an affectation that made me ridiculous and as long as i live i will take care to be wiser  thus all ended well and the club being restored to freedom i am deputed in their name to write this account of it to the plain dealer that it may be published for the common benefit your health is just going round and  i am sir your constant reader etc j h   for my readers entertainment i shall add to these two letters two uncommon pieces of poetry the first was written by karasin the favorite mistress of tamerlane the great by way of congratulation after his success against bajazet it was composed in form of a lozange the letters of which were brilliant diamonds upon a ground of crimson velvet the words the order and the figure are exactly as in the original note the wit of the ladys poetry lay in its shape and fine clothes where a ladys wit often lies in other countries besides tartary  sound o ye harps sound out in state temir the great who with his sword of bright resistless steel makes all who mean him harm and those who wrong him feel the strength of that right arm cleaving betwixt both eyes such as against him rise what fame he won by deeds new done before the sun bajazet late in his fate found tamerlane answered her in like form but with a great deal of gallantry and politeness in letters of amethysts upon a ground of green velvet  five battles fought and dearly bought thy temir won and in the bloody field has forced all foes to yield reducing crowns and land by his triumphant hand yet never gained i conquest yet so joyful and so dear to me as when i conquered thee o karasin thy woes are my worst foes but gentle be for love of thee keeps me alive the second which now follows is a copy of verses by queen elizabeth on occasion of her first uneasiness concerning mary queen of scots  i met with this little piece in an old art of english poesy which was imprinted at london in the year      and dedicated to the lord treasurer burleigh  the author speaking of these verses says  and this was the occasion of them our sovereign lady perceiving how by the queen of scot s residence within this realm were bred secret factions among her people some of them desirous of innovation and aspiring to greater fortunes by her liberty and life the queen our sovereign lady to declare that she was nothing ignorant of these secret practices albeit she had long with great wisdom and patience dissembled it writes this ditty most sweet and sententious  watchful to shun those snares which would my peace destroy in doubt of future woe i lose my present joy when falsehoods tide flows in all dutys channels ebb and meddling folly toils to untwist wisdoms web nw clouds of toys untried overcast the aspiring mind then fall in empty showers and drive with every wind bt pride of hope supposed the root of ruthe will be and all their grafted guiles a sudden blast shall see that daughter of debate that does contention sow shall reap no harvest here where peace has used to grow our swod that rusts with rest shall first his edge employ and lop this love of change that gives such distant joy having never met with these verses before and questioning whether they are extant in any book but that in which i found them i have taken pleasure to communicate them as a relic that merits to be preserved and is worth the notice of the curious  the plain dealer no     quis enim generosum dixerit hunc qui indignus genere and praeclaro nomine tantum insignis  juven rarus enim ferme sensus communis in illa fortuna  ibid  nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus ibid friday july         there is a hobbyhorse in the world called nobility by right of birth which was the invention of industrious policy to entail and perpetuate virtue but like vinegar from the finest wines it is so changed by its putrefaction that there is not a sharper curse among the scourges of gods vengeance than is inflicted on mankind by that silly thing called pride of descent it was first indulged as a mark of merit but it clings inseparably to the line after the most manifest extinction of all the worth which it was given for  yet there was both the rational and the generous in that hope which seems to have been conceived by the first inventors of nobility from its original institution  some great and powerful prince when he had experienced a servants courage his conduct or integrity and was willing to transmit those virtues after they had been so useful to himself to the future benefit of his heirs and successors made it his first care to bestow on this able favorite such lands and extent of revenue as might place him above the necessity of concerning himself for his childrens support in life and this left him at perfect leisure to enlarge and inspire their minds till he made them capable of succeeding as well to his toils and dangers as to his honors and possessions  to strengthen yet more their expectation of so good an end they contrived this further means of adding visible and outward marks betokening honor power and wisdom such as titles robes rank privileges and a train of pomps and ceremonies all these they made hereditary for this weighty and sufficient reason  because it was a natural hope that persons who were exempt from private wants should also be unsubject to private baseness they would then be at liberty to enlarge and exalt their thoughts in proportion to that high condition which they grew up in the expectation and foreknowledge of till they came to disdain narrow principles and renounce selfish purposes such as poverty might have seemed to justify but which could never correspond with that magnificence and disinterested scope of mind which was proposed to be the consequence of so distinguished an education in a life so happily provided for  a nobleman the descendant of noble ancestors when we consider him in this light seems to be one of the pillars of human virtue and the honored ornament of a body politic and the only reason why we talk with respect or even with gravity of the antiquity of a mans family is because by how many more successions the line has continued noble by so many more examples their virtues are supposed to have been fortified till the practice and love of glory justice knowledge and compassion are esteemed inherent in their very nature and their blood flows down distinguished by a kind of inspiration which it carries with it  but exclusive of this single consideration what a ridiculous pretense to reverence is the accident of having been born to live lazily  it is insolence in the highest degree for a cipher of rank and title to expect submission from a person who is venerable for his good qualities upon no better a foundation than because the accomplished commoner is perhaps the son of an honest man who had nothing to depend on but his industry and the foolish lord had a father who left him an estate and a title which somebody a long time ago gave a sturdy valiant soldier to maintain his posterity till they should grow good for nothing and look with scorn at their first founder drawing all their empty glory from the numbered ages which have passed since merit and humility could claim a place in their great family  if in the world there is a pleasanter piece of stupid impertinence than ordinary it is that conceited and satisfied selfpreference with which one of these happy creatures looks down from his own sublimity upon the merit that lies below him  but i wonder what he would answer if in the height of his exultation fortune should take a freak to whisper this question in his ear  pray my lord have you considered how to deserve this fine distinction which you inherit without knowing why  are you honester than your own steward pretty much upon a par  are you braver than your ragged cousin oh no  not at all  are you more pious than your chaplain far from it i assure you  are you wiser or more learned than my lady your lordships wife but a little if any thing  are you richer than your banker not so rich by half a plumb  pray what then may your lordships pretensions be to that respect which you claim from others  why  you know says he that i was born to it  it is a pleasant pretension let us trace it a little higher  why is this lords family of more dignity than that lords since their estates and rank are equal oh there is a very good reason for that it is because his race is most ancient  pray what do you mean by ancient was not adam their common father yes but this mylord has been longer in possession of lands than that mylord has  so then the case it seems stands thus other mens acquirements must give him dignity to whom other mens merit has given distinction  antiquity of name and family is one of the most riduculous things in nature when it is made use of as the ground of honors there being nothing more certain than that the revolutions of time and fortune have used all families alike and were it possible to see backward into the obscurity of past ages we might pick out beggars from our proudest lines and point at princes in our humblest this nobility that consists in sound is an empty and chimerical grandeur it is a mere king of clubs who as the game happens to be may run away from the knave and see the single ace a nobler card than his majesty  i fancy that if i were a lord the turkeycock with his sweeping wing erected neck and peerlike strut within the sphere of his barndoor royalty would make me sick of my boasted quality unless i had better claim than my pride to the stateliness i was distinguished by  the true use of titles is that they may serve as shining lights to lay open and illustrate the spacious chambers of a mind wellfurnished but to a close and sordid soul they are like torches which we carry down to illuminate a sickly dungeon where they expose but the more disgracefully the narrow cells bare walls and dirtiness  the basest thing in nature is to have power to do much good without will to do any how contemptible then are they who becoming insolent by prosperity think on nothing so seldom as the distresses of the miserable and while they were made noble for this end only to be active in good offices live for pleasure and to no better purpose than one of their hounds or their setting dogs  if a nobleman who is thus declined from the only end of his institution can be author of any good by effect of his example it must be such an accidental and involuntary service as was done of old to the philosopher  he was asked from whom he learnt to be so steady in pursuits of virtue i learn it said he from the persons who live most viciously for observing what makes them despicable i see plainly what to shun and i guess by the reverse what it is that i ought to practice  the eastern people ascribe to plato several excellent sayings which we do not find in his works and among others they cite this following  plenty and want are two clouds the fullest stored of any the first rains dullness and arrogance the second learning and humility for while the body of the poor is improving into spirit the spirit of the rich is degenerating into body it is a pretty remark and every mans experience will enable him to justify it for how few public or private improvements have been owing to our men of rank and how many to the unsatisfied application of the unhappy who finding themselves pressed by uneasy circumstances whet and urge their active talents till prosperity can afford them leisure to be as useless as if they were born to it  it is plain then that a nobleman who has no other merit than his rank gives him has no merit at all and is just so much more despicable than a commoner who is equally worthless as the duties of his condition are more elevated and important and that respect which is looked for by a lord merely as a lord deserves to be numbered among those sacrifices which we make to custom at the expense of our common sense and to the dishonor of our natural liberty  an essay writer of the last age who had learnt from tiresome experience that he had irrecoverably lost those years which he had spent in attending the great as they love to hear themselves called quitted the pursuit with a manly scorn and having observed for his readers use that these men make no friendships but such as are subservient either to their interests or their pleasures he closes all with this remark  i have so hearty a contempt for what is commonly called greatness that if i did not meet with the word lord in a prayer i repeat daily i should never name it but with detestation and to allow this author but common justice no man is so foolishly a tyrant over his own heart as he that humbles himself to a will that is too proud to take notice of it and waits on those from whom he can expect nothing but what he must dearly pay for in guilt dishonor or mortification  i am pleased with a frank correction of that peevish and humoursome arrogance so inseparable from these proud mens behavior as it was given by a syrian doctor to one of the caliphs of babylon they were angling upon the river tygris and the caliph growing impatient because he had catched nothing ordered the physician out of his sight for he was sure he should have no sport in company with one who was so unlucky  nay but methinks replied the doctor you accuse me a little rashly my father was a drawer of water and my mother but a slave yet i have been chief favorite of many successive caliphs and am rich and fortunate beyond my wishes how then can such a man as i deserve to be called unlucky but if you would be informed i can name a person who may truly be styled unhappy the caliph told him he might explain himself   it is sir pursued the physician a lord who descending lineally from four illustrious caliphs and being himself too a caliph sits unmindful of his dignity catching fish like an idle saunterer while ignorance and rest are spreading nets to catch his people  since honors were first bestowed as a reward of mens past virtues and for excitement of their future it seems the justest thing imaginable that all lords who possess them fruitlesly should forfeit them and step down among the herd to hide the shame of those defects which by reason of their too high situation blaze out like a beacon to the disturbance of a whole country as for the same reason where a nobleman is truly such his wisdom his courage and his loyalty strike out their influence in larger circles than the virtues of inferior ranks can possibly be extended to  for my part as it is my purpose to speak of every thing like a plain dealer i declare with the utmost indifference that though no man more sincerely reverences what a nobleman was meant to be yet i can have no respect at all for the name where the thing is wanting on the contrary it is my opinion that every gentleman of spirit should despise and mortify the vanity of such a chimerical superiority as would advance itself above substantial honor by the empty memory and sound of it  the breath of a sovereign may have power to create titles but it can have none to invert qualities though the vessel is in the potters hands and the man must be called noble whom the king delights to honor yet he will never be so by his patent if he was not before so in his nature  but there is a kind of man who will always be found noble without aid of pomp or titles and in what place soever you chance to meet him you may know him by the following marks he will be humble in greatness and immovable in adversity he will be compassionate without weakness brave without arrogance conscious without pride and sincere without indecency he will be wary but not suspicious and his anger will have no malice he will love without folly and disapprove without hatred his hope will be strong but patient his fear awake but easy he will be active without hurry and at leisure without idleness and at least if he be not learned he will be a lover of learning  the plain dealer n     turpi secernis honestum hor nec duo sunt sed forma duplex nec foemina dici nec puer ut possit neutrumque and utrumque vid tur ovid monday

sexes they shall furnish the entertainment of the day these female correspondents who are such powerful and ingenious advocates in the behalf of beauty innocence and modesty will probably observe with pleasure that their letters in a short time will have had a good effect upon those who are not lost to all sense of shame they will then enjoy the satisfaction of having efficaciously corrected with their own pretty hands the rudenesses and abuses which they so justly complain of  epsom july         mr plaindealer i have had the misfortune to be educated after the oldfashioned method of our ancestors who were so ignorant to instill modesty as a virtue into their female pupils now you must know sir this place is filled at present with a polite set of ladies members of a society with so hard a name that i am afraid i should spell it wrong so will omit it that have heroically resolved to put all modest virgins out of countenance by staring unmercifully in their faces this behavior adds so many new charms and renders them so agreeable to all they converse with that i would gladly assume a little of this modern accomplishment but the prejudice of early imbibed principles is so strong that instead of answering a smart in his own way i cannot forbear blushing both for him and the ladies that are diverted with his prodigious wit so beg you will either assist me to conquer these illbred flushes or prevail with the ladies to confess their sex by a grain or two of modesty out of compassion to several sufferers and particularly  sir your obedient humble servant biddy bashful nb it would not be amiss if you would be pleased to appoint different hours of public appearance to the two classes of the bolds and bashfuls     sir most of our neighbors knowing that i have the honor to be related to you have put me upon writing this letter to acquaint you that yesterday a strange and surprising creature was seen to pass through our town on horseback it had the face of a young woman stuck full of patches a perriwig which hung down to its waist a hat cocked with the smartness of a young officer a huge bunch of ribbons fastened behind its leftshoulder a shirt laid in large pleights on the breast and tied close at the neck and wrists which with a vest of white satin trimmed with black had much the resemblance of a shroud our whole town was soon alarmed with this strange appearance and various are still the opinions what it really was the old people who were the most courageous generally went pretty near to it with their spectacles on to view it more distinctly the younger sort kept it at an awful distance some were of opinion that it was a highwayman in disguise and accordingly were for seizing it others took it for a nun but by a certain arch lear it had with its eyes i dare engage it had not a bit of nuns flesh about it however by its pale complexion and shroudlike dress most of my neighbors at last concluded it to be a ghost and so took to their heels and left me who am no great believer in these things almost alone with it in the road i had now an opportunity during the time it was drinking a glass of rhenish wine and sugar at the saracensheadinn to survey it well and thereupon concluding it to be an hermaphrodite i enquired of the man who seemed to have the keeping of it if he intended to show it in our town and at what inn for you must know sir that i have a mighty curiosity to see one of those creatures all over but the man with an angry countenance told me that what i took for an hermaphrodite was only a young lady and that the sort of dress she was in was commonly worn for a ridinghabit by the ladies of fashion at london but as neither i nor my neighbors can believe it possible for folks upon no ill design to disguise themselves in such a manner i desire you will in one of your plaindealers for we have it constantly brought to us by our coach inform us of the truth which will tend very much to the satisfaction of the best part of our town who are your readers and particularly  honored sir your kinswoman and most humble servant dorothy plain kettering in northamptonshire july         ps sir since i writ my letter some of my neighbors tell me they believe the creature i have writ to you about is one of the masqueraders we have heard of that are common with you at london but for my part i cannot think it ugly enough for one of them neither     the subsequent epistle is very curious and gives an account of a new method of scandal which my correspondent assures me takes very much with the satirical part of her sex whom i am sorry to see so uncharitable to each other and indiscreet enough to trust their reputation to the tongue of so loquacious an animal  sir i was prevailed upon one day last week to visit my lady tattle where i was no sooner seated but i heard a voice which i thought too hoarse to come from our sex cry  it is true she is very pretty but she has mrs frail s fault that loves fellows company and then a little afterward good lord what is become of miss patty will she never leave the country people say before she went she was fat about the waist hearing my best friends scandalized after this rude manner i could contain no longer but turning about to see the author of such injurious expressions i was surprised to hear the same voice in the most humble tone imaginable cry poor poll scratch pole pretty parrot it is impossible to describe the pleasure that appeared in lady tattles eyes upon hearing her birds discourse she told me she had bespoke three more and that she designed one for party another for scandal and the third which she would instruct herself should speak poetry i beg sir you would either in your writings put a stop to this growing folly or desire some member of parliament to propose an act to prohibit the importation of parrots  i am sir your most humble servant vindemia kensington july     the plain dealer no  0 omnia vincit amor and noscedamus amori virg friday august        to the plain dealer sir the few lines i sent to you on the   th of the last month were intended for the diversion of your readers and were the dictates of a mind at ease i write to you now with a quite different spirit and on a more substantial and solid motive my heart was then so light that i little thought it would in so short a time grow so heavy as i now find it i am in pain about a very worthy relation of ours young mr true love who being just returned from his travels is married to a young lady upon whom he had secretly set his heart for some years before he went abroad the perplexity of the case is that he has married her without the knowledge of his father and that the good old gentleman without the knowledge of his son had provided for him a lady beautiful like her himself has chosen and young like her equal in family but vastly superior in point of fortune never was there a more paternal affection than my uncle true love has shown innumerable marks of to his son nor were there ever more tokens of filial piety than my cousin has taken all occasions to demonstrate toward his father it would be a wondrous pity that any misunderstanding should happen between so loving and beloved a father and so loving and beloved a son and yet we are all in mighty apprehensions that this marriage may occasion a fatal breach between them the father placed the prospect of the sons happiness in his having a wife with a plentiful fortune the son thought that with regard to his own happiness no fortune could be put in competition with the value of the woman whose virtue beauty and innocence had endeared her to his heart the father if all our family guesses right and much i fear we do will be enraged at the loss of an estate in which he had imaginarily placed the whole sum of his sons felicity in this world he will tax him of imprudence tell him he has thrown himself away and call this marriage so entered upon without his knowledge or consent an act of disobedience my cousin who bears a tender and an affectionate heart will ill brook these rebukes that make his father seem to undervalue the precious creature whom he above all the world holds dear he will not he cannot suffer them he will justify his choice he will be warm in the defense of the fair one his father has despised he will speak with indifference of the fortune his father had with pains been seeking in comparison of her and maintain the privilege of his being of age and free to choose for himself thus their very affections by this different notion they have of happiness may be the causes of their difference and since those who have a violence in the passion of love carry with them that violence into other passions we are apt to fear that unless some precautions be taken the rupture may be dangerous and we rather think by gentle methods to break the force of the disappointment in the manner of discovering the marriage to the old gentleman than leave him to the chance of a hasty fury upon his suddenly discovering it himself we are all on the sons side before the matter breaks out and we have a mind to make it up with the old gentleman as it were without his own knowledge our contrivance is what i am sure your humanity will prompt you to help forward that you should pen a paper in defense of the right which young men have of choosing for themselves and against the hardship there would be in a fathers interposing his authority against the inclinations of his son in the case of marriage and after we have read that to him we will open it by degrees though it is more particularly ours at present yet it is the worlds concern the young of both sexes will be pleased with the speculation and it may be very extensively beneficial if that fatherly gentleman that wise companion of yours the major joins with you in supporting the cause of the young people two such authorities will be of great weight with the old ones and at least reconcile them so far to this general opinion of all children that when such accidents happen they will not stand in need of so many arguments to reconcile them to their persons in complying with this you will give great ease and satisfaction to our whole family and particularly to  honored sir your affectionate kinswoman and humble servant dorothy plain kettering in northamptonshire aug         when this letter came to my hands the major happened to be present and as soon as i had looked it over i told him he had a right to read it he did so and returning it with a smile your kinswoman said he makes a very reasonable request the old people who are generally in the right when they differ from the young will not be angry with us their coaevals and wellwishers if we should endeavor to show that the young people are not altogether in the wrong in this point for my share i must frankly declare that when young people are at years of discretion before they marry the law of nature and reason seems to speak them free to choose for themselves since they and not their parents for no less a term than life are to enjoy the happiness of a right choice or feel the smart of a wrong one the major and i agreed in this sentiment and had a long discourse upon the subject which when i got home threw me into the following reflections  of all the affections which move and act pleasurably upon the frame of human nature plato reckons love the most desirable for he says this curious philosopher who is thoroughly affected with this passion removes his soul to the place where he has settled his affections and loses himself to find the object he doats upon this pleasant straying this delightful wandering of the soul from its own mansion is a beautiful description of the force of love and the power which those who were created to charm have to transport us as it were from the government of ourselves into their own absolute dominion a passion which is of its own nature so violent renders men excusable in a great measure when they seem to misplace it they cannot be said to be guilty of a fault in disobeying their relations when they are transported beyond the power of giving law to themselves they are sunk in the soft captivity and captives are not free agents neither is it hard it should be so in nature on the contrary as good and virtuous women alone have the full power of moving and captivating the soul in the manner i mention it is so far from being an evil that it is a blessing to be highly coveted the man who is born of a good mother says little enough when transported by her desert he calls women the ornaments of mankind in their prosperity and their supports in adversity there is no being happy in life without them  plato in another place has carried the sentiment to a more agreeable height he says the soul of a man in love dies in his own body and lives in another this is energy of expression and yet there is not more of strength and delicacy than of propriety and justness for the soul of a man in love is dead to all other appetites the man who was in love with riches and eager in the pursuit of honor before he beheld the fair one who captivated his soul the moment his heart confesses itself a victim to the enchantment of beauty looks no longer upon honor and riches as the two principal movements they grow only secondary blessings and are no farther valued than as they may help him to comfort and adorn the adored companion of his life love is really witn regard to other affections what the philosophers stone is pretended to be with regard to metals it inriches and ennobles every thing it touches it is the genuine elixir that gives a golden tincture to every disposition of the mind it heightens ambition it inlarges generosity it quickens joy it banishes envy it extinguishes lust it enlivens the virtues and extirpates the vices of men in all ranks and conditions of life is there a king who is a lover of money the beauty whom he languishes to make a queen is valued beyond all his treasure is there a courtier that is warm in the pursuit of a coronet let him be in love and his mistress is his pride without her the coronet will not hinder his head from aching a garter will less assuage the swellings of his proud heart than a favor of her bestowing a man that has a fullness of joy in his composition will grow melancholy if he loses the fair object of his desires music cannot please where her voice is not heard equipage embroideries and brocades are false colors upon the heart that is inwardly in mourning the envious man envies no body but his rival while he continues a lover the lustful forgets his appetites after variety of women what parent can rationally expect to be heard when he undertakes to plead against such powerful impressions all the urgings of duty will be of no effect all the arguments that can be used will be no arguments to these all the world beside his mistress is nothing to the man that is in love and she is all the world to him  what can they hope to propose to a son in this condition thar will deter him from his purposes will they propose to him a women whom they think more beautiful and agreeable and that as an infinite superiority of fortune above the fair one that is his own choice let her be as great a fortune as she pleases she is no fortune at all to him she would be with all her wealth the load and calamity of his life love he would say is built upon the union of minds hearts are not to be bribed by gold and true passion is not to be bought off by the treasure of both indies he can have no relish in possessions that his desired partner shares not will they add that besides fortune the mistress they recommend has infinitely more of beauty in the worlds eyes he will answer the worlds eye is none of his he will grant even that she may have defects and will not stop to say that he is even in love with those defects in fine all they can propose will never avail nor is it indeed reasonable that it should if they threaten him with their displeasure and tax him with want of duty he will tell them that he is dutiful in all other points he will be sorry for their displeasure but cannot obey in this one case he will make this undeniable quotation in his defense that he is to leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and truly if his parents think that he sins against prudence in choosing a slender fortune all the world will judge that they would sin against justice if forcing his inclinations they make him wretched under pretense of making him rich and render him miserable under the color of making him fortunate  the plain dealer no    principiis obsta  ovid  vellent tibi barbam lascivi pueri  hor monday august  0      the complaint of chloe in the ensuing letter seems to be formed upon so laudable a desire of making her husband more agreeable to her that without being entirely uncomplaisant and void of all gallantry whatsoever there is no such thing as refusing to insert it or denying her all the assistance that such a plain old man as i am shall be able to give her toward procuring her a proper redress from her husband  it is indeed a nice and ticklish matter to have any thing to do between married folks and unless i had great hopes of doing good i should have little inclination to meddle in it  but i remember to have heard a particular case once when a very reverend divine was applied to by both parties to accommodate a difference between them the holy man excused himself with a venerable shrug saying that he had laid it down as a maxim never to go between a man and his wife on any consideration whatever  a friend of mine who knew both the man and the wife assured me that the first grounds of their difference were too ridiculous to bear being told but that both being very stiff and obstinate not to yield an inch on either side were however inwardly ashamed and wanted nothing more earnestly than a pretense to come together by the interposition of the divine if the doctor had only used will weathercocks healing method and said no more but that though both of them had been in the wrong yet both of them were in the right too all would certainly have come right and they have been as good friends as ever  for this reason therefore i shall never think it a matter of scruple to thrust in between a discontented couple my correspondent chloe complains of a very obvious and visible obstruction that is easy and will be even refreshing to her husband to take off and i comply with her desire of inserting the complaint because i confide that her husbands compliance with the prayer of her petition will be the consequence of mine  mr plain dealer this very day makes it exactly half a year since i became a wife my husband when he made his applications to me always appeared gay genteel and debonnair but about two months after we had tied the gordian knot he began to dress in a more negligent manner he now appears so much the reverse of what he did formerly in point of dress that the neighbors look upon it as a bad compliment to his yokemate before matrimony his chin was scarce shaded but now the barber is never sent for but on a saturday night this strange metamorphosis you may naturally suppose is no ways agreeable to me i assure you sir i have spared no pains to prevail with my deary to make his appearance in a manner suitable to his station however my repeated petitions have all of them proved ineffectual i therefore beg of you mr plain dealer to give me your assistance in this affair and you will highly oblige  your very humble servant chloe   if the maxim of the abovementioned divine was to be followed in our present case i do not know where this complaint might end and whether it would not come to an open rupture it is certain the most remarkable divorces have arisen from as small beginnings the very letter of this young lady shows her to be a neat and cleanly person and therefore her complaint of this i cannot help terming it dirty usage carries the greater weight with it i can methinks behold this young sloven approaching the tender thing and embracing her in a manner that turns pleasure into a torment i see him hold her struggling against a kiss his arms round her unwilling neck force her face to his dreaded lip he is put to the necessity of ravishing a kiss from his own wife and yet is ignorant of the meaning  he takes it however by violence  she looks half pleased half angry hangs down her head hides the water in her eyes pushes him between jest and earnest from her bosom rubs her glowing and smarting mouth calls him rough thing with half a tenderlaughing and a halfwhining voice  the unpolished creature casts a booby stare at her and is stupidly at a loss to know why she struggles so hard against what she likes unless he is told point blank that his beard is the cause of all the disorder he cannot perceive that her cheeks look red and angry with his kisses and wear rather the print of fury than love he must be told that a delicate skin was never formed to be brushed over by a bristly beard that is rough and stubborn like the humor that lets it grow i call it more particularly stubborn in this unaccountable young fellow for she has told and told him of it again and again in plain terms and he notwithstanding all this pertinaciously continues to go rough now is it not a preposterous way of acting after all that when a lover he should shave close for fear of offending the eye of a mistress whom he was uncertain of obtaining and yet let it grow when a husband without having the fear of wounded beauty before his eyes and without any apprehensions of hurting that face by his roughness that charmed him by its softness  i dwell the more upon this subject as inconsiderable as it may seem to some because it is a male vice that i have frequently taken notice of and as often wished to see remedied for the sake of the fair sufferers who are wedded to such unpolished barbarians a marriage conversation ought to humanize and temper men on the contrary these instead of growing tamer are made more savage by matrimony  you shall see a lover in a fine campaign peruque and an embroidered suit of clothes altered into a husband with an awkward country bob and a surtout made out of a rug you shall find his manners following his dress and his complaisance degenerating into bluntness it is in all degrees alike you shall see one whom before marriage you would take for a lord altered after it into a coachman many that seemed senators transmuted into jockies a hundred ceremonious beaus turned clowns and numberless sir clements transformed into country lobbins  sure as old as i am i have a more amorous nature in me still than these mysterious young fellows whose affections and actions are so different i cannot tell what to make of them i can easily guess it would tickle my ear strangely to hear a young beautiful creature telling me how i should become more agreeable to her by adorning myself and entreating me to do it for example if patty amble and i were upon absolute terms of agreement there are not any little customs that i would not depart from for her ease as fixed an aversion as i have professed against clouded canes i should however be easily persuaded to carry a painted stick instead of an oaken if by walking with it i was sure to make progression in my wifes affection nay i would admit a knot of ribbons to it into the bargain provided it would render our marriageknot the easier again i have known women who have a prodigious aversion to a mouse and are not only very wary at guarding their petticoats upon the approach of that little noxious and nimble animal but do not even care that any thing which looks the least like it should come near them now if my patty was of that temper i who know how far women are apt to stretch some antipathies would alter the very color of my gloves for fear of offense and though i have affected mousecolour for so many years i would fit myself with a pair of white or at least of a less frightful complexion before i would come within arms length of her hoop in fine though i wear a little mustache the fashion when i was young and a peculiarity i have not mentioned of myself till this day that would rather tickle than offend yet sooner than that should interpose it should be devoted to the edge of the razor for i am absolutely for rescinding the least obstacles between a man and his wife before matters are carried too far  a great many people will object that these are trifles but i say they are matters that have more consequences than they dream of however granting the objection true if conforming onesself in little matters is sufficient to please it is the least a man can do to indulge so amiable a creature  compliance in dress is a piece of matrimonial wisdom fine feathers making fine birds women often choose more judiciously than the men and have regard to sense temper and behavior but they will have a mixture of appearance too in the composition of their man if possible and dress passes with some of them even beyond looks insomuch that though finery in the general rule be the glory and darling passion of a woman yet there are exceptions of many who would rather see their husbands fine than themselves nothing is more common than to hear ordinary women especially who after they are married are very free in declaring the source of their affections say that the neatness of her husband the smugness of his look and the cleverness of his shape etc first made her in love with him if this be the case when the cause ceases the effect will cease too the moment he grows dirty wears a long beard or drowns himself in a large josephus the pleasant picture that his wife had painted of him in her fancy vanishes and if not reimprinted sometimes her liking insensibly wears away in fine as much trifles as these are a wifes heart if that be a trifle is lost by the disuse of them and perhaps made a trifling present of to a stranger that minds dressing  i have been credibly informed that it is a political piece of cunning among those unlucky sparks who affect to shine by the means of modish wickedness to observe how the husband who grows careless after marriage appeared in the times of his courtship and to equip themselves accordingly they play the part of the suitor so well upon the husband as to estrange from him the affections of his spouse and transfer them to their proper purpose they dress in the same manner wear clothes of the same color are punctual in his very pinch and cock of the hat mimick his air gait mien and by this policy in love make the husband his own rival but as the face is the mart of love so these inconveniences happen mostly from an overneglect of that part the being not shaved ruffles a womans temper against her husband while the gallant by being trimmed smooths a passage to her inclination  i am sure if the case stands thus a barber is an artisan of importance since besides taking off the beard he lops away such growing evils  let him therefore that values his head look to his beard and be mindful  the plain dealer no     cinis and manes and fabula fies pers friday august         ever since i was a schoolboy i have been fond of walking in westminsterabbey where when my heart is heated by the violence of some unruly passion i enjoy a cool composure and a kind of venerable refreshment  its dusky cloisters majestic isles quire organs royal tombs and reverend variety of strong impressive images have a neverfailing power to reduce my mind from transport when hope prosperity or pleasure have betrayed it into vanity or to relieve it when disordered by a weight of anguish or oppression  death and the sun says a french writer are two things not to be looked upon with a steady eye  though there is something in his observation rather pretty than just yet so far is certainly true that we are unqualifyd to think serenely on our dissolution while we are surrounded by the noise and hurry of the world in its ambitious scenes or softened into sensual wishes by the languor of an idle solitude  while we are part of our own prospect we can never view it justly but in such a situation as the abbey we are placed as it were out of ourselves and from this ancient stand of death look back upon a country which we seem no longer to have any concern in and which therefore we can judge of with the necessary clearness and impartiality  the mind that is steadfast enough to meditate calmly on death will be armed to resist the strength and the flattery of human passions  such thoughts if they make us not better will at least make us wiser since that must moderate our wishes which puts us out of countenance at their levity and who can reflect without being ashamed that while every thing in life is accidental and death the only certainty we go on to act notwithstanding as if all things else were infallible and death but accidental  i sometimes suffer myself to be shut up for five or six hours among the tombs where i sit down without ceremony or reprehension among the proudest of those princes who were once too stately to be conversed with but at distance and with fear and reverence  i possess in common with the spiders their companions and most constant servants who spread network over their trophies the unenvied privilege of surrounding those last beds of forgotten majesty  here i bury myself in solemn silence and imprint my imagination with images which awaken thought and prepare me for humility  the stained and melancholy light that enters faintly through the painted windows as if it wore a decent mourning to become the scene it opens to me guides me slowly by the cloistered allies dusty tombs and weeping statues till i am lost in that still pomp of figured sorrow which on every side incloses me  from finished prayer the flock disperse apace and each glad foot forsakes the dreary place the hooded prebend plods along before and the last virger claps the ringing door then thoughtful lingering curious and alone in the dark temple when the rest are gone no noise invades my ear no murmuring breath not one low whisper in the hall of death no trampling sound swims over the silent floor but the slow clock that counts the sliding hour here indulging contemplation i forget my cares and misfortunes and disencumber myself from the forms and embarrassments of converse i become the inhabitant of a quiet and unbusy world where all is serene and peaceful i am disturbed by no fears inflamed by no anger inspired by no hope tormented by no jealousy i can expect whitout impatience and be disappointed without affliction the dust which is scattered round me and which once was living flesh as i am choaks the fountains of my pride and produces in me a mortification that is too strong for all my passions  i was present very lately when of those monumental historians whose employment it is to draw a profit from reading lectures on these resting places of our ancient princes was showing the tomb of henry the fifth to a circle of holiday strollers  after having informed the tasteless wonderers that this was he who conquered france that his son was crowned in paris that he married the french kings daughter and what else he had been able to collect from the records of this great princes reign he pointed to a plain wooden wormeaten coffin that was placed upon the ground by this tombs side and told them that it contained the body of queen catherine the beautiful wife of this triumphant henry  adding that for a small additional contribution he would unlock the coffin and let them look in upon her corpse which lay there perfect and undecayd though she had been dead almost three hundred years they had curiosity enough to pay the price demanded and the proposer made good his promise unveiling to their sight and touch the relics of that royal charmer  i cannot express the indignation and concern which this scene gave me  her lovely limbs which once were thought too tender for the wind to blow upon and which were never seen without joy reverence and wonder by the conqueror of her fathers kingdom and the sovereign of this in which she died now lay neglected and exposed denied even earth to cover her and made a spectacle for entertainment of a crowd of common wanderers  superior as this lady was in her beauty birth and fortune what praeeminence in death have all these given her above the meanest and most unlovely  after having made her life a changeful course of sorrow and calamity they left her destitute in death without the decency of a grave to shelter her  there now she lies a proof of transitory greatness to comfort the wretched with this reflection when they look in upon her exposed remains that nature has made no difference between a royal and a vulgar body but that taking away what was added by fortune each from the moment of death is the others equal to eternity  what rank or condition is there among us which may not draw from this great school of moral reasoning some observation for their benefit  even the unwary and extravagant whose lives are a continued luxury and to whom the miseries of debt appear remote and without terror even they may find a lesson among these tombs for there they may be shown the bodies of great men doing penance in their velvet coffins and imprisoned after death to satisfy the malice of their stubborn creditors as if the influence of sordid money could extend its cruelties beyond life and had a privilege to disturb by avarice the sleeping ashes of departed sovereigns  is a man insulted wronged betrayed does he hate his distrusted enemy are his thoughts employed on revenge and does he break his sleep with stratagems to avoid or retaliate the injustice that may be done him let him walk with me in this instructive circle and i will show him the dust of a murdered monarch mixing quietly with his who murdered him  i will tread with him over earth that is passive and ferments not though composed of united atoms from the mingled bodies of those men whose battling interests and affections while they lived shook the kingdom like an earthquake  when the quarrelsome consider this they ought to blush at their little hatreds and grow ashamed to let their souls be divided by animosity when death may crumple their bodies together and incorporate them with their most malicious enemy  there is no fortune so exalted but it may find a check in this dark mansion nor any condition so dejected but that it may be sure of a comfort every stone that we look upon in this repository of past ages is an entertainment and a monitor  i never leave its venerable gloom without finding my mind cooler and more composed than when i entered  i sink deep into myself and see my heart without disguise in its good or evil propensities and i gather power from these strong impressions to resist pleasure pride ambition or low avarice and to fortify the impulses of humility forgiveness charity and the virtues of content and quietude  there was published a few years since a poem called westminsterabbey i am sorry the authors name was not printed with it there is something highly elevated in his genius that is sweetly serious and sublimely melancholy  the verses inserted above i am indebted for to that poem and i shall borrow from the same piece these following which i will take the liberty to affirm are as fine ones as were ever written  i ask pardon for a transposition and alteration or two which i have only made that i might have the pleasure of collecting into one view as many of the beauties as could possibly be drawn together in the narrow compass of my paper  lead on my muse while trembling i essay to trace thy footsteps through the cloistered way throw a thick veil around thy radiant head and lead me through the dwellings of the dead where the still banner faded and decayed nods pendant over its mouldering masters head where loves transformed to marble angels moan and weeping cherubs seem to sob in stone seize time and by the pinions urge his stay stop him a while in his eternal way bid him recline his scythe on each pale tomb and name the tenant of the darksome room o muse with care the blended dust explore and reinspire and wake the sleeping floor to mount their throne here monarchs bend their way over pavements where their predecessors lay ye sons of empire who in pompous hour attend to wear the cumbrous robe of power when ye proceed along the shouting way think there is a second visit still to pay and when in state on buried kings you tread and swelling robes sweep over the imperial dead while like a god your worshipped eyes move round think then o think you walk on treacherous ground though firm the checkered pavement seems to be twill surely open and give way for thee while crouding lords address their duties near the anointing prelate and the kneeling peer while with obsequious diligence they bow and spread the careful honors over thy brow while the highraisd spectators shout around and the long isles and vaulted roofs resound then snatch a sudden thought and turn thy head from the loud living to the silent dead with conscious eye the neighboring tombs survey these will instruct thee better far then they what now thou art in yon gay homage see but these best show what thou art sure to be i am ignorant what reception this excellent performance met with in the world but i hope for the honor of my country that it was not a bad one  the whole poem is full of beauties but if it had no other merit than appears in what i have here copied from it every candid judge of poetry must allow it to have deserved the highest applause and admiration  the plain dealer no     hic murus aheneus esto nil conscire sibi nulla pallescere culpa hor monday august         but thou shall flourish in immortal youth unhurt amidst the war of elements the wreck of matter and the crush of worlds add cato mr plain dealer i am an old man as you are and when i reflect on the fantastic vicissitude of human affairs when i consider the shortness of life and the small pretensions i have to any longer share in it it fills my mind with something grave solemn and i must own melancholy but when i give my thoughts a more unbounded scope and pass over that short intermission of life into the contemplation of an eternal being my mind recovers from that gloom which the first reflection filled me with and grows gay in proportion to the influence which this latter has upon it  i was last night reading that celebrated speech of cato whence i have taken the motto with which i head this letter and whether it was from the serious thoughts which that soliloquy inspired or the last strong glimpses of a mind almost expiring and habituated to such speculations i am not able to determine but i was no sooner fallen asleep than the following dream or rather vision grew into form and filled my fancy  methought the dreadful hour was come in which i was to resign this life my bed was surrounded by a silent company of weeping friends whose sorrows touched me more than my own approaching dissolution which happened in less time than human nature can conceive and therefore though at that period i felt it sensibly it is impossible i should now describe it i was no sooner freed from the encumbrance and obscurity of matter but my soul became refined to such an infinite degree of conception that my eyes having nothing to interrupt or confine their view were strengthened with such piercing beams that they darted every glance through an innumerable progression of worlds and illuminated me with a particular and perfect knowledge of the harmony and fabric of each extended system  whilst i was thus lost in contemplation for infinite spare like an endless source still afforded me new objects to nourish that inextinguishable thirst of knowledge which is the employment of eternal life i felt a heavenly transport which diffused itself swifter than thought through the frame of my new being and which at the same time it made my soul tremble with its influence invigorated and enabled it to support the energy  i now enjoyed perfect felicity and whilst my soul whose desire of knowledge increased in proportion with its power to gratify it employed each different sensation in pursuit of that branch which which was peculiar to its nature on a sudden i heard an universal crack which seemed to arise from the whole number of created worlds and resounded from globe to globe with a long continuance of reverberated uproars  at last the chain that linked them in that dependant order in which from the first moment of their creation they have perpetually been moving shivered of itself the loosened orbs thus disunited began to roll with an unconceivable swiftness through the vast expanse of space and met and shocked each other in the dark vacuity the sun now robbed of light whirled rapid and irregular the moon let loose her seas and rained a deluge in her falling the fixed stars that from the birth of time had kept their appointed stations no longer awed by the allpowerful word broke loose and rushed together prodigious was the sound and horrible the conflict the elements forgetting their respective qualities and urged by the immutable decree met all and mixed and lost themselves in ruinous confusion  when all seemed buried in profoundest darkness the wild uproar ceased at once and as i wondered at this sudden silence a pyramid of fire broke through that in a moment enwrappd the whole and having nothing left to prey upon at length devoured it self  thus was the end of all when from that inaccessible brightness where the divine presence conceals yet makes it self known a beam of day shot out which lighting up the infinite extent of heaven and rendering it transparent discovered all its glories i there perceived the stream of life which running through the midst of heaven quickened wherever it rolled and watering the tree of knowledge nourished it eternally next i saw numberless swarms of beings like myself that filled the vastness of infinitude and seemed lost like me in wonder praise and adoration i heard a voice which had more influence than the most perfect harmony of human art and communicated itself to all alike cry come eat of the tree of knowledge and drink of the water of life  immediately the angelick host and all the children of earth who by obedience to this command were become one and the same eat and drank as they were commanded the first effect of this that i found on myself and perceived in all the rest was a perfect recollection of whatever i had done since my first entering into life various were the consequences the ungrateful the murderer the miser the false friend and the rebel remembered with horror their past crimes and grew frantic at every thought with the consciousness of what they had merited they felt the severest pangs of that most lively of all torments despair but the just and those who had the least to reproach themselves with found yet they had too much to answer for when in the book of record which was thrown open to the view of all they perceived that the minutest of their thoughts were registered  now we all became sensible how easy the rule was by which we were to have lived and how adapted to the required obedience of human nature whilst we were thus lamenting our unhappy states and aggravating our misery by selfconviction in an instant we discovered a fiercer blaze of light and beheld the mystic veil drawn off that shrouded the almightys presence raised on a throne to which the brightness of the sun would have been dim the divine father of all things disclosed himself his countenance was mildly aweful paternal tenderness shone out in every feature of his face and discovered a concern for us which we knew proceeded from a divine idea that if he should be merciful he must be more than just  on his right hand sat the second person our known redeemer in him the beauty of the father was divinely manifested in him the glory of his power at once was softened and exerted behind him the fatal figure of that cross on which he suffered hung like a dreadful comet prognosticating the hour of judgment on the left was placed the third adorable person in the now no longer mystic union in him an equal mixture of the father and the son revealed itself uniting in his countenance the severest glory of the one with the most ineffable sweetness of the other  beneath and on the right of the worlds triumphant savior sat his twelve disciples their eyes were fixed on their great masters looks and seemed to borrow thence by reflection all their softness and their luster in equal stations on the left of the holy spirit appeared those ancient philosophers who through the dusk of superstition and idolatry by the light of reason and mere nature saw and taught one true eternal god and in defense of that belief had courage even to suffer martyrdom  whilst i contemplated this divine appearance i heard a voice which proceeding thence pierced the profoundest space of heaven proclaming that each should be his own judge and from the testimony of his own conscience acquit or condemn himself  immediately all the just and those whose consciences by due allowances for the frailties of human nature could acquit and encourage them advanced and with a modesty at once more humble and assured than any thing on earth asserted and made known their virtues and obedience to the divine commands concluding that though they had acquitted themselves and were entitled by the unalterable word to everlasting felicity yet could they not pretend to claim it till they had received the almighty sanction which they hoped for through the mediation the merits and the blood of his beloved son who died for mans redemption pardon and salvation after which they prostrated themselves before the throne and receiving diadems of glory were admitted as partakers of beatitude without end  i then heard the same voice repeat let each be his own judge and from the testimony of his own conseience acquit or condemn himself but far from seeing any more advance though still there were infinite numbers remaining i observed that they drew back reproaching each other beating their breasts and making such variety of lamentations that the violent noise awakened me in such a mixture of joy and horror that it will be long before my memory wears out the impression of so strong a vision which if it affects you enough to make you judge it worth publishing i shall have slept as i love to wake for the service or warning of others  i am sir your constant reader c d   the plain dealer no    obsequium amicos veritus odium parit  teren fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit moenia  virg nil agit exemplum litem quod lite resolvit  hor friday august         i was visited some days ago by several of my distinguished friends and on this occasion must particularly name the major and ned volatile in regard they were the principal persons concerned in that afternoons conversation which gave birth to this days paper  the discourse turned upon a subject to which a late unhappy rencounter furnished too many materials twas the dispute between two dear and inseparable friends which ended not but with the life of one of them the personal acquaintance that some of us had with one or both of the gentlemen continued our conversation longer and carried our reflections farther than we should else have allowed of at a time when we met to give and receive a mutual pleasure  the point of honor which is usually the foundation upon which these unhappy disputes are grounded was by the major beautifully explained and set in a just light opposite to the too generally mistaken notions of that noble qualification and which ned had too warmly debated till will weathercock diverted his pushing it to extremity by the seasonable interposition of his peculiar judgment wills decisions as the pagans painted their janus always appear with two faces which favor both parties and reconcile them in good humor nevertheless we could not leave the subject entirely without a progress of reflection upon the fatality of sudden startings and ungovernable passions which are too much indulged and but too little provided against by the generality of mankind  i remember twas agreed to that most of the ill blood debates and quarrels that happen owe their original to unconcern and carelessness about our humor in conversation a man must be master of himself and preserve a watchful guard over his behavior in company if he would either please or be pleased there is a natural liberty which all mankind claims by right but the mistaken use of it leads to mischief a licentious or rambling tongue proves as injurious to society as treason to a state and traitors smart no more frequently for this guilt than prattlers for that folly  ned volatile not yet quite cool broke in upon our chain of reasoning by asserting that a strict watch over ones words actions and humor in all companies is a restraint which in his opinion differed nothing from torture what said he must i be always under the slavery of thinking before i speak shall i never have the pleasure of expressing my own sentiments who would sacrifice his natural rights to please another man would any but a fool or flatterer praise what he hates or declare himself an enemy to what he loves merely to show his good humor or complaisance no gentlemen i maintain that grandeur itself would be too dear bought at this priee and whoever affirms the contrary is no friend to plaindealing  he paused here and looked at me for approbation i was going to distinguish and remark the circumstances that should be punctually regarded when the major begged to be heard the restraint said he that you represent so dreadful gives more satisfaction than pain your complaisance and good humor is more your own interest than your companions is it not for your own sake that you accommodate yourself to his humor from whom you hope good offices or expect agreeable enterainment do you take for dissimulation a guard of prudence which induces you to seem in the sentiments of a man whom you would willingly draw into yours when either your interest or inclination requires it for my part i think you have a right to applaud yourself when you can enter agreeably into opposite humors what induced all the anticents to admire the pliant conduct of alcibiades and why do we still wonder that a man could so aptly accommodate himself to the different manners of the several countries where he lived nothing was so much talked of at athens as his eloquence and gallantry among the persians he was always feasting and nothing was seen more splendid than his dress and equipage but he passed over to opposite manners when he was obliged to go to sparta for there the most rigid lacedemonian led a life less austere than alcibiades   alcibiades cried ned volatile was an affector of popularity his maxim was like that of a friend of mine cum fueris romae romano vivito more but hang it  i hate that suppleness of humor it may be necessary for ambassadors and travelers but ned volatile has nothing to do with it  he was proceeding in his usual volubility of speech when i interrupted him in the following manner  i am sorry my friend volatile would decry one of the blessings upon which the happiness of society is in a great measure founded the commerce of life requires our regard to variety of humors every day and when nature denies the mastery of them men should endeavor to acquire it who would not rejoice with a friend newly and happily married congratulate one just arrived from his travels or condole with another on the loss of an only and valuable son this is no suppleness no inequality of humor it is a sweetness it is a virtue tell me would not yourself in the presence of a gay prince devoted to his pleasures appear with a cheerful countenance or would you accost with a smiling air a cloudy and suspicious one no more is it fitting to carry a passion into company disagreeable to that which reigns in it or to discover a mien which condemns the sentiments wherewith the company is prepossessed in short nothing is more opposite to the maxims of civil society than an opinionative and dogmatical conduct and he who will obstinately follow it is in danger of never getting new friends and even of losing his old ones i wish i could say that these duels and deaths we have been speaking of are not its common consequences  i have heard and enter into your sentiments with pleasure said ned volatile but allow me at least to affirm that one who is thus master of his temper must never abuse this power never betray his sentiments in maintaining an error or in giving praises to words or actions that he is sensible do not deserve it  right answered i  how then said he or wherein do you appear master of your humor  when i submit it replied i to that of others or decline my own will to theirs to whom i would show a deference my words at least my silence should carry tokens of my complaisance as for example did one whom i would not displease commend an ill man not well known to him or who had wronged or disobliged me in such case i would stifle and conceal my resentment and be silent since i could not be of the same opinion with a person whom i was unwilling to offend  no no cried ned volatile if ever i subject my humor it shall be to the ladies there are many capricios that must be borne with from them but in all other cases my mind is my kingdom i am absolute and will be so  he ran on to this purpose near a quarter of an hour and at last happening to touch again on the article of honor and friendship which had introduced the subject of our discourse the major requested him to hear a story in which an example of both these valuable distinctions would better plead for their right use than any account he could give of his own particular sense of them the story said the major is modern but not well known and amongst all the instances of bravery is a fine and uncommon display of it it is what most fighters would think below them yet what none but a conqueror could come up to  altamont and honorius were both men of quality and of eminence in the army wherein they had served long in friendship together altamont was deservedly placed in the full height of power and preferment honorius inferior but a small degree in post was greatly so in fortune but he was filled with princely virtues and his soul had a distinguished greatness he had been a sharer in the whole course of altamonts innumerable glories  honorius on some afteroccasion whether as supposed by altamonts breach of promise or what other ground for resentment happened is neither known nor material to be debated it is sufficient to tell you that honorius was so disobliged that he sent altamont a challenge to determine their difference in a duel at a time appointed in hydepark  at the time in which altamont received this challenge he was so deeply engaged in a trust whereon depended the preservation of the kings person and government that he could not sacrifice or neglect them by risquing his important life in a personal quarrel at that juncture but knowing well the honor and bravery of honorius and jealous too of his own he sent for carolinus early that morning in which he was to fight   brother said he you know how much of the weight of government lies at this time upon my shoulders and there are some secret concerns of state to which you are yet a stranger i am called upon to a duel it concerns a case of honor and my adversary is a man of bravery you must meet him in my stead and give him the satisfaction he requires  carolinus resolved to act in his brothers cause as in his own without delay went to meet his unknown opponent but when he arrived at the destined spot he was confounded to see him the dearest friend he had upon earth good god said honorius to what am i fated i expected your brother and is it you my carolinus it is replied carolinus with a sigh they gazed on each other their breasts were agitated by a tempest of warring passions  after a length of silent confusion honorius thus addressed himself to carolinus  you are that very friend i ever called and thought you you are the man who have so often vowed the most sincere and exalted friendship for me i am replied carolinus and i bring with me the same devoted heart a sacrifice to your disposal if you survive you will know my innocence and the cause why i am here which weighty reasons forbid the discovery of at present but come  since it must be thus  they both advanced and in that instant honorius cried hold my carolinus it is done the struggle of my soul is over and our dispute at an end i am determined i will not i cannot break the chain that has bound our souls so long together no not for your brothers power or my princes crown  they continued some time in disorder and expostulation both of them were brave sovereignly brave and none ever lived who better knew what honor was or could defend it more nobly  honorius went on  well my friend till now i never felt extremity your brother who has done me wrong ought to give me satisfaction and were he here i could not sheath my sword unsatisfied but you are my friend with whom i can have no difference i would die a thousand deaths to save or to serve you and i will put the greatest force upon my nature and even ask pardon of the man who has injured me rather than hazard a life so much more precious than my own but let us leave this place with speed i will give up my resentment let your brother let the world treat my conduct at their pleasure there is nothing but my hopes of heaven that i would not hazard for my carolinus  he went and did as he said and whatever constructions the world might put upon altamonts behavior and honoriuss condeseension a noble example was here given of the most generous and exalted friendship and of that absolute selfconquest which solomon the wisest of all men prefers to the conquering of a city  the plain dealer no    scribere jussit amor  ovid monday august         i dedicate this paper to the ladies for i design it as a lesson of love which a certain perverse foreigner will have to be no more than a phantom because says he like an apparition every body has heard of but nobody has seen it  it is much easier indeed to love than to explain what love is for it is one among the paradoxes of that ungovernable passion that it strikes the tongue dumb but makes every other part of the body eloquent  the major to please ned volatile has indulged him the perusal of that picture of love from which he recited the verses in my xxxivth paper  i had the misfortune to be present and to hear him read it over i call it a misfortune because my passion for that wild insensible my coquet who is rambled away to tunbridge was half suppressed before for want of occasion to inflame it but has rekindled itself at the fire which it caught from this unlucky picture and i now bleed afresh like a dead body at the touch of its murderer  yet why do i complain that i am sensible of a generous passion which to lay aside the pride of wisdom and the formality of age and gravity he who is insensible of is stupid  the philosopher defined love prettily when he said it was a circle returning through happiness to happiness from happiness the emblem was ingenious and the lovers ring is a proper and significant allusion to it  i am so far when i think seriously from being ashamed to be called a lover that i am sincerely of opinion that whoever has not loved has put his virtues to no trial  love is the breeze of life a healthful and refreshing gale which by its agitation of the spirits keeps our faculties in lively motion so as neither to stagnate in unfruitful rest nor drive tempestuously with the most stormy passions  the heart of a lover is impressed with sweetness and humanity his soul receives extension beyond its natural power and is as much more refined than a selfish common soul as that soul which it so excels is above the body it belongs to  there is something in love that is stronger than calamity and more gentle than pity serener than silence more splendid than riches and statelier than honor more trembling than fear and more charming than pleasure it is even more powerful than conscience for whom we love we imagine always present and passing judgment on our most secret purposes we regulate them therefore according to our apprehension of what she would approve or condemn and so supply ourselves with a constant vigilance and propensity to noble actions  in some sense he who loves may be said to be like a god for he has but one care and that a great and a heavenly one he is wholly intent upon beneficence  he has the prophets sacred privilege to be rappd out of himself to enjoy perpetual ecstacy to be emptied of his own soul that he may be animated by one more dear to him  our ideas of the joys of heaven can represent them no other than that we are there to love and to be beloved and they who love here on earth are above the world while they are in it nor can death disunite lovers so entirely as it does other people since love dies not with the object loved she lives so tenaciously in our charmed and retentive memory that her death seems no more than a long and lamented absence rather indearing than defacing her image  so that this is the only difference which death seems capable of making when he interposes between lovers  while both lived their two bodies had no more than one soul and now one is dead their two souls hove no more than one body  neither has age that alters all things a power to deface our love for whom we love can never seem old our remembrance presents her beauty everlastingly in its spring and her idea is retained inchantingly in the very attitude which first she struck us by  the restless but unwearied lover seeks for himself out of himself let him gaze touch listen and be blessed for ever yet still he longs and is unsatisfied  there is a dropsy in his mind and his thirst augments with drinking  his soul is either not at home or in a starting and impatient posture  if he presses his charmers hand it darts with violence into his fingers if he leans at her loved side it beats against his breast as if it would break its prison to be nearer her when she speaks it is in his ear when he looks on her it is in his eye but he has no soul at all when she is absent  absent from her in whom alone we live life grows a bankrupt and no bliss can give friends are importunate and pleasures lost what once most charmed us now disgusts us most fretful to silent solitudes we run and men and light and noisy converse shun pensive in woods on rivers sides we walk and to the unlistning winds and waters talk how next we shall approach her pleased we weigh and think in transport all we mean to say tenderly bowing thus will we complain thus court her pity and thus plead our pain thus sigh for fancied frowns if frowns should rise and thus meet favors in her softning eyes restless on paper we our vows repeat and pour our souls out on the lettered sheet write blot restore and in lost pieces rend the mute entreaters yet too faint to send unblessed when no admission we procure it is heaven at distance to discern her door or to her window we by night repair and let loose fancy to be feasted there watch her loved shadow as it glances by and to imagined motions chain our eye has she some field or grove or garden blessed pleased we retread the paths her feet have pressed near her by chance at visits or at plays our rushing spirits crowd in speaking gaze light on her varied airs our eye balls ride dark as the dead to the full world beside lovers converse like angels by a kind of intuition they hear one anothers souls and prevent each others wishes  like divinities quitting their shrines they disrobe themselves of their bodies and intermingle their meeting minds as we see two lights incorporate  their souls glide out from their eyes to snatch embraces at a distance and return enriched with the fancied treasure  there is more harmony in love than in music a harmony like that which the old philosophers imputed to the spheres only two spheres are acted by one and the same intelligence for the strings of two hearts sympathize like those of two lutes with correspondent trepidations  how mistaken are they who call love an idle passion  thought itself is scarce more active there is an unsatisfied and continual thirst in the appetite of a lover a constant spring in his delights and torments he pursues his discoveries with a restless and impatient vigor and though like the shining heavenly bodies he is everlastingly in motion yet he is so far from becoming weary that he is rather refreshed by his labor  i will copy yet farther from the picture abomentioned the following group or assembly of the symptoms moles and tokens of this passion  it is upon the lovers first approach to his mistresss person we recover slowly from our sweet surprise says this doctor of cupids college and advancing with a blushful tenderness bowing we kneel and her given hand is pressed with sweet compulsion to our beating breast over it in ecstacy our lips bend low and tides of sighs twixt her grasped fingers flow high beats the hurried pulse at each forced kiss and every burning sinew aches with bliss life in a souly deluge rushes over and the charmed heart springs out at every pore the first fierce raptures of amazement past confusion quits us and desire grows fast we sit and while her gazed at wonders rise a humid brightness fills our sparkling eyes modest disquiet every action wears and each long look the mark of passion bears disordered nature no cold medium keeps transport now reigns and dull reflection sleeps all that we wish or feel or act or say is above thought and out of reasons way joy murmurs anger laughs and hope looks sad rashness grows prudent and discretion mad restless we feel our amorous bosom burn now this way look we and now that way turn now in sweet swell of thought our lifted eyes lose their low languor and attempt to rise now sinking suppliant seek the charmers feet and court wished pity in their glanced retreat often in full gaze they dwell upon her face then start astonished from some dazzling grace now in bold liberty fly out unbid now awed scape inward twixt the closing lid if we dare speak and would our wish pursue the words fall feathry like descending dew the softening accents even in uttrance die and the tongues sweetness here outcharms the eye till mingled sighs our fainting voice confound but lovers meanings speak though robbed of sound   i am fond of thinking we might draw from love a proof of the souls immortality what else mean our desires when they extend themselves beyond the utmost that willing nature can indulge us in  why else are the joys of love mixed with melancholy and unsatisfied tremblings  they increase indeed and refine the pleasure but they convince us that there is a union more adapted to our minds free essence and which bodies are not fine enough to permit them the enjoyment of  hence that exquisite expansion that liquefaction of the heart when it refuses to allow us the possession of our dearest wish in the very moment we become masters of it the subtle workings of this exalted passion upon the refinements of our mind have deified the beloved object till we faint with awe when we should receive her tenderness and by a fantastical kind of envy consider ourselves as our own rivals  the supremest joy of love must if men will have it so be called bodily but all that heightens it to be worth the wish of a wise man it must be indebted to the mind for  whence could images so warm as these which follow receive a purity in their expression that adapts them to the chastest ear if the minds part were not strongest even where the body pretends most influence  is there no more oh yet the last remains crown of our conquest sweetner of our pains there is a time when love no wish denies and smiling nature throws off all disguise but who can words to speak those raptures find vast sea of ecstacy that drowns the mind that fierce transfusion of exchanging hearts that gliding glimpse of heaven in pulsive starts that veiny rush that warm tumultuous roll that fire that kindles bodies into soul and on lifes margin strains delight so high that sense breaks short  and while we taste we die but i am going i know not whither the painter of this picture has bewitched me from my purpose which was to have entered upon a philosophical dissertation concerning the qualities of love instead of which i am rambling into a natural one upon the effects of it  the plain dealer no     parts speculamur in omnes claud friday august         in my xxxvith paper i published some remarks on an excellent old ballad called william and margaret i was charmed with the strength and beauties of its masculine simplicity and really took it to be what it appeared the work of some old poet long since dead but i have been agreeably undeceived the author of it is alive and a northbriton i congratulate his country on the promise of this rising genius for the gentleman it seems is very young and received his education in the university of edinburgh  among many fine qualities which adorn him he is so unconscious of his own merit or possesses it with so sincere a modesty that he declines being publicly named but as he has obliged me with a letter containing the short history of an unhappy accident which gave occasion to his ballad it will be an agreeable entertainment if i publish it as the author sent it me  sir your plain dealer of july the   th was sent to me by a friend i must own after i had read it over i was both surpised and pleased to find that a simple tale of my writing had merited the notice and approbation of the author of the plain dealer  after what you have said of william and margaret i flatter myself that you will not be displeased with an account of the accident which gave birth to that ballad  your conjecture that it was founded on the real history of an unhappy woman is true  a vain young gentleman had for some time professed love to a lady then in the spring of her life and beauty he dressed well talked loud and spoke nonsense with spirit she had good understanding but was too young to know the world i have seen her very often there was a lively innocence in her look she had never been addressed to by a man of sense and therefore knew not how despicable and unsincere a fool is in time he persuaded her that there was merit in his passion  she believed him and was undone  she was upon the point of bringing into the world the effect of her illplacd love before her father knew the misfortune judge the sentiments of the good old man yet his affection outweighed his anger he could not think of abandoning his child to want and infamy he applied himself to her false lover with an offer of half his fortune but the temper of the betrayer was savagd with cruel insolence he rejected the fathers offers and reproached the innocence he had ruined with the bitterness of open scorn the news was brought her when in a weak condition and cast her into a fever and in a few days after i saw her and her child laid in one grave together  it was some time after this that i chanced to look into a comedy of fletchers called the knight of the burning pestle the place i fell upon was where old merrythought repeats these verses when it was grown to dark midnight and all were fast asleep in came margarets grimly ghost and stood at williams feet   which i fancy was the beginning of some ballad commonly known at the time when this author wrote  these lines naked of ornament and simple as they are struck my fancy i closed the book and bethought myself that the unhappy adventure i have mentioned above which then came fresh into my mind might naturally raise a tale upon the appearance of this ghost  it was then midnight all round me was still and quiet these concurring circumstances worked my soul to a powerful melancholy i could not sleep and at that time i finished my little poem such as you see it here if it continues still to deserve your approbation i have my aim and am  sir your most obliged and most humble servant etc   it does most justly continue to deserve and will for ever deserve not only approbation but the applause of all true judges of wit and nature the authors copy which he enclosed to me is different in several places from that which fell into my hands but the sense of both is exactly the same and the variation in some expressions not considerable enough to make it necessary to republish that excellent ballad  having this occasion to speak of scotland i judge it the properest place to insert my acknowledgment of a letter from edinburgh signed fergus bruce i take this name to be fictitious but whoever the writer is i am pleased with his proposed correspondence which will open a new scene of intelligence to the expectation of my readers as they may see by the following extract of the letter itself which is writ with the politeness of a gentleman and in the style of a man of learning  edinburgh the   th of july      sir the first plain dealer that came to my hand was that wherein you represent in true colors the character and conduct of the present emperor of russia with regard to his son prince alexei  my fancy was charmed and my judgment entirely satisfied with the account you gave our coffeehouses take in your papers and i observe with pleasure the welcome which our politest people receive them with not the men alone of all ranks but the ladies also make them their entertainment the general conversation of both sexes turns on the matter you afford  i cannot help writing to you that i may let you know your influence it must be a pleasure to your generous soul to be conscious of the extent and power of its beneficence and i should be wanting in my duty to the man who gives me weekly delight and instruction if i concealed from him what might any way contribute to his satisfaction  i will presume if you please to send you nowandthen my reflections upon the matter which the beaux and belles of this city may furnish for a plaindealer something happens here every day not unworthy public notice and there are a thousand things that fall naturally under your cognizance that neither the king the parliament the pulpit or the bench have any thing to do with perhaps too it would be of use to our gentry at edinburgh to know you have a spy here upon their conduct pray tell them so and depend on the most watchful fidelity of  sir your sincere friend and most humble servant fergus bruce   i cannot forbear confessing that i shall expect with a very sensible pleasure the event of this northern correspondence for i have retained from my infancy a kind of affectionate partiality for the generous bravery and gallant plainness of our brothers beyond tweed when i traveled in my youth i scarce ever saw a court even in the remotest parts of the civilized world where some gentleman or other a scot by birth or descent was not one of its noblest ornaments and now since the muses and the graces have very visibly from the beginning of the present century fixed and seated themselves in their learned seminaries their rising youth of both sexes seem to vie with one another in a warm and generous emulation which shall most adorn their own or soonest match the elegance of other even the politest nations  not the gentlemen alone but the very ladies of edinburgh form themselves into select and voluntary societies for the improvement of their knowledge instead of the entertainment of their fancy and go on at the same time to refine their conversation enrich their understanding and polish and render amiable their personal deportment  i shall in the course of my observations take occasion to demonstrate the truth of this remark by a variety of particulars which while they are doing justice to the north will contribute in no small degree to the pleasure of the south part of this kingdom at present i shall produce but two instances and the first is a society of young gentlemen most if not all of them students in the university of edinburgh who from a sympathy of affections foundded on a similitude of parts and genius have united themselves into a body under title of the grotesque club the reason of which name i shall explain in a future paper their business to express it in the words of one of their own members is a friendship that knows no strife but that of a generous emulation to excel in virtue learning and politeness  to how surprising a degree these fine spirits have succeeded in their noble end let the following sentiments declare conceived and expressed with all the clearness depth and strength of an experienced philosopher by a member of this grotesque club who was in his fourteenth year only when he composed in blank verse a poem now in my hands and founded on a supposition of the authors sitting a whole summer night in a garden looking upward and quite losing himself in contemplation on the works and wonders of almighty power  if this was a subject naturally above the capacity of so very a boy to what a degree does it increase our wonder when we find it treated in this masterly manner  now i surveyed my native faculties and traced my actions to their teeming source now i explored the universal frame gazed nature through and with interior light conversed with angels and unbodyd saints that tread the courts of the eternal king gladly i would declare in lofty strains the power of godhead to the sons of men but thought is lost in its immensity imagination wastes its strength in vain and fancy tires and turns within itself struck with thamazing depths of deity  ah my loved god in vain a tender youth unskilled in arts of deep philosophy attempts to search the bulky mass of matter to trace the rules of motion and pursue the phantom time too subtle for his grasp yet may i from thy most apparent works form some idea of their wondrous author and celebrate thy praise with rapturous mind how can i gaze upon yon sparkling vault and view the planets rolling in their spheres yet be an atheist  can i see those stars and think of others far beyond my ken yet want conviction of creating power what but a being of immense perfection could through unbounded spaces thus dispose suth numerous bodies all presumptive worlds the undesigning hand of giddy chance could never fill with globes so vast so bright that lofty conclave  where shall i trace the sources of the light what seats assign to the element of fire that unconfined through all the systems breaks here could i lie in contemplation wrapped and pass with pleasure an eternal age but it is too much for my weak mind to know teach me with humble reverence to adore the mysteries i must not comprehend let this prodigious young man bear the blame of my not having left myself room in this paper to pay that respect which i intended to the fair intellectuals a club of ladies at edinburgh who set a pattern to female excellence and whose history rules and constitutions i have the pleasure to see before me with the conventual address of mistress speaker to the lovely sisterhood and the admissory speech of one of the ladies as set forth by the able pen of mistress secretary  i shall say more on a future occasion of the honor done to the whole sex by the dangerous ambition of these ladies and of the political necessity which i conceive there will soon be of putting a stop to the progress of such unlimitted improvement of a power already too exorbitant  the plain dealer no     veniunt a dote sagittae juv monday august         i have endeavored to show in a former paper that parents are highly to blame when they force their children to marry for the sake of a fortune which can never repair the least of those innumerable mischiefs that are inseparably annexed to it using authority in such a case turns the most indulgent of fathers into an insupportable tyrant who by one inconsiderate decree that is irreversible dooms his own child to the most doleful imprisonment for life the following epistle gives us so sad but so lively a representation of this truth that i insert it for the sake of those who might possibly be betrayed in their conduct to give the same fatal proofs of their affection to their offspring that seem to edge all the sufferings of our present complainant  sir i am a young man about three and twenty that much against my will have complied with the incessant importunities of my friends or rather obeyed the absolute commands of an indulgent father and a fond mother in marrying a very rich maid of about thirty six who it seems is only mine because several suitors of equal pretensions in wealth with herself that liked her person left her as soon as they had conversed with her sufficiently to sound her temper  before i married her i enjoyed health and good humor and thought my fortune good enough as it was and abundantly sufficient with a female companion that brought the like ingredients toward it to make life tolerably happy  she has not been my wife quite a year and yet has managed her time so well that she has robbed me of all my quiet the natural gayety of my disposition is sowrd almost enough to make me think of growing her torturer as she is mine the floridness of health has left me and i am overcome by an inward pining that wastes me outwardly in fine she has convinced me that a man may be emphatically poor in the affluence of wealth and truly and properly said to want amidst the abundance of all things  i have industriously studied to show gratitude and true friendship for i really had an intention to render myself as agreeable as possible and the more because during the time of our modish courtship she had told those from whom i should hear it again that she liked me by this habitual art of tenderness i almost brought it to be natural and began to deceive myself into an opinion that i should not be incapable of even loving her at last she in return began after a manner then perfectly unaccountable to do every thing not only that she thought would disoblige me but that she knew would be a sincere affliction to me i find since i am taken by way of showing she could have her man and i am the subject of her revenge because she lost the person she had a liking to  she is a woman of a strong but mischievous understanding and letting it be guided by what it should correct her humor which is my inveterate enemy she can be as poignantly cruel to me as she pleases she lets me know by broad hints that she sees what would delight me but is blind like a jew out of hardness of heart if i ask how i may oblige her she is dumb but if i drop an ambiguous word that may be tortured into a malignant construction she can use her tongue like a larum  if i explain the simplicity of my meaning and beg pardon for want of caution in expressing myself her ears are shut and she is like the deaf adder the comparison is true beyond the deafness she is like it in my bosom she stings like it she poisons like it only with this difference that her poison is of an italian kind it lengthens out torment and kills at distance of years after a painful confinement  in my fathers presence this fair hypocrite is never dumb but ever eloquent in my praise  such a husband and such a wife we are the happiest couple  then she calls often upon me with an air of friendship to be merry under the effects of the melancholy she causes her eyes her ears her tongue her hands seem all too little to oblige me  the old gentleman doats on her  i help to carry on the farce it would be tragedy if he knew otherwise  he blesses his stars and very comfortably puts me in mind how much i possess the joy he wished me  what is to be done with this riddle of a woman so much in her senses and out of them as she pleases what prospect can i have of happiness but from her death whom by my public vow and hardtuggd virtue i am obliged to support in sickness  i would never have complained but that i hope it may be a proper caution and serve for the preservations of others i am pleased that i never discovered these grievances because had i complained every time i had occasion i should have been ashamed to complain any longer and she would have appeared as irreprehensible as an angel thus i have a fortune which has been the purchase of misery to make me rich my relations have made me wretched and for my part i have nothing to hope but that long patience and sufferings may make me insensible  i am sir your most humble servant a z   to what a multitude of sorrows is this genteel complainer betrayed the first considerations that ought to precede a matrimonial choice are the piety education person and liking of both parties indeed a competent fortune is a material consideration to be weighed together with the others but never separately from them of this pliny the politest gentleman as well as finest writer of his age has given us a satisfactory account in two of his epistles which i am glad for the benefit of the laladies to find published in two volumes in in eaglish in one he shows us his judgment in choosing a husband for a friends relation in the other the happy effects of a judicious choice in the person of his own wife  to junius mauritius on choosing a husband for his relation the particular opinion you have of my choice of a husband for your brothers daughter is very obliging you well know how much i loved and esteemed that great man with what advice he cherished my youth and by his own commendation gave me the credit of being thought praiseworthy you could have injoined me nothing of greater consequence or more agreeable nor any thing i would undertake with more honor than to choose a man fit to continue the family of arulenus rusticus which indeed might prove a work of time did not minucius acilianus luckily present who as young men do each other for he is some years younger loves me intimately yet treats me with a respect due to age he is pleased to be formed and instructed by me as i used to be by you his country is bresica of that part of our italy that does yet retain and keeps up much of the ancient modesty frugality and even rusticity his father minucius macrinus eminent in the equestrian order for he aimed no higher being chose by vespasian into the praetorian with great constancy preferred an honest ease to this our ambition shall i call it or honor his grandmother of the mothers side is serana procula of padua you are acquainted with the manners of the place yet serana is to the patavins an example of strict virtue his uncle p acilius is a man of singular discretion prudence and honesty in truth you will meet with nothing in the whole family less agreeable than in your own acilianus himself has a great deal of vigor and industry accompanied with the utmost modesty and having already discharged the offices of questor tribune and praetor with abundance of credit yet he has referred it to you to make his court for him he has a comely face a sanguine complexion his whole person gentlemanlike with a becoming gravity in his mein things i think not to be disregarded but due to the merit of a virtuous woman i am in doubt whether i need take notice of the large estate of his father for when i consider you for whom we propose a soninlaw i think i need not when i reflect on the common custom and even the laws of the city which principally have regard to the fortunes of men that seems by no means to be omitted and to one that thinks of posterity this in the making of a match is not the least material consideration perhaps you will think i have indulged too much the love of my friend in this account but i will stake my credit you shall find every thing exceed my description i love the young man indeed most ardently as he deserves but it is the duty of friendship to be moderate in commendation   to hispulla his wifes aunt as i remember that great affection which was between you and your excellent brother and know you love his daughter as your own so as not only to express the tenderness of the best of aunts but even supply that of the best of fathers i am sure it will be a pleasure to you to hear that she proves worthy of her father worthy of you and of your and her ancestors her ingenuity is admirable her frugality extraordinary she loves me the surest pledge of her virtue and adds to this a wonderful disposition to learning which she has acquired from her affection to me she reads my writings studies them and even gets them by heart you would smile to see the concern she is in when i have a cause to plead and the joy she shows when it is over she finds means to have the first news brought her of the success i meet with in court how i am heard and what decree is made if i recite any thing in public she cannot refrain from placing herself privately in some corner to hear where with the utmost delight she feasts on my applauses sometimes she sings my verses and accompanies them with the lute without any master except love the best of instructors from these instances i take the most certain omens of our perpetual and increasing happiness since her affection is not founded on my youth and person which must gradually decay but she is in love with the immutable part of me my glory and reputation nor indeed could be less expected from one who had the happiness to receive her education from you who in your house was accustomed to every thing that was virtuous and decent and even began to love me by your recommendation for as you had always the greatest respect for my mother you were pleased from my infancy to form me to commend me and kindly to presage i should be one day what my wife fancies i am accept therefore our united thanks mine that you have bestowed her on me and hers that you have given me to her as a mutual grant of joy and felicity   the plain dealer no     quod nequeo monstrare and sentio tantum juven friday september        detractors may be said to lead their lives in a habit of most injurious falsehood toward good men and of the most offensive impiety to heaven persons of this itching and abandoned appetite may if we consider the numerous mischiefs they do to human society be compared to the most ravenous beasts of prey with this difference that as beasts of prey do good sometimes in worrying one another these on the contrary will not fall upon or devour any thing but what is excellent  wit wisdom beauty good humor modesty valor integrity in fine all the virtues and all the graces which can illustrate any person of either sex are as so many tempting spoils to the savage slanderer and strong provocatives to detraction there is scarce a man living that has many little infamous srories more than ordinary privately handed about wirh great industry from one to another in order to depreciate his character in the world but what will be found upon a close examination to have merited public applause for some noble action or other examine still farther and it will as certainly be found that that noble action was the very source of a secret envy and a private hatred which broke out in a hundred whispered traditions till it spread and enlarged itself into public defamation  the most unhappy circumstances which attend the illustrious sufferers in this way i reckon to be these that as persons who seek after fame the most eagerly do for the most part very plentifully deserve it so they are the most frequently interrupted in the search and the least able to bear the trouble of such unwelcome interruptions no men are more ideally fond of glory than such as most substantially deserve it this is a pleasant weakness but then no men have a quicker sensibility of unjust reproaches than those who take care never to deserve them and this is a sore frailty which opens through the bosoms of the generous and the innocent a way to a thousand unnecessary heartachs it is pity it should be so much in the power of calumny as experience shows it is to strike a damp upon the most generous spirits and throw a load over an aspiring mind that is upon the stretch after glory but what seems at present the most of all to be regretted is that by the frequent complaints i have lately received this vice is as prevailing as it is insupportable  i have a letter from a gentleman containing a very lively description of a lady whose charms have been so long drowned in tears that they are almost worn out and carried away by the wasting tide of her sorrow which she hides but cannot stop  he proceeds to tell me that upon inquiry into the source of this mighty woe he finds it arose from two or three ambiguous and broken sentences glancing at her virtue and conversation artfully dropped by a malicious woman in the ear of a youth of a jealous disposition who loved her whom she loved who was contracted to her and departed from her on this account  what signifies talking to her of her innocence and telling her that no mortal living credits it but that one jealous young man  alas it is only his not believing it that must pour comfort upon her affliction  till then she must remain as inconsolable as she is innocent  my correspondent goes on to say that he had the curiosity to go and see this detractress he found her as he tells me old wrinkled ugly her visage of a pale just turning black as with a mortification her conscience he takes to be much of a complexion with her face for when he charged her with it she owned it as some trifling mistake then drawing her mouth into a scornful smile to contradict her words cries out that she did not mean it as it was taken  when the fatal consequences were pressed upon her  she said she was sorry but expressed her grief so very unconcernedly desiring to be troubled no more about it since it was not actionable that she might have sat for the picture of envys look when she has just stolen from doing one of her most precious mischiefs   this correspondent of mine justly moved with his own relation concludes his letter with warm expostulations  shall guilt sin thus and shall innocence look pale for it is there no redress  yes there is  others who are out of the question may and ought to rise up in the defense of innocence  let the plain dealer says he whenever any scandal is traced to the fountainhead but mark the quarters of the detractors as crosses in the time of the pestilence are placed upon the doors of the deceased and that method will effectually strike the tongue of detraction dumb  another account has been lately transmitted to me concerning a young gentleman who is said to have numerous good qualities and has been divided from the estimation of his friend by the as constant as false insinuations of a worse than once perjured woman who insists that the young gentleman betrayed his friends liberty for a bribe  the contrary has been made out and attested to her face  she continues behind his back to load him with the calumny  finding since she began her evil reports that they would not take without putting on an air of charity and sanctity she now concludes her story to srrangers thus   he meaning the person she aims to scandalize is generally allowed to be a good man an honest man  pretty generally indeed  but what is there to be said for accidents in this world  there is nothing wonderful  nothing new under the sun  i have so often occasion to wonder that i am resolved never to let any thing for the future surprise me into a fit of admiration  he is no lover of money  that is certain as some say  but say they what they will there is such a prevalence in bribes no one knows his own strength till he be tried  there is no trusting any body  i would not have believed it of him if everybody had not said it but what everybody says must be true   here my correspondent says he asked the detractress how everybody came to know it and she immediately boasted that she was the discoverer of it to all who heard it at first hand to what continues he may we properly liken such a dangerous creature as this is who puts out false colors that she may come up safe and rob virtue unsuspected she can be compared to nothing that resembles her so nearly as a witch in one of those fatal operations where murder is the consequence of her incantations the detractress molds her descriptions as the witch does her waxen images when the witch has made an end of her image the bewitched body perishes and where the detractress ends any of her descriptions she makes an injured reputation die  i have other accounts of the like sort to all which i shall give an answer in a future paper when i shall explain my self at large upon this head  the plain dealer no     hae nugae seria ducunt in mala derisum semel exceptrumque sinistre hor monday september        the entertainment of this day shall be furnished by my restoring to my correspondents in this public manner what they were so kind to lend me privately for that purpose  sir i have been married about two years to a young woman that is every way agreeable to my temper but only she is given to be a little too superstitious the truth is she was determined in her choice of me by the prediction of a fortune tellers without thinking myself more obliged to him than in good reason i should i may safely say without superstition that i shall like him for having caused my good fortune by foretelling it the longest day i have to live she would be the bestnaturd creature in the world if her mind was not haunted by spirits stories of which take up most of her conversation by day and make her waken me a nights very frequently i laughed at these little tales at first but not being able to get her out of them i indulged her in the relating them which she has continued to do so prettily that though i know according to right reason i ought not to be terrified i am brought to tremble at the tumbling of a saltseller  if my wife could be once cured i am sure i should be well soon after  she has been for these three months last counting our hours by a deathwatch and has made me almost sick with fear that she who so often speaks of her death should die in good earnest  this splenetick cast of her temper having an effect on me who sympathize with her in every thing throws a gloom over our hours which would otherwise pass as delightfully as any couples upon earth  pray give her some better reasons than i am able to instill into her to fortify her mind against these little surprises of superstition and you will make her the best wife in the world who studies to be and is easy to me in every case but this that she is uneasy to her ownself  your most humble servant mark docile   mr plain dealer you have pretended to give laws about peoples behavior in marriage and there is no such thing in nature to be done i am a man of the best humor in the world or otherwise i could not please my wife by appearing to be the worst if i am not angry half a dozen times a day she will be out of humor and not speak to me i found out her delight and have got many a sweet kiss for what in another couple would have gone near to have caused a divorce she uses a hundred plots to put me out of humor all which increases my good nature so much knowing that poor molly falls out for nothing but to make friends that i sometimes find it hard to be pleased to be angry with her i am perhaps the merriest man of a passionate one that was ever known and my wife the most contented of all sufferers i should weary your patience if i was to tell you the different stratagems by which she almost tires out my good humor to make me exert it in trying her patience my shoemaker has a wife as like her as two lasts but she is more violent in her cravings insomuch that he is forced to proceed from sound to substance  he says she never is a kinder bedfellow than when she has induced him to do her the kindness to bang her into bed he adds that he has bound her to him in all kindness by laying his strap over her shoulders almost every day she lives if he miss it some days together the poor thing cries and thinks herself neglected you see what happiness there is in matrimony and that there are other rules for behavior between husband and wife besides those of your teaching  yours bob merrythought   sir you lately gave us so lively a description of the races at newmarket that i cannot but wish you would exert your woodenhorse as men of your age commonly call their oakensticks and take a journey from your watchtower of barbican to exchange alley you will find that the citizens who have been a long time injuriously misrepresented as a plodding generation of people have as brisk imaginations in their way as any of the quickest wits that inhabit the temple or any courtly part of the town beyond the bar their fancies run upon wheels but they are substantial ones and since the lottery has been set up they all seem to turn upon that great and important one of fortune they are so clever in their devices that they have formed several streets into courses and fixed a convenient market just at hand where a man may purchase a racer at any hour of the day to try his luck upon and scower away into a large estate between sun and sun in fine the scene of newmarket is shifted to london and smithfield translated into exchangealley as ill a figure as the top citizens have been said to make on horseback with all their pageants about them on a lordmayors day yet to do them justice now they are become serious in horsemanship and have turned play into a trade you cannot imagine what expert jockies they make our newspapers have lately diverted us with strange accounts of slow beasts called asses that have been brought up to be very nimble and of cows turned into gallopers for the sport of our ingenious brethren that have running heads in the country we have very far overmatchd them in town for we have exchange bears and exchange bulls that will mount a titt as cleverly as if they were born to it they will purchase you a nag for three half crowns and count him but a mere jade if he wins the rider less than a thousand pounds guildhall is the goal they run to and if one of your cityracers comes in at the nick as we call it for we run the twelve hours by lucky minutes two boys hold up their hands and bid the man that has run the course be happy all his life after i dont doubt but when bartholomew fair was put to so early a period you deplored the accident because lasting a little longer the odd mirth of the people that frequented it would have furnished you with materials without going far from your neighborhood but this bull and bear fair in the city will be of long continuance and make you ample amends if you will but come and see it when i see the wheel go round and the racers are by at the twirling of it my imagination represents it to me like the flying chariots and machines for young travelers in smithfield in which methinks i see an apprentice seated over the head of a commoncouncilman a suburbhabardasher of small wares mounted three stories higher in fortune than a grave alderman with a gold chain about his neck and a semstress more lofty than a lady mayoress but i am giving you a description which i had rather you should come and take i dare say it will make as diverting a paper at least as the list of the lottery tickets and you need not desire a better prize than to have yours read by equal numbers with equal curiosity desire and circumspection i am of the mule kind in trade and sometimes bellow in the alley like a bud upon the fall and sometimes dance like a bear upon the rise of the stocks you shall be welcome to take a secure stand in in my den from whence you may see all the diversion you will be presently directed to it if you ask any one out of the many thousands of city jockies that you will see there for  your very humble servant ursa major from my den near the popes head in cornhill sept   ps a vintner had but one leg of a horse which whole horse cost but three half crowns and won five hundred pounds to his share by that leg pray come and see the sport and you will say that as old as you are you never saw the like since you was born nor do i think except the time of the south sea there was ever such merry trading in the memory of man if you continue to like mrs patty amble bring her with you i must put her in a way of making a properer wife for you by teaching her how to mend her paces and her fortune together both which you may remember you left in a desperate way at that place which you described in a most delightful and instructive paper of yours by the name of mendallmarket     the plain dealer no  0 dignum laud virum musa vetat mori hor virtus repulsae nescia sordidae intaminatis fulget honoribus nec sumet aut ponit secures arbitrio popularis aurae ibid friday september         the estimation of public actions seems to me to be unjustly calculated men derive the quality of actions from that of the actor would it not be more just to measure the actor by the action the ancients considered the degrees of superiority to consist in those of merit and virtue pliny has distinguished himself by remarks on this head in his admirable epistles and though he was at the head of the nobles as well as the wits of his age he thought it not below him to pay acknowledgments nay refined compliments to the merit of persons in low life but took a worthy pride in raising them from the obscurity annexed to that condition by a comparison with the highest renowned for deeds which sprang from the same greatness and elevation of spirit as titles are often but accidents this is a just way of judging since worth is not the consequence of a name but a great name ought ever to be the consequence of virtue  modern writers said our critic the other evening have gone into a different turn of thinking they extol to the skies the indifferent actions and palliate the blemishes of titled people who disgrace the figure of life they appear in but meanly decline the right use of art upon subjects where they might point out greatness in obscure men who were never little in any thing but the accident of their birth and who living and dying did an honor to human nature such penmen may be called the rabble of the wits who are dazzled by the false glare of the great but can look at solid virtue without the least emotion or sign of being able to see it the styles of these petty panegyrists are like their subjects glittering but not solid swelling but rather empty than great they seem never to have heard of that beautiful simplicity which arises out of nature and forms the sublime so much admired by the readers and so masterly executed by the writers of antiquity  we were led into this track of thinking by my looking the other day into a little book called the history of the preservation of charles the second after the noted battle of worcester which was fought in the year      on the third of this very month of september i there meet with such a prodigious instance of fidelity and loyalty in a poor mean country fellow named pendrell and all his family that i know not any so illustrious to which my heart would lead me to pay greater or sincerer acknowledgements i am not at all surprised to find that this amazing incident of integrity is coolly and insensibly treated by men of slender abilities who have an affectation to shine upon more pompous subjects who choose rather to spend their strength in relating the fury of that battle and lay out all their mistaken eloquence in raising the powers of hell to push on its horrible consequences but it is both a matter of surprise and confusion to think that so many truly great poets and orators should live just after and leave an example so beneficial to posterity in a manner forgotten for want of being commended with that spirit it so richly deserves  perhaps the history of the whole world were we to turn it never so carefully over could furnish us with but few things more astonishing more moving and pathetick more exemplary and edifying than this uncelebrated passage  a monarch to be forced by a prevailing faction to turn a fugitive in his own kingdoms and when discomfited princes disabled lords and routed armies could no longer assist their sovereign that it should be reserved for a poor simple hind to preserve this lords anointed from a cruel pursuing victor whose praeternatural swells of fortune made him the terror of all christendom  that it should be reserved for an ignorant countryman to save a wise and mighty prince from falling like his good father to be afterward received as our glory with the applauses and acclamations not only of our own three kingdoms but all the nations about us and shall this englishman recorded with honor by foreign writers be only coldly spoken of by our own  is he a mean man consider the noble trust and the nobler discharge of it and he grows great in proportion to the littleness of his condition is he poor how does that poverty add to the richness of his virtue who hears praemiums bid for the precious life he has in custody and yet disdaining the bribe of gold ventures his own for his loyalty sure nothing but a soul which is abandoned to barbarity and meanness can let a little idea of him take place upon account of his despicable figure it is the noblest addition to his greatness as inconsiderable as he might be otherwise he must in this view make a fine picture and he is a living disgrace to that herd of titled criminals who followed the fortunes and partook the impious greatness of the pursuer of majesty let those who look no farther than the outside of things think a plebian below eulogy i who view him with other eyes almost think him above it had he lived in more generous times and been the preserver of an augustus his honest contempt of gold would have justly given him a place equal with camillus in the horatian ode consecrated to the praises of that emperor  it is a scene that the imagination cannot entertain without a mixture of grief and admiration when we place before our eyes that prince in the habit of a rustic amidst so many different dangers relying upon the conduct and fidelity of this real rustic this venerable clown and his little family for his guards i remember to have been informed by a very great man that he has heard the king tell the story in jest and wondered to see many smile when his majesty said pleasantly that he he was once in danger of losing his guide in the nightime but that the rustling of richard s calvesskin breeches was a direction to his ear in the dark the king might indeed make a jest of it said he but i could not think of majesty in such distress without being touched in good earnest by a grief which it was beyond the notion of an odd and comical dress to remove  i must say the same as this nobleman with regard to the king and even as to pendrell there is something too serious in his integrity not to make us lose his appearance in our veneration of his virtues as there was a princely person in one rough garb there was a noble soul in the other for when he attended the king for the last time he showed he had a true sense of the weight of his charge for his majesty complaining of the horse that it was the heaviest jade he ever rode on pendrell smilingly told him that the horse had the weight of three kingdoms on his back and ought not therefore to be blamed if he went a little heavily  when i meditate the many passages that this little history recounts between the king and pendrell my attention is so fixed to the parts which exercised this mans fidelity that i scarce have room in my thoughts for the glories of a restoration that he was reserved for i love to dwell upon this good man it is a familiar example but it is the more useful the least man may be faithful and fidelity will make him great while the greatest man without integrity dwindles into a little one  it is true also integrity makes a great man much greater so it is with general monk a name far beyond his title duke of albemarle strikes no ear calls for no admiration but every one admires the general and the restorer  a little gentlemanly estate was afterward settled upon his descendants and had he been advanced by the pleasure of the king from that lowly degree to the nobility no lord could have thought himself injured by having for his peer and companion the heir of that worthy man who preserved the fountain of honor  the plain dealer no     fallacia alia aliam trudit teren monday september         credulity is a weakness from which very few are exempted it is the groundwork of craft and imposture and the means by which they are propagated  i have often reflected with concern upon the condition of humanity in this regard and nothing can be more afflicting than to behold one part of the rational world making a trade of misguiding the other if all the errors into which people are drawn had but the marks of truth some excuse might be found for their credulity but the shame is in their receiving what is new at the expense even of probabability vulgar minds are most struck with what is most incredible and the way to convince is to amaze them reason makes few proselytes but mystery rarely fails and the less they know why the fonder they grow of the imposture  because i would not dip into controversies wherein religion and government are concerned i must descend into low life and only touch the little artifices which owe their reputation to this weakness  the world is wearied with stories of witches and fairies and begins to see through the imposture the craft of astrologers conjurers and prophets begins also to be exploded by the vulgar whose oracles they have long been but i am not a little amazed to find that instead of the delusions once practiced on the multitude they now work strongest among the polite and fashionable people what staring what clapping what waste of time and money have harlequin and faustus occasioned the madness both of actors and spectators has so provoked me almost to tears that i could even have wept over the city  i will not be so partial to our worshipful society of free and accepted masons as to forbear reproving them on this occasion for the unaccountable pother and noise they have lately made in the world what stories have been told to amuse and engage the credulous what reflections what reproach have they brought upon that ancient order by making proselytes in so cheap and so prostituted a manner it afflicts me sensibly when i see coxcombs introduced into our lodges and made privy to our secrets i have often entered my protest against this abuse in private society and must use the freedom to offer this memorial in my public character it is my opinion that the late prostitution of our order is in some measure the betraying it the weak heads of vintners drawers wigmakers weavers etc admitted into our fraternity have not only brought contempt upon the institution but do very much endanger it and i have heard it asked why we dont admit women as well as tailors into our lodges i must confess i have met with as sufficient heads among the fair sex as i have found in the brotherhood i have some reasons to fear that our secrets are in danger there is in the conduct of too many since their admission the  caecus amor sui et tollens vacuum plus nimio gloria verticem arcanique fides prodiga perlucidior vitro which is expressly prohibited by our excellent rules and constitutions and which is the very characteristick of the fools that were received into the lodges at rome in the days of augustus caesar and whereof our brother horace complained vehemently in an ode to varus who was then grand master but whatever freedoms others imagine they may lawfully and discreetly use my conscience cannot brook them   non ego te  invitum quatiam nec  sub divum rapiam  my female readers and i am afraid some of the brotherhood may stop here and stare as if i had blabbd out the whole mystery they may be doubtful whether the above words and dashes may not be decypherd into the famous mason word but i leave the ignorant to their wonder and proceed to assure my brethren that they have promoted superstition and babbling contrary to the peace of our sovereign lord the king by their late practices and condescentions alarming reports and stories of ladders halters drawn swords and dark rooms have spread confusion and terror and if the government does not put the laws against us in execution it will be an extraordinary favor or oversight for my own part i am so faithful a subject and have the weal of our ancient order so much at heart that unless the grand master puts a stop to these proceedings by a peremptory charge to the brotherhood i wish i could honorably enter into another  and now i have hinted at another order i must entertain my readers with two letters the first addressed to my self and the last written from rome to the author of the first  hang chi to the british plaindealer health sage sir by the help of my secretary and interpreter i peruse your lucubrations and write this epistle to assure you of my esteem  i am informed that you have taken notice of the advertisement i caused to be published in the newspapers and that you called at the castle to be satisfied of the truth of my arrival in this place your enquiry and the conversation you had with my secretary give me occasion to gratify you farther and i am proud to have it in my power to distinguish one of your merit in the manner i intend  the laws and constitutions of the most ancient and illustrious order of the gormogons oblige us to be cautious and frugal in admitting new members remarkable virtues have always recommended the candidates no rank station or condition of life intitles a person to be of our fraternity we know neither prejudice nor partiality in conferring this honor and all the interest in the world to procure it would be fruitless without merit  my residence here will be short it cannot therefore be expected that i should invite many worthy persons to enter into our order nor dare i render it cheap and contemptible by admitting every pretender but i know several who deserve to be received and to whom i have promised the distinction  i shall consider it as an ornament to our most ancient and illustrious order which is the honor and ornament of all its members if you sage sir will be pleased to accept the privileges that i am empowered to bestow on the deserving i confess you must first be degraded as our laws require and renounce and abandon the society of falsebuilders but as your great judgment must distinguish the excellence of our order i hope you will prefer being a fellow with us nothing would more sensibly concern me when i leave london than not be able to transmit your name in the list that i must send to the ecumenical volgee in china  i am sage sir your affectionate friend hang chi   shin shaw to hang chi at london health most illustrious brother and friend i congratulate you on the speedy progress you have made from the court of the young sophy and your safe arrival in the isle of britain your presence is earnestly expected at rome the father of high priests is fond of our order and the cardinals have an emulation to be distinguished our excellent brother gormogon mandarin chan fue is well and salutes you since my last i had advices from pekin which confirm former accounts that our new emperor is an open enemy to the jesuits but i pray their disgrace in china may not provoke the europeans to use us ill take care of your health farewell  shin shaw   i acknowledge the honor done me by the illustrious mandarin hang chi and though i cannot prevail with my self to be degraded in the manner required by the laws and constitutions of the order of gormogons i approve and applaud their admitting none but whom merit recommends into the fellowship of the ecumenical volgee moreover i propose the good conduct and regularity of the gormogons as a pattern to the free and accepted masons for the future and if i shall be enabled to make any useful discoveries for the service of the brotherhood they may depend on my watchful fidelity  the letters

gentleman from london to his friend at cambridge and being full of a generous spirit we have inserted them according to our promise in our last  london december  0       sir what i here write to you is affection true because spontaneous affection to a family who know not me or that i am now writing or intending to write to you or any body concerning them  i am just now seated at a coffeehouse not far from the royal exchange where i am very much affected as i often have been with the genteel humble deportment of the barkeeper a deportment most agreeably adapted to her present station  yet at the same time such as betokens a genius superior to this way of livelihood it is known to every body that sees this gentlewoman seeing her is knowing it that she is a gentlewoman but that moreover she has this additional merit to have been the comfort the loving and beloved comfort of the great and admirable favellus this perhaps is not so universally known  favellus was an eminent preacher of the town those that know his character can tell twas a compound of all the good characters belonging to a christian to a divine to a gentleman he had a most extensive genius which with his own education and industry made vast acquirements in all sorts of theological literature this will appear to a man of any sagacity that makes use of that and his sermons when published which are now printing by subscription the first of these sermons that was preached in my hearing gave me a most surprising mixture of pleasure and concern pleasure in hearing at once a demosthenes and a euclid a chrysostom and a bentley  all met together all speaking in this accomplished divine who was himself a most powerful a most pathetick orator a most exact reasoner a most persuasive theologer  in one word an universal consummate scholar  this was the pleasure a concern too it gave me a concern inexpressible arising from a certain uneasiness i felt in my own breast from reflecting that though i had been years in london this was but my first pleasure of hearing this inimitable man after this you may be sure i became his eager attendant and of all the sermons i attended head and heart say this  they were all to a degree that is incredible all edifying all entertaining entertaining i mean in that way wherein theological performances may and ought to entertain it is rare remarkably rare to meet with the man that writes or indeed is capable of writing in that close that mathematical that concatenating way he excelled in or that has the same sagacity in pointing out the intricacies of an argument together with the same acuteness the same clearness in removing em  putting prejudice to the blush  reconciling scripture to scripture  making error appear to be error truth to be truth you would be sure not only to be pleased but to exult in the pleasure you took if you had heard him frequently as i did advancing and that so ingeniously some truths that were uncommon and defending common ones in an uncommon manner making obscure things plain plain things surprizingly plainer  to raise objections so pertinently to state em so heartily to answer em so unanswerably is a talent or rather many talents wherein but few men if few could come up to him  i ask now should it not be matter of wonder to all men and to men of merit concern that this very man a man of their own number a minister of the gospel too an eminent minister an eminent writer  great in learning  great in goodness  great in renown  of a meek humble winning disposition  of a sweet sober edifying conversation  of a blameless of an unspotted character  withal too a man of strict orthodoxy and is not this alone a thousand good characters  i say should it not even in point of humanity much more so of charity affect all men of merit or that love merit to observe how it passed unrewarded slighted discouraged though seen plainly though admired universally in this excellent man  think  and grieve when you think how he died how indigent how exceedingly indigent  and this after a life wherein there was nothing of excess  except that of its being painful willingly painful to himself  and that purposely that it might be useful to others  behold him when living living blamelessly in every thing  blamelessly did i say it had been just to have said admirably in every thing admirably every where at home studious at home frugal in all his economy abroad seldom  except at his church at church attended with a full congregation perhaps the fullest in this great city wherein were persons of almost all denominations all all ranks and persuasions all pleased all greedy to hear this incomparable man  and yet  behold him when dying not worth enough to defray the charge of his funeral now it appears through his own singular modesty it did not till now what a poor livelihood   wonder and be astonished and yet this was all his livelihood for himself and family he got by the ministry poor so deplorably poor that his distressed widow and two or three young lovely children at least some of em are likely ever long   o pity pity even to  i cannot speak it  what shall i say  my heart bleeds when i think of it he died as i am told not worth ten shillings  within the circle of your acquaintance and my own there are some no doubt that have inclinations but want abilities to be beneficent some that have abilities but want inclinations some that have both and would employ both but know not where to employ em to these last sort of persons to all these ablewellinclining persons namely to all that have no heirs of their own to inherit after them or have more riches than enough for their heirs and for such like reasons have generous design i say to these surely i need not say more  pity even common pity moved me thus to throw in a word or two i hope at least twill have some favorable consequence in favor of this unhappy widow and children the melancholy remains of that learned good man i have been speaking of and the this rather because as you see they are now reduced for the sake of a subsistence to the business of a coffeehouse  the widows demeanor in this new way of life as i told you genteel humility submissive easy cheerful in this the station allotted her because it is allotted her she has this character in all its beauty and elegance in all the nicety and goodbreeding belonging to it see the whole of her conduct see in that the worst of adversities in its best dress whoever attends to it and whoever beholds cannot but attend to it has a very instructive amusement there is scarce an action she does that in this way is not an excellent document being itself a comment on that polite humility i am speaking of to see her just now bringing me the dish of coffee i called for with her peculiar way of doing it is an admirable criticism on those words of st paul i know how to be abased and to attend her saying sir i thank you and her manner of saying it   with the curtsy annexed to a gentleman that a while ago laid his penny at the bar is perhaps a better sermon than many a divine could have made on this text of st peter  be courteous so much for the widow  the children poor fatherless undone children seem to carry an hereditary goodness in their very aspects it would melt any heart to behold them any especially that remembers that worthy father they descended from  sir sure you are affected with this melancholy narrative it is truth inquire and you will find it all to be truth as related to you by  your most affected maecenas   london may         dear sir in my last i grieved in this i rejoice as you will when i tell you that the distressed widow of the late reverend and excellent favellus is lately married to a good man and an ample estate ample enough to provide handsomely for her and her children behold the benevolence behold the goodness the superlative goodness of amasius that has thought fit to bestow himself and his all and this without hurt to any relation of his own i esteem i admire the man tho i know him not i am all joy and transport and impatient to tell it you i can write nothing else  therefore conclude in an ecstasy  yours maecenas   sept        sir it is the opinion of me and of many that the two letters i enclose may pass with advantage through your hands to the public if too long abridge em as you think fit i was at cambridge when i recivd both from maecenas who i must tell you is a gentleman of the temple that will not permit me to say more of him nor need i to a person of your taste and discernment that can read the soul of a man in his letters  be just sir to such a remarkable piece of generosity as this of amasius and convince the world that it is not only an uncommon generosity but an uncommon good sense a good sense perhaps which a great many foolish people have not a notion of and which a great many wise ones have only a notion of  the like conduct to this of amasius was the other day that of theodosia a lady of an amiable character and of a very considerable family and fortune she has had a long and intimate knowledge of honestus and of all his good qualities she has often heard often seen what a kind husband he made to his wise whom he has lately lost and with her an estate that was all he had to subsist upon he had met with many adversities many trials before but this was the greatest he bore it manfully hoping trusting resting firmly and cheerfully in an almighty wisdom goodness and providence with this resolution he made a friendly visit to his acquaintance in the country among the rest to theodosia who received him kindly and pitied him he there fell ill of a fever during which she gave him a thousand proofs of her tenderness and after he had recovered added this to the number of em she married him  not without the advice of her best friends and relations   this is the character of honestus a great deal of merit but withal a great deal of poverty and four children along with it for this she is reflected on cruel world thus to treat the generous theodosia and thus to treat her because she is generous  cruelty itself but encourage her i beseech you sir and let it be your generosity to say all you can in behalf of theodosias  hereby if speedy you will oblige many besides  sir your sincere friend and humble servant philanthropos   the plain dealer no    trahimur omnes laudis studio and optimus quisque maxim gloria ducitur  cicero monday september         we regard not rivals in love with more malice than rivals in fame and the softer sex is most liable to the malignant impressions of envy because their pursuits being fewer than ours their application is more intense and collected and they brook disappointments with less comfort and moderation  wit and beauty are the arms they conquer by it is with jealousy therefore that they behold them in any hands but their own the praise of one lady is considered by another as a reproach and her soul must be sublimely great who not only observes with pleasure the fame and influence of a powerful rival but contributes her own endeavors to the support and increase of them  i have been led into these reflections by the delight with which i perused the following letter and copy of verses which were lately sent me by a lady who has either too much generosity to malign the excellence and applause of others or too large a share of both herself to be alarmed at their advance in either  sir i have found that your paper has a power to move the soul and holds a command over the passions your plain dealer on death is one continued beauty he ought methinks to live for ever who can make death so desirable while i was reading in it all vanity and love of life forsook me  my eyes resigned themselves to tears and i even seemed to feel the grave the beautiful verse glided through my veins and i trembled with a pleasing horror  while my mind was thus delightfully saddend death deprived me of a perfect friend to whose dear memory i have devoted the lines enclosed they have little beauty but the truth and passion of my concern perhaps that will plead their pardon  the lady whose loss i lament was an ornament to one sex and the reproach and admiration of the other i wonder a death so considerable appears so little deplored  where is friendship  was it buried in delias grave let me invoke it to lament her  she who could so gracefully mourn let us mourn her  she who could give life to our imagination let us be sorry for her death and assist her fame by our gratitude  you sir who know how to charm your readers as you please i wish you would choose this inspiring subject of friendship its divine spirit is too much confined among persons of narrow natures  as for me i am not insensible of it i feel its power at my heart but cannot do justice in expressing it  the descent to age and affliction is smoothed and softened by the aid of friendship it rebates the edge of sharpest miseries we seem not to grow old when we have a friend to make life tasteful to us time flies over us indeed but he seems to brush us with downy wings and marks his way with slight impressions  when i see a face more serene or more lovely than usual i take pleasure to imagine she owes her sweetness to the influence of some charming friends society the soul is quickened in its energy by the power of so divine a softness nor shares nor laments the bodys miseries  excuse the fullness of my heart on this favorite subject and i will be frank enough to own that i am sometimes blessed with a friend of your sex too and while i have the joy of listening to his wisdom methinks we have already passed the grave and are enjoying the delights of heaven  i am sir your most respectful humble servant cleora   verses written by a lady on the death of mrs manley pale bleeding friendship and distracted grief leave me no voice to give my woe relief even the soft gratitude my eyes should pay flows from my soul and speaks this nobler way my weeping pen shall my distress impart and its dark tears dissolve the readers heart till tears on tears in social grief descend and the world mourns my souls lamented friend yet does my muse but a bribed offering give since joined to thine my name is sure to live why were thou ravished from my love so soon why gleamd thy evening only on my noon had thy dear friendship warmed my morning lays i had deserved the glory of thy praise sprung lively forward lightened by thy ray cheered for the race and darted into day but thou were held from my desiring sight and my muse wandered distant from thy light how strong yet soft was her accomplished mind sincere like heaven and as its angels kind safe as the sun in her superior rays how full shone merit in her graceful praise such active flame did her warm fancy give that every glowing letter seemed to live where is now the unconscious heart that could descend to bless my wishes with the name of friend senceless and cold twill now no longer move at pitys tender voice or weeping love where shall we now those bright ideas find that peopled thought from thy creating mind death has turned back the intercepted store but thy fame lives and thou can die no more such immortality thy friendship gave for none whom delia sung can fear the grave life of my genius whither art thou flown to what new regions to my soul unknown let me overtake thee  for i weary grow and sicken at the world that is left below the sunless world where friendship has no part is cold and dead to my bewinterd heart in lifes vain joys no comfort can be found no cure for memrys eversmarting wound when the bright traces of thy mind i read oh how will waking recollection bleed thy angel pen awed even unblushing vice and chased high guilt from its proud paradise but innocence and virtue were thy care thy towering genius shone triumphant there oh delia tuneful mistress of my mind dear to my friendship to my errors kind where shall my muse another delia find what wished entreaties did i still receive such the true great alone have soul to give while in immortal honors she was dressed she stooped to raise me to her generous breast and wooed my distant merit to be blessed i grasp thy tomb nor would i thence depart the world has now no charm that tempts my heart dark let me sigh to thy departed shade nor light intruding solemn grief invade my trembling arms would this cold marble bind till my lost body joins my buried mind i am charmed almost equally with the verse and prose of this lady  there is in her style a peculiar mark or mole which her minerva may be known by it is a certain majestic shortness in her periods impregnated with sense and fullness and her poetry is so rich in beauties that her eyes have scarce more fire or her mind more scope and sweetness  it has often been observed that the ladies of this island are the most beautiful in the universe i shall endeavor for my countrys honor to prove them also the most witty and that they are most wise we are under a political necessity of maintaining because no remark is more obvious to foreigners than that the superiority of our womens talents has almost universally preferred the sex in this happy corner of the world to a right of governing their husbands  but when i come to speak of the wit of our english ladies i will not do em the injustice of comparing them with our male poets  there was a corinna among the ancients who carried away the prize of poetry from the immortal pindar himself  to write better than the men therefore is a triumph below the genius of some of our female wits whom i could name since other women have been already so far conquerors in other nations but if i match our modern muses against the sapphos and corinnas of antiquity and they shall be victorious over those famed victors that indeed will be a glory  i shall consecrate three future papers to the great and different excellence of three english ladies who are all now living and whose writings shall be tried in a most impartial comparison with the finest and most celebrated remnants of female genius which have been preserved and wondered at through a length of applauding ages  and i doubt not but i shall make it demonstrable in those three papers that the english ladies have excelled the ancients in the depth the tenderness and the sublimity of their compositions  the plain dealer no    cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutor hor friday september         in a coffeeroom the other day where the conversation turned on wit a gentleman was taking pains to draw an odd kind of demonstration from the list of subscribers to mr popes translation of homer that there never was an age so favorable to poets as this  and that from the number of our noble patrons the glorious reign of king george will shine brighter to posterity than the reign of augustus caesar  though i love loyalty at my heart and am as conscious as i ought to be of the influences of his majestys glory yet i confess i was a little startled at the novelty of this assertion and expressed my surprise with some emotion  i find then cried i that i have lived in profound ignorance  as for the politics indeed of the present age i have always considered em as too remarkable to be soon forgot but for the wit of it i was in hopes there could be no danger of its being remembered  it seems continued i the severest misery of men of learning that custom has misled them to depend for their encouragment on those great little creatures whom we call people of quality  were wisdom the consequence of riches rank and power it had been prudent and reasonable for merit in distress to apply itself to the mighty  but since the flattery and indulgence in which those called great men are educated must give liberty to their passions and restraint to their intellects for understanding is scarce necessary to men who can pay others to think for them therefore with due regard to a few shining exceptions a lord is above wit and most of em would have found it more to their taste and their talent to subscribe to heidegger than to homer but that the numerous acquaintance of this fine and happy genius united themselves so powerfully to recommend his translation that to be out of the list was to be out of the fashion which misfortune no doubt it was well worth six guineas to be delivered from the disgrace of  but let me see these shining names to mr denniss miscellaneous tracts which he is now publishing by a subscription scarce the sixth part so chargeable and i will afterward suppose that they can read as well as purchase  this however is what i know them too well to expect at their hands unless mr dennis shall become as much the mode as mr pope is  i was surpised to observe that at my mention of mr dennis almost every person present joined in a clamor against critics they affirmed thus it was but just to neglect the writings of a person who only writes to censure others and that the world should without regard to a criticks learning declare war against his malice and treat and consider him as a king of common enemy  i contented myself with smiling at the extravagance of this reasoning and replied that i doubted hot however but the name of mr pope would be found among mr denniss subscribers because he has soul to know that though living merit may sometimes as in his own case be popular yet popularity is so far from being the mark of living merit that real excellence for the most part both wants and disdains it  in the progress of my papers i am determined to examine into the foundation of this silly notion that critics are enemies to wit and learning and i dare be positive beforehand that i shall discover it to take its rise from a cause of the same nature with that which makes the pickpocket hate the horsepond  to pretend a love of learning and at the same time io despise criticism is as ridiculous an absurdity as to delight in noble buildings and exclaim against architecture  if there is not some rule whereby we are to measure wit then wit has no dependence on the reason and the judgment and to be a wit or a fool are in that case terms synonimous  but if wit is to be judged by the examination of our reason then that reason is criticism and he who is a critic is the champion of wit and defends it from profanation  how can he therefore be the enemy of what is supported by his influence  the true friends of learning ought to be cautious how they give up critics lest to free themselves from a present fear they destroy their future hope and fall into oblivion under the growth of assuming ignorance like the degenerate roman armies who slackening the severity of their old martial discipline came at length says procopius to think helmets and corslets too hot for them  they were cumbersome and insupportable  they fainted under the weight of em  and had courage enough they were sure to fight as successfully without em  they tried it and the consequence was they were never from that time forward able to stand against the arrows of the overnumbering goths and vandals so deprived of their defense they lost their empire to barbarians  but since no truth operates so powerfully as that which convinces by example let the good or ill of criticism be decided in fair combat between the gentleman i have named above who professes and forms himself on it and one of our most rapid and voluminous compilers of poetry who though one would imagine him too heavy to ride post yet trusting wholly to inspiration breaks over hedges and ditches and never checks his horses speed whether out of the road or in it  this merchant adventurer was for engrossing trade to himself and began with firing the magazines of those who dealt in the same commodity  one of his first witty performances was a satire against wit  an accident befell me the other day that may furnish him with matter of speculation i am very fond of a cat and ever since i lodged in barbican have delighted in the society of a tabby favorite of my landladys children but it happened a few days since that not being in a humor to be so familiar with her as usual she opened one of her claws and was pleased to scratch my leg with no small freedom and impertinence upon which in great wrath i took her up by the tail and tossed her out of window  the cat got no harm but i have quite lost her heart upon it and now i may call coax and tempt her as much as i please she keeps always out out of my reach and i dare be positive i shall never catch her though i were to live and die in barbican  but to go on with what i proposed  after his satire against wit he set forth his wit against satire and published an epic poem called prince arthur  the excellent critic abovenamd saw upon perusing this piece that the gentleman wanted skill and application in the art he was bent on practicing he put himself therefore to the trouble of composing for his use a just and generous reprehension which he entitled remarks upon prince arthur  had the author been either humble or wise enough to make advantage by it this would have served him as a plan to build stronger for the future and given a turn to his reflection that might have made him him what he had so earnest a desire to pass for  but it was then as it is now the custom to despise a critic and the author of prince arthur fell so courageously into the fashion that in almost his coachload of epic poems which he has since obliged the world with from arthur down to alfred i speak it without compliment the same distinguishable purity fire elegance fancy copiousness and elevation shine alike in every one of em and all are equally secure as well from criticism as imitation  but not content with raising and adorning human nature he aspired at last to write upon divinity itself  the great almighty and his works were now to be the subject of his practiced panegyric  here sure if ever he was to guard himself with caution and put on the criticks armor  creation opened to him with its boundless luster  worlds beyond worlds were to be discovered by his poetic telescope and other suns whose light though swift enough to travel a hundred and fourscore thousand miles in one second of time is notwithstanding spent and lost in unconceivable immensity before it reaches this our own suns confines this light was to be more illuminated by his muse and shine down upon his readers fancy  here the admirable critic his old friend had himself set an example such as can never be too much applauded  the noblest the most extensive the most astonishing ideas which can expand the human soul had enriched his powerful conception and one would have hoped that mr dennis had made it impossible for any future writer to treat this subject in a mean and grovelling manner after he had obliged the world so nobly in his paraphrase on te deum with verse and sentiments sublimely suited to the vastness of the occasion  wherever at utmost stretch we cast our eyes through the vast frightful spaces of the skies even there we find thy glory  there we gaze on thy bright majestys unbounded blaze ten thousand suns prodigious globes of light at once in broad dimensions strike our sight millions behind in the remoter skies appear but spangles to our wearied eyes and when those wearied eyes want farther strength to pierce the voids unmeasurable length our towering thoughts more vigorous farther fly and still remoter flaming worlds discry but even an angels comprehensive thought cannot extend so far as thou have wrought our vast conception to such swelling brought swallowed in infinite is lost in naught this is poetry that defies censure and is raised even above praise for it is scarce possible to say so much of it as it truly deserves  but now behold on the opposite side an abstract from the muse of prince arthur in his hymn to the creator  hail king supreme  of power immense abyss father of light exhaustless source of bliss thou uncreated selfexistent cause controlled by no superior beings laws the first three lines being truly poetical what pity that the authors pride deprived him of the use of criticism had he buoyed himself by the help of that he could never though he had sir john falstaffs alacrity in sinking have sunk so soon and so shamefully as to tell us in the  th verse  that he who is supreme in power is controlled by no superior  about  0 lines after this god goes out with a pair of compasses to mark the limits of the world not that the poet had any design they should be made use of but mr milton had described compasses upon this very occasion and our author was resolved to be up with him  through the black bosom of the empty space the gulf confess the omnipotent embrace and pregnant grown with elemental seed unfinished orbs and worlds in embryo breed to suspend a short remark on the manifest contradiction of these two ideas  the drawing out with a pair of compasses  and the begetting by embraces  i challenge the whole tribe of critickhaters throughout europe to match this last image with any thing so indecent so improper so illexpressd and indeed so almost blasphemous and extravgant  but that no cause of complaint may disturb the lovers of variety whoever likes not one image shall have a dozen new ones to make choice of  the author to do him justice is no niggard of his fancy we are all kindly welcome to it as far as it will go and he that desires more is too unreasonable in all conscience  from the crude mass the omniscient architect for every part materials did select and with a master hand the world erect labored by him etc  by his cementing words the parts cohere and rolls by his impulsive nod in air i am sorry i have not room to entertain my reader with the whole but we may measure hercules by his foot  one of your creeping narrow geniuss creatures who stand in awe of the critics would never have been capable of half this luxuriant fullness nay they might have been silly enough to suppose it blameable by which pusilanimous fear of theirs the reader must have lost the sublimity of these fine ideas of his creator at one and the same time measuring the world with a pair of compasses  omnipotently embracing it  impregnating it with seed  breeding orbs in embryo  picking materials from the crude mass  erecting it with a masterhand  laboring it  cementing it  nodding at it  and setting it a rolling  shameful heap of inconsistencies  are images that should elevate the soul of man to an astonishment at his makers power in creating with a word the heavens and the earth and all that is in them all are images fit for this to be borrowed from the pains and postures of a common labourer had not he a nobler lesson before him and does not moses inform him that when god says let there be light there was light  but such as these are the effects of maintaining war against critics and the prodigious and unbounded difference between these two gentlemens performances upon one and the same subject may convince the selfsufficient that it is not a dancing brain a wild eruptive fancy that can qualify a man to be a poet though it serves well enough to set him a going as a scribbler  the plain dealer no    est modus in rebus sunt certi denique fines quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum hor monday september         the following letter from the gentleman who obliged me with a former from edinburgh will speak so excellently for itself that the kindest thing i can do for my reader will be to say nothing concerning it which may detain him from the pleasure of perusing it  edinburgh sept the  th      sir your paper of friday the   th of august is arrived in northbritain and has occasioned much speculation but all its readers are sensibly obliged by the respect you have shown our country and for the honor you have done the rising generation of both sexes and i believe there is none here who would not heartily join their acknowledgements with mine on this occasion i may therefore presume to thank you in the name of all my countrymen who may not use the freedom to write to you but the gentlemen of the grotesque club whom you have so remarkably distinguished must represent their sentiments in a better manner than i can and i will not pretend to speak their sense or anticipate their gratitude  give me leave sir only to express my mind in the sequel you have brought me under strong obligations to you by the notice you have taken of my letter and since you seem to promise to yourself and the world some intelligence from this quarter by means of my proposed correspondence i cannot but use my endeavors to answer in some measure your expectations you have fixed me sir in the character of your northern spy and you may depend upon my most watchful fidelity  edinburgh being our metropolis and the place of my residence must be the chief scene of action and the date of your intelligence from northbritain here is a vast variety of humors customs manners and conversation to be considered many things happen in this place that are worthy your knowledge as a plaindealer some deserve praise and admiration others displeasure and reprehension both regards may be useful either as examples provoking emulation or as reasons warning from danger and sure your judgment sir cannot err in the improvement and application of any accounts i send you  i beg leave to lay before you several of the advantages and disadvantages of our good town before i descend to private life  we are blessed with an able and active magistracy most of those entrusted with with the superintendency of the city are gentlemen of breeding and letters and all have a bent of mind that favors the public grandeur and emolument it seems to be the united ambition of our magistrates to adorn the place and by rendering it more beautiful and commodious to invite new inhabitants to increase its treasure and revenue they would surmount all the difficulties it labors under by a superiority of genius and as they appear true friends to the public interest in respect of trade they are not wanting in giving countenance and encouragement to arts and sciences politeness thrives under their influence and some of them set an example of it to the youth in their own practice and behavior here sir are few cloudy heavyheaded aldermen whose length of wigs and gowns is their sole mark of dignity you would take our provosts for first ministers and our bailies for courtiers i have seen statesmen make a worse figure than our deacons and heard as good speeches in the towncouncil at edinburgh as at the council board of great britain i wish all our peers had abilities equal to some of our weavers and that every clergyman had half the grace of some bonnetmakers of our city  but sir you know there is no bodypolitick perfect many things are wanting to make our city more flourishing and famed and perhaps the greatest misfortune we labor under is faction and party this sir discourages many noble purposes and baffles glorious undertakings selflove pride and ambition prevail everywhere and sway all men more or less these are natural to all creatures the oldest cock is lord of the roost and the strongest bull is grand seignior in his green seraglio the eldest buck is tyrant of the park and from his strength and his horns claims a right to be chief in power and no doubt but every individual creature of every species with the same force would seek and exercise the same jurisdiction but men are remarkably distinguished by their love of precedence and often add to their natural desire of governing a certain lowspirited spleen and malice our worthy magistrates meet with more opposition and discouragment from little pretenders to their place and authority than from any other cause if the towncouncil beholds not macro with the same partiality with which he considers himself he wonders at their blindness and grows peevish upon it for the root of the spleen is often pride disappointed some carry it farther than mere envy by laboring to undermine and depose those who are above them and commonly the greater the merit is the more obnoxious to ill will and reproaches as the red dragon pursued the woman in the revelation faction or private malice pursues the most deserving man and when it cannot overtake him it opens its mouth and throws a flood after him people who have not merit to rise themselves would at least level others and what has often been my greatest wonder in this case is that most of our little jars are created and carried on by our clergy priestcraft is here as infallible as it is at rome and our popes are as absolute to the full extent of their parishes for my own part i have neither personal partiality for any of the present magistrates nor prejudice against their adversaries i never had nor ever needed the favor of any of them i speak my sense freely and it is the result of just reflection and observation and i heartily wish i had not such ground to expose the spirits of any of my neighbors to the plaindealer but what a pity is it that faction should deface the public good and how vile to plot the downfall or calumniate the fame of those whose power is their countrys blessing  my concern for the place of my birth has carried me farther than i ought to have allowed myself liberty but as i am not to touch this subject again you will have the goodness to excuse what i judged in some respects to be requisite  i should not neglect giving you an account of the state of trade in this place nor ought i to pass over in silence the university and college of justices many of the clergy too deserve their praises and must upon some occasions come under consideration but being unwilling to tire your patience and huddle my materials too much together i will conclude this letter when i have acquainted you with what the ladies would have most known and what every body here would be glad to have your opinion of i mean the fair assembly this sir consists of our bestbred ladies of different qualities and ages it is but a late institution and at first was thought to be a proper theme for our pastors sunday sermons all our pulpits railed against it as they did of old against perukes and tobacco but the holy fire is now much spent and we are at liberty to meet in our great hall without danger of the kirks anathema nay some of the wives and daughters of the sanctified begin of late to grace our fellowship for my own part i despair not to see the reverend themselves eating sweatmeats in our company and mixing innocently in our country dances and i own notwithstanding they are worthy ladies of undisputed virtue and honor who preside over the fair assembly i should be better pleased to see at our head a moderator from the general one slander and detraction would fly before him and innocent freedom and christian communion would be cherished by his influence husbands would allow their wives to go into company without jealousy and parants send their daughters without fear of their leaving behind them any thing that they ought to bring back again but till that halcyon day arrives we must be contented with the want of sanction and dance and drink tea without them i shall say more of our fair assembly hereafter and at present only subscribe myself  sage sir your trusty spy and humble servant fergus bruce   the plain dealer no    virtutem incolumem odimus sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi hor friday october        to the author of the plaindealer sept         sir i return you thanks for the pleasure which i have received from several of your plain dealers and particularly from that which you lately published concerning detraction which could never have obliged the world at a more seasonable juncture because as you justly observe slander was never so prevailing as it is at present and never so insupportable  detraction or slander or calumny call it by what name you please is for the most part begot by knaves and nourished and maintained by fools and the more fools and knaves there are in a nation the more must slander flourish in it but the more corrupt and degenerate a nation grows the more fools and knaves must abound in it now whether this nation was ever so corrupt and degenerate as it is at present i leave to others to determine  the fools and knaves of either sex have a natural aversion to merit and when they are neither able nor willing to reach a height to which others more befriended by nature and more beloved by heaven have attained they constantly endeavor with all their might to bring the envied object down to their own pitch and the more extraordinary the merit is the greater is the envy and the stronger the efforts which it makes to blacken the deserving which has occasioned a famous observer of mankind to say that whenever he hears a great deal of ill said of any one and sees none at all in him he begins to suspect that that person has a troublesome and offensive merit which eclipses that of others  as soon as a knave has invented a slander a fool cries out there must be something in it  there is no smoke without fire which is as much as to say that there can be no such thing as slander or that no slander can be propagated which is equally contrary to common sense and to constant matter of fact  how different an opinion of this matter had the judicious and penetrating la bruyere who tells us that the reverse of what is commonly reported concerning persons or things is what may reasonably be believed of either  there is another musty proverb made use of in the propagation of slander which is mentioned in your last paper viz that what everybody says must be true  if they who pronounce this meant that every thing must be true which has the universal consent of mankind there might perhaps be something in it but alas their meaning is vastly different they only infer that when a report or opinion in any place so far prevails as to become in that place general that report or opinion must be true so that in the notion of these gentlemen if calumny at any time so far prevails as to become general it is no longer calumny but truth and a sure consequence of this doctrine is that popery is the best religion at rome and mahometism at constantinople  but how little do they who talk at this rate know either of the frailty or malignity of human nature or the transactions of their own times or the records of preceding ones some of the best and most deserving persons both among ancients and moderns have labored under general calumny under calumnies which were not only inconsistent with common sense but were directly contradictory of those virtues and great qualities for which they had long been eminent and for which some of them have been celebrated by twenty succeeding centuries and though the truth was so manifestly on their side yet some of these and those of the most deserving have been quite oppressed by such calumnies as socrates and phocion among the graecians  among the romans camillus and coriolanus  socrates the most religious and most virtuous of all the athenians was condemned and excuted as an atheist and a corrupter of youth among the jews the prophets were stoned and jesus christ himself was crucified as an imposter and a blasphemer  you have very justly observed that detraction brings most disquiet to those who are most above it  you may say such things without any consequence to a worthless fellow as will blow a man of honor into a flame not to be quenched but by blood but if such injuries are so insupportable to a man of honor when they come from one single person provoked perhaps by some imaginary offense and quite frantic with passion and wine what impressions must they not make when they are whispered in cold blood by a number of different persons such slanders obstruct the progress of arts the advancement of learning and the growth of virtues by the killing impressions which they make on individuals  i wish you would proceed to show what disorder they bring to families and what desolation to states hannibal was undone and carthage was ruined by the malicious slanders of hanno and the duke of marlboroughs unparalled victories could not defend him against ingratitude while the malice of his slanderers met with countenance from men in power who being privately his enemies had not soul enough to sacrifice their little spleen to the love of their countrys glory  i am sir your most obedient servant a b   detraction is an evil which however hateful in its nature the world must always expect to abound with and therefore since my correspondent has written so much and so well in detestation of this ungenerous weakness all i will add upon the subject shall be to advise those who suffer under the severity of its consequences rather to despise than complain of it to which end they would do well to reflect on the answer of the philosopher whom his friends were urging to contrive some public means whereby to redeem himself from the disgrace which he suffered under the malice of some busy slanderers  they who love me said he will give no credit to malicious rumors to my disadvantage and as for those who hate me i will live in a manner so contrary to what they believe of me that i will make em ashamed of their credulity  that very socrates which my correspondent so justly produces as one of the most glorious of all the victims to slander triumphed over it in the very current and full force of its influence for when aristophanes in his comedy called the clouds had exposed this great and virtuous sufferer with the utmost bitterness of witty malice to the public spleen of the athenians socrates came in person to see the comedy acted and taking his place in the most remarkable part of the theater stood up and exposing himself to the observation of the whole audience told em aloud when the play was over that they had been at a merry feast where he was served up for their entertainment nor was he angry to have been their standing dish because the aversion which some had brought with them would last no longer than till they had tasted him  since it is inseparable from merit to be exposed to envy and envy necessarily produces slander there is no hoping to live free from the effects of this pernicious calumny but next to not feeling it the most desirable strength of mind is not to appear to feel it  one of these is out of our reach the other we may attain by force of reason and resolution and its prettily observed in aelian asserting that defamation sinks deepest in weak natures the slander of the strong is like water thrown against a wall but the slander of the weak is like the wall thrown into water  to the author of the plain dealer sept         sir the lady who was the occasion of my writing the song i have sent you has merit enough to justify me both as a lover and an author  when you have room for it in your paper you will oblige me if you publish it  i am your very humble servant philander   o love thou neverabsent thought thou only purpose of the mind all are to thy subjection brought yet not one rebel can thou find thou god who dealst out every human lot whose power decrees who is happy and who not reign still thus mighty as thou art i wish not liberty restored for the bright idol of my heart was born to rule and be adored but oh the passion which you raise protect nor let such truth be blasted by neglect the plain dealer no     tantaene animis coelestibus irae virg monday october        i have lately received a letter containing some remarks on the battle of the angels as it is described by milton in the vith book of his paradise lost and i thought i could not find a more proper occasion of publishing that letter than just after the feast of st michael on the   th of the last month which was set apart by the church to celebrate the victory which that archangel got over lucifer and his rebellious crew i make no doubt but it will appear that milton by the account which he has given of that victory has gained a very glorious one himself and has carried away the praise of sublimity from all poets both ancient and modern  sir of all the commentators on the paradise lost mr addison was certainly the most ingenious if he was not the most learned but he has not given milton his full due either through want of discernment or want of impartiality in the   th page of the small edition of his notes upon the paradise lost he has these words of the author  miltons chief talent and indeed his distinguishing excellence lies in the sublimity of his thoughts there are others of the moderns who rival him in every other part of poetry but in the greatness of his sentiments he triumphs over all the poets both moderns and ancients homer only excepted but as when a man departs from truth which is the only bond of union and agreement both of our sentiments with those of others and of our sentiments with themselves he his ready immediately to differ from and to grow inconsistent with himself mr addison who expressly here either equals or prefers homer for the greatness of his sentiments before milton contradicts himself at least no less than twice in the course of his observations for says he in the  th page of the foresaid edition there is an indisputable and unquestioned magnificence in every part of paradise lost and indeed a much greater than could have been formed upon any pagan system now if there is a greater magnificence in every part of miltons poem there is by consequence a greater sublimity than there is in the iliad which was formed upon a pagan system  again in the   d page of the foresaid edition mr addison speaking of the excellence of miltons performance in the sixth book of his poem delivers himself thus  miltons genius which was so great in itself and so strengthened by all the helps of learning appears in this book every way equal to his subject which is the most sublime that could enter into the thoughts of a poet now sir if miltons subject is the most sublime that could enter into the thoughts of a poet and his genius is every way equal to his subject it follows that milton is more exalted than any poet who has not a subject so elevated and consequently than homer or any other poet ancient or modern  but as in the   st page of the foresaid comment mr addison takes a great deal of pains to show the greatness of one particular passage of homer and to describe it after longinus in all those chosen circumstances which may make it appear to be noble and exalted which pains he has not taken with any other passage we may reasonably conclude that he believed this to be the most lofty of any that are in the works of homer as indeed it really is now as there is a passage in the  th book of paradise lost which was produced upon a parallel occasion let us see if we cannot find by comparing them for the honor of our country that the passage of our briton is as much superior to that of the grecian as the angels of the one are more potent than the others gods or as the empyrean heaven is more exalted than ossa pelion or olympus  in order to this sir give me leave to lay before you the words which mr addison makes use of to set sorth the masterly strokes of homer after he has told us that there is no question but that milton had heated his imagination with the fight of the gods in homer before he entered upon the engagement of the angels of which by the way i do not believe one syllable i would sooner believe the greatest absurdities of the alcoran he is pleased to add what follows  homer there gives us a scene of men heroes and gods mixed together in battle mars animates the contending armies and lifts up his voice in such a manner that it is heard distinctly amidst all the shouts and confusion of the fight jupiter at the same time thunders over their heads while neptune raises such a tempest that the whole field of battle and all the tops of the mountains shake about them the poet tells us that pluto himself whose habitation was in the very center of the earth was so affrighted at the shock that he leaped from his throne homer afterward describes vulcan as pouring down a storm of fire upon the river xanthus and minerva as throwing a rock at mars who he tells us covered seven acres in his fall with these imaginary ne plus ultras had mr addison so filled his capacity that when ten thousand greater beauties are before his eyes he stops short of them and never in the least discerns them as you will see immediately for thus he goes on  as homer has introduced into his battle of the gods every thing that is great and terrible in nature milton has filled his fight af good and bad angels with all the like circumstances of horror the shout of armies the rattling of brazen chariots the hurling of rocks and mountains the earthquake the fire the thunder are all of them employed to lift up the readers imagination and give him a suitable idea of so great an action with what art does the poet represent the whole body of the earth trembling even before it was created thus with this very pretty trifling remark does mr addison stop short within the very touch of one of the vastest and the sublimest beauties that ever was inspired by the god of verse or by miltons godlike genius when the very next lines the very next words strike and astonish us with such wonderful ideas as are able to lift up the readers imagination to a thousand times a greater height than either the shout of armies the rattling of brazen chariots the hurling of rocks and mountains the earthquake the fire or the thunder but that these beauties may be seen in all their luster and in all their glory give me leave to set the whole passage before you  the archangels trumpet through the vast of heaven resounded and the faithful armies rung hosanna to the highest nor stood at gaze the adverse legions nor less hideous joined the horrid shock now storming fury rose and clamor such as heard in heaven till now was never arms on armor clashing brayed horrible discord and the madding wheels of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise of conflict overhead the dismal hiss of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew and flying vaulted either host with fire so under fiery cope together rushed both battles main with ruinous assault and inextinguishable rage all heaven resounded and had earth been then all earth had to her center shook what wonder when millions of fierce encountering angels fought on either side the least of whom could wield these elements and arm him with the force of all the regions but now sir if millions of fierce encountering angels fought on either side and the very least the very weakest of so many millions had power to rend this globe of earth and ocean from its axle and whirl it with its dependent atmosphere through the ethereal regions what must be the unutterable the inconceivable effect of so many millions furiously contending against each other and each of them exerting all his might for victory when  each on himself relied as only on his arm the moment lay of victory   these are amazing these are astonishing ideas worthy of the great original fight the battle of the empyrean  but now sir if the least if the weakest of so many millions as fought on either side had strength to remove this globe of earth with its dependent elements what could not the greatest of them what could not lucifer what could not the prince of the archangels michaels nexttoalmighty arm do the following lines and our own reflections on them may a little help to inform us   long time in even scale the battle hung till satan who that day prodigious power had shown and met in arms no equal ranging through the dire attack of fighting seraphim confused at length saw where the sword of michael smote and felled squadrons at once but now sir of whom were these squadrons why squadrons of those the least of whom could wield these elements and arm him with the force of all their regions   what must the power of that archangel be who with one stroke of his sword could fell whole squadrons of those the least of whom could wield these elements and arm him with the force of all their regions
