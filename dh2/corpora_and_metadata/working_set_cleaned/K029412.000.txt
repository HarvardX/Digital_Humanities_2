a new and most accurate theory of the moons motion whereby all her irregularities may be solved and her place truly calculated to two minutes  written by that incomparable mathematician mr isaac newton and published in latin by mr david gregory in his excellent astronomy  london printed and sold by a baldwin in warwick lane   0   to the reader the irregularity of the moons motion has been all along the just complaint of astronomers and indeed i have always looked upon it as a great misfortune that a planet so near us as the moon is and which might be so wonderfully useful to us by her motion as well as her light and attraction by which our tides are chiefly occasioned should have her orbit so unaccountably various that it is in a manner vain to depend on any calculation of an eclipse a transit or an appulse of her tho never so accurately made whereas could her place be but truly calculated the longitudes of places would be found every where at land with great facility and might be nearly guessed at sea without the help of a telescope which cannot there be used  this irregularity of the moons motion depends as is now well known since mr newton has demonstrated the law of universal gravitation on the attraction of the sun which perturbs the motion of the moon and of all other satellites or secondary planets and makes her move sometimes faster and sometimes slower in her orbit and makes consequently an alteration in the figure of that orbit as well as of its inclination to the plain of the ecliptic but this being now to be accounted for and reduced to a rule by this theory such allowances are made for it as that the place of the planet shall be truly equated  this therefore being perfectly new and what the lovers of astronomy have a long while been put in hopes to receive from the great hand that has now finished it i thought it would be of good service to our nation to give it an english dress and publish it by it self for as dr gregorys astronomy is a large and scarce book it is neither every ones money that can purchase it nor acquaintance that can procure it and besides i hope we have a great many persons in england that have skill and patience enough to calculate a planets place who yet it may be dont well enough understand the latin tongue to make themselves masters of this theory in the authors own words at least i persuade my self that a theory so easy and plain as this which carries along with it such a pretense to exactness will encourage many persons to employ themselves in astronomical calculation which before possibly they neglected because they judged there was but little exactness to be attained in it and this would be a very useful way of spending their leisure hours and if they would oblige us with the publication of good ephemerides tables etc they would soon inflame others with a desire of pursuing these kind of studies  the famous mr isaac newtons theory of the moon this theory has been long expected by the lovers of art and is now published in dr gregorys astronomy in mr newtons own words  by this theory what by all astronomers was thought most difficult and almost impossible to be done the excellent mr newton has now effected viz to determine the moons place even in her quadratures and all other parts of her orbit besides the syzygys so accurately by calculation that the difference between that and her true place in the heavens shall scarce be two minutes and is usually so small that it may well enough be reckoned only as a defect in the observation and this mr newton experienced by comparing it with very many places of the moon observed by mr flamstead and communicated to him  the royal observatory at greenwich is to the west of the meridian of paris      of vraniburgh        0 and of gedanum        the mean motions of the sun and moon accounted from the vernal equinox at the meridian of greenwich i make to be as follows the last day of december    0 at noon old style the mean motion of the sun was   sign  0       of the suns apogaeum was   sign       0  the mean motion of the moon at that time was   sign         and of her apogee   sign        of the ascending node of the moons orbit   sign           and on the last day of december   00 at noon the mean motion of the sun was   sign  0     0 of the suns apogee   sign       0 the mean motion of the moon was  0 sign        0 of the moons apogee    sign       0 and of her ascending node   sign        0 for in  0 julian years or   0  days the suns motion is  0 revolut 0 sign 0     and the motion of the suns apogee    0  the motion of the moon in the same time is     rev   sign         and the motion of the lunar apogee is   revol   sign    0    and the motion of her node   revol 0 sign     0     all which motions are accounted from the vernal equinox wherefore if from them there be subtracted the recession or motion of the equinoctial point in antecedentia during that space which is    0 there will remain the motions in reference to the fixed stars in  0 julian years viz the suns    revol    sign          of his apogee    0 and the moons     revol   sign          of her apogee   revol   sign         and of the node of the moon   revol 0 sign          according to this computation the tropical year is     days   hours       and the sydereal year is     days   hours       these mean motions of the luminaries are affected with various inequalities of which    there are the annual equations of the aforesaid mean motions of the sun and moon and of the apogee and node of the moon  the annual equation of the mean motion of the sun depends on the eccentricity of the earths orbit round the sun which is         of such parts as that the earths mean distance from the sun shall be  000 whence it is called the equation of the center and is when greatest       0  the greatest annual equation of the moons mean motion is       of her apogee  0 and of her node    0  and these four annual equations are always mutually proportional one to another wherefore when any of them is at the greatest the other three will also be greatest and when any one lessens the other three will also be diminished in the same ratio  the annual equation of the suns center being given the three other corresponding annual equations will be also given and therefore a table of that will serve for all for if the annual equation of the suns center be taken from thence for any time and be called p and let   0 p  q q    0 q  r p d d    0 d  e and d   0 d    f then shall the annual equation of the moons mean motion for that time be r that of the apogee of the moon will be e and that of the node f  only observe here that if the equation of the suns center be required to be added then the equation of the moons mean motion must be subtracted that of her apogee must be added and that of the node subducted and on the contrary if the equation of the suns center were to be subducted the moons equation must be added the equation of her apogee subducted and that of her node added  there is also an equation of the moons mean motion depending on the situation of her apogee in respect of the sun which is greatest when the moons apogee is in an octant with the sun and is nothing at all when it is in the quadratures or syzygys this equation when greatest and the sun in perigaeo is      but if the sun be in apogaeo it will never be above      at other distances of the sun from the earth this equation when greatest is reciprocally as the cube of such distance but when the moons apogee is any where but in the octants this equation grows less and is mostly at the same distance between the earth and sun as the sine of the double distance of the moons apogee from the next quadrature or syzygy to the radius  this is to be added to the moons motion while her apogee passes from a quadrature with the sun to a syzygy but is to be subtracted from it while the apogee moves from the syzygy to the quadrature  there is moreover another equation of the moons motion which depends on the aspect of the nodes of the moons orbit with the sun and this is greatest when her nodes are in octants to the sun and vanishes quite when they come to their quadratures or syzygys this equation is proportional to the sine of the double distance of the node from the next syzygy or quadrature and at greatest is but    this must be added to the moons mean motion while the nodes are passing from their syzygys with the sun to their quadratures with him but subtracted while they pass from the quadratures to the syzygys  from the suns true place take the equated mean motion of the lunar apogee as was above showed the remainder will be the annual argument of the said apogee from whence the eccentricity of the moon and the second equation of her apogee may be compared after the manner following which takes place also in the computation of any other intermediate equations    let t represent the earth ts a right line joining the earth and sun tacb a right line drawn from the earth to the middle or mean place of the moons apogee equated as above let the angle sta be the annual argument of the aforesaid apogee ta the least eccentricity of the moons orbit tb the greatest bissect ab in c and on the center c with the distance ac describe a circle afb and make the angle bcf  to the double of the annual argument draw the right line tf that shall be the eccentricity of the moons orbit and the angle btf is the second equation of the moons apogee required  in order to whose determination let the mean distance of the earth from the moon or the semidiameter of the moons orbit be  000000 then shall its greatest eccentricity tb be       such parts and the least ta       so that the greatest equation of the orbit viz when the apogee is in the syzygys will be       0 or perhaps    0 for i suspect there will be some alteration according to the position of the apogee in or in but when it is in quadrature to the sun the greatest equation aforesaid will be         and the greatest equation of the apogee          having from these principles made a table of the equation of the moons apogee and of the eccentricitys of her orbit to each degree of the annual argument from whence the eccentricity tf and the angle btf  viz the second and principal equation of the apogee may easily be had for any time required let the equation thus found be added to the first equated place of the moons apogee if the annual argument be less than  0 or greatear than   0 and less than   0 otherwise it must be subducted from it and the sum or difference shall be the place of the lunar apogee secondarily equated which being taken from the moons place equated a third time shall leave the mean anomaly of the moon corresponding to any given time moreover from this mean anomaly of the moon and the beforefound eccentricity of her orbit may be found by means of a table of equations of the moons center made to every degree of the mean anomaly and some eccentricitys viz   000  0000   000  0000 and   000 the prostaphaeresis or equation of the moons center as in the common way and this being taken from the former semicircle of the middle anomaly and added in the latter to the moons place thus thrice equated will produce the place of the moon a fourth time equated  the greatest variation of the moon  viz that which happens when the moon is in an octant with the sun is nearly reciprocally as the cube of the distance of the sun from the earth let that be taken       when the sun is in perigaeo and     0 when he is in apogaeo and let the differences of this variation in the octants be made reciprocally as the cubes of the distances of the sun from the earth and so let a table be made of the aforesaid variation of the moon in her octants or its logarithms to every tenth sixth or fifth degree of the mean anomaly and for the variation out of the octants make as radius to the sine of the double distance of the moon from the next syzygy or quadrature so let the aforefound variation in the octant be to the variation congruous to any other aspect and this added to the moons place before found in the first and third quadrant accounting from the sun or subducted from it in the second and fourth will give the moons place equated a fifth time  again as radius to the sine of the sum of the distances of the moon from the sun and of her apogee from the suns apogee or the sine of the excess of that sum above   0 so is    0 to a sixth equation of the moons place which must be subtracted if the aforesaid sum or excess be less than a semicircle but added if it be greater let it be made also as radius to the sine of the moons distance from the sun so    0 to a seventh equation which when the moons light is increasing add but when decreasing subtract and the moons place will be equated a seventh time and this is her place in her proper orbit  note here the equation thus produced by the mean quantity    0 is not always of the same magnitude but is increased and diminished according to the position of the lunar apogee for if the moons apogee be in conjunction with the suns the aforesaid equation is about    greater but when the apogees are in opposition it is about as much less and it librates between its greatest quantity      and its least      and this is when the lunar apogee is in conjunction or opposition with the suns but in the quadratures the aforesaid equation is to be lessened about  0 or one minute when the apogees of the sun and moon are in conjunction but if they are in opposition for want of a sufficient number of observations i cannot determine whether it is to be lessened or increased and even as to the argument or decrement of the equation    0 above mentioned i dare determine nothing certain for the same reason viz the want of observation accurately made  if the sixth and seventh equations are augmented or diminished in a reciprocal ratio of the distance of the moon from the earth i e in a direct ratio of the moons horizontal parallax they will become more accurate and this may readily be done if tables are first made to each minute of the said parallax and to every sixth or fifth degree of the argumennt of the sixth equation for the sixth as of the distance of the moon from the sun for the seventh equation    from the suns place take the mean motion of the moons ascending node equated as above the remainder shall be the annual argument of the node whence its second equation may be computed after the following manner in the preceding figure  let t as before represent the earth ts a right line conjoining the earth and sun let also the line tacb be drawn to the place of the ascending node of the moon as above equated and let sta be the annual argument of the node take ta from a scale and let it be to ab as    to   or as    to   then bissect ba in c and on c as a center with the distance ca describe a circle as afb and make the angle bcf equal to double the annual argument of the node before found so shall the angle btf be the second equation of the ascending node which must be added when the node is passing from a quadrature to a syzygy with the sun and subducted when the node moves from a syzygy toward a quadrature by which means the true place of the node of the lunar orbit will be gained whence from tables made after the common way the moons latitude and the reduction of her orbit to the ecliptic may be computed supposing the inclination of the moons orbit to the ecliptic to be         when the nodes are in quadrature with the sun and       0 when they are in the syzygys  and from the longitude and latitude thus found and the given obliquity of the ecliptic       the right ascension and declination of the moon will be found  the horizontal parallax of the moon when she is in the syzygys at a mean distance from the earth i make to be     0 and her horary motion          and her apparent diameter     0 but in her quadratures at a mean distance from the earth i make the horizontal parallax of the moon to be     0 her horary motion         and her apparent diameter      the moon in an octant to the sun and at a mean distance has her center distant from the center of the earth about  0    of the earths semidiameters  the suns horizontal parallax i make to be  0 and its apparent diameter at a mean distance from the earth i make        the atmosphere of the earth by dispersing and refracting the suns light casts a shadow as if it were an opake body at least to the height of  0 or  0 geographical miles by a geographical mile i mean the sixtieth part of a degree of a great circle on the earths surface this shadow falling upon the moon in a lunar eclipse makes the earths shadow be the larger or broader and to each mile of the earths atmosphere is correspondent a second in the moons disk so that the semidiameter of the earths shadow projected upon the disk of the moon is to be increased about  0 seconds or which is all one in a lunar eclipse the horizontal parallax of the moon is to be increased in the ratio of about  0 to     thus far the theory of this incomparable mathematician and if we had many places of the moon accurately observed especially about her quadratures and these well compared with her places at the same time calculated according to this theory it would then appear whether there yet remain any other sensible equations which when accounted for might serve to improve and enlarge this theory  dr greg astr elem phys and geom p
