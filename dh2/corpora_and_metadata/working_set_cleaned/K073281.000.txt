the vision a poem on the death of the queen  price sixpence  the vision  a poem on the death of her most gracious majesty queen caroline  by stephen duck  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane and j jackson in st jamess street mdccxxxvii  the vision a poem twas on the fatal day that claims a sigh from every heart a tear from every eye ere albions joys were wholly snatched away or britons for their queen forbid to pray while hope and fear contended in my breast intruding sleep my weary eyes oppressed wrapped in a vision  where i cannot say nor can the muse the glorious place display it seemed some blessed angels happy sphere or blessed angels might inhabit there for sure the beauteous scene did far excel what heathen bards of blessed elysium tell a cloud of glory shone before my face which shed refulgent rays around the place and scattered colors various to behold here blushing rubies there the burnished gold as wondering at the scene i gazing stood struck with religious awe that chilled my blood i saw britannia with dejected air pale was her face dishevelled was her hair her trembling hand had dropped the laurel bough a mournful cypress wreathed her pensive brow before the shining cloud she prostrate lay and thus she prayed or seemed at least to pray  almighty father whose commanding power can hasten or adjourn the fatal hour can lengthen or contract a monarchs reign or raise the silent dead to life again oh stop thy threatening arm and spare awhile one sacred life so precious to my isle for royal carolinas health i sue the best of sovreigns and of subjects too in every state her goodness has been proved when ruled obedient and when ruling loved securely blessed beneath her gentle sway it is happiness to serve and pleasure to obey nor fewer charms adorn her private life the tenderest mother most submissive wife who never yet her consort disobeyed by honor duty love and virtue swayed in virtues path she constantly proceeds by virtues rule she measures all her deeds even now though tortured with severest pains her patient tongue adores thee not complains to thee her ardent prayers and praises tend on thee on thee alone her hopes depend firm faith and patience fortify her mind to live indiffrent or to die resigned yet spare her longer from her heavenly throne spare her for others good though not her own look down and see her duteous childrens tears look down and hear the best of monarchs prayers see round her bed her tender offspring kneels while every pang her royal consort feels nor only they entreat thee for her breath three kingdoms beg thee to avert her death religion learning art and science fear to find a period and a grave with her for her the widows weep a briny tide for her whose bounty has their loss supplied for her unhappy helpless orphans mourn and shed more tears than over their parents urn their parents death they need no longer grieve might caroline their better parent live who feeds the hungry succors the distressed and from oppression rescues the oppressed even in the height of power her power was shown in acts of love and mercy like thy own oh were she like thee more in every state oh were she were she like thee free from fate but that alas is not to mortals given yet surely this is in the grant of heaven increase her days restore her native bloom nor crop the royal fruit till autumn come few are the years to mortal man assigned ah let not her  to fewer be confined but stop thy threatening arm and spare awhile her sacred life so precious to my isle she said the tears ran trickling as she spoke while from the radiant cloud these accents broke  britannia cease thy fruitless tears and know one certain day is fixed for all below that day permit to heaven for heaven alone knows when the noble work of virtues done few are the years you say of human kind but years add nothing to the perfect mind improperly by time you count the date it is virtuous actions make a life complete suppose the sun that chears your earthly clime should run his destined course in half the time performing all the offices of light of heat of circling seasons day and night say could you think his race too swiftly run or could you call him an imperfect sun heavens greatest lord that over all presides who rules that sun and all his motions guides in length of years an equal never surveyed but is not therefore worshipped or obeyed his goodness only claims that tribute due his goodness not his age though ever new if then your gracious queen though few her days has practiced every virtue worthy praise worthy immortal bliss what can she more though heaven again her former health restore though heaven a thousand added years bestow her soul can be no perfecter below it is time she now should quit her mortal throne to change an earthly for a heavenly crown and see she mounts triumphant to the skies of all her virtues reaps the glorious prize starting to hear the fatal sentence spoke with trembling joints and streaming eyes i woke when strait i hear complaints from every tongue on every face a cloud of sorrow hung sad sighs and floods of fruitless tears bemoan the noblest queen that ever graced a throne finis
