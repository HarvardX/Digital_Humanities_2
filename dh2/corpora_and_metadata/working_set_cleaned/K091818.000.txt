letters of the honorable algernon sydney  letters of the honorable algernon sydney to the honorable henry savile ambassador in france  in the year      etc  now first printed from the originals in mr sydneys own hand  london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pall mall       letters of the honorable algernon sydney london febr           sir i hope you will be so just unto me as not to think i gave over writing unto you during the sitting of the parliament because i did not in a good while receive an answer unto my first letter i seldom stand upon such ceremonies and never with those who have obliged me as you have done the truth is some of your friends and mine were so entangled in business then upon the stage that i could say nothing to the purpose without mentioning them and the parts they had taken upon themselves were such as i was unwilling to relate the result of all this is that the lord sunderland is out of his place and the council the lord conway succeeds him and has the seals essex is also put out of the council and lieutenancy of hartfordshire upon presenting a petition from the lords godolphin hoped to have had the honor of accompanying them in their disgrace but temple only has it the council being hereby weakened is reinforced by the admission of the earls of oxford chesterfield and aylesbury and it is hoped that to render it complete the lords berkeley craven and arundel of trerice shall be called the lord hallifax is gone to ruminate upon these matters at rufford and says he will not return southward until the parliament meet at oxford the fruits expected from the last parliament having been lost by little underhand bargains and as some say the king and parliament equally betrayed by those that were trusted by them mens minds seem to be filled with various conceits and many jealousies some think the writs for calling the parliament are in themselves void as being without advice of council and that the law takes notice of nothing done by the king sine sapientum and magnatum consilio or that if it should meet at oxford its acts would be void or subject to be vacated for want of the freedom of voting which is essential unto it others say the validity of the writs depends solely upon the person of the king and that others ought to think themselves safe where he is safe though their danger be from him i know not what this will produce but i never saw mens minds more heated than at present and cannot think that portends less evil than the comet people are every where busy in choosing parliament men of their own principles and they will probably be like unto the last but it is thought many officers will be prevailed with to make false returns i hear of no election passed but that of amersham of those who by the last parliament were there judged capable of giving their voices sir robert hill had forty mr sydney seven and thirty sir joseph drake twenty eight mr cheyney twenty nine but the constables have been pleased to return the two latter tomorrow is appointed for the election of the citymembers who people believe will be the same as formerly some think his royal highness has business enough to employ his thoughts others say he is at such perfect leisure that the maid of honor who accompanied him cannot employ all his spare time and for that reason or to give her time to lay aside something that troubled her he applys himself to a young gentlewoman who with much respect and gratitude receives the honor he is pleased to do her but she has an old crabbed husband who does not take that for a just recompense of the great respect he has showed unto his royal highness and is not like to learn better manners from his presbyterian brethren  notwithstanding what is said we good subjects hope all will go perfectly well his majesty as is said resolves so to reform his court that all shall be of one mind mr seymour being now looked upon as the greatest man brings his two friends conway and ranelagh into the management of business and the first of these being as eminent for finesse of wit quickness and easiness in state affairs as the other in the excellency of all moral virtues things cannot but go well and we particularly hope that england will keep up its reputation of being as the cardinal pallavicini says the mother and nurse of the best wits in the world when all foreign ministers shall come to treat with jenkins and conway who will be taken for patterns of the genius of the nation and not thought the only men it produces that deserve the highest praises and lest any thing should be wanting mr hide is joined unto these it is true that we have not of our nation a man to put at the head of the soldiers as admirable in military skill and virtues as those abovementioned are in civils and morals but the knowledge of our own defects the sagacity of discovering in the earl of feversham the qualities which we have not and the prudent humility of submitting unto him that is blessed with them though a stranger deserves some commendations and i am confident that when things shall be brought into such order that a papist may appear openfaced we shall show as great respect unto the lord dunbarton france and germany that are full of their trophies cannot but admire this whilst we rest secure under their shadow fit men may more easily be found for less eminent places and the earl of thanet as is said shall succeed mr russell in the command of the foot guards civil and military affairs being thus settled treasures flowing in unto us on all sides and all foreign princes concerned in our affairs being sure unto us we need not fear a few discontented lords a mutinous city or murmuring counties and presuming that the vast magazines of arms made at breast and some that with a good quantity of ammunition were lately sent into ireland are in pursuance of agreements made with you we cannot but think all will tend to our good  i am your most humble and faithful servant  london febr  0 th       sir i hope you will excuse the trouble i give you in enclosing this and desire you to send it forward into gascoiney it is a climate where i cannot be suspected of sending any thing of a dangerous nature but we have so many at the post house infected with the most impertinent folly that a packet though directed thither can hardly pass unvisited unless the person to whom it is directed do protect it  the last resolutions of the city have been as pleasing to the county as distastful to the court yesterday the company of artillery intended to have chosen prince rupert to be their captain and sir thomas player their leader but a letter was produced from the king rather desiring than commanding that no new officers should be chosen and they having no constitution beyond an act of king and council depending upon his majestys will did unwillingly obey  parliament men are for the most part chosen by the parties most contrary to the court and many believe this next house of commons will not be at all more pliable than the last sir william waller and poultney were this day chosen at westminster without any opposition col titus and sir thomas proby were with the same facility chosen knights of huntingtonshire hambden the elder and wharton of buckinghamshire with a multitude of others  the lady portsmouth is said to have entirely recovered her lost favor the earl of sunderland is at his house in queen street the lady hallifax on tuesday followed her lord to rufford  i am your most humble and faithful servant  london april          sir being conscious unto my self that what i could say of businesses now upon the stage would be of little use unto you i thought it fitter for me to be one of the last in writing to you than to take place according to my desire of serving you which would suffer me to yield to none but lest this acknowledgment should be taken for a pretense to cover laziness i will here give you such a sight of things as i have and intend to continue to do the like as often as i can without troubling you you will have heard from all hands what temper the house of commons appears to be of and that the earl of danby has accomplished his promise of bringing it into an entire subjection unto the kings will as well as the other two points of paying his majestys debts increasing his treasure and rendering him considerable amongst his neighboring princes which are verified in leaving twenty two shillings and ten pence in the exchequer two and forty hundred thousand pounds of passive debts and the revenue anticipated for almost a year and half and the account his lordship was pleased to give in his speech to the peers of the esteem the king of france had for his person and government notwithstanding all this he is so far considered at court that his concernments are a general obstruction to all businesses the lord berckely frecheville and others of the learned think he has behaved himself so well as to deserve no punishment and therefore opposed the commitment of the bill of attainder that it might be cast out shaftsbury essex and halifax differing something in opinion from them in compliance unto the kings desires did as an amendment wipe out the word attainder and made it almost the same with that which their lordships had formerly sent up to banish him and declaring him attainted only if he came into england after the first of may next the consideration of which business is likely this day to possess the house of commons and if their mind be known before this letter be sealed it shall be inserted  the next important point likely to be pursued is to prosecute the last weeks vote that all the forces now on foot in england except the trained bands were kept up contrary to law and though it was objected that the kings guards and the garrisons of portsmouth and other places would be included it was answered that kings governing justly according to law had no need of custodia corporis and that it was better to have no garrisons at all than such as were commanded by leg holmes and their peers  the controversy concerning the election at grinstead was determined at the committee in favor of mr powell chosen by the commons and thomas pelham by the major part of the corporation no complaint being made against him powell choosing to stand as he is chosen for ciciter the dispute upon the new election is like to be between skrog and sir thomas littleton who is like to have the assistance of the dorset family the pelhams and some others on friday last the same committee voted the right of election at windsor to be in the commons and that ernely and his companion having been unduly chosen by the corporation a new election should be made but the house approving of the first part only annulled the election of ernely and the other and approved that of winhood and storkey  all foreign affairs are at a stand only van beuninghen takes great pains to make people believe the king of france intends to add england unto his other conquests and disabuse such as were so foolish as to believe there was any thing of truth in the reports of those that had spoken of the popish plot and finding me infected with the same opinion with some of my friends he was pleased to spend two hours the other day in the park to convince me of my error in which he did succeed as well as he used to do in his great designs  the king certainly inclines not to be so stiff as formerly in advancing only those that exalt prerogative but the earl of essex and some others that are coming into play thereupon cannot avoid being suspected of having intentions different from what they have hitherto professed  the earl of ormonds miscarriages are so extreme and his favor to the irish so apparent that few believe he can continue in the government of ireland some speak of three justices and a good commander of the army wholly fixed upon an english interest but if a lieutenant be sent i believe it will be essex or halifax  that you may see the good humor we are in i here enclosed send you a piece of poetry given unto me by a friend of yours and if you have not seen another which is the speech of writ by andrew marvel hodge the clown from the top of the pyramid i will endeavor to send it unto you  the house of commons have this day presented unto the lords the articles drawn against the five lords in the tower i also hear just now that they do adhere to the bill of attainder of the earl of danby and will no ways admit of the lords amendments of it one reading a lawyer not long since offered four thousand pounds and three hundred pounds a year in land to bedloe if he would disavow the testimony he had given against the lords of powys bellassys and peters which being communicated unto prince robert and earl of essex he brought reading by their advice into a place where two witnesses heard him whereupon reading was apprehended and he having found means whilst he was in the serjeants hands to send a letter to his wife to be delivered to mr chyvins desiring to be admitted to the kings presence promising to tell great matters his majesty refers him wholly to the house of commons and offers to issue out a commission of oyer and terminer for his trial which will be very speedy if he save not himself by discoveries this morning a letter was intercepted written to him by his wife wherein she tells him that every body says he is a rogue and if he does not confess all he will be hanged and she together with her children ruined  i am your most humble servant  london april      sir you are so much aforehand in obliging me when i most wanted a friend that i cannot hope in a long time to pay my debt though i were in a place that gave me more advantages than any i can ever reasonably expect but you may ever be sure of all that is within my reach i write now in some haste but am unwilling this post should go without a letter from me i presume you know that the earl of danby rendered himself to the black rod on wednesday last and that desiring of the lords at the bar that for his health he might be suffered to continue under his custody that he might have recourse as often as occasion should require to all state papers that were necessary to him in making his defense that he might at once have a copy of all his charge and be obliged not to answer to any part until the whole were before him and that he might have sergeant weston sergeant raymond mr sanders and mr holt assigned unto him for counsel he received no other answer than that if he told what papers he desired the house would do as was usual in those cases that the house of commons could not be abridged of the liberty retained to itself of bringing in additional charges if it were thought fit that he might have for his counsel such of those he had named as were not of the kings and that he must be committed to the tower where cheek received him subtle men find great mysteries in his rendering himself and make the king to be of the plot but those that see no farther than i believe he has had in this and all his businesses of late no other counsel than his lady  you will perhaps be surpised to hear that yesterday the king did entirely dissolve his old privy council and chose a new one consisting of fifteen officers of the crown ten lords and five commoners his majesty retaining unto himself the liberty of naming a president calling such princes of the blood as should be from time to time and the secretary of scotland for the time being if he thought fit declaring moreover that whenever any place should be vacant he would name none without the advice of the council and that the person named should be called by a letter subscribed by them all to which he was pleased to add that he would have no first or principal minister no committee of foreign affairs or cabinet council but that in all things he would follow and rely upon their advice next unto that of his great council the parliament which was also specified in the letter sent by his majesty for the calling of every one of them who are now to serve in council the officers who by their places are to be of the council as i remember are the chancellor chief justice privy seal ormond steward arlington chamberlain sussex as first commissioner of the treasury sir henry capell as first commissioner of the admiralty the chancellor of the exchequer the archbishop of canterbury and bishop of london the two secretaries and some others that i have forgot but newport and mainard are none the lords are the dukes of newcastle and albemarle the marquesses of winchester and worcester earls of bridgewater and salisbury viscounts faulconbridge and halifax barons roberts and hollys commoners are the lords russel and cavendish mr powell mr seymour and as i hear sir william temple i hear also seven commissioners named for the admiralty sir henry capell merres littleton vaughan mr daniel finch and two others that i have forgotten the lord shaftsbury is declared president of the council these were sworn this morning and that ceremony being performed the king went to the house of lords and sent for the house of commons to whom he did impart all that had passed and all that i have yet spoken with seem much pleased though it might have been wished that some of those that are chosen had been left out a friend marquess of halifax earls of sunderland and essex see letter of may the   th p of yours and mine is as far as i understand the author of all this and if he and two more can well agree amongst themselves i believe they will have the management of almost all businesses and may bring much honor to themselves and good to our nation  i find mens hearts much set upon taking the government of ireland out of the earl of ormonds hands if a lieutenant be named i believe it will be essex or halifax and if neither of them three justices  others design halifax successor to his uncle coventry you will perhaps wonder not to hear his brother william mentioned but as yet there is no occasion for it  we have every day foolish alarms from the french fleet and i find no body but the lord sunderland and myself that believe not one word of it morgan governor of jersey is dead and laheer appointed to succeed him that our affairs may be managed by as able a man abroad as that island is defended by sir h goodrike expects in a few days to be dispatched for spain we do not yet see what effect the death of the king of sweden will have as to the peace of europe i received the good piece of poetry that i sent you from the lord halifax you should have hodges speech by this post but it is very long and i must write it in my own hand which obliges me to stay until the next week the house of commons has been all this day upon sir john hubberts petition concerning the election of knights of the shire for norfolk but i know not the success  i am your most humble and faithful servant  london april    on this day was a sennight i writ unto you what i had heard of the passages of the foregoing week and though i make no doubt but you have many that give you far better accounts of what is done than i am able to do i will not make that an excuse for silence lest others should allege the same and covering true laziness with fained modesty leave you in the dark as my friends did me when i was abroad  the five popish lords in the tower had at the first given in cavilling uncertain answers but bellassys and peters on thursday and powys stafford and arundell on saturday without any ambiguity pleaded not guilty and declared they put themselves upon the lords justice  the earl of danby has not thought fit as yet to deal so clearly but has put in a huge long answer containing great protestations of his own innocence as to every part of his charge and then pleads his pardon which enumerates and acquits him of all the crimes that it is almost possible for a man to commit this is by some thought very strange his innocence that he protests declaring that he had no need of pardon and the pardon pleaded in effect acknowledging the truth of his charge it being useless if he be not guilty hereupon other questions do arise as whether the king can pardon whether if he have this power he has rightly executed it the formalities not having been observed and lastly whether he will insist upon this answer which will not leave him any plea at all if the pardon be judged defective i dare give no opinion upon these points but i hear the learned say the king cannot pardon a man impeached by parliament upon a public account that though he could this would be of no value being defective in all the formalities and though perhaps the court may be prevalent enough in the house of lords to have it admitted that would be of evil consequence no man doubting but the house of commons will extremely dislike such a judgment and grow very refractory thereupon and the whole nation would follow them in it so as all business would be thereby obstructed by which means the king upon the personal account of the earl of danby would lose the advantage of all that has been done of late to please the nation which i leave to your judgment that know the court much better than i do this point i only find to be clear that if the pardon can be found good though the formalities are wanting it will be made good and the burden left upon the chancellor that put the great seal unto it without taking care of seeing them observed  some judges were yesterday put out wild for inability of body and barton and thurland of mind with some others to whom old else raymond and pemmerton leake and atkins the younger are to succeed the house of lords is busy upon one bill concerning popery and the house of commons upon another both inclining to find a way of distinguishing protestants only from papists but cannot yet resolve upon it so as to include the several dissenting sects that papists may not be sheltered and receive the indulgence which is not intended them under other names and this difficulty is chiefly occasioned by the quakers who for more than one reason are thought least to deserve much to be cared for shaftsbury and halifax are eminent in pleading for indulgence to tenderconscienced protestants and severity against papists the first of these said the other day he neither could live with or under a papist on saturday it was reported to the house of commons that the lord cottington who died many years ago in spain had appointed an epitaph to be written upon his tomb expressing his desire that his body might rest there until england were restored to the church and then carried over this it was the last year and a warrant was produced from the earl of danby to the commissioners of the customs to let it pass  yesterday was appointed extraordinary by the house of commons to consider of the succession of the crown in relation to popery upon the debate of which secretary coventry amongst other things is said to have reproached birch that his discourses savoured of the years    0 and    but that himself continued in the same mind he had ever been and having taken the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to the king and his successors could not without perjury fail of performing the contents of them to his successor what religion soever he should happen to be of unto which birch replied asserting his own services to the king taxing coventry of having broken his word to the parliament twice the last year in relation to a war promised to be declared and actually made upon france disserved the king and nation in having been a principal cause of breaking the triple league and concluded he was as fit to be turned out of the council as any one that had been so bennet not long before had said that though this council seemed in some degree to be reformed no good could reasonably be expected as long as one continued in it who did by such violences and other undue ways advance arbitrary power in scotland and one that had masses daily said for him in ireland for the first of these he named latherdale and left the house in an opinion that for the other he meant anglesey at the last it was concluded that the king should be desired to give order for the execution of pickering and another condemned priest that a proclamation should be issued to banish all papists without any other exceptions than public ministers and their followers twenty miles out of london the lady portsmouth was named but not pursued that the duke of york being a papist the hopes of his succeeding unto the crown had been the principal ground and foundation of the plot against the kings life and the protestant religion that the secret committee should on wednesday next bring into the house such letters and papers as they had in their hands relating unto the said duke the concurrence of the lords is desired as to the proclamation and the first vote concerning the duke and the lord russell notwithstanding his being a privy counselor appointed to carry up the message they also voted an address to be made to the king that all seaports places of strength and command of ships may be put into trusty hands and concluded to refer the farther consideration of this business to wednesday next and i believe it will be then debated whether such an association shall be entered into as was appointed in queen elizabeths time or an act made that this parliament should not determine in such a time as should be limited though the king should die or in so many months after or something to that purpose which may tend to the kings security i do not well know what the houses have done this morning but hear the message from the house of commons is carried up to the lords and that they have appointed the earl of danby to be at their bar tomorrow morning the commons have also perfected their bill for disbanding of the army by a land tax of twenty thousand pounds the month subsequent to that which will expire in february next several priests were taken the last night of which two confess they were sent over by all means to endeavor to invalidate oats and bedloes testimony reading was this morning in the pillory and is condemned to a years imprisonment and  000 pounds fine for having endeavored to corrupt bedloe stubbs the countess of shrewsburys butler confesses he had been induced by three priests to gain as many servants as he could to set fire on their masters houses of which a wench was apprehended for firing her masters in fetterlane  i am your most humble servant  london may     though the last week was spent rather in wrangling than the dispatch of any business of importance i continue to give you an account of what i hear because these irregular motions are often the forerunners of great matters and as they denote the temper of a nation they give good grounds of guessing what they will end in i do not send you the king and chancellors speeches because i presume care was taken to send them to you by the last post but perhaps others have not been so free in telling you the effect of it as i shall be the courtiers did believe that the kings yielding that the parliament should not end with his life or be revived by his death if it chanced to be dissolved in his lifetime and have the nomination of all officers both civil and military if his successor proved to be a papist would have given entire satisfaction unto the house of commons but to the contrary it is certain that the supposition that the next in blood must be king though a papist is so distastful to them that nothing will please upon that odious condition and as to this particular it is looked upon as a trick to bring the parliament to confess and confirm the dukes title that is a little gilding to cover a poisonous pill this puts them upon various counsels some would impeach him upon what is discovered of his part in the plot others incline more to bring in an act to exclude him from the succession of the crown as being a papist and thereby a friend unto and dependent upon a foreign and enemy power some of those that are of this mind look who is fittest to succeed if this should be and they are for the most part divided between the prince of orange and duke of monmouth the first has plainly the most plausible title by his mother and his wife but besides the opinion of the influence it is believed the duke of york would have over him it is feared that the commonwealthparty in holland would be so frighted with that as to cast itself absolutely into the hands of the king of france who might thereby have a fair occasion of ruining both england and holland i need not tell you the reasons against monmouth but the strongest i hear alleged for him are that whosoever is opposed to york will have a good party and all scotland which is every day like to be in arms does certainly favor him and may probably be of as much importance in the troubles that are now likely to fall upon us as they were in the beginning of the last others are only upon negatives but when i have said what i can upon this business i must confess i do not know three men of a mind and that a spirit of giddiness reigns amongst us far beyond any i have ever observed in my life  nothing was done the last week concerning the popish lords in the tower the earl of danby on saturday last did insist upon his former plea and answer how little sense soever there be in it some say it is ex industria perplexa and that having the court and house of lords to favor him he cares not for the inconsistence of protesting his innocence which renders his pardon useless and pleading his pardon which is a confession of guilt hoping that if the commons do demur in law upon the two points first that the king cannot pardon a delinquent impeached by one commoner much less by all the commons in england secondly that though it were granted he might pardon this pardon could not hold because it wants all the formalities the lords would overruled it and then he is acquitted  the bill for the habeas corpus was passed by the lords on friday last and sent down to the commons the same day they also passed an act for the banishing of the papists out of london and penned it so well by the industry of the bishops that if the commons should pass it without amendment all the nonconformists of london would be driven out of town and half the shops shut up the bill for disbanding the army is passed the two houses and i presume will not stay long for the royal assent the lords did assent to the vote of the commons that the duke being a papist had been the occasion of the plot but added the word unwillingly the whole business formerly mentioned of the earl of danby his endeavor to suborn bedloe to renounce his testimony was the last week verified before a committee of lords and dumblain his man confessed he had been employed to do it so as his lordship is found to have done just the same thing for which reading stood the last week in the pillory some scholars sent from st omers were lately apprehended by sir william waller and confess they are sent hither by the jesuits by any means to invalidate oats and bedloes testimonies but they rather confirm them the lord ross having been put out of the house of commons is by writ called to the house of lords sir john hartup who petitioned against him is upon the invalidating of his election chosen by the freeholders of the county and took his place in the house on friday this day is appointed for the new election in norfolk and it is thought sir john hubbert will have the same success  sir i desire you to tell monsieur de ruvygny the younger that upon his recommendation i did address the duke de gramonts esquire to the places where all the best horses in england were to be had but he has rid four hundred miles and is returned without liking any to say the truth he is such a proud ass that he neither knows what is good nor will believe any body else i had directed him to see two that are said to be as fine young horses of five years old as any are in england which having never been trained were fat and as he said trop relever near lincoln he saw two of the lord castletowns which had the same faults at the lord burlingtons in yorkshire he saw one that is thought to be worth as much as any one in england bred of an arabian six years old passed never run but once at kippling and then won the plate and being now thin and drawn for another course he is to run within this week this wise gentleman took him for a mazette he did the like with some others in the same place and at the marquess of winchesters upon all which i have no more to say to mons ruvygny than that he should find a way to revive bucephalus or send a man that has more wit than this to take such as the world affords  the horrible reports made from france of poisoning affright reasonable persons here as much as the discourses of the fleet at breast do fools  the house of commons have voted that the pardon pretended by the earl of danby was of no value and went up to desire justice upon him of the house of lords we live in a time that no man by what is passed can well judge what is to be expected for the future but i am much inclined to believe that danby having in this last act followed his own disposition that ever delighted in juggling and indirectness will by the tricks he has played have found a way to hang himself it is said that the king will be at the house tomorrow in his robes to pass the act for disbanding the army this morning secretary coventry not being well the lord russel from the king declared unto the house of commons he expected no supply from them this sessions but desired care might be taken of the navy  i am your most humble and faithful servant  may    i have received your letter of may    and continue my custom of giving you once a week an account of what comes to my knowledge though to discourage me i can only make the unpleasant relations of such disorders here as in my opinion threaten us with the greatest mischiefs that can befall a nation the three that i meant in my letter that you would have me explain were the earls of sunderland essex and halifax and i am still of the same mind so far as the power of the court goes  the last week was spent for the most part in janglings between the two houses upon points of privilege relating unto the rights the lords pretend unto in points of judicatories which the lords frecheville berckely ferrers aylesbury northampton and some others equal unto them in understanding eloquence and reputation do with the help of the bishops very magnanimously defend several proposals have been made by the commons of conferring with them upon all the points in question or appointing a committee of both houses which meeting together might adjust all those that might be occasion of difference but their lordships disdaining to confer upon points that as they did suppose depended wholly upon their will on friday last did vote that they would have no such committee which vote was carried only by two voices the one side having    the other    of eighteen bishops that were present sixteen were on the victorious side and only durham and carlisle were so humble as to join with the vanquished of those    one and fifty the next day protested and i think only laziness hindered the earl of leicester who was the other not to protest as well as the others with whom he had voted on saturday there was a conference between the two houses upon this business and it appearing that all proceedings would stop thereupon it being impossible for two to agree upon any thing unless their thoughts and reasons are communicated they were pleased yesterday to recede from that vote and appointed a committee of twelve lords to confer with a double number of commons thereupon  the house of commons have made an address unto his majesty desiring him to remove the duke of latherdale out of all employments in england and ireland and from his presence for ever to which they received a dilatory answer  the archbishop of st andrews has been lately murdered in his coach three miles from st andrews by ten men that there set upon him of which two were taken by some horse that came suddenly to the place it is not known who they are nor who employed them but latherdale is graciously pleased to lay it upon the nonconformists and has thereupon caused a very severe proclamation to be issued out against them but others believe it was upon a private quarrel with some gentlemen that by fraud and power the prelate had thrown out of their estates he having been most remarkable for outrageous covetousness besides other episcopal qualities  the house of commons have forbidden all commoners of england to be of counsel to the earl of danby under the pain of being esteemed betrayers of the rights of all the commons by whom he is accused unless leave be asked and given by them the bill for disbanding the army is passed on saturday the king having appointed sixteen small pieces of ordnance to be sent to portsmouth notice was taken thereof in the house of commons and a great suspicion that they being sent with fieldcarriages harnesses for horses and all necessaries belonging to the train of a marching army they might be intended rather for such an use than to furnish a garrison as is pretended at the same time reports were spread that the duke of york was returned into england or hourly expected and some believe his business is to hinder the disbanding of the army with such others as the knowledge of his nature together with the persons that command in portsmouth the isle of wight and some other places may suggest in the most jealous time that i have ever lived in  the house of commons sat yesterday being sunday to hear such papers read as the secret committee thought fit to produce relating to the duke of york which had been found amongst the cardinal of norfolks papers and other places they are many in number which speak of his assenting unto and approving of the plot in all points but none directed to him or written by him many various motions were made but in the end it was ordered that a bill should be drawn up to debar him from the succession of the crown sir francis winnington and mr vaughan would have put off the debate until the trial os danby and the popish lords was over sir william coventry sir thomas littleton and others spoke directly against the thing but the major part by much was of the other opinion so as on the division appointed upon the question whether there should be candles the inequality was so great that the pains of telling was spared and when the main question was put there was no division at all not to trouble you with many particulars i will only recite one which is that a gentleman moving the words should be put in or ever had been a papist they were laid aside as some believe in respect unto him who by the direction of the late lord crofts was brought up under the discipline of the peers de loratorie the next work was to make an address to his majesty full of humility and loyalty expressing their utmost resolution to serve him with their lives and fortunes in the preservation of the protestant religion  i hope the new method resolved upon here in relation unto public ministers will be of as little prejudice unto you where you are as the report of the occasion which began with you will do you here  i am your most humble and faithful servant london may    london may    i have been abroad all this day and come with a head so disordered with the east wind and dust that i can say very little this night the lords and commons have not yet found the way of agreeing upon the method of trying the earl of danby and the other lords the bishops are the principal causes of the dispute affecting a right to sit as judges and content themselves to leave the exercise of it to the papists but with a protestation that the precedent be not alleged against them for the future but insist upon sitting in the earl of danbys case until they come to vote upon life or death and to show how ingenious they are in that point they profess they do no prejudice to their calling in being his judges resolving not to condemn him the truth is that business is full of a multitude of difficulties that are very hard to decide the chief of which are first whether the king has power to pardon one impeached by the commons secondly whether that judgment belonging to the declaratory part of the law is to be given by one or both houses thirdly in case the king can pardon whether this has the formalities required fourthly if this pardon be not good whether he may be admitted to plead any thing else fifthly if he may plead whether the points he is accused of amount to treason which may probably exercise the house until it be dissolved or prorogued the two houses differ also in that the lords would first try the popish lords and the commons would give the preference to danby  the duke hamilton arrived the last week from scotland with a great train and was received here in triumph all that come with him say the archbishop of st andrews was killed by one that had been his own steward and others that were not conventiclemen  the severe bill against the duke of york was read on thursday last and is appointed to be read again tomorrow it recites the popes pretensions to power over kings particularly in england the immorality of the roman religion incompatibility of those that profess it with english protestants their perpetual plots against the government sedulity in seducing the duke and a multitude of other things of the like nature in the preamble asserts the power of parliament to dispose of the succession as best conduced to the good of the kingdom which had been often exercised in debarring those that were nearest in blood but never with so much reason as now wherefore it does enact that the duke should be and was thereby excluded declares him attainted of high treason if he landed in england before or after the kings death forbids commerce or correspondency with him under the same penalty of treason this pleases the city so well that a petition is framing there which will be presented in two days signed by one hundred thousand men to give thanks unto the parliament for their vigorous proceeding in discovering the plot and opposing of popery and promising to assist them in so doing with their lives and fortunes  the committee of lords being informed that some important papers were hid in a wall at tarthall they sent to break it and in a copper box found those which the attorney general says give more light into the plot than all they had formerly seen but most particularly against the lord stafford i am almost asleep and can only assure you  i am your most humble and faithful servant  london june     your nephew arrived here last night and i going to welcome him received your letter from him his friends find he bears in his face too fair marks of a spanish journey but in all things else i believe he will give them as entire satisfaction as unto me who ever had an extraordinary good opinion of him  this day was sennight the prorogation of the parliament was spoken of but being then uncertain and as i thought not like to be i was not willing to mention it but it fell out the next day and all mens wits have been screwed ever since that day to find out the consequences every body has had his conjecture and the most ignorant showed themselves the most bold in asserting their opinions many find that the king would not have done it if he had not resolved to send for the duke keep up the army desire assistances from abroad sell jersey and tangier to the french for which mr savile is to make the bargain set the earl of danby at liberty and with the help of the papists and bishops set up for himself but instead of this we see little reason to believe the duke will think himself well here the army is in part disbanded and had been entirely before this day if it had pleased colonel birch the place from whence the foreign assistances should come is not known mr savile is not thought very good at such treaties the earl of danby is like to lie where he is and the utmost help his majesty can for ought i hear expect until the parliament do meet is by fox kent and duncombs credit which perhaps will not be found to be a very steady foundation no man will avow having been the kings counselor in this business and some wonder that his majesty in constituting the privy council having promised that he would have no cabinet council but that he would in all things follow their advices next unto those of his great council the parliament should so suddenly prorogue that great council without so much as asking the other this fills men with many ill humors the parliament men go down discontented and are like by their reports to add unto the discontents of the countries which are already very great and the fears from the papists at home and their friends abroad being added thereunto they begin to look more than formerly unto the means of preserving themselves  there has been a suit at law in scotland between the earl of argyle and one macclaine a great man in the highlands and the earl as is said by the favor of duke latherdale has obtained a decree for the lands in question which by order from hence is to be put in execution by the strength of all the kings forces in scotland and fire and sword to be used in case they find resistance as probably they will macclaine resolving he will not be turned out of his ancient inheritance by a trick in law and a decree from corrupt judges this man being head of a numerous and stout people helped by the fastness and poverty of their country may perhaps make good what he proposes unto himself and to show he is not to be surprised he has already entered into argyles country with  00 or  000 men the earl of athol is his neighbor friend and enemy to argyle so as it is believed he may give him secret assistance at the first and afterward more openly about the same time a proclamation was there published making it treason to be present at any of the fieldconventicles that are armed and every man knowing the pressures they are exposed unto if they go disarmed they must incurr the penalties or abstain wholly from going which they will hardly be persuaded unto things being thus brought unto extremities the king has been persuaded to give a hearing unto what the duke hamilton and other scotch lords have to say against latherdale as is appointed before the council  two associates were offered unto sir thomas chichely for the better executing of his office of master of the ordnance but he thinking that an affront to a man of so eminent abilities as himself refused them which has obliged the king to dismiss him from the place and put it into commission as some others have been sir thomas littleton sir william hickman and sir joseph lowther are said to be the men if what is said be true the ill management of the treasury was not more extreme than this of the ordnance for besides the extravagancies of furnishing the french armies with arms and ammunition whereas the stores where fuller two years ago than ever they were known to have been there are now but six hundred muskets in the tower and other things in proportion  some think these ways of employing many parliament men may strengthen the kings party in the house others think that a king is ever a loser when he enters into a faction and bandys against his subjects besides that these men will lose their credit and having only single votes will be overpowered by number i do not find the new privy counselors well at ease and am not free from sear that whilst they endeavor to keep fair with both parties they may give distaste unto both harry sydney is to go envoy extraordinary into holland and yesterday the king declared unto him his intention to that purpose  vanlieu the holland ambassador is arrived and van beuninghen going away he made the last week a great noise about a message sent by the king of france unto his masters concerning the contributionmoney due from the country about breda denouncing in a very terrible manner his intention of levying it by force if it were not paid and that in an ottoman style which unto some silly people gave as silly a hope that the peace would break and the league be renewed against the french but the french ambassador says it is a thing of no moment at all and already composed however i see no inclinations in discreet men here to desire such a discomposure of things abroad as should engage us to take any part in them until our affairs are better settled at home than they are yet like to be  ireland is in extreme disorder by the duke of ormonds negligence ignorance and favor to the irish douglass his regiment thinking to use the same licentiousness at kinsale as it had been accustomed unto in france gives great distaste and apprehensions of such works as began almost by the same ways in      old roberts in appearing of late for the king and bishops thinks himself of merit to succeed him but he is as singular in that opinion as in many others  some that know matters better than i do must tell you whether we shall have the same parliament at the end of the prorogation or a new one or none at all but i think this or another will be found necessary and if this be dissolved another will be chosen of less inclinations to favor the court the four priests are sent down to be hanged where they were condemned the council gave order to the lord mayor to be very diligent in putting the proclamations against the papists in execution and careful under that name not to trouble protestant dissenters it is said that langhorne wakeman sir joseph gage sir william goring and other popish commoners shall be soon brought to their trial now the parliament does not sit little news will be stirring but you shall constantly have such as i know or any other service that lies in the power of  your most humble servant  london june     the best news i can now send you is that your nephew and mine is looked upon as we wish and i believe he will perform all that you and i expect from him  there has been a suit at law depending this good while in scotland between the earl of argyle and one macclaine the head of a great and numerous family in the highlands the earl as is said by the help of the duke of latherdale obtained of late a decree for the possession of the lands in question and an order was sent from hence unto the kings officers to assist the earl in executing the decree and use fire and sword against such as should oppose it which was so far prosecuted that he with  00 of the kings men and  00 of his own raised upon an island of macclaines which he was not able to defend or perhaps thought it his best course by way of diversion to draw argyle from thence but what reason soever persuaded him he said he would not be put out of the inheritance of his ancestors by a trick in law and the corruption of the judges and joining the macdonnells unto himself fell into argyles country with near  000 men where he found no resistance the lady of argyle was obliged to leave her house and in some haste retired to edinborough to get relief which could not easily be granted lest the fanatics should take advantage of the kings forces being so employed some say this is only a family feud others believe it has a deeper root but whatsoever this is no man doubts of the truth of the news brought hither by an express on saturday morning which is that the conventiclemen in the county of glascow are in arms that one captain grimes coming something too near them with his troop and other forces was beaten back with the loss of his cornet and fourteen troopers which according to the posture he found them in he was persuaded to content himself with rather than to press farther the council was called upon this occasion on saturday last but nothing as i hear resolved until they hear more some doubting whether it be a laid business or a sudden tumult raised by accident i know not the truth of this but the discourses i have heard very often of late of those who every day expected some such thing persuades me to believe it is not fallen out by chance though no resolution was taken at council upon this matter it is said that private orders are given out to several officers of the late disbanded troops to get their men again together and to others upon the most plausible pretenses that they can invent to delay their disbanding as much as may be these suspicions go too far and already reach some of your friends and mine to such a degree that counselors are rather said to be changed than councils and if they do not find a way to cure that sore at the next meeting of the parliament they will be looked on as their predecessors if nothing from scotland hinders the court will go to windsor tomorrow i presume you know that h sydney has bought mr godolphins place of master of the robes gives  000 pounds and is to go envoy extraordinary into holland the lord ranalagh for the same sum paid to the lord sunderland is made gentleman of the bedchamber in his place and the great business concerning his account is referred to the council in ireland  many things may pass in the town that you may be willing to hear but they come not into the cell that covers  your most humble servant  london june      the scotch news that i mentioned to you last week does still possess the minds of all men here but all relations that come from scotland are so imperfect that no man knows what to make of them and those that come to court being more particularly so than others no men are thought to understand less of the business than privy counselors this is attributed to latherdale and though it be concluded that what he says is not true some think the business worse others better than it is represented the fact as far as i hear is that the earl of lithco with above five and twenty hundred horse and foot did come within a few miles of the conventiclemen and finding them in such a posture as he did not think it prudent to charge them he concluded the best was to let them take glascow where they are said to have found good store of arms ammunition and some cannon and having left so many men in the town as are thought sufficient to guard it they march with four pieces they are said to increase in number every day but we know nothing of them certainly unless it be that they have no landed men amongst them nor any gentlemen but a younger brother to a knight of the hamilton family the last week we heard of nothing but raising of great forces to subdue these rebels the dukes of monmouth albemarle and lord garret were to have regiments of horse feversham one of dragoons and grenadiers the lord cavendish gray of werk mr t thin and some others regiments of foot but that heat seems to be something abated the lord gray gave up his commission mr thin refused to take any cavendish does not raise any men upon his and garret swears he will not be at a penny charge to raise a man but if the commissioners for the treasury will raise him a regiment and provide money to pay it he will command it whilst ways were sought to remove these difficulties the scotch lords that are here endeavored to persuade the king that the business may be ended by far more certain and less chargeable ways in as much as these men having been driven into a necessity of taking arms by the extreme pressure suffered from those that did abuse the authority his majesty had trusted them with the people being eased of those burdens the persons removed that had caused them and such men placed in the government as were acceptable to the nation they durst undertake that all may be composed without blood this was not as i hear disliked but another point was started that does yet more incline the court to mild courses which is in the year      acts of parliament were made in both kingdoms making it treason for any person belonging unto either to make war upon or invade the other without the consent of parliament and though one or two of the judges say that the acts being reciprocal the scots having rescinded theirs ours falls of itself or though it did not the act forbidding an invasion no ways touches such as by the kings command should go to subdue rebels others say that what the scots did might indeed give unto the parliament of england a just ground of annulling their act also but not having done it no man can doubt but it remains in force and whosoever marches against scotland incurrs the penalties of treason denounced by it and some that were present at the making of it are so far from approving the distinction between invading and subduing rebels as to say that the parliament then finding they had been upon the like pretense engaged against scotland in      and    made this act expressly to hinder any such a business as that which is now depending and to take care that england should never be again engaged against scotland without the consent of the parliament which was also the reason why the act was continued in force on our side though it was dissolved on theirs this renders men of estates unwilling to engage and hereupon the duke of monmouth was sent away yesterday in such haste as to carry no more company with him than could go in one day to your good town of newark where he was to lodge the last night he is furnished with powers of indulgence to compose rather than destroy and the lord melvin who is thought well enough inclined to nonconformists and well liked by them is sent with him as being thought a fit minister of a good agreement the foot that was embarked in the thames is gone for barwick where it is to stay to secure the town and the other forces that are newly entertained are to continue only for a month this looks as if your friend latherdale may within a while be lest as naked as the earl of danby the army is almost every where disbanded unless it be these that upon this occasion are again taken into pay and the countries almost every where express the utmost hatred unto them as soon as they have laid down their arms douglas his regiment now in ireland as is said has orders to march into scotland which giving people occasion to talk of that country they say that the king having lately placed the greatest powers of the three kingdoms in the hands of the three worst men that could be found in them can never be at ease until they are all sacrificed to expiate the faults of the government and appease the discontents of the nation  harry sydney has his instructions for holland sir henry goodrike is going into spain as a pattern by which that court may judge of the wit and good sense of our nation on friday last harcourt whitebread and three other priests were at the old baily found guilty of the plot and condemned as traitors on saturday the like sentence passed upon langhorne the trials were in all respects fair even by the confession of the adversaries the arraigned persons placed all the hopes of their defense upon the invalidating of oats his testimony to which end they had about    witnesses sent from st omers to assert that they had seen him every day in may and june was a twelve month at st omers and consequently he could not be here as he does assert but as three of them having been apprehended by sir will waller at their first coming told him they were come to be witnesses and being asked what they were to witness they said they must know that from their superiors it did plainly appear at the trial that they were ready to say whatever they were bid and oats did plainly prove by a knight and two of his servants two protestant parsons a popish priest and some others that he was here at that time so as his testimony was taken without dispute this is a dangerous leading case for the lords in the tower whose principal hopes were to invalidate the testimony of oats bedloe and dugdale all which being confirmed by the judgment of a jury in the face of all london cannot be questioned wakeman was to have been tried the same day but being arraigned the trial was put off for a month as is said at the solicitation of the portugal ambassador and in a way that to many seemed scandalous if the scotch business be settled the king will go to windsor as he intended you may remember that the last year four irishmen were spoken of for having been sent down thither to attempt upon the kings life it is now said that one antonio a servant to the queen told one belonging to the duke of monmouth at that time that four irishmen were expected there about a business of great importance and the kings harbinger says four such were then recommended to him as men he must take a care of and see well lodged how little soever i have to say i fill my paper like a gazette and have room only to add that i am  your humble and faithful servant  london june    july   i told you in my last that the duke of monmouth was gone toward scotland since which time reports have been so various that no man well knows what to make of that business and the cause of this uncertainty is imputed to the diligence of the kings officers who intercept and keep all letters directed unto persons any ways suspected so as no more is known than they think fit to divulge an express arrived here on saturdaynight from edinburgh and brought news that the duke of monmouth arrived there on wednesday that he had been received with great joy and as much honor as those that were there could show unto him that the council having been immediately called he exposed unto them his commission which was very well liked that the chancellor invited him to supper that night and that he was the next morning to go to the army having first sent an express to the lord lithco that commands it no ways to engage in any action before he comes some think that he has the conventiclemen at an advantage and will pursue it to their destruction others say that upon the extreme aversion that is shown all over england to a war in scotland and the little probability yet appearing of the parliaments being any ways engageable in it he has received much more gentle instructions and intends by the help of the lord melvin to compose those businesses if he can and if he can accomplish it will certainly render himself very popular in england and scotland  the duke hamilton and some other scotch lords having let his majesty know that the disorders in scotland proceeded only from the extreme pressures the people was brought under by those who contrary to law abused the power his majesty had trusted them with did undertake to finish all without blood if he would be pleased to ease them of those pressures and removing those who had caused them put the government of the kingdom into the hands of such persons as were wellpleasing unto the nation this having been taken into consideration for some days the duke hamilton with the rest and one lockart were sent for by the king who told them the points formerly spoken of did relate unto his prerogative which in three points he would not suffer to be touched  st that he having a right of disposing of all places might incapacitate such persons as he should think fit  dly that it belonging to him to prevent conspiracies he might secure and imprison suspected persons and that there was no such thing as a habeas corpus in scotland nor should be as long as he lived  dly that it being his part to prevent or to quell rebellions he might raise such forces as he pleased quarter them where he thought fit and employ them as occasion should require to which lockart replied that the places in question were those belonging to counties and corporations which had ever been chosen by the people respectively according to their charters and forasmuch as concerns conspiracies and rebellions he thought he could prove that what his majesty did assert did neither agree with the laws of scotland nor any other law nor the ends for which that or any other government was constituted  the next point in discourse was concerning some articles exhibited against latherdale in which it is said that his majesty for several years passed had been utterly misinformed and never known the truth of any thing relating unto scotland but been guided by such reports as best suited with latherdales interests that he had been thereby induced to bring down the last year that army of barbarous highlanders upon pretense of mutinous and seditious fieldconventicles whereas such meetings as had been were modest and quiet and quartered them in those countries where there never had been any at all several other misdemeanors are said to be mentioned and amongst others that of michell who had been put to death after having had a promise of life and limb by false oaths made by latherdale and some others of the privy council the conclusion was the king commanded the duke that these articles should not be made public in which he excused himself forasmuch as having done nothing in the dark several copies had been taken which were not in his power some say we shall this day see them in print with the declaration of the conventiclemen printed at glascow which is very well worth seeing the forces of these conventiclemen or as they call themselves the western army are variously reported some say they have   000 or   000 men others that this day was a sennight they had not far from stirling between two and three thousand horse well armed and mounted with about the like number of foot that a brother of the earl of galloway was coming to them and within three hours march with above four hundred horse and foot and that they had parties of good strength in several other places  the five priests formerly condemned were executed on saturday confessing nothing langhorne is reprieved for some time upon his offer to confess that which shall deserve his life the earl of shaftsbury has been twice with him but as is said has as yet gained nothing from him but the discovery of some lands belonging to the jesuits franciscans and benedictins not exceeding two thousand pounds a year which will not save his life wakeman is to be tried this week at the kings bench bar his relations desire he should confess and think he will it is said that about this time was a twelvemonth some women visiting his wife saw a daughter of his growing up to be marriageable which gave occasion to the gossips to ask the mother what portion she should have to which she answered that if one thing hit right sir george would give her ten thousand pounds which people now reflecting upon together with the life and estate of the person believe that one thing which was to enable him to give so large a portion was the   000 pounds which was promised him to poison the king  there is a certain petition preparing in london to be presented unto the king which as is said will be signed by many lords gentlemen and all the principal householders of the city of london taking notice of the army having been raised upon pretense of the french war kept up by danbys means contrary to an act of parliament as a standing army in the next place it mentions the acts of parliament made in england and scotland making it treason for the subjects of either kingdom to invade the other or the subjects thereof giving power and enjoining all other subjects of either to fall upon and destroy such as should in any time attempt to do it as rebels and traitors and showing the dangerous consequences of forcing the protestants of his kingdom to imbrue their hands in each others blood if according to the rumor spread of a war in scotland any men should contrary to the act march against them desiring his majesty to put an end to their fears in that point compose things there suffer the parliament to meet the   th of august bring danby and others to their trials perfect the disbanding of the army and other newraised forces if this petition do take as some believe it will be sent to the grand juries in the several counties and come up signed by so many as shall approve of it some say the highlanders have laid down their arms and submit the determination of their differences with argyle to the king  the speaker jeffryes is made a baron of the exchequer in the place of leak who resigned it whilst i write this news is come by an express that the duke of monmouth is within a mile of the scotch conventiclemen who lodged them in duke hamiltons little park with so little skill and so much disorder that all men give them for lost i am sure our friends will be so cautious as you wish concerning ticklish places h sydney is to be here again in october but to return after the dispatch of some private businesses i am  your most humble servant p s this long letter was to have been sent by the last post and left by accident till it is in danger of appearing unseasonable a courier arrived the last night from scotland who brings word that the duke of monmouth had attacked the conventiclemen and easily forcing a little barricado they had made to defend a bridge had utterly defeated them some letters say two thousand are killed upon the place but my lord sunderland tells me there is only some hundreds slain many taken and the whole party dissipated and destroyed by which means it is said that the duke of monmouth will have made himself as popular in england and scotland as the duke of york men here will be startled at present but that will not hold the scotch lords here have been so wise as to leave their countrymen to be cut in pieces but as some believe not enough to keep themselves so free from corresponding with them as not to leave that which being well followed may bring their heads to the block i am  your most humble and faithful servant   i shall not be in town on monday to write unto you according to my custom the peace of brandenburgh could not be otherwise than as it is  the gentleman to whom the enclosed is addressed has received one letter that passed through your hands and will wait upon you for this    london june  0 july   i write to you now rather to keep my day than from an opinion that these last days have produced any thing that deserves to be communicated unto you the news concerning the scots mentioned in my last is confirmed by several expresses and all show their defeat to have been entire the party dissipated and those who escaped the fury of the sword remain exposed to the discretion of their conquerors i find mens judgments as various as to the use will be made of this advantage as of the duke of monmouths action in what is passed some did think that they being a poor people brought into despair by the most violent persecution pitied by all both in england and scotland helped by none without head or conduct were to be spared and that in doing so he might have made himself very popular in both kingdoms which he is thought with reason much to desire and best to have provided for the kings interest others who look upon it as a fine thing to kill a great many men and believe monarchies are best kept up by terror extol the action and say there is no other way of suppressing old rebellions or preventing new ones than by force and rigor looking upon caligula as a great statesman and oderint dum metuant as a good maxim some think that the duke of monmouths first instructions were according to the first of these ways but that he was followed by others which savoured much of the second those that were of the first opinion do now think the best way were to compose things there and by showing indulgence not only in sparing those that are obnoxious but in giving them such indulgence in matters of conscience as may satisfy them prevent the like and please the body of the english nation which has given many tokens of being much concerned for them on the other side those are not wanting who think the best way of bringing that stubborn people into subjection and keep em as they call it in peace free from rebellions is to use the utmost rigor upon those that are in their power and to discover who did in any measure assist or abet them and in order thereunto the prisoners are used most cruelly and it is said that at the least forty of the most noted men amongst them shall be put into the boots my lord of latherdale has brought into fashion to make them discover what correspondence the great men held with them i know not how far this may concern some that are or lately have been here but it is probable enough they may have the fortune that ordinarily accompanies them that pretending to be very subtle and keep well with both sides ever do too much or too little and that whereas they might have prevented all tumults if they had endeavored it by denying all manner of favor to the discontented people or reformed the state of that kingdom if they would have taken the conduct of them and very well provided for their own interest by either way may have ruined these poor people by stirring them up and leaving them to themselves brought the whole nation under the power of their enemy and given such advantages against themselves as may be their ruin if they are pursued that is to perish or be saved by the mercy of him they profess to abhor duke hamilton complains he is ruined by this business and that not only all the provisions of victuals and corn and grass upon the ground is destroyed but that there is not a cow one horse or sheep left upon his whole estate and his own house had been plundered if the duke of monmouth had not sent an officer to preserve it but latherdale says he cannot believe that hamiltons friends tenants and servants would so far forget their dependence obligations and good manners as to deal uncivilly with him such as are near unto those who manage businesses may speak positively of them but i must as you see suspend my judgment until the duke of monmouth comes back which is expected in a few days  the petition i mentioned in my last did meet with some interruption but the defeat of the scots put an end to it those who use to extol all that relates to rome admire the constancy of the five priests executed the last week but we simple people find no more in it than that the papists by arts formerly unknown to mankind have found ways of reconciling falsehood in the utmost degree with the hopes of salvation and at the best have no more to brag of than that they have made men dye with lies in their mouths langhornes discoveries being trivial relating only to lands of a small value belonging to convents i think he will be hanged this day or tomorrow wakemans trial is put off as is believed to avoid the indecency of the discourses that would have been made this day and tomorrow will bring all the court to windsor the king is to meet the council every thursday at hampton court and we of the vulgar expect after their first meeting to hear whether the parliament shall meet or no at the time appointed some speak as if our small queen upon pretense of going to burton would be so cruel as to leave us  i am your humble and faithful servant  london july  0 0 if i had a mind to play the politic like a house of commons man newly preferred to be a privy counselor i should very gravely excuse myself for not writing to you by the last post and lay the fault upon my want of leisure putting as much weight upon a lawsuit as they do upon affairs of state but having at their costs learnt that those who make such discourses cheat none but themselves i ingenuously confess i had nothing to say and that now the parliament is prorogued and the court at windsor i hear little more than i shall do when i am dead the truth is some of our friends being newly grown men of business are so politic and secret that a man who sees it can hardly forbear laughing but none is so ingenuous as to be content men should do it except the lord halifax who is sometimes free enough with his companions to begin i long since found that the design of sending h sydney into holland was like the rest of sir william temples projects a matter of great depth and kept so close that not one of them would speak to me of it but this day was a sennight a gentleman that came to see me took a letter out of his pocket newly come from holland wherein the whole end of his negotiation is set out very plainly which in short is understood to be no more than under the pretense of a guaranty to draw holland and spain into a league with england which may help the prince of orange with an occasion of breaking the peace lately made which i believe will take effect if the french can be persuaded to sleep three months and take no notice of it if the louvesteine party in holland and their associates can be brought to believe the prince of orange thinks of advancing no interest but the public good of the country and if our house of commons can be so well satisfied with the management of the last business in flanders as to be willing to raise a new army under the same conduct and to believe one that is so raised will conduce to the defense of flanders as much as the last  the last post brought me yours of july the   th and if you confess you did not know what to make of the scotch business before you had my letters i may conclude you were as much in the dark afterward for i could not make you understand that which i am ignorant of and to say the truth i am so a great part of our modern prudence being to suppress informations of the truth which i take to be as great a point of subtilty as that of one of our friends who concealed a misfortune befallen him in the first acquaintance he had with a woman until he was like to fall into pieces some think the great lords will be found to have incited the poor people and then endeavored to value themselves at court upon the power they had of appeasing them and if that prove true they may have the fortune that ordinarily accompanies those that do too much or too little and my lord latherdales boots will be a powerful means of discovering whether this be so or no  monsieur de flamarin has been received at windsor as seriously as if it had been believed the queen of spains marriage should not hold unless it were here approved and the formalities that are usual with men of business having been observed to him he is grown to think he is so you know monsieur de barillion governs us if he be not mistaken but he seems not to be so much pleased with that as to find his embonpoint increased by the moistness of our air by frequently clapping his hands upon his thighs showing the delight he has in the sharpness of the sound that testifies the plumpness and hardness of his flesh and certainly if this climate did not nourish him better than any other the hairs in his nose and nails of his fingers could not grow so fast as to furnish enough of the one to pull out and of the other to cut off in all companies which being done he picks his ears with as good a grace as my lord la the dissolution of the tables at windsor has caused a great solitude there which leaves the king few better entertainments than fishing and unto some of our friends a good opportunity of making their court which they improve a man is come out of the north who says that sir thomas gascoin did treat with him to undertake to kill the king sent him to london to receive farther instructions and tells his story so discreetly that every body believes him he seems to involve sir george ratclife of northumberland who had been formerly taxed by oats one carrill a sussex gentleman was last week seized and brought before oats he says he is a jesuit and the same man that by those of the society was called blundell of whom much has been said  i dare not assure you that the gentleman to whom the letters were addressed that i sent to you is as honest as he is understanding in business because i doubt men that are necessitous and live by their wits may be apt to swerve from the best way and i know some of his near relations to be very naught but i can truly say that in many years acquaintance i have not found him guilty of any ill thing and i am sure that a brother of his having undertaken one that was abominable he was so far from joining with him that he discovered it to the person concerned in it and as i believe thereby saved his life and since that time so brake with his brother as never to have looked upon him for this    or    years i hear the duke of monmouth is expected here this day we poor people know nothing of the sitting of the parliament but are confident it will not be in august  i am sir your most humble and faithful servant  you may with reason believe i am little informed of what passes in the world that in my last letter i said nothing of the parliament which i make no doubt but others that writ to you the same day said was dissolved the truth is the business being done at hampton court the news came not hither until the afternoon and i having it two or three hours later than others had already sent my letter to the post and could not recover it to make an addition though of so great importance this business is wholly imputed unto your two friends and the other that ever joins with them but the king finding it would not pass at council takes it wholly upon himself though that as well as some other things of the like nature are thought not well to agree with what his majesty was pleased to declare when he made the new council to have no cabinet council but next unto the advices of the parliament to follow theirs in all things and the world looking upon this as the work of the three above mentioned they begin to be spoken of all over england in the same manner as danby and i fear may be impeached the next parliament upon this point and the war in scotland as is said contrary to an act parliament in the year      the new parliament is to meet on the  th of october there will be as great canvassing for places as ever people believing this parliament was dissolved only in hopes of having one that would be less careful of the public interest all men that wish well unto it think it necessary to employ all their industry in endeavoring to make it better in that sense and many believe they will effect it though some probably will grow weary of the expenses of elections and the ways of preventing them as yet are not settled the lord halifax is made an earl under the same title the lord sunderland has order to prepare warrants to confer the same honor upon the lords garret and roberts  the lord of wiltshires marriage with mrs coventry was the last week celebrated with great solemnity and yesterday the young couple came to the marquess of winchesters house where there was a mighty feast and much dancing and rejoicing langhorne was yesterday hanged professing the same innocence that the jesuits did and had the fortune as well as they to be believed only by those that are in the same crimes or are concerned in having them concealed this day the council was extraordinarily assembled at hampton court to consider of wakemans business with its consequences which notwithstanding he is to be tried tomorrow at the old baily  the last week the king gave the scotch lords a hearing against latherdale they had counsel on both sides lockart and cunningham did undertake to prove a multitude of things done by latherdale to have been against law and mackenzy the kings advocate being of counsel for him could no ways disprove them but had recourse unto the royal authority the lords of essex and halifax were present and both of them but especially the latter did very much uphold the complainants and amongst other things told the king he saw the scottish nation was more free than the english nevertheless answer was returned to them that latherdale had done nothing but what his majesty had commanded and which he would uphold by virtue of his prerogative which was above the law this as is thought will preserve him from punishment but his place of secretary will be given to the lord magennis  the duke of monmouth before he came from scotland had taken care that the scotch prisoners should be used with more humanity than they found amongst their countrymen and since his arrival here orders are sent to enlarge the indulgence granted unto the nonconformists in their meetings the result of that business as far as i understand it is a great many fools have been killed their blood lies upon latherdale their folly and the cruelty showed unto them has gained a great deal of compassion for those that remain of their party which probably will persuade those in authority here to proceed more gently and that which is reasonable in itself will be rendered absolutely necessary if the parliament be suffered to sit for unless they prove to be of a temper very different from what is expected they will suffer nothing like unto that which has been  a business happened lately which makes a great deal of noise a certain captain under the shelter of the african company committed several piracies upon the english company trading in turkey and lately coming to town five or six principal merchants that had received the damage arrested him whereupon he complained to the commissioners of the admiralty who sent for the merchants and upon their refusal to release the captain committed them they addressed themselves to one of the judges for a habeas corpus who before he granted it gave notice unto the commissioners that the commitment of the merchants was against law advised their release before the habeas corpus was granted which could not be denied which the commissioners refused to do but advising farther with lawyers found not only that what they had done was unwarrantable but that they were subject to actions for false imprisonment upon which the injured persons would obtain great damages so as they found no better way than to release the men with a great many fair words but they not being therewith satisfied resolved to sue them at law or bring the business into parliament i write this two days before the going of the post because i am obliged to make a little journey this day and shall not be back until he be gone  i am your humble and faithful servant london july    london september     i have been out of town almost this month so as my last letter to you was dated about that time at my return i found mens minds more disturbed than ever i remember them to have been so as there is no extremity of disorder to be imagined that we might not probably have fallen into if the king had died or that may not yet reasonably be feared if he should relapse all that is now to be told of news is from the court and must be known from those that are more conversant there than i am though the parliament is like to signify little people are busy in bringing those in who are of their own mind and the party that is most averse to the court seems to prevail in the counties and great corporations as the other does in many of the small boroughs and upon the whole matter many believe the house will be composed as the last was or as some think of a more harsh humor the same men being something sharpened  your friend the lord latherdale is more powerful than ever in scotland openly opposes the duke of monmouth and has so far prevailed as to render the indulgences obtained by him utterly ineffectual but lest his power there should not be sufficient to protect him here if the parliament meets he does not disdain a pardon and as i hear one is preparing for him i know not how much your friends and mine do grow at court nor whether the gains they can expect to make there will countervail what they lose in the nation but i do think myself assured that lords halifax and essex two of them who were generally as well esteemed as any men i know are now as ill spoken of as any and the asperity one of them showed against the papists is most bitterly retorted upon him if the parliament sits i shall not be so ignorant as i am of what passes and i will with the same care that i did the last time let you know what i hear and as far as i dare trust letters sent by the post what i think  i am your most humble and faithful servant  london october    it is indeed a good while since i heard from you and i have been less diligent in writing to you than formerly partly because i doubted whether my letters were any ways acceptable unto you and partly because one that is far from court knows nothing worth relating unless it be in parliamenttime when all that is done is made public or at the least comes to the knowledge of those that have any acquaintance i am not able to give so much as a guess whether the parliament shall sit the   th of january or not and though i think myself in all respects well chosen am uncertain whether i shall be of it or not there being a double return and nothing can be assured until the question arising thereupon be determined unless it be that as i and my principles are out of fashion my inclinations going one way my friendship and alliance with those that are like to give occasion for the greatest contests drawing another i shall be equally disliked and suspected by both parties and thereby become the most inconsiderable member of the house but however matters go if the house does sit and you care to know what i either hear or think i so far abhor the excuse that is worn out by having been so often alleged by liars and fools as never to pretend to much business as a reason for my omission and i think i shall make none  i have often heard of monsieur davaux his behavior in holland but did not need any information as to matter of fact to be assured he would oppose it to believe he would succeed and indeed with some confidence to conclude that our disappointment in that case is much more for our advantage than what we sought and as it is said in religion that nothing is more terrible than the return of illconceived prayers nothing is more to be feared in politics than the success of unreasonable and illgrounded counsels and though the proposition that was made being rejected will certainly raise the party in holland that is least for the prince of orange and cast it into a dependence upon france that is less mortal unto us than a league that would certainly have produced a rupture of the peace renewed the war all over europe exposed flanders to be lost the first year which this must have done it being as certain the assistances expected from hence would have failed as that it has not in itself that which is necessary for its defense this and a great deal more upon the like subject was told the lord sunderland and mr h sydney before he went but sir william who was taken for the oracle of those parts assured them there was no such thing as a party in holland inclined to oppose the prince of orange that all was submitted unto his authority and united in desiring such an alliance with us that it would certainly be accepted as soon as offered and that the french which had made the peace for fear of us would by the same reason more exactly keep it when it was seen that we were joined with them i should think him bewitched that does not see there is as many falsities as to matter of fact and mistakes in judgment in this matter as there are words but i see no intention of receding from such counsels nor remedy for the mischiefs they bring upon us it was also believed this business would have been liked by the parliament but i am as confident as of this that is passed that if the parliament had met neither this nor any thing that is like to engage us in any war would have been endured by them nor that they would have given a penny toward it  you will certainly have heard of a precious plot carried on by a man of four names who had been almost as many times in the pillory for perjury and such other pieces of wit whereby the presbyterians should be brought under the suspicion of having one now on foot which should have given occasion of bailing the lords in the tower but he having had the ill luck to mistake mansell for mansfield carried a bundle of letters he had forged to a wrong place and bringing some officers of the customs to search mansells lodgings for flanders lace and other prohibited commodities was fain to find them himself but the mistake of the superscription which was to mansfield the seals not opened and other circumstances making the fraud to appear the whole matter vanished about the same time another design of equal prudence and integrity was carried on to suborn dugdale to renounce his testimony concerning the popish plot but he consulted with some friends placed two good witnesses under the hanging to testify what the woman said who treated with him and when he saw a fit time discovered all to the council so as that plot also is enervated we hear of several other persons that would more fully discover the popish plot but as things stand none dares appear sergeant long spoken of has deposed what he knows and as i hear delivered it into safe hands signed and sealed h sydney is said to have made a very ill discourse to him at the hague and if it come before the parliament will probably have evil effects the duke went toward scotland on monday full of various imaginations as is said but some understanding men think he has nothing that ought more to please him in his journey than good weather there is a paper cast about the town of the earl of danby his case which makes a very ill one of it and amongst other things to prove he was not of the french faction he says he needs allege only the french ambassadors discourses of him at madam mazarins this new logic of proving a thing by a proposition either false or as uncertain as itself being looked upon as the invention of that excellent wit  i am glad to hear of the dullness you observe in your neighborhood and wish you could find means to increase it believing that nothing else can keep them from taking advantage of our follies as i am sure the league would have done if it had been accepted in holland h sydney arrived here yesterday the duke his first lodging was at hatfield the earl of salisbury being at quickshot six miles off sent his son to excuse his not coming to wait upon his royal highness for that he had been let blood five days before no provisions for his entertainment appeared in the house but two does upon the table one barrel of small beer in the cellar and a pile of faggots the dukes servants sent into the town to buy all things necessary even to candles and to borrow candlesticks the gentlemen of the neighborhood were so charitable as to take the lord of ossory and many others to their houses where they were well entertained the duke being unwilling to be burdensome to a poor lord appointed sir j worden to pay for what he had had and the steward took money for the faggots and eight shillings for the barrel of beer the earl of orrery is dead and the lord of ormond has made his son arran major general in his stead that if the french invade that kingdom the army commanded by himself and his two sons may be fit to oppose them  i am your most humble and faithful servant  london october    we are in a busy time and how empty soever any mans head has formerly been the variety of reports concerning things in agitation do so fill it at the least with an imagination of contributing something to other mens inventions that they have little leisure to do any thing else this obliges me to write in haste and without any other consideration than of the agreement made between you and me to set down nothing but truth to tell you in short that the first day of the parliament the lord russel named mr williams to be speaker who being approved of without contradiction was with little ceremony and no excuse made for himself assented unto by the king the two next days were spent in swearing the members of the house of commons and putting them to the test on monday the five and twentieth the committees were named and a multitude of petitions concerning elections presented and referred unto that of privileges and elections  on tuesday the   th dangerfield was brought to the bar of the house of commons where he did declare himself positively that the duke had offered him a great sum of money to kill the king he also said that the lord privy seal peterborough and sir robert payton were privy unto and contrivers of the mealtub plot the same day the lord russell representing the mischiefs and dangers that threaten our nation showed the duke to be the center of all sir h capell seconded him sir francis winnington made a recapitulation of all that had been done since the last parliament to the prejudice of the nation in favor of popery and imputed the greatest part thereof unto the same cause whereupon a vote was passed by the house nemine contradicente that the house should proceed incessantly upon the further discovery of the plot and the means of preventing a popish successor  wednesday the   th dangerfield was brought into the speakers chamber and being put to his oath by a justice of the peace did depose what he had formerly said mr hide only and sir lionel jenkins did speak in favor of the duke and the latter having the ill luck to say he did in his heart believe his royal highness was as good a subject as any is in england one that was not far off whispered and as good a protestant  the same day complaint being made in the house of commons of those who had obstructed petitions and some members severely answering such as had been guilty thereof sir robert howard desired the house to proceed cautiously therein his majesty having by proclamation declared such petitions to be contrary to law notwithstanding which admonition the house did vote nemine contradicente that it was and had ever been the right of the subjects of england to petition his majesty for the meeting and sitting of parliaments until all petitions were heard and grievances redressed in the second place they appointed a committee to examine who had been guilty of obstructing such petitions and therein betraying their country there are six or seven members of the house of commons said to have declared themselves detesters and abhorrers of such petitions who as is thought will be turned out of the house without other ceremony  the same day sir robert payton was suspended the house  an american jew lately interpreter to the last portugal ambassador that was here did testify before a committee of the house of lords that he had been suborned by the said ambassador to kill the earl of shaftsbury by casting handgranadoes into his coach as he should be going to or coming from chelsea and to find others to kill arnold oats and bedloe he mentioned this at first in the phrensy of a fever and finding that he had so discovered himself found no better way of security than to declare the whole to the earl of clarendon the first day of may last and delivered unto him the whole matter in writing the earl does neither deny the receipt of the papers nor give any reason why he concealed it  many terrible accusations come in against anglesy  the lord halifax brought in a bill for the speedy discovery and conviction of papists and ease of nonconformists but so contrived that both parties are almost equally incensed against him for it the house of lords was on thursday turned into a committee and as i hear will be so every day to consider of it and try whether it can be so mended as to be useful unto the ends intended i know not whether that can be done or no but i could have wished that intending to oblige above a million of men that go under the name of nonconformists he had been pleased to consult with one of that number concerning the ways of doing it  on friday twentynine lords and commoners were invited by the lord mayor to his feast and after dinner the duke of monmouth came to them in his return he was accompanied by a great number of people that ran to see him and esquire thin it was observed that having formerly had a bar in his arms upon his coach it was then wiped out  october the  0th dugdale did declare unto the house of commons that ewers the jesuit told him there had been a contest between the duke of york and coleman he complaining that the duke put him upon businesses that would bring him to be hanged the duke told him he would secure his life so he would hold his peace coleman answered he could do so for the future but he had already confessed so much unto his friend sir edmond godfrey that it was in his power to discover him and all his business whereupon the duke replied that ought not to trouble him for order should be taken to keep godfrey from doing any hurt which in a few days was performed by his death cann of bristol and withins steward of westminster are put out of the house of commons for discountenancing and opposing petitioning  i believe tomorrow will be a great day in the house of commons in as much as it relates to the duke he is said to be arrived in scotland but no certain news is come of him since he was seen off from newcastle on monday last if the orders sent into flanders from spain concerning reprisals upon the duke of brandenburgh by sea or land be executed as is said by sending two or three thousand horse into the pais de cleves and de juliers i look upon the peace as broken for the french will certainly defend it or do the like in flanders  i am your most humble and faithful servant the lord ogle is dead  the length of this letter will persuade you i am not in the haste i mentioned but abundance of matter has made a letter of six pages when i intended but one    nerac december           i received yesterday in one and the same packet three letters from you of which one had passed through paris whilst i was there and that would have spared me a journey of four hundred leagues if i had then received it this would have been a convenience unto me but my obligation unto you is the same and i so far acknowledge it to be the greatest that i have in a long time received from any man as not to value the leave you have obtained for me to return into my country after so long an absence at a lower rate than the saving of my life you having proceeded thus far i will without any scruple put myself entirely upon the kings word and desire you only to obtain a pass to signify it and that his majesty is pleased to send for me so as the officers of the ports or other places may not stop me as they will be apt to do as soon as they know my name if i have not that for my protection you took that which had passed between you and me so rightly that i have nothing to add unto it i have no other business than what solely concerns my person and family i desire not to be a day in england unknown to the king or his ministers and will lose no time in waiting upon the secretary as soon as i can after my arrival i think it no ways reasonable that i should stay in england if the king do not see i may do it without any shadow or possibility of prejudice unto him and unless i can satisfy him in that point i desire no more than to return on this side the seas after the three months where i intend to finish my days without thinking any more of living in england you see my thoughts simply exposed i beseech you to accomplish the work you have so well begun send your answer to monsieur du moulins and believe no man in the world can be more obliged unto you than  your most humble and obedient servant  london july         i had not failed of seeing you when you were here if it could have been compassed by industry for i was more than once at your old lodging in king street and the new one which i then heard you had taken near st jamess but courtiers are always in motion so as to meet with them is as hard as to shoot flying and though my intention was to have done it i found that skill was wanting i was in that enquiry guided by my own inclinations unto you and the knowledge of obligations received from you both of which join in persuading me to wish you in a way more suitable unto your humor than that which engages you in troublesome removes to follow a prince who perhaps does not always know his own mind or that thinks it a part of his greatness to vex as many as he can those that he sent lately hither spoke of nothing so much as la gloire de leur maitre though perhaps there were more of true glory in the steadiness of a little good common sense than in all the vanities and whimsies their heads are filled with but if you find some inconvenience in being obliged in a degree to comply with them where you are i doubt whether you would have been exempted from the like here for even we that are afar off from that fire are so much scorched by it that we expect not trouble but ruin from it i am sir  your most humble and faithful servant  paris november           the time that i have remained here beyond my expectation might have given you leisure to let me know what success you had in the business you were pleased to speak to me of but the sickness which as i hear you fell into soon after your arrival may have detained you till you had reason to believe i was removed into a country far from this but if your recovery give you opportunity of making an essay i desire you either to give your letter by which i may know it to my lady sunderland to be sent unto me or direct it to monsieur du moulins who is with your nephew here to be sent after me i have bought a horse of mr porter in which i think he has dealt civilly with me as he says upon your consideration which i have reason to believe and am very willing to acknowledge as from a person from whom i receive much greater obligations and to whom i shall be ever ready to render all that agrees with the title of  your most humble and obedient servant  finis
