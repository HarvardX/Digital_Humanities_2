etc query i whether there ever was is or will be an industrious nation poor or an idle rich    qu whether a people can be called poor where the common sort are well fed clothed and lodged    qu whether the drift and aim of every wise state should not be to encourage industry in its members and whether those who employ neither heads nor hands for the common benefit deserve not to be expelled like drones out of a well governed state    qu whether the four elements and mans labor therein be not the true source of wealth    qu whether money be not only so far useful as it stirs up industry enabling men mutually to participate the fruits of each others labor    qu whether any other means equally conducing to excite and circulate the industry of mankind may not be as useful as money    qu whether the real end and aim of men be not power and whether he who could have every thing else at his wish or will would value money    qu whether the public aim in every well governed state be not that each member according to his just pretensions and industry should have power    qu whether power be not referred to action and whether action does not follow appetite or will   0 qu whether fashion does not create appetites and whether the prevailing will of a nation is not the fashion     qu whether the current of industry and commerce be not determined by this prevailing will     qu whether it be not owing to custom that most fashions are agreeable     qu whether it may not concern the wisdom of the legislature to interpose in the making of fashions and not leave an affair of so great influence to the management of women and fops and tailors and vintners     qu whether reasonable fashions are a greater restraint on freedom than those which are unreasonable     qu whether a general good taste in a people would not greatly conduce to their thriving and whether an uneducated gentry be not the greatest of national evils     qu whether customs and fashions do not supply the place of reason in the vulgar of all ranks whether therefore it does not very much import that they should be wisely framed     qu whether the imitating those neighbors in our fashions to whom we bear no likeness in our circumstances be not one cause of distress to this nation     qu whether frugal fashions in the upper rank and comfortable living in the lower be not the means to multiply inhabitants     qu whether the bulk of our irish natives are not kept from thriving by that cynical content in dirt and beggary which they possess to a degree beyond any other people in christendom   0 qu whether the creating of wants be not the likeliest way to produce industry in a people and whether if our peasants were accustomed to eat beef and wear shoes they would not be more industrious     qu whether other things being given as climate soil etc the wealth be not proportioned to the industry and this to the circulation of credit be the credit circulated or transferred by what marks or tokens so ever     qu whether therefore less money swiftly circulating be not in effect equivalent to more money slowly circulating or whether if the circulation be reciprocally as the quantity of coin the nation can be a loser     qu whether money is to be considered as having an intrinsic value or as being a commodity a standard a measure or a pledge as is variously suggested by writers and whether the true idea of money as such be not altogether that of a ticket or counter     qu whether the value or price of things be not a compounded proportion directly as the demand and reciprocally as the plenty     qu whether the terms crown livre pound sterling etc are not to be considered as exponents or denominations of such proportion and whether gold silver and paper are not tickets or counters for reckoning recording and transferring thereof     qu whether the denominations being retained although the bullion were gone things might not nevertheless be rated bought and sold industry promoted and a circulation of commerce maintained     qu whether an equal raising of all sorts of gold silver and copper coin can have any effect in bringing money into the kingdom and whether altering the proportions between the several sorts can have any other effect but multiplying one kind and lessening another without any increase of the sum total     qu whether arbitrary changing the denomination of coin be not a public cheat     qu whether nevertheless the damage would be very considerable if by degrees our money were brought back to the english value there to rest for ever   0

virtue in gold or silver other than as they set people at work or create industry     qu whether it be not the opinion or will of the people exciting them to industry that truly enricheth a nation and

not nevertheless supply bills of exchange sufficient to answer the demands of absentees in england or elsewhere     qu whether current bank notes may not be deemed money and whether they are not actually the greater part of the money of this kingdom     qu provided the wheels move whether it is not the same thing as to the effect of the machine be this done by the force of wind or water or animals     qu whether power to command the industry of others be not real wealth and whether money be not in truth tickets or tokens for conveying and recording such power and whether it be of great consequence what materials the tickets are made of     qu whether trade either foreign or domestic be in truth any more than this commerce of industry     qu whether to promote transfer and secure this commerce and this property in human labor or in other words this power be not the sole means of enriching a people and how far this may be done independently of gold and silver   0 qu whether it were not wrong to suppose land it self to be wealth and whether the industry of the people is not first to be considered as that which constitutes wealth which makes even land and silver to be wealth neither of which would have any value but as means and motives to industry     qu whether in the wastes of america a man might not possess twenty miles square of land and yet want his dinner or a coat to his back     qu whether a fertile land and the industry of its inhabitants would not prove inexhaustable funds of real wealth be the counters for conveying and recording thereof what you will paper gold or silver     qu whether a single hint be sufficient to overcome a prejudice and whether even obvious truths will not sometimes bear repeating     qu whether if human labor be the true source of wealth it does not follow that idleness should of all things be discouraged in a wise state     qu whether even gold or silver if they should lessen the industry of its inhabitants would not be ruinous to a country and whether spain be not an instance of this     qu whether the opinion of men and their industry consequent thereupon be not the true wealth of holland and not the silver supposed to be deposited in the bank at amsterdam     qu whether there is in truth any such treasure lying dead and whether it be of great consequence to the public that it should be real rather than notional     qu whether in order to understand the true nature of wealth and commerce it would not be right to consider a ships crew cast upon a desert island and by degrees forming themselves to business and civil life while industry begot credit and credit moved to industry     qu whether such men would not all set themselves to work whether they would not subsist by the mutual participation of each others industry whether when one man had in his way procured more than he could consume he would not exchange his superfluities to supply his wants whether this must not produce credit whether to facilitate these conveyances to record and circulate this credit they would not soon agree on certain tallies tokens tickets or counters   0 qu whether reflection in the better sort might not soon remedy our evils and whether our real defect be not a wrong way of thinking     qu whether it would not be an unhappy turn in our gentlemen if they should take more thought to create an interest to themselves in this or that county or borough than to promote the real interest of their country     qu whether it be not a bull to call that making an interest whereby a man spends much and gains nothing     qu whether if a man builds a house he does not in the first place provide a plan which governs his work and shall the public act without an end a view a plan     qu whether by how much the

does not stand in his own light     qu whether small gains be not the way to great profit and if our tradesmen are beggars whether they may not thank themselves for it     qu whether some way might not be found for making criminals useful in public works instead of sending them either to america or to the other world     qu whether we may not as well as other nations contrive employment for them and whether servitude chains and hard labor for a term of years would not be a more discouraging as well as a more adequate punishment for felons than even death itself     qu whether there are not

hearkened to before convenience and convenience before luxury     qu whether to provide plentifully for the poor be not feeding the root the substance whereof will shoot upwards into the branches and

contrary extinguish all such ambition making men listless helpless and slothful     qu whether a country inhabited by people well fed clothed and lodged would not become every day more populous and whether a numerous stock of people in such circumstances would not constitute a flourishing nation and how far the product of our own country may suffice for the compassing of this end     qu whether a people who had provided themselves with the necessaries of life in good plenty would not soon extend their industry to new arts and new branches of commerce     qu whether those same manufactures which england imports from other countries may not be admitted from ireland and if so whether lace carpets and tapestry three considerable articles of english importation might not find encouragment in ireland and whether an academy for design might not greatly conduce to the perfecting those manufactures among us   0 qu whether france and flanders could have drawn so much money from england for

trade what advantages may not great britain make of a country where land and labor are so cheap     qu whether ireland alone might not raise hemp sufficient for the british navy and whether it would not be vain to expect this from the british colonies in america where hands are so scarce and labor so excessively dear     qu whether if our own people want will or capacity for such an attempt it might not be worth while for some undertaking spirits in england to make settlements and raise hemp in the counties of clare and limeric than which perhaps there is not fitter land in the world for

quantity while we make very little and very bad   0 qu how long it will be before my countrymen find out that it is worth while to spend a penny in order to get a groat     qu if all the land were tilled that is fit for tillage and all that sowed with hemp and flax that is fit for raising them whether we should have much sheepwalk beyond what was sufficient to supply the necessities of the kingdom     qu whether other countries have not flourished without the woollen trade     qu whether it be not a sure sign or effect of a countries thriving to see it well cultivated and full of inhabitants and if so whether a great quantity of sheepwalk be not ruinous to a country rendering it waste and thinly inhabited     qu whether the employing so much of our land under sheep be not in fact an irish bull     qu whether our hankering after the woollen trade be not the true and only reason which has created a jealousy in england toward ireland and whether any thing can hurt us more

convenience to the kingdom and whether it could be attended with any possible inconvenience to great britain and whether there were not mints in naples and in sicily when those kingdoms were provinces

with fir daubed over with oil and paint be not like a fireship ready to be lighted up by all accidents      qu whether larger houses better built and furnished a greater train of servants the difference with regard to equipage and table between finer and coarser more and less elegant and impolite may not be sufficient to feed a reasonable share of vanity or support all proper distinctions

the world than an italian palace that is stone and mortar skilfully put together and adorned with sculpture and painting and whether this may not be compassed without foreign trade      qu whether an expense in gardens and plantations would not be an elegant distinction for the rich a domestic magnificence employing many hands within and drawing nothing from abroad      qu whether the apology which is made for foreign luxury in england to wit that they could not carry on their trade without imports as well as exports will hold in ireland      qu whether one may not be allowed to conceive and suppose a society or nation of human creatures clad in woollen clothes and stuffs eating good bread beef and mutton poultry and fish in great plenty drinking ale mead and cider inhabiting decent

spend them      qu whether upon the whole a domestic trade may not suffice in such a country as ireland to nourish and cloth its inhabitants and provide them with the reasonable conveniences and even comforts of life      qu whether a general habit of living well would not produce numbers and industry and whether considering the tendency of human kind the consequence thereof would not be foreign trade and riches how unnecessary soever see qu         qu whether nevertheless it be a crime to enquire how far we may do without foreign trade and what would follow on such a supposition      qu whether the number and welfare of the subjects be not the true strength of the crown      qu whether in all public institutions there should not be an end proposed which is to be the rule and limit of

respect to us also      qu how much of the necessary sustenance of our people is yearly exported for brandy      qu whether if people must poison themselves they had not better do it with their own growth      qu if we imported neither claret from france nor fir from norway what the nation would save by it      qu when the root yields insufficient nourishment whether men do not top the tree to

may not easily prevent the ill effects of such a bank as mr law proposed for scotland which was faulty in not limiting the quantum of bills and permitting all persons to take out what bills they pleased upon the mortgage of lands whence by a glut of paper the prices of things must rise whence also the fortunes of men must increase in denomination though not in value whence pride idleness and

temporals may not be justly required of the roman catholics and whether in common prudence or policy any priest should be tolerated who refuses to take it      qu whether there have not been popish

not make missionaries in the irish tongue useful      qu whether the mere act of hearing without making any profession of faith or joining in any part of worship be a religious act and consequently whether their being obliged to hear may not consist with the toleration of roman catholics      qu whether if penal laws should be thought oppressive we may not at least be allowed to give premiums and whether it would be wrong if the public encouraged popish families to become hearers by paying their hearthmoney for them      qu whether in granting toleration we ought not to distinguish between doctrines purely religious and such as affect the state      qu whether the case be not very different in regard to a man who only eats fish on fridays says his prayers in latin or believes transubstantiation and one who professes in temporals a subjection to foreign powers who holds himself absolved from all obedience to his natural prince and the laws of his country who is even persuaded it may be meritorious to destroy the powers that are      qu whether therefore a distinction should not be made between mere papists and recusants and whether the latter can expect the same protection from the government as the former   00 qu whether our papists in this kingdom can complain if they are allowed to be as much papists as the subjects of france or of the empire   0  qu

points do not think it their duty to obey the civil government   0  qu whether since the peace of utrecht mass was not celebrated and the sacraments administered in diverse dioceses of sicily notwithstanding the popes interdict   0  qu whether every plea of conscience is to be regarded whether for instance the german anabaptists levellers or fifth monarchy men would be tolerated on that pretense   0  qu whether popish children bred in charity schools when bound out in apprentiship to protestant masters do generally continue protestants   0  qu whether a sum which would go but a little way toward erecting hospitals for maintaining and educating the children of the native irish might not go far in binding them out apprentices to protestant masters for husbandry useful trades and the service of families   0  qu whether if the parents are overlooked there can be any great hopes of success in converting the children   0  qu whether there be any instance of a peoples being converted in a christian sense otherwise than by preaching to them and instructing them in their own language   0  qu whether catechists in the irish tongue may not easily be procured and subsisted and whether this would not be the most practicable means for converting the natives   0  qu whether it be not of great advantage to the church of rome that she has clergy suited to all ranks of men in gradual subordination from cardinals down to mendicants    0 qu whether her numerous poor clergy are not very useful in missions and of much influence with the people      qu whether in defect of able missionaries persons conversant in low life and speaking the irish tongue if well instructed in the first principles of religion and in the popish controversy though for the rest on a level with parish clerks or the schoolmasters of charity schools may not be fit to mix with and bring over our poor illiterate natives to the established church whether it is not to be wished that some parts of our liturgy and homilies were publicly read in the irish language and whether in these views it may not be right to breed up some of the better sort of children in the charity schools and qualify them for missionaries catechists and readers      qu whether there be any nation of men governed by reason and yet if there was not whether this would be a good argument against the use of reason in public affairs      qu whether as others have supposed an atlantis or eutopia we also may not suppose an hyperborean island inhabited by reasonable creatures      qu whether an indifferent person who looks into all hands may not be a better judge of the play than a party who sees only his own      qu whether one whose end is to make his countrymen think may not gain his end even though they should not
