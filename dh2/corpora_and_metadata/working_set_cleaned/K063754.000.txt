peace ignominy and destruction a poem  inscribed to the rt hon charles james fox  rompez rompez tout pacte avec limpiete racine london printed for f and c rivington st pauls church yard and r white no     piccadilly        to the right honorable charles james fox sir i cannot pay the candor that accompanies your great talents a higher compliment than by dedicating to you a poem whose general principle is adverse to your political sentiments  i have the honor to be your obedient humble servant the author  peace ignominy and destruction around the enduring martyrs hallowed shrine their brightest flowers the holy muses twine with roses blushing from the fields of war their skilful hands adorn the victors car and for the candid brow of peace they bring the modest honors of the early spring but for the peace that lifts the imploring eye from whose frail breast escapes the cowards sigh no muse applauding one small leaf shall bring of all the foliage of the early spring but from her bower shall ignominy rend a branch of nightshade for her gentle friend these painful eyes behold an english peer his weak memorial sicklied over with fear in humble attitude a suppliant stand to claim the friendship of a murderous band the plaintive breathings of the snowwingd dove ill suit the imperial messenger of jove  who should by longexcited vengeance driven bear in his grasp the thunderbolt of heaven oh my loved country timeennobled realm where jealous honor still has watched the helm the unclouded glory long to europe known which clasps thy loins like a refulgent zone say will thy hand the hallowed cestus tear and yield thy virtue to the tainting air for me  unmarked by honors wealth or fame no swelling title blazoning round my name  to be a fleeting bubble of thy earth inflames my mounting soul with pride of birth oh sacred parent still thyself revere to honors call to virtues voice be near blur not the brightness of thy heavenly cause with one dim moments intervening pause better to fall in glorys full career embracing honor on the untimely bier than weak subdued with agonising strife waste in the socket the last gleams of life say if to cloathe with light the laughing skies the god of day were doomed no more to rise were it not better in the pomp of power in the rich ardour of meridian hour to rush abrupt from heaven with downward flight a flaming chaos to the jaws of night than tinge the ocean with a lingering ray expiring in the silence of decay yet think not france from nature will depart and chase the fiend that grapples to her heart that the wild tigress will forego her prey couch with the kid and with the lambkin play that the fond child shall stretch his little hand to lead the lion in a flowry band these beauteous emblems of the days of old with this mock concord no resemblance hold no heavy drops of mandragora steep the dragons eyelids in the dews of sleep the gift extended by a faithless foe is the concealment of a lurking woe it is like the pause that natures storm bestows an awful calm  the thunders dread repose my anxious eyes solicit still in vain some sign that might my failing hopes sustain some sacred altar robbed in spotless white where candours priest performs the genial rite where longtried statesmen fraught with wisdoms lore whose hair the hand of peace has silvered over with learned fathers swayed by virtues rule whom peace has tutored in religions school where pensive as they walked the holy breeze flew through the shady cloister whispering peace for these best pledges other scenes arise  the enchanters cauldron smites my wondering eyes behold a troop of ghastly shapes advance in frantic mood and form a horrid dance now bending low these haggard forms of hell breathe the dark prayer and mutter the dread spell and now into the turbid stream they throw with imprecations big with future woe the galling tears that flowed from beautys cheek the voice of agony and terrors shriek the blood that trickled from afflictions dart the sighs exhaling from a broken heart the burst of anguish murders piercing cry the screams that hurried through the midnight sky the famished infants deep expiring groan the dungeond victims solitary moan the clotted hair which desperation tore the milk of murdered mothers streaked with gore the plaint of innocence the virgins prayer which the rude ravisher consigned to air the hallowed edicts by religion planned and holy wedlocks desecrated band behold the infernal sorcerers unite to close their incantations fearful rite and leering cast into the vase prosound the likeness of two skulls which once were crowned say for these fiends if england can descend to weave the bond that grapples friend to friend flown is the spirit of her living fame  and what remains  a carcass of a name could i like dryden wield the bolts of war or boast the warm exuberance of parr the glow of mind the piercing ray of heaven by natures liberal hand to orford given the zeal of him whose energetic strain unfolds the sorrows of the negro train brings the heartrending tale to britains ear and bids compassion pay her long arrear the arguments that flow from wyndhams sense well guarded round by reasons strongest fence the sacred boon by chathams son possessed the muse of eloquence that sires his breast the quiver richly stored with attic darts which genius to his sheridan imparts the exalting winnowd purity of soul with which fitzwilliam soars beyond control who greatly daring with a zeal severe stemmed the wild deluge of opprobious fear and on the day eternally renowned like abdiel was the only faithful found  had i these powers concentered in one form i would pour on england the resistless storm to wake her soul to rouse her mental part and chase her sombrous lethargy of heart do some pretend that justice holds the scales that over french councils honor now prevails approach the dial in the dead of night demand the hour by artificial light then virtue seek with an inquiring eye amid the system unillumd from high november the   th      the convention decreed that a spot of ground should be allotted for a burial pla with this inscription death is an eternal sleep mark yon sad cemeterys starless gloom where time shall never unlock the ravenous tomb where shadowy death shall a dread vigil keep midst the still horror of eternal sleep there the pledged maiden at the approach of eve over the dear relics of the youth shall grieve while her dark creed shall urge the sting of woe and bid her flowing tears for ever flow hope dares not whisper to her clouded eye to send a glance to times unsolding sky where pity weaves the amaranthine chain to circle lovers never to part again there too the mother with affliction wild bends over the grave that holds her darling child for ever holds  no pleasing vision cries suppress the tears that trickle from thine eyes ah know thy child with angels soars on high in the bright regions of the upper sky and decked with wings that glitter to the ray plays on the sunbeams of eternal day  her darkning creed with no assuagement fraught forbids her soul to grasp the cheering thought there too the friend his otherself shall mourn from his habitual sight for ever torn forbid to look to that celestial shore whose blissful bowers shall friend to friend restore thus the strong chain their sacrilege has rivn which bound in sacred union earth and heaven made every future high reversion void the rights of immortality destroyed compelled the claims of merit to be mute creations lord degraded to a brute and what their hellconstructed thought designed insulted nature and dethroned the mind july the   th      voltaires ashes were removed to st genevieve behold here flowerets deck the lengthening way the slow procession moves in bright array a gorgeous spectacle ovations car pressed by no hero slaughtered in the war but pressed by him who scattered wild alarm and raised against virtue his destructive arm who dared on truths bright shield in evil hour the poisoned shafts of blasphemy to shower his ardent votries  a licentious crowd  uplift their champion festring in his shroud and while the graveworms fasten on his frame high honors pay to his irrevrent name pale irreligion comes with all her train  her atheist choir  to act the rites profane she comes with all the witlings of the land her grave buffoons her academic band the steps of the famed porch they now ascend and through the pillard isles their march they bend an host of praiseful voices rends the fane and impious echoes multiply the strain but when the corse was to the vault conveyed night round the temple flung her darkest shade with terror heaved the sympathetic ground from every altar breathed a sigh profound and fiends rejoiced while angels wept around time was when france preferred her learned name and wore the wreath bestowed by classic fame mark the dread change  the cold immoral blast has chilled the plants of science as it passed nipt the young thought just bursting from its fold and froze instructions current as it rolled see education weeping on the ground her globes her torch her emblems scattered round her children all are fled  the path that leads to her august abode is choked with weeds she mourns her sabbaths and her rites suppressed she mourns her silent hours ignoble rest who now appears the tutoress of youth to cheer the darkened mind with beams of truth with those clear rays which her bright noon adorn to streak and beautify her pupils morn from the wideyawning ground now bursts to view a form gigantic and of sable hue it is inhumanity  she comes to trace instructions precepts to the rising race she feasts their minds  not with theatric show but with live scenes of dire ensanguind woe gluts their affections with atrocious food with acts of wrath and festivals of blood a battalion of children from ten to eleven were organized at rennes who were made to shoot old men of eighty behold her children new to wars alarms at her commandment grasp their little arms behold yon aged group whose silver hair demands compassion and entreats to spare against these  whose crimes are poverty and age she bids her pupils act their virgin rage and as they now impel the deathwingd balls some benefactor or some parent falls with horrors deepning dye so early stained in massacrous employ so early trained will they not terrify the future day whose rudiments of vice such proofs display  against these to war is virtues best crusade she cries oh england hasten to my aid see atheist cruelty her weapons wield lift to her blow thy consecrated shield oh that the warning voice to me was given which once resounded through the vault of heaven woe to the sons of earth i would overwhelm with sudden terror the unconscious realm till grasping one great plan by truth designed the will of many gathering to one mind with courage added to prophetic fear she should to france an iron aspect wear woe to the land which shamefully secure shrinks from the toil that wisdom bids endure declines the steps of glory to retrace and shuns calamity to meet disgrace  misfortune is the night expecting day disgrace a stain that seas cannot wash away see jeremiah chapter    a voice prophetic smote the passive air and cried to media  haste prepare prepare resume the shields and make the arrows bright direct to babylon their hasty flight oh thou who fillst the trembling earth with woe destroying mountain i am thy dreadful foe i will put forth my arm and thou shalt rush with flaming ruin and descending crush deep to the intombing vale could england hear the sound perchance would vibrate on her ear and she referring to that ruinous power would catch the lesson of the present hour like media she would dart a threatening eye proud to perform the menace from on high and cry to heaven as she ascends the car thou art my battleaxe my strength of war then cease oh britain timeennobled land cease to implore what virtue cannot demand yes i adjure thee by thy days of yore by thine illustrious fames untainted store by all the reverence thy great statesmen claim who raised on wisdoms plan thy wondrous frame by all thy sons who in thy cause have bled by all the tears their drooping widows shed by all thy sacred bards whose magic lays sound in thy porch and dignify thy praise by thy benevolence  that brilliant gem whose luster plays around thy diadem by all the charities that most endear by emigrancys meek imploring tear thou wilt not reject her at her utmost need nor plant thy footsteps on the broken reed  yes i adjure thee by the sainted train who heavninstructed reared thy awful fane who for imperial romes gay pomp of lights her pageant altars and her scenic rites gave to thy holy lips a purer prayer whose chaste ascension breathes celestial air often when in vain the art of medicine strives how nature trusting to herself revives so  would our busy stateempirics cease to pour the opium of reposing peace  england would start from her ignoble ease and rise superior to her new disease and boldly grasp the maddning arm of france alluding to agave who in a delirium slew her childsee ovids metamorphosis book iii till like agave wakning from her trance she trembling casts her haggard eyes around and views her infant bleeding on the ground but if cold reason with her lengthening chain comes every vigorous purpose to restrain  ah then no time can englands fame restore the curtain drops and glorys scene is over  resigned submissive to my humbler tate excluded from the conclave of the state it cheers me to reflect i am not decreed to make this bond of peace my act and deed ere i would fix thirrevocable seal and legalise what shame can never repeal see a tedious composition in rhyme entitled the progress of civil society i would be the wretch whose infidel designs creep in his mawkish cold lethargic lines who meanly caters from dim reasons ray while bright religion pours a flood of day who from the gates of wisdom turns aside and takes lucretius for his moral guide i would rather by the nine accursed produce the harsh crab vintage of the baviad muse whose cynic numbers not devoid of art spring from the workings of a bilious heart coarse unrefind inelegantly keen the foul oerflowings of selftorturd spleen thou who have long attained the immortal goal while choral plaudits sound from pole to pole the glowing sunset of whose honored day expands the brilliance of meridian ray who have from states removed the incumbent shade and the wide sphere of government displayed the distant azure of whose vague extremes thou have illumd with truths unerring beams our household deity who warns foretells points to the den where the hushed monster dwells presents our perils awfully to view and bids the country to herself be true oh sage of beaconsfield indulge the muse who the same track thou have adorned pursues who gleans thy scattrings grasps the falling grain from the full harvest of thy loaded wane the end
