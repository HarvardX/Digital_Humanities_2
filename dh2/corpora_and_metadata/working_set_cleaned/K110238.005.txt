anna st ives a novel  by thomas holcroft  volume v  london printed for shepperson and reynolds no     oxfordstreet  mdccxcii  anna st ives a novel letter lxxx coke clifton to guy fairfax london doverstreet before you proceed with my letter fairfax read the enclosed paper a copy given by anna to clifton as she had promised him of all that she had said in her last conversation   read  the handwriting is hers  it is addressed to me was repeated to me is transcribed for me  transcribed by herself  read and if it be possible believe in your own existence believe if you can that all you see all you hear the images that swim before your eyes and the world itself are real and no delusion  for my part i begin to doubt  read  oh that i were invisible and standing by your side  well  have you ended  and do you still continue to breathe  are you not a statue  would not the whole universe denounce me liar if knowing me i were to tell it that words like these were not only spoken to me but are written lest i should forget the maddening injuries they contain  what make me her confessor  me  no secret sin of thought word or deed concealed  all remembered all recited all avowed  sins committed with the hated henley  sins against love against clifton  does she imagine i can look on a paper like this and while my eye shoots along the daring the insulting line not feel all the fires that now devour me  surely she is frantic  these things fairfax are above my comprehension my amazement must be eternal for i never shall be able to understand them  what tell me clifton of her amorous debates with such a fellow appoint him her headusher over me announce him my rival meet my eye unabashed and affirm him to be my superior inform me of the deep hold he has taken of her heart own she kissed him  once again it is incredible nay most and still more incredible for strange to say and yet more strange for her to do even this received such a varnish from her lips her eyes her beauties her irradiating zeal that reason everlastingly renounce me if i scarcely knew while she spoke whether it were not the history of some sylph some heavenly spirit she was reciting  yes fairfax there was a moment a short but dangerous moment at which so charmed was i by her eloquence so amazed by her daring sincerity so moved by the white candor of a soul so seeming pure that possessed by i know not what booby devil of generosity i was on the point of throwing myself at her feet confessing the whole guilt of my intents and proclaiming myself her true and irrevocable convert  and this before the breath that uttered these injuries was cold  the siren  all the beauteous witcheries that ever yet were said or sung do not equal her  circe calypso morgana fairy or goddess mortal or immortal knew not to mix the magic cup with so much art  not that it was her arguments what are they it was her bright her beaming eyes her pouting beauteous lips her palpitating ecstatic bosom her  i know not what except that even this was not all  no  there was something still more heavenly  an emanating deity  the celestial effulgence of a divine soul that flowed with fervor almost convulsive  had you witnessed her elevated aspirations  such swelling passions so mastered so controlled till then i never beheld like the slow pause of the solemn deathbell the big tear at stated periods dropped but dropped unheeded though she could not exclude them her stoic soul disdained to notice such intrusive guests  her whole frame shook with the warfare between the feelings and the will  and well might it shake  i went prepared and lucky it was that i did my fixed determination was to be silent that i might profit by what i should hear that one dangerous moment excepted i was firm  firm  not to be moved though rocks would had they listened  yes fairfax i did my part not that i am certain that to fall at her feet like a canting methodist own myself the most reprobate of wretches whine out repentance and implore forgiveness at the all sufficient fountain of her mercy would not be the very way to impose upon her best  i begin indeed to be angry at myself for not having yet resolved on one consistent plan schemes so numerous present themselves and none without its difficulties and objections that to determine is no easy task circumstances in part must guide me i must have patience at present i can only prepare and keep in readiness such cumbrous engines as this phlegmatic foggy land of beef and pudding can afford i must supply the fire if i find it necessary to put the machines in motion  but having decreed her fall my spirits are now alert and there is not a being that surrounds me to whom imagination does not assign a possible part and that the part should be wellsuited to the person must be my care  my first exercise must be on myself apathy or the affectation of apathy must be acquired  inevitably must be  my passions must be masked i must pretend to have conquered them in their naked and genuine form they are indecent immoral impure i know not what but catch a metaphysical quirk and let vanity and dogmatic assertion stand sponsors and baptize it a truth and then raptures extravagance and bigotry itself are deities be then as loud as violent as intolerant as the most rancorous of zealots and it is all the sublime ardour of virtue  yes i must learn to ape their contempt of all and every terrene object motive and respect  enclose the strange paper i sent you and return it in your next i sent it in her own handwriting that your eyes might have full conviction i took a copy of it but i have since recollected i may want the original the time may come when she may assail me with accusation and complaint i will then present that paper and flash guilt upon her  i am much deceived if i do not observe in this gardening and improving knight a want of former cordiality a decrease of ardour and perhaps a wish to retract  why let him  to the daughters deadly sins let him add new it will but make invention more active and revenge more keen i will have an eye upon him i half hope my suspicions are true  the aunt wenbourne too still continues to give laud unto mr henley  damn mr henley  but she may be necessary and a she is entirely governed by the gull edward i must submit to bring myself into his favor the thing may easily be done  the lordly uncle fitzallen is secure i frequently dine with him on what he calls his open day he being overwhelmed with business as blockheads usually are and i do not fail to insinuate the relationship in which if care be not taken he may hereafter chance to stand to a gardeners son his face flames at the supposition and his red nose burns more bright what will it do should i make him my tool when he finds to what good purpose he has been an abettor be that his concern it neither is nor ever shall be mine  but none of these are the exact agent i want nor have i found him yet they at best can only act as auxiliaries laura indeed may be eminently useful but the plotting daring mischievous malignant yet subaltern imp incarnate that should run fly dive be visible and invisible and plunge through frost or fire to execute my behests is yet to be discovered  were i in italy disburse but a few sequins and battling legions would move at my bidding but here we have neither cicisbeos carnivals confessors bravoes nor sanctuaries no  we have too few priests and too much morality for our noble corpse to flourish in full perfection  i know not that all this may be necessary but i suspect it will and i must prepare for the worst for i will accomplish my purpose in despite of hell or honesty  ay fairfax will  gentle means insinuation and hypocrisy shall be my first resource and if these fail me then i will order my engines to play  i have been once more reading my copy of this unaccountable paper and though every word is engraven in my memory it dropped from my hand with new astonishment her history of her mr henley the yearnings of her heart toward him and her unabashed justification of all she has said all she has thought and all she has done are not to be paralleled in the records of female extravagance  she comes however to the point at last  calculation is in favor of celibacy  for once lady you are in the right  we may appear to agree on cases more dubious but on that it will be miraculous if we ever hereafter differ  i cannot but again applaud myself for keeping my preconcerted resolution of silence and reserve so firmly i rejoice in my fortitude and my foresight for her efforts were so strenuous and her emotions so catching that had i been less prepared all had been lost  c clifton  letter lxxxi coke clifton to guy fairfax london dover street yes yes fairfax she takes the sure and resolute road to ruin and travels it with unwearied ardour  what think you she has done now  an earthquake would have been more within my calculation  she labors hard after the mavelous  she has been angling again in the muddy pool of paradox and has hooked up a new dogma  and what is it  why nothing less than an asseveration that the promise she made me is not binding  promises are nonentities they mean nothing stand for nothing and nothing can claim  so be it  it is a maxim divine apostate that will at least serve my turn as effectually as yours to own the truth i never thought promises made to capricious ladies stood for much nor were my scruples at present likely to have been increased if she a woman be simple enough to have faith in the word of man it is her fault let her look to it  this is not all the doctrine is not of her own invention mr henley the eternal mr henley again appears upon the scene from which he is scarcely ever a moment absent  were it possible i could relent she is determined i shall not but they are both down in my tablets in large and indelible characters on the black list and there for a time at least they shall remain  my plan fairfax is formed and i believe completely when i was first acquainted with her as you know my meaning was honest and my heart sincere i was a fool at least for a fortnight for that was the shortest period before i began at all to waver i was indeed deeply smitten nor is desire cooled delay opposition and neglect have only changed its purpose she soon indeed taught me to treat her in some manner like the rest of her sex and to begin to plot it is well for me that i have a fertile brain and it had been well for her could she have been contented with the conquest she had made and have treated me with generosity equal to my deserts but a hypocrite she has made me and a hypocrite she shall find me ay and a deep one  she has herself given me my clue she has laid open her whole heart she has the fatuity to mimic the perfect heroine tell her but it is a duty and with the bramin wives she would lie down calmly and resolutely on the burning pile  well then i will tell her of a duty of which she little dreams yes she shall grant every thing i wish as an act of duty i will convince her it is one i the pretty immaculate lamb must submit in this point to become my pupil and it shall go hard or i will prove as subtle a logician as herself  what say you fairfax is not the project an excellent one is it not worthy of the sapient doctor clifton shall i lose reputation think you by carrying it into effect  i am already become a new man my whole system is changed she begins to praise me most unmercifully and while my very heart is tickled with my success the lengthened visage of inspired quaker when the spirit moved was never more demure i am too pleased too proud of my own talents not to persist  already i am a convert to one of her truths do laugh fairfax i have acknowledged that you and your footman are equal is it not ridiculous however i am convinced ay and convinced i will remain till time shall be she shall teach me a truth a day  yet no  i must not learn too fast it may be suspicious though i would be as speedy as i conveniently can in my progress  the zeal of disputation burns within her and as i tell you i am already one of her very good boys because the pursuit of my own project makes me now as willing to listen and hunt after deductions such as i want as she is to teach and to supply me with those deductions she starts at no proposition however extravagant if it do but appear to result from any one of her favorite systems of which she has a good round number rather than relinquish the least of them she would suppose the glorious sun a coalpit and his dazzling rays no better than volumes of black smoke polished and grown bright on their travels by attrition she professes it to be the purpose of her life to free herself from all prejudices but here she has the modesty to add the saving clause  if it be practicable  could she fairfax have a more convenient hypothesis do you not perceive its fecundity and the task being so very difficult will it not be benevolent in me to lend her my assistance what think you is it not possible to prove that marriage is a mere prejudice  she shall find me willing to learn many or perhaps all of her doctrines and in return i desire to teach her no more than one of mine can any thing be more reasonable more generous nay i will go further i will not teach it her she shall have all the honor of teaching it to me can man do more  the most knotty and perplexed part of my plan was to find a contrivance to make the gardeners son an actor in the plot the thing is difficult but not impossible i have various stratagems and schemes in the choice of which i must be guided by circumstances that which pleases me most is to invite him to sit in state the umpire of our disquisitions  i think i can depend upon myself otherwise there would be danger in the project but if i act my part perfectly if i have but the resolution to listen coolly to their quiddities sometimes to oppose sometimes to recede and always to own myself conquered on the points which suit me best i believe both the gentleman and the lady will be sufficiently simple to suppose that in all this there will be nothing apocryphal they will imagine the gilt statue to be pure gold i shall be numbered among their elect i shall rise from the alembic a saint of their own subliming shall be assayed and stamped current at their mint  yet i must be cautious i would put my hand in the fire ere undertake so apparently mad a scheme with any other couple in christendom considering how very warm  curses bite and tingle on my tongue at the recollection  considering i say how very warm i know their inclinations toward each other to be nothing but the proofs i have had could prompt me to commence an enterprise so improbable but the uncommonness of it is a main part of its merit and i think i know the ground i have to travel so well that i do not much fear i should lose my road  i am aware that the enemy i have most to guard against is myself to pretend a belief in opinions i despise to sit with saturnine gravity and nod approbation when my sides are convulsed with laughter to ape admiration at what reason contemns and spurns and to smooth my features into suavity while my heart is bursting with gall at the intercourse they continually hold of becks and smiles and approving kind epithets to do all this is almost too much for mortal man but i have already made several essays on myself and i find that the obstinate resolution which an insatiable thirst of ample retribution inspires is not to be shaken and renders me equal even to this task  i am well aware however what dangerous quicksands the passions are and that a good pilot is never sparing of soundings i will therefore not only keep a rigorous watch upon myself but take such measures as shall enable me to exclude or retain the grubmonger as i shall think fit during our conversations  thus you are likely soon to hear more of our metaphysics nay if you be but industrious enough to enable you to set up for yourself and become the apostle of paris i know no place where if you have but a morsel of the mavelous to detail you will find hearers better disposed to gape and swallow  c clifton  letter lxxxii anna wenbourne st ives to lovisa clifton london grosvenorstreet afortnight has almost elapsed since i last wrote to my louisa till my heart begins to cry shame at the delay could i plead no other excuse than the trifling occupations of a trifling world i must sign my own condemnation but your brother has afforded me better employment our frequent conversations on many of the best and most dignified of moral enquiries his acute remarks and objections and the difficult problems he has occasionally given me to solve have left me in no danger of being idle  oh louisa how exquisite is the pleasure i feel to see him thus determined thus incessant in his pursuit a change so fortunate and so sudden astonishes while it delights  may it continue  may it increase  may  vain unworthy wish  it must  the mind having once seized on the clue of truth can neither quit its hold nor become stationary it is obliged to advance and when its powers are equal to those of coke clifton ought we to wonder at its bold and rapid flights  still the conquests he daily makes over his own feelings cannot but surprise his struggles are evident but they are effectual he even resolutely casts off the strong prejudices he had conceived against frank henley invites him to aid us in our researches and appeals to him to explain and decide  let us if we wish to weed out error be sincere in our efforts and have no remorse for our prejudices  this is his own language louisa oh that i could fully communicate the pleasure this change of character gives me to my friend yes the restraint which too frequent contradiction lays him under will soon wear off and how great will then be the enthusiasm with which he will defend and promulgate truth  nor is it less delightful to observe the satisfaction which this reform sometimes gives to frank henley at others indeed he owns he is disturbed by doubt but he owns it with feelings of regret and is eager to prove himself unjust  yet respecting me his thoughts never vary  alas louisa i still am his by right his tongue is silent but his looks and manner are sufficiently audible i surely have been guilty of the error i so much dreaded my cause was strong but my arguments were feeble i have prolonged the warfare of the passions which i attempted to eradicate or rather have left on his mind a deep sense of injustice committed by me  the thought is intolerable  excruciating  but oh with what equanimity with what fortitude does he endure his imagined wrongs pure most pure must that passion be which at once possesses the strength of his and his forbearance there are indeed but few frank henleys  surely louisa i may do him justice  surely to esteem the virtuous cannot merit the imputation of guilt  who can praise him as he deserves and can that which is right in others be wrong in me  yet such are the mistakes to which we are subject i scarcely can speak or even think of him without suspecting myself of committing some culpable impropriety  pardon louisa these wanderings of the mind they are marauders which uniform vigilance alone can repel they are ever in arms and i obliged to be ever alert but it is petty warfare and cannot shake the dominion of truth  my feelings have led me from the topic i intended for the chief subject of this letter  the course of our enquiries has several times forced us upon that great question the progress of mind toward perfection and the different order of things which must inevitably be the result yesterday this theme again occurred frank was present and his imagination warm with the sublimity of his subject drew a bold and splendid picture of the felicity of that state of society when personal property no longer shall exist when the whole torrent of mind shall unite in enquiry after the beautiful and the true when it shall no longer be diverted by those insignificant pursuits to which the absurd follies that originate in our false wants give birth when individual selfishness shall be unknown and when all shall labor for the good of all  a state so distant from present manners and opinions and apparently so impossible naturally gave rise to objections and your brother put many shrewd and pertinent questions which would have silenced a mind less informed and less comprehensive than that of our instructor  at last a difficulty arose which to me wore a very serious form and as what was said left a strong impression on my memory i will relate that part of the conversation observe louisa that clifton and frank were the chief speakers your brother began  i confess sir you have removed many apparently unconquerable difficulties but i have a further objection which i think unanswerable  what is it  neither man nor woman in such a state can have any thing peculiar the whole must be for the use and benefit of the whole  as generally as practice will admit and how very general that may be imperfect as its constitution was sparta remained during five hundred years a proof  then how will it be possible when society shall be the general possessor for any man to say  this is my servant  he cannot there will be no servants  well but  this is my child  neither can he do that they will be the children of the state  indeed  and what say you to  this is my wife  can appropriation more than for the minute the hour or the day exist or among so disinterested a people can a man say even of the woman he loves  she is mine  we paused  i own louisa i found myself at a loss but frank soon gave a very satisfactory reply  you have started a question of infinite importance which perhaps i am not fully prepared to answer i doubt whether in that better state of human society to which i look forward with such ardent aspiration the intercourse of the sexes will be altogether promiscuous and unrestrained or whether they will admit of something that may be denominated marriage the former may perhaps be the truth but it is at least certain that in the sense in which we understand marriage and the affirmation  this is my wife  neither the institution nor the claim can in such a state or indeed in justice exist of all the regulations which were ever suggested to the mistaken tyranny of selfishness none perhaps to this day have surpassed the despotism of those which undertake to bind not only body to body but soul to soul to all futurity in despite of every possible change which our vices and our virtues might effect or however numerous the secret corporal or mental imperfections might prove which a more intimate acquaintance should bring to light  then you think that some stipulation or bargain between the sexes must take place in the most virtuous ages  in the most virtuous ages the word bargain like the word promise will be unintelligible  we cannot bargain to do what is wrong nor can we though there should be no bargain forbear to do what is right without being unjust  whence it results that marriage as a civil institution must ever be an evil  yes it ought not to be a civil institution it is the concern of the individuals who consent to this mutual association and they ought not to be prevented from beginning suspending or terminating it as they please  clifton addressed himself to me  what say you to this doctrine madam does it not shock does it not terrify you  as far as i have considered it no it appears to be founded on incontrovertible principles and i ought not to be shocked that some of my prejudices are opposed or at being reminded that men have not yet attained the true means of correcting their own vices  surely the consequences are alarming the man who only studied the gratification of his desires would have a new wife each new day and the unprotected fair would be abandoned to all the licentiousness of libertinism  frank again replied  then you think the security of women would increase with their imagined increase of danger and that an unprincipled man who even at present if he be known is avoided and despised would then find a more ready welcome because as you suppose he would have more opportunities to injure  i must own that the men fit to be trusted with so much power are in my opinion very few indeed  you are imagining a society as perverse and vitiated as the present i am supposing one wholly the contrary i know too well that there are men who because unjust laws and customs worthy of barbarians have condemned helpless women to infamy for the loss of that which under better regulations and in ages of more wisdom has been and will again be guilt to keep i know sir i say that the present world is infested by men who make it the business and the glory of their lives to bring this infamy upon the very beings for whom they feign the deepest affection  if ever patience can forsake me it will be at the recollection of these demons in the human form who come tricked out in all the smiles of love the protestations of loyalty and the arts of hell unrelentingly and causelessly to prey upon confiding innocence nothing but the malverse selfishness of man could give being or countenance to such a monster whatever is good exquisite or precious we are individually taught to grasp at and if possible to secure but we have each a latent sense that this principle has rendered us a society of detestable misers and therefore to rob each other seems almost like the sports of justice  for which reason sir were i a father i think i should shudder to hear you instructing my daughters in your doctrines  i perceive you wholly misconceive me and i very seriously request pray observe sir i very seriously request you to remember that i would not teach any mans daughters so mad a doctrine as to indulge in sensual appetites or foster a licentious imagination i am not the apostle of depravity while men shall be mad foolish and dishonest enough to be vain of bad principles women may be allowed to seek such protection as bad laws can afford  it is an eternal truth that the wisdom of man is superior to the strength of lions but i would not therefore turn an infant into a lions den  i am glad to be undeceived i thought it was scarcely possible you should mean what your words seemed to imply  at present i understand you and i again confess my surprise to find so much consistency and so many powerful arguments on a question in favor of which i thought nothing rational could be advanced you have afforded me food for reflection and i thank you i shall not easily forget what has been said  tell me my dear louisa are you not delighted with this dialogue and with the candor the force of thinking and what is still better the virtuous fears of your brother his mind revolted at the mischief which it seemed to forebode he was happy at being undeceived and with respect to argument i doubt whether he forgot any one of the most apparently formidable objections to what is called the levelling system but he was pleased to learn that this is only giving a good cause a bad name such a system is infinitely more opposite to levelling than the present since the very essence of it is that merit shall be the only claimant and shall be certain of preeminence  the satisfaction i feel my friend is beyond expression to have my hopes revived and daily strengthened after fearing they must all be relinquished increases the pleasure it is great and would be unmixed but for  well well  let clifton but proceed and frank will no longer say  to the end of time  you know the rest louisa  all good be with you  a w st ives p s i thought i had forgotten something when frank had retired your brother with delightful candor praised the great perspicuity as well as strength with which he argued he added there was one circumstance in particular in his principles concerning marriage although they had at first appeared very alarming which was highly satisfactory and this was the confidence they inspired nothing he said gave his nature so much offense as the suspicions with which at present our sex view the men about two years ago he had a partiality for a neapolitan lady and thought himself in love with her but in this he was mistaken it was rather inclination than passion he knew not at that time what it was to love neither this neapolitan lady though beautiful and highly accomplished nor any other woman his feelings told him could inspire pure affection who was incapable of confiding in herself and wanting this selfconfidence of confiding in her lover suspicion originates in a consciousness of self defect those who cannot trust themselves cannot be induced to trust others  thus justly louisa did he continue to reason nor could i forbear to apply the doctrine to myself i have been too distrustful of him my conscience accused me and i am resolved to remedy the fault i have always held suspicion to be the vice of mean and feeble minds but it is less difficult to find rules by theory than to demonstrate them by practice  i am sorry my dear louisa to hear that the infirmities of mrs clifton increase but these are evils for which we can at present find no remedy and to which we must therefore submit with patience and resignation    letter lxxxiii coke clifton to guy fairfax london dover street i will not suppose fairfax you seek to compliment me when you say you enjoy the exuberant heat of soul the fire that pervades my epistles i am glad you do i shall not think the worse of your talents many a line have i written in all the burst of feeling and not a few in all the blaze of wit and have said to myself  should he not understand me now  why if he should not dullness everlasting be his portion  but you take the sure way to keep up my ardour while i perceive you continue to enjoy i shall continue to be communicative a sympathetic yawner i may be but i do not believe i am often the first to begin  i knew not half my own merits i act my part to admiration it is true the combining circumstances are all favorable i must be a dunce indeed if i such a school i should want chicanery our disputations have been continual nor have i ever failed to turn them on the most convenient topics but none of them have equalled the last managed as it was with dexterity by me and in the very spirit i wished by my opponents i speak in the plural for i took care to have them both present several remarks which i had heard from him assured me he would second my plan which was no less than to prove  marriage a farce  would you have believed fairfax i should have had the temerity to step upon a rock so slippery and to have requested this archimago of adams journeymen adam you know being the worlds headgardener to stay and lend me his support  yet thus audacious was i and courage as it ought has been crowned with success  the thought was suggested by themselves and had you or i or any of us vile marriage haters been declaiming against the saffron god and his eternal shackles i doubt whether the best of us could have said any thing half so much to the purpose  is it not excellent   then had you heard me preach ay me myself against libertines and libertinism  by the by don cabbageplant had the insolence to say two or three devilish severe things dishonorable to the noble fraternity of us knights of the bedchamber which if i forget may woman never more have cause to remember me  however i brought him to own  i  do laugh by my very great apprehensions of the effects of such a doctrine that though marriage be a bad thing it is quite necessary at present for the defense of the weaker vessels and modest maidenhood ay and i applauded him for his honest candor i was glad i had misunderstood him thanked him for all his profound information in short made him exactly what i wished my tool and a hightempered tool he is by the aid of which i will show myself a most notable workman   not but the fellows eye was upon me i could observe him prying endeavoring to search and probe me but i came too well prepared instead of shrinking from the encounter my brow contracted increasing indignation and my voice grew louder as i stood forth the champion of chaste virginity and fanctimonious wedlock  the scene in the very critical sense of the phrase was high comedy   it was well fairfax they went no farther than paris had either of them only reached turin i had been half undone and had they touched at naples rome venice or half a dozen other fair and flourishing cities my character for a pretty behaved demure and virtuous gentleman had been irremediably ruined  upon my soul i cannot put it out of my head  had you heard me remonstrate what a horrid thing it would be to have marriage destroyed and us honest fellows turned loose among the virgins from whom we should catch and ravish each a new damsel every new day and had you seen what a fine serious undertakers face i put upon the business your heart would have chuckled to the day of your death it would never have been forgotten  perhaps you will wonder how i could draw such a doctrine from these spinners of hypothesis i will tell you i had heard them severally maintain  try to guess what  not in seven years though you were to do nothing else  you i suppose like me have heard that liberty security and property are the three main pillars of political happiness  well then these professors maintain that individual property is a general evil  what is more they maintain it by such arguments as would puzzle college council or senate to refute but that i am determined never to torment my brain about such quips and quillets may i turn turk if they would not have made a convert of me and have persuaded me that an estate of ten thousand a year was a very intolerable thing  my intention was to keep my countenance but to laugh at them in my heart most incontinently however i soon found my side of the question was not so perfectly beyond all doubt nor theirs quite so ridiculous as i had imagined  it is true i went predetermined to be convinced and to take all they should tell me for gospel i had a conclusion of my own to draw and if i could but lead to that i cared not how much i granted  i know not whether this predisposition in me was of any advantage to their argument though i think it was not for so ready was the solution to every difficulty i boldly ventured to state objections which i meant to have kept out of sight lest i should myself overturn a system that suited my purpose i perceived their eagerness saw there was no danger that they should stop at trifles even if i should happen to throw them a bone to pick and the readiness of each reply raised my curiosity i fearlessly drew out my heavy artillery which they with ease and safety as fearlessly dismounted with a breath my strong holds were all puffed down like so many houses of cards  by this however my main business was done more effectually we came to it by fair deduction it was not abruptly introduced it was major minor and consequent  all individual property is an evil  marriage makes woman individual property  therefore marriage is an evil  could there be better logic  as for his saving clause that marriage in these times of prejudice and vice i have the whole cant by rote fairfax is a necessary evil leave me to do that away what is she not a heroine and can i not convince her that to act according to a bad system when there is a better were to descend to the ways of the vulgar can i not teach her how superior she is to the pretty misses who conform to such mistaken laws shall she want the courage and the generosity to set the first good example how often have i seen her eyes sparkle her bosom heave and her zeal break forth in virtuous resolutions to encounter any peril to obtain a worthy purpose and can there be a more worthy  curse upon these qualms of conscience never before did i feel any thing so teazing so tormenting and knowing what i know remembering what i never can forget the slights injuries and insults i have received how i came to feel them now is to me wholly inconceivable she is acting it is true with what she calls the best and purest of intentions toward me she believes them to be such she sometimes almost obliges me to believe them such myself she tortures me by half constraining me to revere the virtues in favor of which she harangues so divinely but shall i like a poor uxorious lackadaisy driveller sit down satisfied with a divided heart  i  has she not with her own lips under her own hand avowed and signed her contumelious guilt her audacious preference of a rival  a mean a base a vulgar rival  and after this shall my projects suffer impediment from cheesecurd compassion  shall the querulous voice of conscience arrest my avenging arm  no fairfax  it cannot be though my heart in its anger could not accuse her of a single crime beside that alone that damning preference would be allsufficient  the furies have no stings that equal this recollection  i have been throwing up my sashes striding across my room and construing ten lines of seneca and my pulse again begins to beat more temperately  let us argue the point with this pert unruly marplot conscience of mine  it was not at first without considerable reluctance and even pain that i began to plot i almost abhorred reducing her to the level of the sex not one of whom was ever yet her equal but she used me ill fairfax yes she used me ill and you well know that want of resentment is want of courage none but pitiful contemptible nosouled fellows forget insults till ample vengeance have been taken and shall conscience insolently pretend to contradict the decree  beside i could not but remember our old maxims the cyprian battles our jovial corpse had fought and the myrtle wreaths each wight had won should i the leader the captain of the band be the first to fly my colors was it not our favorite axiom that he who could declare upon his honor he had found a generous woman who never had attempted once to deceive trifle with or play him trick should still be acknowledged a companion of our order even though he were to marry but that all coquetry all tergiversation all wrongs however slight were unpardonable and only one way to be redressed what answer can conscience give to that  your letters too are another stimulalative you detail the full true and particular account of your amorous malefactions and vaunt of petty obstacles petty arts and petty triumphs over signoras and madames who advance challenge you to the field and give battle purposely to be overcome their whole resistance is but to make you feel how great an alexander you are and that having vanquished them you are invincible as you will certainly never meet with an anna st ives it is possible you may die in that opinion but i tell you fairfax if you compare these practiced amazons to my heroine you are in a most heterodox and damnable error of which if you do not timely repent your soul will never find admission into the lovers elysium  bear witness however to my honesty of women i allow her to be the most excellent but still a woman and not as i foolishly for a while supposed an absolute goddess no no madam can curvet and play her pranks though of totally a different kind and being almost mortal at present mere mortal must become in despite of conscience and its green sickness physiognomy  at first i knew her not and unwilling to encounter logic in a gauze cap i ceased to oppose her arguments and thought to conciliate her by resolving to be of her creed what could be more generous but no forsooth the veil was too thin to pretend conviction when it was not felt and to be satisfied with arguments before i had heard them were all insufficient for her the prize could be gained only by him who could answer the enigmas of the sphinx i must enter the lists of cavil and run a tilt at wrangling ere the lady would bestow the meed of conquest can conscience pretend to palliate conduct like this  i then turned my thoughts to a new project and endeavored to overpower her by passion by excess of ardour by tenderness and importunity they had a temporary effect but i found them equally inefficacious nor was the art by which i had oftenest been successful forgotten though i confess that with her from the beginning it afforded me but little hope i tried to familiarize her to freedoms i began with her hands but she soon taught me that even her hands were sacred they were not to be treated with familiarity nor to be kissed and pressed like other hands let conscience if it can tell me why  in fine while to this insolent pedagogue she has been all honeysuckle sweet marjoram and hearts ease to me she has been rue wormwood and hellebore him praising me reproving confiding in him suspecting me and as the very summit and crown of injury proclaiming him the possessor the master of her admiration or in plain english of her heart  and now if after this impartial this cool this stoic examination mr conscience should ever again be impertinent enough to open his lips i am determined without the least ceremony to kick him out of doors  when this famous conference of which i told you some half an hour ago was ended and our president our monarch of morals and mulberries had quitted his chair and withdrawn i played an aftergame of no small moment after pronouncing a panegyric on the gentleman as a legislator fit for truth and me i read the lady a modest lecture on confidence informed her of almost the exact quantity which i expected she would repose in me and declaimed with eloquence and effect against those suspicious beauties who always regard us honest fellows as so many naughty goblins who like the ethiopian monster voraciously devour every virginandromeda they meet but as i tell you i did it modestly i kept on my guard watched the moment to press forward or to retreat and wielded my weapons with dexterity and fuccess  poor girl is it not a pity that the very shield in which she confides her perfect honesty and sincerity should be destined to fall upon and overwhelm her  thus says counselor sentiment and counselor sentiment is a great orator  but what say i why i say so have the fates decreed and therefore let the fates look to it it is no concern of mine i am but their willing instrument  these however are but the preliminaries the preparations for the combat ere long i shall be armed at all points and what is better by her own fair hands nor do i know how soon i may begin the attack i have been casting about to send this superintendant of the cardinal virtues this captain of casuists and caterpillars out of the way and i think i have hit upon a tolerably bold and ingenious stratagem i say bold because i perceive it is not without danger but i doubt i cannot devise a better without naming or appearing to mean myself i have fuggested to him by inventing a tale of two friends of mine what a noble and disinterested thing it would be for him to go down into the country and prevail on his father to remove all obstacles to our marriage   how say you is marriage your plan and if not is not that the way to ruin all  there is the danger i talked of but i do not think it great the scoundrel gardener i mean the father who is heartily despised by every body is desirous that his son should marry anna i know not whether i ever before mentioned this sublime effort of impudence the cunning rascal has so long been the keeper of sir arthurs purse that it is supposed two thirds of the contents have glided into his own pocket this is the reason of the delay on sir arthurs part which at present i do not wish to shorten that this son of a grub catcher a demosthenes though he be should prevailon such a father if he were to go down as i hope he will is but little probable however should the least prognostic of such a miracle appear i have my remedy prepared i will generously have a letter written to the senior overseer of the gravel walks which if the character i have heard of him be not wholly false shall revive all his hopes and put an end to compliance  in italy where amorous plotting is the national profession i was not easily circumvented and here where another gunpowder treason would as soon be suspected as such gins and snares at least by these very honest and sublime simpletons i laugh at the supposition of being unearthed  one word more i think i observe in this knight of gotham this sir arthur a more cordial kind of yearning toward our young prince of babel land than formerly a sort of desire to be more intimate with him of which by the by the youth is not very prompt to admit and an effort to treat him with more respect himself by way as it were of setting a good example to others if my conjectures are right the threats of the old muckworm father have shaken the crazy nerves of the baronet and i half suspect there is something more of meaning at the bottom of this were it so were he to attempt to discard me it would indeed add another spur to the fury of revenge an affront so deep given by this poor being this essence of insignificance would make revenge itself hot unsatiable revenge grow more hot madden more and thirst even after blood  patience foams at the supposition  thank heaven i hear the noisy postman with his warning bell which obliges me in good time to conclude and cool these fermenting juices of mine  c clifton  letter lxxxiv frank henley to oliver trenchard london grosvenor street my mind oliver is harassed by a variety of doubts i believe i shall soon be down at wenbourne hill and of course shall then not fail to meet thee and visit thy most worthy father  the reason of my journey originates in the doubts i mentioned i am angry with myself for feeling alarms at one moment which appear impossibilities the next if my fears have any foundation this clifton is the deepest the most hardened fiendlike hypocrite imagination can paint  but it cannot be  surely it cannot  i am guilty heinously guilty for enduring such a thought  so much folly and vice combined with understanding and i may say genius so uncommon is a supposition too extravagant too injurious  and yet it is strange oliver  a conduct so suddenly altered so totally opposite to old and inveterate habits is scarcely reconcilable to the human character but if dissimulation can be productive of this is truth less powerful no  truth is omnipotent yet who ever saw it hasty in its progress my only hope in this case is that the fuperiority of his mind has rendered him an exception to general rules  but what could he propose by his hypocrisy  i cannot tell  his passions are violent and ungovernable and are or very lately have been in full vigor  again and again it is strange  but what of this  why these fears can she be spotted tinged by the stain of unsanctified desire  never  the pure chastity of her soul is superior to attaint  yet  who can say  wilfully her mind can never err but who can affirm that even she may not be deceived and may not act erroneously from the most holy motives  perhaps oliver it is my own situation my own desires but half subdued in which these doubts take birth if so they are highly culpable  be it as it may there is a duty visibly chalked out for me by circumstances her present situation is surely a state of danger to see them married would now give me delight it would indeed be the delight of despair of gloom almost approaching horror but of that i must not think my father is the cause of the present delay i fear i cannot remove this impediment but it becomes me to try  though i had before conceived the design this conduct has even been suggested to me by clifton and in a mode that proves he can be artful if he please yet does it not likewise prove him to be in earnest  we have lately had several conversations one in particular which even while it seemed to place him in an amiable sincere and generous light excited some of the very doubts and terrors of which i speak  if he be a hypocrite he guards himself with a tenfold mask  it cannot  no  it cannot be   i mean to speak to sir arthur concerning my journey but not to inform him of its purport it would have the face of insult to tell him i was going to be his advocate with his servant not to mention that he has lately treated me with increasing and indeed unusual kindness if i do make an effort however it shall be a strenuous one though my hopes that it should be effectual are very few my decision is not yet final but in my next thou will probably learn the result farewell  f henley p s my brain is so busied by its fears that i forgot to caution thee against a mistake into which it is probable this letter may lead i mentioned in one of my last the project i had conceived of leaving england do not imagine i have abandoned a design on which the more i reflect the more i am intent the great end of life is to benefit community my mind in its present situation is too deeply affected freely and without encumbrance to exert itself  this is weakness  but not the less true oliver we are at present so imbued in prejudice have drunken so deeply of the cup of error that after having received taints so numerous and ingrained to wish for perfect consistency in virtue i doubt were vain here or at the antipodes alike i should remember her but i should not alike be so often tempted and deluded by false hopes the current of thought would not so often meet with impediments to arrest divide and turn it aside  i have studied to divine in what land or among what people whether savage or such as we call polished the energies of mind might be most productive of good but this is a discovery which i have yet to make the reasons are so numerous on each side that i have formed a plan for a kind of double effort i think of sailing for america where i may aid the struggles of liberty may freely publish all which the efforts of reason can teach me and at the same time may form a society of savages who seem in consequence of their very ignorance to have a less quantity of error and therefore to be less liable to repel truth than those whose information is more multifarious a merchant with whom by accident i became acquainted and who is a man of no mean understanding approves and has engaged to promote my plan but of this if i come to wenbourne hill we will talk further once more oliver adieu    letter lxxxv coke clifton to guy fairfax london doverstreet come to my aid fairfax encourage me feed my vanity let hungry ambition banquet and allow me to be a hero lest i relent for were i not or lucifer or coke clifton it is certain i should not persevere by the host of heaven fairfax but she is a divine creature she steals upon the soul a heart of rock could not resist her nor are they wiles nor womans lures nor blandishments of tricksey dimples nor captivating smiles with which she forms her adamantine fetters no it is the open soul of honesty true sincere and unrelentingly just to me to herself to all it is that enchanting kindness that heavenly suavity which never forsakes her that equanimity of smiling yet obstinate fortitude that hilarity of heart that knows not gloom because it knows not evil that inscrutable purity which rests secure that all like itself are natively immaculate that  pshaw  i can find no words find you imagination therefore and think not i will labor at impossibility you have read of ancient vestals of the virgins of paradise and of demideities that tune their golden harps on high  read again  and having traveled with prophets and apostles to the heaven of heavens descend and view her and invent me language to describe her if you can  curse on this frank henley but for him my vengeance never would have been roused never would the fatal sentence have passed my lips  it is now irrevocable  sure as the lofty walls of troy were doomed by gods and destiny to smoke in ruins so surely must the highsouled anna fall  ill starred wench  i fairfax like other conquerors cannot shut pity from my bosom while i cry havoc i could almost weep could look reluctant down on devastation which myself had made and heave a sigh and curse my proper prowess  in love and war alike such fairfax is towering ambition it must have victims its reckless altars ask a full and large supply and when perchance a snowy lamb spotless and pure bedecked for sacrifice in all the artless pomp of unsuspecting innocence is brought bright burns the flame the white clouds curl and mantle up to heaven and there ambition proudly sits and snuffs with glut of lusty delight the grateful odor  i know your tricks fairfax you are one of the doubtful doctors you love to catch credulity upon your hook i hear fat laughter gurgling in your throat and out bolts your threadbare simile  before the battles won the brentford hero sings te deum  but dont be wasteful of the little wit you have do i not tell you it is decreed when was i posted for a vapouring hector what but the recollections of my reiterated ravings resolves threats and imprecations could keep me steady assailed as i am by gentleness benevolence and saintlike charity  by the agency of subtlety hypocrisy and fraud i seek to rob her of what the world holds most precious by candor philanthropy and a noble expansion of heart she seeks to render me all that is superlatively great and good  why did she not seek all this in a less offensive way why did she oblige me to become a disputant with a plebeian  disputant  what do i say  worse worse  rival  devil  myriads of virtues could not atone the crime  yet in this deep guilt she perseveres and glories  can i forget  fear me not nor rank my defeat among things possible  be patient and lend an ear  to one sole object all my efforts point her mind must be prepared ay so that when the question shall be put chaste as that mind is it scarcely shall receive a shock such is the continual tendency of my discourse her own open and undisguised manners are my guide not a principle she maintains but which by my cunning questions and affected doubts pushed to an extreme adds links to the chain in which i mean to lead her captive  perhaps fairfax you will tell me this is the old artifice and that the minds of all women who can be said to have any mind must thus be inveigled to think lightly of the thing they are about to lose granted and yet the difference is infinite they are brought to think thus lightly of chastity but should you or any one of the gallant phalanx attempt to make anna st ives so think she would presently cry buzz to the dull blockhead and give him his eternal dismission  virtue with her is a real existence and as such must be adored her passions are her slaves and in this and this alone the lovely tyrant is the advocate of despotism she soon taught me that common arts would be treated by her not merely with determined and irrevocable repulse but with direct contempt some very feeble essays presently satisfied me no encroachments of the touch no gloting of the eye no well feigned tremblings and lovers palpitations would for an instant be suffered by her take the following as a specimen of my mode of attack  among her variety of hypotheses she has one on mutability little she says as we know of matter and spirit we still know enough to perceive they are both instantaneously eternally and infinitely changing of what the world has been through this series of never beginning never ending mutation she can form nothing more than conjecture yet she cannot but think that the golden age is a supposition treated at present with ridicule it does not deserve by the laws of necessity mind unless counteracted by accidents beyond its control is continually progressive in improvement with some such accidents we are tolerably well acquainted such are those which have been destructive of its progress notwithstanding the high seize it had made in greece and rome the ruins still existing in egypt are wonderful proofs of what it once was there though egypt is at present almost unequalled in ignorance and depravity who then shall affirm changes still more extraordinary have not happened she has no doubt some revolution in the planetary system excepted that men will attain a much higher degree of innocence length of life happiness and wisdom than have ever yet been dreamed of either by historian fabulist or poet for causes which formerly were equal to the effects then produced are now rendered impotent by the glorious art of printing which spreads preserves and multiplies knowledge in despite of ignorance false zeal and despotism  such was her discourse and thus vast were her views nay urged on by my questions by the consequences which resulted from her own doctrines and by the ardour of emanating benevolence she astonished me by her sublime visions for she proceeded to prove from seemingly fair deduction that men should finally render themselves immortal should become scarcely liable to moral mistake should all act from principles previously demonstrated and therefore never contend should be one great family without a ruler because in no need of being ruled should be incapable of bodily pain or passion and should expend their whole powers in tracing moral and physical cause and effect which being infinite in their series will afford them infinite employment of the most rational and delightful kind  oh how did the sweet enthusiast glow ay and make me glow too while with a daring but consistent hand she sketched out this bold picture of illusion  but while the lovely zealot thus descanted on splendid and half incomprehensible themes what did i why when i found her at the proper pitch when i saw benevolence and love of human kind beaming with most ardour in her eye and pouring raptures from her lip i then recalled her to her beloved golden age her times of primitive simplicity made her inform me what lovers then were and what marriage and what the bonds were which hearts so affectionate and minds so honest and pure demanded of each other  what think you could her answers to all these questions be what but such as i wished could lovers like these suspect each other could they basely do the wrong to ask for bond or pledge or if they wanted the virtue to charm could they still more basely ask rewards they did not merit could they with the wretched selfish jealousy of a modern marriagemaker seek to cadaverate affection and to pervert each other into a utensil a commodity a thing appropriate to self and liable with other lumber to be cast aside no fairfax she played fairly and deeply into my hand she created exactly such a pair of lovers as i could have desired for with respect to the truth and constancy with which she endowed them if i cannot be the thing i can wear the garb ay and it shall become me too shall sit degage upon me and be thought my native dress  think not that i am a mere listener far the reverse i throw in masterly touches which while they seem only to heighten her picture produce the full effect by me intended thus when she described the faith and truth and love of the innocents of her own creation how did i declaim against the abuse to which such doctrine though immutably true was liable  alas madam said i had the unprincipled youths with which these times abound your powers of argument with their own principles how dreadful would be the effect how many unsuspecting hearts would they betray  i am once more just returned from the palace of alcina i broke off at the end of my last paragraph to attend my charmer and here again am i detesting myself for want of resolution and detesting myself still more for having made a resolution for having undertaken that which i am so eternally tempted to renounce your sneer and your laugh are both ready  i know you fairfax  the gentleman is sounding a retreat the enterprise is too difficult  no  i tell you no no no  but i am almost afraid it is too damnable  i pretended to be exceedingly anxious concerning the delay and afflicted at not hearing any thing more from sir arthur if i did not do this it might be a clue to lead her to suspect hypocrisy considering how very ardent i was at the commencement and to say the truth i am weary enough of waiting though it is not my wish to be relieved by any expedition of sir arthurs who as i hinted to you before does not appear to be in the least hurry and whose unction for the gardeners son increases  but had you heard her console me had you seen her kindness the tear glistening in her eye while she entreated me to consider delay as a fortunate event which tended to permanent and ineffable happiness had you i say beheld her soul for it was both visible and audible fairfax though you are the marauder of marriage land and the sworn foe of virginity even you would have pardoned my tergiversation  did you never behold the sun burst forth from behind the riding clouds the scene that was gloomy dark and dismal is suddenly illumined what was obscure becomes conspicuous the bleak hills smile the black meadows assume a bright verdure quaking shadows dare no longer stay cold damps are dispelled and in an instant all is visible clear and radiant so vanish doubts when she begins to speak thus in her presence do the feelings glow and thus is gloom banished from the soul till all is genial warmth and harmony  these being my feelings now when i am escaped when i am beyond the circle of her sorceries think fairfax be just and think how seductive how dangerous an enemy i have to encounter  listen and judge  oh clifton  she speaks listen i say to her spells  oh clifton daily and hourly do i bless this happy accident this delay i think with the heroic archbishop i could have held my right hand firmly till the flames had consumed it could i but have brought to pass what this blessed event has already almost accomplished to behold your mind what it is and to recollect what it so lately was is bliss unutterable i consider myself now as destined to be yours but whether i am or am not is perhaps a thing of little moment let self be forgotten and all its petty interests what am i what can i be compared to what you may become the patriot the legislator the statesman the reconciler of nations the dispenser of truth and the instructor of the human race for to all these you are equal as for me however ardent however great my good will i cannot have the same opportunities beside i must be just to myself and you and it delights me to declare i believe you have a mind capable of conceptions more vast than mine of plans more daring and systems more deep and of soaring beyond me you have the strong memory the keen sensibility and the rapid imagination which form the poet it is my glory to repeat that your various powers when called forth have as variously astonished me to bid you persevere were now to wrong you for i think i dare affirm you cannot retreat you have at present seen too much thought too much known too much ever to forget in private you will be the honor of your family and the delight of your wife and in public the boast of your country and the admiration of the virtuous and the wise  i fell on my knee to the speaking deity she seemed delivering oracles my passions rose my heart was full her eulogium made it loath and abhor its own deceit the words  madam i am a villain  bolted to my lips there they quivering lingered in excruciating suspense and at last slunk back like cowards half wishing but wholly ashamed to do their office  by the immortal powers fairfax it was past resisting why should i not be all she has described the hero the legislator the great leader of this little world ay why not she seemed to prophesy she has raised a flame in me which if encouraged might fertilize or desolate kingdoms body of caesar i know not what to say  it is true she has treated me ill nay vilely it cannot be denied but ill treatment itself from her is superior to all the maukish kindness which folly and caprice endeavor to lavish fairfax would you did but behold her my heart was never so assailed before  my resolution is shaken i own but it is not obliterated no i will think again my very soul is repugnant to the supposition of leaving its envenomed tumors unassuaged and its angered stabs unavenged yet if healed they could be she surely possesses that healing art  once more i will think again  what you tell me in the postscript to your last concerning count caduke consult your dictionary or to save yourself trouble read count crazy alias beaunoir is wholly unintelligible to me but as you say the name of the gardeners son was several times mentioned by him i shall take an immediate opportunity of interrogating the squire of shrubs who i am certain from principle will when asked tell me all he knows  apropos of poetry the panegyric of this sylph of the sunbeams gave me an impulse which i could not resist and the following was the offspring of my headlong and impetuous muse for such the hussy is whenever the fit is upon her i commit it as it may happen to your censure or applause with this stipulation if you do not like it either alter it till you do or write me another which both you and i shall like better if that be not fair and rational barter i know nothing either of trade logic or common sense  anacreontic i when by the gently gliding stream on banks where purple violets spring i see my delias beauties beam i hear my lovely delia sing when hearts combine and arms entwine when fond caresses amorous kisses yield the height of human blisses entranced i gaze and sighing say thus let me love my life away ii or when the jocund bowl we pass and joke and wit and whim abound when song and catch and friend and lass in sparkling wine we toast around when bull and pun rude riot run and finding still the mirth increasing pealing laughter roars sans ceasing i peal and roar and pant and say thus let me laugh my life away iii when dreams of fame my fancy fill sweet soothing dreams of verse and rhyme that mark the poets happy skill and bid him live to latest time each rising thought with music fraught all full all flowing nothing wanting all harmonious all enchanting oh thus in rapt delights i say thus let me sing my life away iv oh lovely woman generous wine these potent pleasures let me quaff thy raptures wit oh make them mine oh let me drink and love and laugh in flowing verse let me rehearse how well i have used your bounteous treasure then at last when full my measure though pale my lip i will smile and say i have lived the best of lives away c clifton  letter lxxxvi frank henley to oliver trenchard london grosvenor street within a week oliver we shall once more meet what years of separation may afterward follow is more than i can divine i surely need not tell thee that this thought of separation were it not opposed by principle would indeed be painful and that it is at moments almost too mighty for principle itself but we are the creatures of an omnipotent necessity and there can be but little need to remind thee that a compliance with the apparently best should ever be an unrepining and cheerful act of duty  i have had a conversation with sir arthur very singular in its kind which has again awakened sensations in their full force that had previously cost me many bitter struggles to allay i began with informing him of my intention to go down to wenbournehill after which i proceeded to tell him it was my design to embark for america  he seemed surprised and said he hoped not  i answered i had reflected very fully on the plan and that i believed it was scarcely probable any reason should occur which could induce me to change my purpose  the thing he replied might perhaps not be so entirely improbable as i supposed his family had great obligations to me i had even risked my life on various occasions for them they thought my talents very extraordinary in fine oliver the good old gentleman endeavored to say all the kind and as he deemed them grateful things his memory could supply and added that should i leave england without affording them some opportunity to repay their obligations they should be much grieved there were perhaps two or three very great difficulties in the way but still he was not sure they might not be overcome not that he could say any thing positively for matters were he must own in a very doubtful state he was himself indeed very considerably uneasy and undetermined but he certainly wished me exceedingly well and so with equal certainty at present did all his family his daughter his son himself were all my debtors  the good old gentlemans heart overflowed oliver and by its ebullitions raised a tumult in mine which required every energy it possessed to repel what could i answer but that i had done no more for his family than what it was my duty to do for the greatest stranger and that if gratitude be understood to mean a remembrance of favors received i and my family had for years indubitably been the receivers  he still persisted however in endeavoring to dissuade me from the thought of quitting the kingdom not finding me convinced by his arguments he hesitated with an evident desire to say something which he knew not very well how to begin all minds on such occasions are under strong impulses my own wish that he should be explicit was eager and i excited him to proceed at last he asked if he might put a question to me assuring me it was far from his intention to offend but that he had some uneasy doubts which he could be very glad to have removed  i desired him to interrogate me freely and to assure himself that i would be guilty of no dissimulation  he knew my sincerity he said but if when i heard i should think any thing in what he asked improper i past dispute had a right to refuse  i answered that i suspected or rather was convinced i had no such right and requested him to begin  he again stammered and at last said  i think mr henley i have remarked some degree of esteem between you and my daughter   he stopped  his desire not to wound my feelings was so evident that i determined to relieve him and replied   i believe sir i can now divine the subject of your question you would be glad to know if any thing have passed between us and what perhaps you ought to have been told without asking but i am certain that concealment at present would be highly wrong  i then repeated as accurately as my memory would permit which is tolerably tenacious on this fubject all which anna and i had reciprocally said and done it was impossible oliver to make this recapitulation with apathy my feelings were awakened and i assure thee the emotions of sir arthur were as lively as in such a mind thou could well suppose the human heart seems to be meliorated and softened by age he wept a thing with him certainly not usual at the recital of his daughters heroic resolves in favor of duty and at her respect for parental prejudices her dread of rendering him unhappy made him even sob and burst into frequent interjections of  she is a dear girl she is a heavenly girl i always loved her she is the delight of my life my souls treasure from her infancy to this hour she was always an angel  after hearing me fully confirm him in his esteem and affection for so superlative a daughter he added  you tell me mr henley that you freely informed my daughter you thought it was even her duty to prefer you to all mankind even though her father and friends should disapprove the match  i did sir i spoke from conviction and should have thought myself culpable had i been silent  perhaps so but that is very uncommon doctrine  it was not merely that more felicity would have been secured to ourselves but greater good i supposed would result to society  i have heard you explain things of that kind before i do not very well understand them but give me leave to ask  are you still of the same opinion  i am sir  not that i am so confident as i was  mr clifton has a very astonishing strength of mind and should it be turned to the worthy purposes of which it is capable i dare by no means decide positively in my own favor and the decision which i now make against him is the result of the intimate acquaintance which i must necessarily have with my own heart added to certain dubious appearances as to his which i know not how to reconcile of myself i am secure  and of him you have some doubts  i have but i ought in duty to add the appearances of their being unjust are daily strengthened  sir arthur paused ruminated and again seemed embarrassed at last he owned he knew not what to say turn which way he would the obstacles were very considerable his mind had really felt more distress within these two months than it had ever known before he could resolve on nothing yet he could not but wish i had not been quite so determined on going to america there was no saying what course things might take mrs clifton was very ill and in all probability could not live long but again he knew not what to say he certainly wished me very well  very well  i was an uncommon young man i was a gentleman by nature which for aught he knew might be better than a gentleman by birth the world had its opinions perhaps they were just perhaps unjust he had been used to think with the world but he had heard so much lately that he was not quite so positive as he had been  this oliver reminded me of the power of truth how it saps the strong holds of error and winds into the heart and how incessantly its advocates ought to propagate it on every occasion he was not quite so well pleased as he had been with my father but that was no fault of mine he knew i had a very different manner of thinking still he must say it was what he very little expected he hoped however that things would one way or other go more smoothly and he concluded with taking my hand pressing it very warmly and adding with considerable earnestness  if you can think of changing your american project pray do  pray do   after which he left me with something like a heavy heart  and now oliver how ought i to act the opposing causes of these doubts and difficulties in his mind are evident the circumstances which have occurred in my favor being aided by the obstinate selfishness of my father by his acquired wealth and as i suppose by the embroiled state of sir arthurs affairs have produced an unhoped sor revolution in the sentiments of sir arthur but is it not too late are not even the most tragical consequences to be feared from an opposition to clifton nay if his mind be what his words and behavior speak would not opposition be unjust were it not better with severe but virtuous resolution to repel these flattering and probably deceitful hopes than by encouraging them to feed the cankerworm of peace and add new force to the enemy within who rather stunned than conquered is every moment ready to revive  neither is sir arthur master of events nor is his mind consistent enough to be in no danger of change  my heart is sufficiently prone to indulge opposite sentiments but it must be silenced it must listen to the voice of truth  did i but better understand this clifton i should better know how to decide that he looks up to her with admiration i am convinced she seems to have discovered the true key to his understanding as well as to his affections even within this day or two i have observed symptoms very much in his favor how do i know but thus influenced he may become the first of mankind the thought restores me to a sense of right never oliver shall self complacency make me guilty of what cannot but be a crime most heinous if such a mind may by these means be gained which would otherwise be lost shall it be extinguished by me would not an assassination like this outweigh thousands of common murders well may i shudder at such an act oliver i am resolved if there be power in words or in reason my father shall comply  as far as i understand the human mind there is and even should he persevere there always must be something to me enigmatical in this instance of its efforts in clifton persevere however i most sincerely hope and even believe he will  but should he not  the supposition is dreadful  anna st ives  my heart sinks within me  can virtue like hers be vulnerable  surely not  the more pure a woman is in principle the more secure would she be from common seducers but if the man can be found who possesses the necessary though apparently incompatible excess of folly and wisdom there is a mode by which such a woman is more open to the arts of deceit than any other and is not that woman anna st ives nay more if he be not a prodigy of even a still more extraordinary kind is not that man coke clifton  he came in the heyday of youthful pride selfsatisfied selfconvinced rooted in prejudice but abundant in ideas argument made no impression for where he ought to have listened he laughed the weapons of wit never failed him and while he lanched them at others they recoiled and continually lacerated himself of this he was insensible he felt them not or felt them but little his haughtiness never slumbered and to oppose him was to irritate not convince for four months he continued pertinaciously the same then without any cause known to me suddenly changed it was indeed too sudden not to be alarming  and yet my firm and cool answer to all this is that hypocrisy so foolish as well as atrocious is all but impossible   indeed oliver i do not seek to wrong him i do not hunt after unfavourable conjectures they force themselves upon me or if i do it is unconsciously the passions are strangely perverse and if i am deceived as i hope i am it is they that misguide me  clifton has just been with me some correspondent from paris has mentioned the visit paid to me instead of him by the count de beaunoir but in a dark and unintelligible manner and he came to enquire i confess oliver while i was answering his interrogatories i seemed to feel that both you and i had drawn a false conclusion relative to secrecy and that by concealment to render myself the subject of suspicion was an unworthy procedure however as my motives were not indirect whatever my silence might be i answered without reserve and told him all that had passed frankly owning my fears of his irritability as the reason why i did not mention the affair immediately  he laughed at the counts rhodomontade acknowledged himself obliged to me and allowed that at that time my fears were not wholly causeless he behaved with ease and good humor and left me without appearing to have taken any offense  i shall be with thee on tuesday i know it will be a day of feasting to the family and i will do my best endeavor not to cast a damp on the hilarity of benevolence and friendship  f henley  letter lxxxvii anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton london grosvenor street alas louisa what are we  what are our affections what our resolves taken at unguarded moments agitated hurried away by passion how seldom have we for a day together reason to be satisfied with our conduct  not pleased with myself i doubt i have given cause of displeasure to your brother my father was in part the occasion for a moment he made me forget myself  louisa  frank henley is going to america he does not lightly resolve and his resolution seems fixed  good god  i  louisa  i am afraid i am a guilty creature  weak  very weak  and is not weakness guilt  but why should he leave us  where will he find hearts more alive to his worth  sir arthur came to inform me of it he had been conversing with him and had endeavored but without effect to dissuade him from his purpose he came and begged me to try i perhaps might be more successful  there was a marked significance in his manner and i asked him why  nay my dear child said he and his heart seemed full you know why mr henley has told me why  what sir has he told  nothing child  sir arthur took my hand  nothing but what is honorable to you  i questioned him and you know he is never guilty of falsehood  no sir he is incapable of it  well anna try then to persuade him not to leave us though he is a very excellent young man i am afraid he has not the best of fathers i begin to feel i have not been so prudent as i might have been and if mr henley were to leave england the father might attribute it to us and  sir arthur hesitated  i have received some extraordinary letters from abimelech of which i did not at first see the full drift but it is now clear every thing corresponds and my conversation with young mr henley has confirmed all i had supposed however he is a very good a very extraordinary young gentleman and i could wish he would not go i dont know what may happen  your brother came in and sir arthur left me desiring me as he went to remember what he had said clifton after an apology asked  does it relate to me at that moment frank entered no said i it relates to one who i did not think would have been so ready to forsake his friends  a thousand thoughts had crowded to my mind a dread of having used him ungenerously unjustly a recollection of all he had done and all he had suffered his enquiring penetrating and unbounded genius his superlative virtues a horror of his being banished his native country by me of his wandering among strangers exposed to poverty perils and death with the conviction in his heart that i had done him wrong  my tumultuous feelings rushed upon me overpowered me and in a moment of enthusiasm i ran to him snatched his hand fell on my knee and exclaimed  for the love of god mr henley do not think of leaving us  clifton like myself could not conquer the first assault of passion he pronounced the word madam in a tone mingled with surprise and severe energy which recalled me to myself   you see said i turning to him what an unworthy weak creature i am  but mr henley has taken the strangest resolution   what madam said your brother recovering himself and with some pleasantry is he for a voyage to the moon or does he wait the arrival of the next comet to make the tour of the universe  nay answered i you must join me and not treat my poor petition with ridicule  you must not go mr henley indeed you must not i mr clifton my father my brother we will none of us hear of it we are all your debtors and it would be unjust in you to deprive us of every opportunity of testifying our friendship  your brother louisa made an effort worthy of himself repressed the error of his first feelings assumed the gentle aspect of entreaty and kindly joined me  we are indeed your debtors said he to mr henley but i hope it is not true i hope there is no danger that you should forsake us where would you go where can you be so happy  i mean first replied frank to go to wenbourne hill and after that my intentions are for america  this louisa brought on a long discussion i and your brother both endeavored to convince him it was his duty to remain in england that he could be more serviceable here and would find better opportunities for effecting that good which he had so warmly at heart than in any other country  he answered that though he was not convinced by our arguments he should think it his duty seriously to consider them but we could not make him promise any thing further previous to his return from wenbourne hill he would determine  indeed louisa this affair lies very heavily upon my mind i am incessantly accusing myself as the cause of his exile and am i not by the manner of sir arthur i am sure he must have said something very highly in my praise i have gone too far with your brother to recede that is now impossible it would be more flagrant injustice than even the wrong to frank if a wrong it be and indeed louisa i dread it is  indeed i do  i dread it even with a kind of horror  i thought reason would have appeased these doubts ere this but every occasion i find calls them forth with unabated vigor surely this mental blindness must be the result of neglect had we but the will the determination it might be removed oh how reprehensible is my inconsistency  the rapid decline of mrs clifton grieves me deeply your brother too has frequently mentioned it with feelings honorable to his heart he is now more than ever sensible of her worth he has been with me since i began to write this letter and there is not the least appearance of remaining umbrage on his mind it was indeed but of short duration though too strong and sudden not to be apparent  all kindness peace and felicity be with you  a w st ives  letter lxxxviii coke clifton to guy fairfax london dover street i will curse no more fairfax or if curse i do it shall be at my own fatuity i will not be the dilatory languid ranting moralizing hamlet of the drama that has the vengeance of hell upon his lips and the charity of heaven in his heart i will use not speak daggers   fairfax i am mad  raging  the smothered and pentup mania must have vent  what was not the page sufficiently black before  i am amazed at my own infatuation my very soul spurns at it  but it is past  deceitful damned sex  idiot that i was i began to fancy myself beloved  i  blind deaf insensate driveler  torpid blockish brainless mammet  most sublime ass  oh for a bib and barley sugar with the label meacock pinned before and behind   fairfax i never can forgive my own absurd and despicable stupidity  marriage  what with a woman in whose eye the perfect impression and hated form of a mean rival is depicted  in colors glowing hot  who lives revels triumphs in her heart  i marry such a woman  i   i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others use i am too full of phrensy fairfax to tell thee what i mean but she has given me another proof more damning even than all the former of the gluttony with which her soul gorges her gloating eye devours him ay i being present nay were i this moment in her arms her arms would be clasping him not me with him she would carouse nor would any thing like me exist  contagion  poison and boiling oil   never before was patience so put to the proof  my danger was extreme with rage flaming in my heart i was obliged to wear complacency satisfaction and smiles on my countenance  the fellow has determined to ship himself for america  would it were for the bottomless pit  and had you beheld her panic  st lukes collected maniacs at the full of the moon could not have equalled her  twas well indeed her frantic outrage was so violent or i had been detected and all had been lost  as it was i half betrayed myself  the fellows eye glanced at me however it gave me my cue and all things considered i afterward performed to a miracle her own enthusiastic torrent swept all before it and gave me time she was in an ecstasy reasoning supplicating conjuring panting i her friends the whole world must join her and join her i did it was the very relief of which hypocrisy stood in need i entreated this straightbacked youth stiff in determination to condescend to lend a pitying ear to our petitions to suffer us to permeate his bowels of compassion and avert this fatal and impending cloud fraught with evils misery and mischief   but marry no  it could not be  sentence was passed  he had been at the trouble to make a pair of scales and knew the weight to a scruple of every link in the whole chain of cause and effect  teach him truly  advisehim  move him  when who how  at last compliance willing to be royally gracious said well it would consider  though there was but little hope  nothing it had heard had any cogency of perscrutation  but in fine it would be clement and consider  do you not see this fellow fairfax is he not now before your eyes is he not the most consummate but why do i trouble myself a moment about him  it is her  her   nor is this all did that devil that most delights in mischief direct every concurring circumstance they could not all and each be more uniform more coercive to the one great end this poor dotterel sir arthur is playing fast and loose with me he has been at his soundings  he  imbecile animal  could wish there were not so many difficulties  is afraid they cannot be all removed  has his doubts and his fears  twenty thousand pounds is a large sum and mrs clifton is very positive  his own affairs much less promising than he supposed  then by a declension of hems hums and has he descended to young mr henley  a very extraordinary young gentleman  a very surprising youth  one made on purpose as it were for plumcake days high festivals and raree show  a prodigy  not begotten born or bred in the dull blindmansbuff way of simple procreation but sent us on a sunday morning down jacobs ladder  then for obligations to him count them who could  he must first study more arithmetic  and as for affection it was a very wayward thing  not always in peoples power  there was no knowing what was best  the hand might be given and the heart be wanting  and with respect to whether the opinions of the world ought to be regarded good truth he knew not marry the world was much more ready to blame others than to amend itself and he had been almost lately persuaded not to care a fico for the world but for his part he was a godly christian and wished all for the best he had faith hope and charity which were enough for one  do not imagine fairfax the poor dotard would have dared to betray himself thus far had not i presently perceived his drift and wormed him of these dismal cogitations of the spirit he beat about and hovered and fluttered and chirped mournfully like the poor infatuated bird that beholds the serpents mouth open into which it is immediately to drop and be devoured however having begun i was determined to make him unburden his whole heart if hereafter he can possibly find courage to face me in order to reproach i have my lesson ready out of thy own mouth will i judge thee sinner  gangrened as my heart is i still find a satisfaction in this self convalescence the lady of mellifluous speech shall suborn no more no more shall lull me into beatific slumbers i have recovered from my trance and what i dreamed was celestial i will demonstrate to be mere woman  from his own lips i learn that this insolent scoundrel received a visit from the count de beaunoir which was intended for me and out of tender pity to my body lest god ild us it should get a drilling he did bestow some trifle of that wit and reason of which he has so great a superflux upon the count thereby to turn aside his wrathful ire  i heard the gentleman tell his tale and tickle his imagination with the remembrance of his own doctiloquy with infinite composure and whenever i put a question took care first to prepare a smile every thing was well better could not be  with respect to monsieur le comte i will take some opportunity to whisper a word in his ear it is not impossible fairfax but that i may visit paris even within this fortnight not that i can pretend to predict they shall not think i fly them should any soul among them dare to dream of vengeance i know the count to be as vain of his skill in the sword as he is of his pair of watch strings his parisbirmingham snuff box or the bauble that glitters on his finger i think i can give him a lesson at least i mean to try  my mothers health declines apace i know not whether it may not shortly be necessary for me to visit her the loss of her will afflict me but in all appearance it is inevitable and i fear not far distant  once more fairfax should you again fall in company with the count and he should give himself the most trifling airs assure him that i will do myself the honor to embrace him within a month at farthest from that date be it when it will  adieu c clifton  letter lxxxix anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton london grosvenorstreet he is gone louisa has left us his purpose unchanged his heart oppressed and his mind intent on promoting the happiness of those by whom he is exiled and what am i or who that i should do him this violence what validity have these arguments of rank relationship and the worlds opprobrium are they just he refuted them so he thought and so persists to think and who was ever less partial or more severe to himself  louisa my mind is greatly disturbed his high virtues the exertion of them for the peculiar protection of me and my family and the dread of committing an act of unpardonable injustice if unjust it be are images that haunt and tantalize me incessantly  if my conclusions have been false and if his asserted claims be true how shall i answer those which i have brought upon myself the claims of your brother which he urges without remission are still stronger they have been countenanced admitted and encouraged i cannot recede what can i do but hope ardently hope frank henley is in an error and that he himself may make the discovery yet how long and fruitless have these hopes been my dilemma is extreme for if i have been mistaken act how i will extreme must be the wrong i commit  little did i imagine a moment so full of bitter doubt and distrust as this could come were i but satisfied of the rectitude of my decision there are no sensations which i could not stifle no affections which i could not calm nor any wandering wishes but what i could reprove to silence but the dread of a flagrant an odious injustice distracts me and i know not where or of whom to seek consolation even my louisa the warm friend of my heart cannot determine in my favor  your brother has been with me he found me in tears enquired the cause and truth demanded a full and unequivocal confidence i showed him what i had been writing you may well imagine louisa he did not read it with total apathy but he suppressed his own feelings with endeavors to give relief to mine he argued to show me my motives had been highly virtuous he would not say  his candor delighted me louisa  he would not say there was no ground for my fears he was interested and might be partial he believed indeed i had acted in strict conformity to the purest principles but had i even been mistaken the origin of my mistake was so dignified as totally to deprive the act of all possible turpitude  he was soothing and kind gave high encomiums to frank took blame to himself for the error of his former opinions and reminding me of the motives which first induced me to think of him tenderly asked if i had any new or recent cause to be weary of my task  what could i answer what but that i was delighted with the rapid change perceptible in his sentiments and with the ardour with which his enquiries were continued  frank henley is by this time at wenbourne hill you will see him plead our cause louisa urge him to remain among us condescend even to enforce my selfish motive that he would not leave me under the torturing supposition of having banished him from a country which he was born to enlighten reform and bless  there is indeed another argument but i know not whether it ought to be mentioned sir arthur owns he is in the power of the avaricious abimelech and i believe is in dread of foreclosures that might even eject him from wenbourne hill this man must have been an early and a deep adventurer in the trade of usury or he never could have gained wealth so great as he appears to have amassed  past incidents with all of which you are acquainted have given sir arthur a high opinion of frank and this added to his own fears i am persuaded would lead him to consider a union between us at present with complacency were not such an inclination opposed by other circumstances the open encouragement that he himself has given to clifton is one and it is strengthened by all the interest of the other branches of our family your brother is highly in favor with lord fitz allen my aunt wenbourne equally approves the match and clifton and my brother edward are become intimate as to me reason consistency and my own forward conduct oblige me to be the enemy of frank  louisa i scarcely know what i write think not i have abandoned myself to the capricious gusts of passion or that my love of uncontaminated and rigorous virtue is lessened no it is indecision it is an abhorrence of injustice which shake and disquiet me  write to me let me know your sentiments and particularly how far your application to frank when you have made it is successful i am anxious to receive your letter for i know it will inspire fortitude of which i am in great great need  a w st ives  letter xc louisa clifton to anna wenbourne st ives rosebank oh my dearest and ever dear anna what shall i say how shall i assuage doubts that take birth in principles so pure and a heart so void of guile i know not i have before acknowledged the mist is too thick for me to penetrate  the worthy the nobleminded frank has been with us and i could devise no better way than to show him your letter he was greatly moved and collecting all the firmness of his soul resolutely declared that since your peace was so deeply concerned be his own sensations what they might he would conquer them and remain in england the heartfelt applause he bestowed upon you was almost insupportably affecting he has indeed a deep sense of your uncommon worth and he alone i fear on earth is capable of doing it justice  but things have taken a different turn and what can the best of us do when involved as we continually are in doubt and difficulty but act as you do with impartial self denial and the most rigid regard to truth and virtue  alas dear anna i too am in need of support and in search of fortitude  my mother  she will not be long among us  a heart more benevolent a mind more exalted  she calls  i hear her feeble voice  not even my anna must rob her of my company for those few remaining moments she has yet to come i am her last consolation  l clifton i expect you will this post receive a letter from frank that will speak more effectually to your heart than i have either the time to do or the power    letter xci frank henley to anna wenbourne st ives wenbournehill madam your generous and zealous friend has thought proper to show me your letter i will not attempt to describe the sensations it excited but as your peace of mind is precious to me and more precious still perhaps to the interests of society and since my departure would occasion alarms and doubts so strong i am determined to stay my motives for going i thought too forcible and well founded to be overpowered nor could they perhaps have been vanquished by any less cause if one of us must suffer the warfare of contending sentiments and principles let it be me it was to fly from and if possible forget or subdue them that i projected such a voyage our duties to society must not cede to any effeminate compassion for ourselves we are both enough acquainted with those duties to render us more than commonly culpable should we be guilty of neglect  to describe my weakness and the contention to which my passions have been lately subject might tend to awaken emotions in you which ought to be estranged from your mind our lot is cast let us seek support in those principles which first taught us reciprocal esteem nor palliate our desertion of them by that self pity which would become our reproach we have dared to make high claims form high enterprises and assert high truths let us show ourselves worthy of the pretensions we have made and not by our proper weakness betray the cause of which we are enamoured  you will not  no you are too just  i am sure madam you will not attribute resolutions like these which are more infinitely more painful to the heart than they ought to be to any light or unworthy change of sentiment superior gifts superior seize and superior virtues inevitably beget admiration in those who discover them for their possessors admiration is the parent of esteem and the continuance and increase of this esteem is affection or in its purest and best sense love to say i would not esteem and would not love virtue and especially high and unusual virtue would be both folly and guilt  but you have taught me how pure and selfdenying this love may be oh that the man of your choice may but become all you hope and all of which his uncommon powers are capable oh that i may but see you as happy as you deserve to be and i think i shall then not bestow much pity upon myself  i have forborne madam to intrude the petty disquiets of another kind from which as you will readily imagine i cannot have been wholly free need i say how much i disapprove my fathers views and the mode by which he would have them accomplished there is no effort i will not make to conquer and remove this obstacle it wounds me to the heart that you the daughter of his benefactor should for a moment be dependant on his avarice the injury and iniquity are equally revolting and there are moments when my prejudices falsely accuse me of being a participator in the guilt  i have had two conversations with my father they both were animated but though he was very determined his resolution begins to fail and as i have justice on my side and am still more determined than he i have no doubt that in a few days every thing which sir arthur has required of him he will be willing to undertake  however as in a certain sense all is doubtful which is yet to be done perhaps strict prudence would demand that sir arthur should not be led to hope till success is ascertained of which i will not delay a moment to send you information  i am etc f henley  letter xcii coke clifton to guy fairfax london dover street the moment fairfax the trying the great the glorious moment approaches every possible contributing cause calls aloud for expedition and reprobates delay this gardening fellow is gone for his absence i thank him but not for the resolute spirit with which he intends to attack his father and make him yield he has a tongue that would silence the congregated clamours of the sorbonne and dumbfound belial himself in the hall of pandemonium it is certain he has a tough morsel to encounter and yet i fear he will succeed  this would destroy all  marry her  no  by heaven no if the hopes of abimelech be not stubborn enough to persevere they must and shall be strengthened his refusal is indispensably necessary in every view unless the view of marriage which i once more tell you fairfax i now detest i should have no plea with her were that of delay removed  what is still worse this delay may be removed by another and more painful cause my mother it appears declines rapidly her death is even feared and should it happen i cannot pretend to insist on the obstacles which her maternal cares and provisionary fears have raised  i can think of no certain expedient for this abimelech but that of an anonymous letter neither the writing nor the style must appear to be mine nor must the hand that writes it understand its purport tyros and ignorant as my opponents are in the tricks and intrigues of amorous stratagem still they have too much understanding not to be redoubtable  those old necromancers subtlety and falsehood must forge the magic armor and the enchanted shield under which i fight like wizards of yore they must render me invisible and the fair form of the foolish clifton they have imagined must only be seen  honest ab y or i mistake him is too worthy a fellow to desert so good a cause and this cloudcapt lady whose proud turrets i have sworn to level with the dust will not descend to plead the approaching death of my mother when i shall urge the injustice of delay  ay fairfax the injustice i mean to command to dare to overawe that is the only oratory which can put her to the rout she loves to be astonished and astonished she shall be if i do not shrink from myself her fall is infallible  my heart exults in the coming joy never more will the milky pulp of compassion rise to mar the luxurious meal she has been writing to the fellow fairfax ay and has shown me her letter for let her but imagine that truth or virtue or principle or any other abortive being of her own creation requires her to follow the whims of her disjointed fancy and what frantic folly is there of which she is incapable  it is maddening to recollect but she doats on the fellow absolutely doats i am the tormenting demon that has appeared to interrupt her happiness she the devoted victim sacrificed to shield me from harm the thought of separation from him is distracting and every power must be conjured up to avert the horrid woe  never before did my feelings support such various and continual attacks never did i endure infidelity so open or insult so unblushing but patience the day of vengeance is at hand or rather is here this moment will i fly and take it expect to hear of battles sieges disastrous chances and of moving accidents but not of hair breadth escapes  escape she cannot i go she falls  c clifton  letter xciii frank henley to anna wenbourne st ives wenbournehill it is now a week since i wrote to you madam at which time i took some pleasure in acquainting you with my hopes of success these hopes continued to increase and my father had almost promised to agree to the just proposals i made when two days ago he suddenly and pertinaciously changed his opinion  i am sorry to add that he now appears to be much more determined than ever and that i am wholly astonished at and wholly unable to account for this alteration of sentiment i delayed sending you the intelligence by yesterdays post hoping it was only a temporary return of former projects which i could again reason away but i find him so positive so passionate and so inaccessible to reason that i am persuaded some secret cause has arisen of which i am ignorant yet do not be dejected dear madam nor imagine i will lightly give it up as a lost cause  no  my mind is too much affected and too earnestly bent on its object not to accomplish it if possible  i received your letter it contained the state of her feelings with which the reader is already acquainted but no new incidents for which reason it is omitted  but have no thanks that can equal the favor i hope the emotions to which it gave birth were worthy such a correspondent i can truly and i believe innocently say my heart sympathises in all your joys hopes and apprehensions and that my pleasure at the progress of mr clifton in the discovery of truth and the practice of virtue is but little less than your own  i am glad you thought proper to be cautious of giving sir arthur any unconfirmed expectations and i promise you to exert every effort to effect a propitious change in the present temper and resolutions of my father  i am dear madam etc f henley  letter xciv coke clifton to guy fairfax london dover street when last i wrote my resolution was taken and i determined on immediate attack but i went in a seeming unlucky moment though i much mistake if it were not the very reverse  the supposed misfortune i had foreseen fell upon me the squire of preachers had fairly overcome his fathers obstinacy and induced him to give ground instead of having received the news of his determined persistency i found her with a letter in her hand informing her that he had begun to relent and that his full acquiescence was expected  to have commenced the battle at so inauspicious a moment would have been little worthy of a great captain my resolution was instantly formed  after acting as much ecstasy as i could call up i hastened home and wrote my projected letter to honest aby i threw my hints together in italian that they might not be understood by the agent whom i meant to employ this was my groom an english lad whom i met with at paris who spells well and writes a good hand i pretended i had crushed my finger and could not hold a pen and without letting him understand the intent of my writing or even that it was a letter i dictated to him as follows a transcript of which i send to you fairfax first that you may sigh and see what the blessing of a ready invention is and next as an example which you may copy or at least from which you may take a hint if ever you should have occasion  so you have been persuaded at last to give up your point my old friend and can you swallow this tale of a tub a fine cock and a bull story has been dinned in your ears dont believe a word on it i know the whole affair and though you dont know me be assured i mean you well and i tell you that if you will but hold out stoutly every thing will soon be settled to your hearts desire she is dying for love of him and he cannot see it she will never have the man they mean for her i can assure you of that and what is more he will never have her what i tell you i know to be true no matter who i am if i knew nothing of the affair how could i write to you and if the advice i give be good what need you care whom it comes from only dont let your son see this if you do it will spoil all you perceive how blind he is to his own good and how positive too keep your counsel but be resolute look around you persist in your own plans and the hall the parks the gardens the meadows the lands you see are all your own i am sure you cannot misunderstand me but mark my words be close keep your thoughts to yourself you know the world you have made your own fortune dont mar it by your own folly tell no tales i say nor if you are a wise man give the least hint that you have a friend in a corner  this i dictated to my amanuensis pretending to translate it out of the paper i held in my hand and which i took care to place before him so that he should see it was really written in a foreign language i likewise once or twice counterfeited a laugh at what i was reading and ejaculated to myself  this is a curious scrap  when he had finished i gave him half a crown praised his handwriting which i told him i wanted to see for perhaps i might find him better employment than currying of horses and sent him about his business too much pleased and elated and his ideas led into too distant a train to harbor the least suspicion  nor did my precautions end here i immediately ordered my horse and rode without any attendant full speed to hounslow i there desired the landlord of an inn at which i am personally known though not by name to send one of his own lads post to the market town next to wenbournehill and there to hire a countryman without explaining who or what he himself was to deliver the letter into the hands of honest aby i requested the landlord to choose an intelligent messenger and backed my request with a present bribe and a future promise  my plan was too well laid to miscarry and accordingly yesterday a mournful account arrived from the young orator that judgment is reversed and he in imminent danger of being cast in costs  and now fairfax once more i go  expedition resolution a torrent of words a storm of passion and the pealing thunder that dies away in descending rains the word is anna st ives revenge and victory  c clifton  letter xcv coke clifton to guy fairfax london dover street once more fairfax here am i  well and how   not so fast good sir all things in their turn the story shall be told just as it happened and your galloping curiosity must be pleased to wait  i knew my time the hour when she would retire to her own apartment and the minute when i might find admission for she is very methodical as all your very wise people more or less are i had given laura her lesson that is had told her that i had something very serious to say to her mistress that morning and desired her to take care to be out of the way that she might be sure not to interrupt us the sly jade looked with that arch significance which her own experience had taught her and left me with  oh mr clifton  and here i could make a remark but that would be anticipating my story  you may think fairfax that marshalled as my hopes and fears were in battle array something of inward agitation would be apparent in reality not only some but much was visible it caught her attention and luckily caught i attempted to speak and stammered a false step as it would have been most fatal so was it more probable at the moment of onset than afterward when the heated imagination should have collected arranged and begun to pour forth its stores  the philosophy of the passions was the theme i first chose though at the very moment when my spirits were all fluttering with wild disorder but my faultering voice which had i wished i could not have commanded aided me for the tremulous state of my frame threw hers into most admirable confusion  what was it that disturbed me what had i to communicate she never saw me thus before it was quite alarming  madam  observe fairfax i am now the speaker but i shall remind you of such trifles no more if you cannot distinguish the interlocutors you deserve not to be present at such a dialogue madam i own my mind is oppressed by thoughts which however just in their purpose however worthy in their intent inspire all that hesitation that timidity that something like terror which i scarcely know how to overcome yet what should i fear am i not armed by principle and truth why shun a declaration of thoughts that are founded in right or tremble like a coward that doubted of his cause i am your scholar and have learned to subdue sensations of which the judgment disapproves from you likewise have i learned to avow tenets that are demonstrable and not to shrink from them because i may be in danger of being misconstrued or even suspected pardon me i do you wrong your mind is superior to suspicion it is a mean an odious vice and never could i esteem the heart in which it found place i forget myself and talk to you as i would to a being of an infinitely lower order  mr clifton   do not let your eye reprove me i have not said what is not and who better knows than you how much it is beneath us to refrain from saying what is  do not keep me in this suspense i am sure there is something very uncommon in your thoughts speak  thoughts will be sometimes our masters the best and wisest of us cannot always command them that i have daily repressed them have struggled against rooted prejudices and confirmed propensities and have ardently endeavored to rise to that proud eminence toward which you have continually pointed you are my witness  i am  protracted desires imagined pleasures and racking pains and oh how often have they all been felt no longer sway me they have been repulsed disdained trodden under foot you have taught me how shameful it is to be the slave of passion truth is now my object justice my impulse and virtue high virtue my guide  oh clifton speak thus be thus ever  the moment it appeared i knew that delay was ominous  nay clifton   hear me madam  yes ominous i see no end to it have every thing to fear from it and nothing to hope  there is a thought  ay that verges to madness  i have a rival  but i will forget it  at least will try who can deny that it is excruciating  but i am actuated at present by another and a nobler motive you know madam what you found me and i hope you are not quite unconscious of what you have made me you have taught me principles to which i mean to adhere and truths i intend to assert have opened views to me of immense magnitude in your society i am secure but habits are inveterate and easily revived and were i torn from you i myself know not the degree of my own danger yes madam fain indeed would i forget there is such a person as frank henley yet how by what effort what artifice say teach me what though my heart reproaches me with its own foibles who can prevent possibilities mere possibilities in a case like this from being absolute torments my soul pants and aches after certainty the moment i ask myself what doubt there can be of anna st ives i answer none none yet the moment after forgetting this question alarms probabilities past scenes and intolerable suppositions swarm to assault me without relaxation or mercy  clifton you said you had a nobler motive  i merit the reproach madam these effusions burst from me are unworthy of me and i disclaim them you have pardoned many of my strays and mistakes and i am sure will pardon this for the love of fame fairfax do not suffer the numerous masterstrokes of this dialogue to escape you i cannot stay to point them out yes madam i have a nobler motive yet enlarged as your mind is i know not how to prepare you calmly to listen to me without alarm and without prevention strange as it may seem i dread to speak truth even to you  if truth it be speak and fear nothing propose but any adequate and worthy purpose and there is no pain no danger no disgrace from which if i know myself i would shrink  no disgrace madam  your words and looks both doubt me  put me to the proof propose i say an adequate and worthy purpose and let your test be such as nature shudders at then despise me and my principles if i recoil  the union of marriage demands reciprocal unequivocal and unbounded confidence for how can we pretend to love those whom we cannot trust the man who is unworthy this unbounded confidence is most unworthy to be a husband and it were even better he should show his bad qualities by basely and dishonestly deserting her who had committed herself body and soul to his honor than that such qualities should discover themselves after marriage there is no disgrace can equal the torment of such an alliance  i grant it  you have attained that noble courage which dares to question the most received doctrines and bring them to the test of truth who better than you can appreciate the falsehood and the force of the prejudices of opinion yet are you sure madam that even you are superior to them all  far otherwise would i were i am much too ignorant for such high such enviable perfection  but is it not possible that some of the most common and if i dared i should say the most narrow the most selfevident of these prejudices may sway and terrify you from the plain path of equity dare you look the worlds unjust contumelies steadfastly in the face dare you answer for yourself that you will not shudder at the performance of what you cannot but acknowledge nay have acknowledged to be an act of duty  i confess your preparation is alarming and makes me half suspect myself half desirous to retract all i have thought all i have asserted yet i think i dare do whatever justice can require  you think   once more bring me to the proof i feel a conscious again you make me a braggart a virtuous certainty  in opposition to the whole world its prepossessions reproofs revilings persecutions and contempt  the picture is terrifying but ought not to be and i answer yes in opposition to and in defiance of them all  then  you are my wife  how  be firm start not from the truth you are my wife ask yourself the meaning of the word can set forms and ceremonies unite mind to mind and if not they what else what but community of sentiments similarity of principles reciprocal sympathies and an equal ardour for and love of truth can it be denied  it cannot  you are my wife and i have a right to the privileges of a husband  a right  an absolute an indefeasible right  you go too fast  they are your own principles they are principles founded on avowed and indisputable truths i claim justice from you  clifton  justice  this is wrong  surely it is wrong  this cannot be  instead of the chaste husband such as better times and spirits of higher dignity have known who comes with lips void of guile the rightful claimant of an innocent heart in which suspicion never harbored imagine me to be a traitorous wretch who poorly seeks to gratify a momentary a vile a brutal passion imagine me i say such a creature if you can once i should have feared it but you have taught my thoughts to soar above such vulgar terrors my appeal is not to your passions but your principles inspired by that refulgent ardour which animates you with a noble enthusiasm you have yourself bid me put you to the proof you cannot will not dare not be unjust  and now fairfax behold her in the very state i wished cowed silenced overawed her ideas deranged her tongue motionless wanting a reply her eyes wandering in perplexity her cheeks growing pale her lips quivering her body trembling her bosom panting behold i say the wild disorder of her look then turn to me and read secure triumph concealed exultation and bursting transport on my brow while impetuous fierce and fearless desire is blazing in my heart and mounting to my face see me in the very act of fastening on her and see   curses  everlasting curses pursue and catch my perfidious evil genius  see that old incubus mrs clarke enter with a letter in her hand that had arrived express and was to be delivered instantly  our mutual perturbation did not escape the prying witch my countenance red hers pale  the word begone maddened to break loose from my impatient tongue my eyes however spoke plainly enough and the hag was unwillingly retiring when a faint  stay mrs clarke  called her back  as i foreboded it was all over for this time she opened the letter what its contents were i know not and impossible as it is that they should relate to me i yet wish i did i am sure by her manner they were extraordinary i could not ask while that old beldam was present had she been my grandmother on this occasion i should have abused her and the eye of the young lady very plainly told me she wished me away it was prudent to make the best retreat possible and with the best grace i therefore bowed and took my leave very gravely telling her i hoped she would seriously consider what i had said and again emphatically pronounced the word justice  you have now fairfax been a spectator of the scene and if its many niceties have escaped you if you have not been hurried away as i was by the tide of passion and amazed at the successful sophistries which flowed from my tongue sophistries that are indeed so like truth that i myself at a cooler moment should have hesitated to utter them if i say the deep art with which the whole was conducted and the high acting with which i personified the only possible being that could subjugate anna st ives do not excite your astonishment why then you really are a dull fellow but i know you too well fairfax to do you such injustice as this supposes victory had declared for me i read her thoughts they were laboring for an answer i own but she was too much confounded and would i have given her time to rally no i should then have merited defeat  the grand difficulty however is vanquished she will hear me the next time with less surprise and the emotions of passion genuine honest mundane passion must take their turn for not even she fairfax can be wholly exempt from these emotions i have not the least fear that my eloquence should fail me and absolute victory excepted i could not have wished for greater success  i cannot forget this letter it disturbs and pesters my imagination i supposed it to be from edward who has been at bath but my valet has just informed me he is returned perhaps it is from my sister and if so by its coming express my mother is dead i really fear it bodes me harm  i am determined to rid myself of this painful suspense i will therefore step to grosvenorstreet i may as well face the worst at once you shall hear more when i return  oh fairfax i could curse most copiously in all heathenish and christian tongues she has shut herself up and refuses to see me this infernal fellow frank henley is returned too he arrived two hours after the express i suspect it came from him nay i suspect  flames and furies  i must tell you  i have seen laura though scarcely for two minutes she is afraid she is watched it is all uproar confusion and suspicion at sir arthurs but the great curse is my groom the lad that i told you copied my letter to abimelech has been sent for and privately catechized by her and her paramour and what confirms this most tormenting of all conjectures is the absence of the fellow he has not been home since nor at the stables though he was always remarkably punctual but has sent the key so that he has certainly absconded  had i not been a stupid booby had i given laura directions to keep out of the way of anna but in the way of taking messages for her she might have received the express and all might have been well such a blockheadly blunder well deserves castigation  i will deny the letter fairfax they have no proof and i will swear through thick and thin rather than bring myself into this universal this damnatory disgrace i know indeed she will not believe me and i likewise know that now it must be open war between us for do not think that i will suffer myself to be thus shamefully beaten out of the field no by lucifer and his tophet i will die a foaming maniac fettered in straw ere that shall happen if not by persuasion she shall be mine by chicanery or even by force i will perish fairfax sooner than desist  oh for an agent a coadjutor worthy of the cause he must and shall be found  the uncle and aunt must be courted the father i expect will side with her the brother too must be my partisan for it will be necessary i should maintain an intercourse and the show of still wishing for wedlock  i am half frantic fairfax to be baffled by such an impossible accident after having acted my part with such supreme excellence is insupportable but the hag vengeance shall not slip me no i have fangs to equal hers ay and will fasten her yet i have been injured insulted frustrated and fiends seize me if i relent  c clifton  letter xcvi anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton london grosvenor street louisa  my dear my kind my affectionate louisa  my friend  what shall i say how shall i begin i am going to rend your heart   keep this letter from the sight of mrs clifton if she have not already been told do not let her know such a letter exists  oh this brother  but he is not your brother  error so rooted so malignant so destructive exceeds all credibility  he came to me yesterday morning as was his custom there was something in his look which could i but have read it was exceedingly descriptive of the workings of his heart it was painful to see him he endeavored to smile and for a moment to talk triflingly but could not he was in a tremor his mouth parched his lips white  his next essay was to philosophise but in this attempt too he was entirely at fault  the passions are all sympathetic and none more so than this of trepidation i cannot recollect what the ideas were that passed hastily through my mind but i know he excited much alarm doubt and i believe suspicion  but though he had found all this difficulty to begin having begun he recovered himself very surprisingly his color returned his voice became firm his ideas clear his reasoning energetic and his manner commanding he seemed to mould my hopes and apprehensions as he pleased to inspire terror this moment and the excess of confidence the next  louisa my heart bleeds to say it but his purposes were vile his hypocrisy odious and  i must forbear and speak of foul deeds in fair terms i know not how many prejudices rise up to warn me one that i am a woman or rather a girl another that i am writing to the mans sister a third that she is my friend and so on with endless et ceteras no matter that truth is to this friend infinitely more precious than a brother i may be allowed to feel indignation but not to express my feeling  but the most distressing the most revolting part of all is that he harangued like the apostle of truth the name of which he vilely profaned in favor of the besest most pitiful most contemptible of vices the mere vainglory of seduction he has not even so much as the gratification of sensual appetite to plead in his excuse i am wrong it was not vain glory vanity itself contemptible as such a stimulus would have been was scarcely a secondary motive it was something worse it was revenge my mind has been wholly occupied in retracing his past behavior i can think on no other subject and every trait which recollection adds is a confirmation of this painful idea he does not wish to marry me and i almost doubt whether he ever did at least fully and unreservedly  he came to me louisa and began with painting the torments of delay and the pangs of jealousy which he endeavored to excuse and concluded with a bold appeal to my justice a daring overawing confounding appeal he called upon me at my peril and as i respected truth and virtue to deny his claim  and what was this claim  i was his wife  in every pure and virtuous sense his wife and he demanded the privilege of a husband  demanded louisa  demanded  and demanded it in such a tone with such rapid overbearing bold expressions and such an apparent consciousness of right that for a moment my mind was utterly confused  not that it ceded no not an instant i knew there was an answer a just and irrefragable one but i could not immediately find it he perceived my disorder and you cannot imagine what a shameless and offensive form his features assumed i know not what he would not instantly have attempted had not while i was endeavoring to awake from my lethargy mrs clarke come in she brought me a letter  it was sent express  the hand writing was franks agitated as i was suspicion influenced me and i retreated a few steps  i opened the letter and the first words i saw were  beware of mr clifton   it contained only half a dozen lines and i read on what follows were its contents   beware of mr clifton  had i not good cause madam i would not be so abrupt an accuser but i am haunted tortured by the dread of possibilities and therefore send this away express  beware of mr clifton  i will not be long after the letter and i will then explain why i have written what to you may appear so strange  f henley   think louisa what must be the effect of such a letter coming at such a moment  i believe i was in no danger though if there be a man on the face of the earth more dangerous than any other it is surely clifton but the watchful spirit of frank seems placed like my guardian angel to protect me from all possible harm  my mind debated for a moment whether it were not wrong to distrust the power of truth and virtue and not to let mr clifton see i could demolish the audacious sophistry by which he had endeavored to confound and overwhelm me but my ideas were deranged and i could not collect sufficient fortitude oh how dangerous is this confusion of the judgment and how desirable that heavenly presence of mind which is equal to these great these trying occasions i therefore thought it more prudent to suffer him to depart and suspect vilely of me than to encounter the rude contest which he would more audaciously recommence were i to send away mrs clarke which he might even misconstrue into a signal of approbation these fears prevailed and i desired her to stay and by my manner told him i wished his absence  louisa how shall i describe my anguish of heart at seeing all those hopes of a mind so extraordinary for extraordinary it is even in guilt at once overthrown it was indeed iteration of anguish what can guile so perfectly assume the garb of sincerity can hypoprisy wear so impenetrable a mask how shall we distinguish what guide have we how be certain that the next seeming virtuous man we meet is not a  well well louisa  i will remember  brother my louisa knows it is not from the person but from the vice that i turn away with disgust would i willingly give her heart a pang let her tell me if she can suspect it she has fortitude she has affection but it is an affection for virtue truth and justice she will endeavor to reform error the most obdurate so will i so will all that are worthy the high office but she will not wish me either to marry with or to countenance this error marry  how does my soul shudder at the thought his reasoning was just seduction would have been a petty injury or rather a blessing compared to this master evil he was most merciful when he meant me as he thought most destruction i have been guilty of a great error the reformation of man or woman by projects of marriage is a mistaken a pernicious attempt instead of being an act of morality i am persuaded it is an act of vice let us never cease our endeavors to reform the licentious and the depraved but let us not marry them  the letter had not been delivered more than two hours before frank arrived you may think louisa how hard he had ridden but he refused to imagine himself fatigued he brought another letter which abimelech had received but which for some hours he obstinately refused to give up and for this reason frank fent off the express a letter not of cliftons writing but of his invention and sending  finding that frank was likely to prevail on his father to raise the money for sir arthur and obviate all further impediments to our marriage clifton fearful that it should take place wrote anonymously to abimelech to inform him i was in love with frank and to encourage him to persist but read the letter yourself the following is a true copy of it the reader has already perused it in letter xciv to which he is referred   if such a letter be his i am sure louisa you will not say i have thought or spoken too unkindly of him and that it is his we have indubitable proof though it was anonymous and not in his handwriting  you no doubt remember louisa the short story of the english lad whom your brother hired at paris it was written by him though innocently and without knowing what was intended this lad has an aunt who after having labored to old age is now lame infirm and in need of support the active frank has been with her has aided her with money and consoled her with kindness the lad himself was desirous of assisting her and frank willing to encourage industry in the young gave him some writings to copy at his leisure hours by this accident he knew the lads handwriting  i forgot to mention in its proper place the astonishment of frank at the sudden change in his father and the firm resolution he took to discover the cause of this change the obstinacy of abimelech was extreme but frank was still more pertinacious more determined and so unwearied and incessant in his attacks on his father that the old man at last could resist no longer and showed him this letter  from what has preceded that is from his manner of acting you may well imagine what the alarms and sensations of frank were he brought the letter up with him for he would not trust it out of his own custody and immediately went himself to cliftons stables in search of the lad brought him to me and then first showed him the letter which that no possible collusion might be alleged he had left in my keeping and then asked if it were not his handwriting the lad very frankly and unhesitatingly answered it was except the direction which this plotting clifton had procured to be written by some other person  without telling the lad more than was necessary frank advised him to quit his service for that there was something relating to that letter which would certainly occasion a quarrel and perhaps worse between him and his master and as it would be prudent for him to keep out of the way he sent him down to wenbournehill where the lad is at present  and now what shall i say to my louisa how shall i sooth the feelings of my friend do they need soothing does she consider all mankind as her relations and brothers or does she indeed imagine that one whose principles are so opposite to her own is the only brother she possesses will she grieve more for him than she would for any other who should be equally unfortunate in error or does she doubt with me whether grief can in any possible case be a virtue and if so is there any virtue of which she is incapable what is relation what is brother what is self if relation brother or self be at war with truth and does not truth command us to consider beings exactly as they are without any respect to this relationship this self  but i know my louisa she will never be impatient under trial however severe nor foolishly repine for the past though she will strenuously labor for the future  all good all peace all happiness all wisdom be with her  a w st ives  letter xcvii louisa clifton to her brother coke clifton rosebank sir on friday morning i received the original letter from anna st ives of which the enclosed is a copy and on the following day about a quarter of an hour before midnight my mother expired i mention these circumstances together because they were noticed by those who were necessarily acquainted with them as having a relation to each other whether real or imaginary much or little i do not pretend to determine but i will relate the facts and leave them to your own reflection and i will forbear all coloring that i may not be suspected of injustice  my mother as you know has been daily declining and was indeed in a very feeble state she seemed rather more cheerful that morning than she had been lately and at her particular request i went to visit the wife of farmer beardmore who is a worthy but poor woman and who being at present dejected in consequence of poverty and ill health my mother thought she might be more benefited by the kindness of the little relief we could afford her if delivered by me than if sent by a less soothing and sympathetic hand i should hope sir it would be some consolation to you to learn that my mothers active virtue never forsook her while memory and mind remained but of this you are the best judge  while i was gone the postman brought the letter of my friend and as her letters were always read to my mother and as i likewise have made it a rule and a duty not to have any secrets to conceal from her or indeed from any body she had no scruple to have the letter opened because she expected to find consolation and hope for till the arrival of this the letters of anna st ives have lately been all zealous in your praise  i will leave you sir to imagine the effect which a letter beginning as this did must have on a mind and body worn to such a tremulous state of sensibility coming as it did first into my mothers hands the very caution which the benevolent heart of anna dictated produced the effect she most dreaded my mother had still however a sufficient portion of her former energy to hear it to the end  in about an hour after this happened i returned and found her in extreme agitation of mind i neglected no arguments no efforts to calm her sensations and i succeeded so far that after a time she seemed to be tolerably resigned she could not indeed forget it and the subject was revived by her several times during the day  my chief endeavor was to lead her thoughts into that train which by looking forward to the progress of virtue is most consoling to the mind of virtue  she seemed at last fatigued and about eleven oclock at night fell into a doze about a quarter before twelve i perceived her countenance distorted i was alarmed i spoke to her and received no answer i endeavored to excite attention or motion but in vain a paralytic stroke had deprived her of sensation in this state she remained fourandtwenty hours and about midnight departed  i have thought it strictly incumbent on me to relate these circumstances but i should consider myself as very highly culpable did i seek to aggravate or to state that as certainty which can never be any thing more than conjecture my mother was so enfeebled that we began to be in daily apprehension of her death i must not however conceal that the thought of your union with anna st ives had been one of her principal pleasures ever since she had supposed it probable and that she had spoken of it incessantly and always with that high degree of maternal affection and cheering hope which you cannot but know was congenial to her nature  the disappointment itself was great but the turpitude that attended it much greater this i did not endeavor to palliate how could i i have told you i had no resource for consolation either for myself or her but in turning like anna st ives from the individual to the whole  i would endeavor to say something that should show you the folly of such conduct for the folly of it is even more excessive than the vice but not to mention the state of my own mind at this moment i despair of producing any effect since anna st ives herself aided by so many concurring motives has failed in the generous and disinterested attempt  i imagine you will be down at the funeral perhaps it is proper i cannot say for indeed i do not very well understand many of what are called the proprieties of custom i own i am weak enough to feel some pain at meeting you under the present circumstances but since it is necessary i should act and aid you in various family departments if you should come down i will not yield to these emotions but considering you as an erring brother will endeavor to perform what duty requires  l clifton p s previous to this i wrote three different letters but they were all as i fear too expressive of those strong sensations which i have found it very difficult to calm i destroyed them not because they were wrong but lest they should produce a wrong effect    letter xcviii coke clifton to his sister louisa clifton london dover street madam i have received your very lenient equitable calumniating insulting letter and i would have you put it down in your memorandumbook that i will carefully remember the obligation it perfectly accords with your sublime ideas of justice to decide before you have heard both parties and it is equally consistent with your notions of sisterly affection that you should pass sentence on a brother what is a brother or all he may have to say to you who more infallible than the holy father himself have squared a set of rules of your own by which you judge as you best know how  your insinuations concerning the death of my mother are equally charitable and i have already learnt them by rote yes madam assure yourself they will not be forgotten any suspense of judgment would have ill become a lady so clear sighted however possible it may be that anna st ives may herself have been imposed upon and i both ignorant and innocent of this forged letter yet for you to have entertained any doubts in my favor would have partaken too much of the fogs of earth for so inspired and celestial a lady  but i must tell you madam since you can so readily forego equity in a brothers behalf i can and will be as ready to forget and cast off the sister i never yet was or will be injured with impunity i would have you note down that  i mean to be at rosebank tomorrow or the day after to attend the funeral and take such order as my affairs may require and though i have as little affection for your company as you have for mine i imagine it will be quite necessary for you to be there not only that you should be present to execute all orders but likewise to listen to a few hints which i shall probably think proper to communicate  in the mean time madam be industrious to propagate the report if you think fit that i have caused anonymous letters to be written to sir arthurs steward have endeavored to betray anna st ives and have been the death of my mother spread the agreeable intelligence i say as quickly and as widely as you can and when you meet me you shall receive a brothers thanks  c clifton  end of volume v
