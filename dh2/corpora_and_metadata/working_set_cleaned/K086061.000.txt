elegies  i on the death of samuel foot esquire  ii on age  by thomas holcroft of the theater royal drury lane  london printed for j bew in paternoster row m dcc lxxvii  price one shilling  advertisement every one who amuses himself with writing works of imagination has a view to either profit or fame though the author of the following trifles does not pretend to be above such motives yet he hopes his anxiety is not powerful enough to render him unhappy one moment should he be entirely disappointed he is sensible how much success depends upon circumstances a poem must be read before it can be admired nay more it must be read with some share of that temper and spirit in which it was written or it will appear languid a good character or a bad one given by those gentlemen who take upon themselves the office of public censors in literary matters will frequently at least for a time determine its fate as he is entirely unknown he is not in any dread of a partial sentence if these poems are worthless let them rest in that oblivion which is the utmost happiness unworthiness can know if the contrary happens to be the case he has no doubt but their merits will be seen and acknowledged by every one whom heaven has blessed with taste and judgment sufficient to form the true critic  elegy i on the death of s foot esquire  elegy i ah what avails the fancied lore of man or all the envied gifts the gods bestow his wisdom folly length of time a span his life is vanity his death is woe ii could wit protect had genius power to save did they immortal life with fame impart alexis never had known a dreary grave death never had drenched an arrow in his heart iii mourn mourn ye spirits who delight in mirth in yonder tomb alexis breathless lies the soul of wit that gave your laughter birth inhabits once again her native skies iv how fixed those features which so well portrayed the cobweb virtues of the canting saint how dull those eyes that could so well upbraid and mimas vice in mimas manner paint v weep ye who bend beneath the savage rod of stern oppression spurning human laws your champion covered by yon senseless sod hears not your griefs or sure he would plead your cause vi rejoice ye sons of rapine io your foe who dragged your dark misdeeds to public shame your scourge is fled no longer shall ye know the stings of guilty terrot at his name vii where is now the pliant muscle big with whim the eye that filled with laughter every face the various voice the oftdistorted limb and all the mirthfed features of grimace viii how ghastly now his grin no latent spark of newfound wit sheds dimples over his cheek no heavy blockhead dreads himself the mark on whom the biting gibe shall shortly break ix where now the shouts that theaters have rent while laughter roared and begged to be relieved ah where the plaudits every hand has sent when humor brought forth all that wit conceived x mourn every muse in elegiac song in meter melancholic let if flow adown the doleful breeze your griefs prolong in wails and sighs and tears shrill sad and slow xi but oh thalia be thy sorrows loud though allunusd to accents so severe ah shed the drop most precious over his shroud for sure a son like him deserves a tear xii full well he once was known thy dear delight thou never denydst whatever he deigned to ask thy choicest pen was his whenever he would write and his whenever he would act thy choicest mask xiii ye shagged satyrs leave the deep recess the dark close woodland and the braky dell quit every pointed weapon of redress hear shriek and hear your favrites passing bell xiv no more we catch your meaning from his eye no more he wields the manybarbed dart or guides your galling arrows as they fly to strike the guilty sinner through the heart xv ye lightwingd sprites who sport in fancys dome with freaks and bounds in antic circles play attend your kindred genius to his home proclaim him welcome to the realms of day xvi ye sylphs who down the sunbeams love to flit and round the poets temples laurel twine or jocund on the dancing ignis sit or quaff from azure streams aetherial wine xvii forsake your sports and if you know to weep if ever your silken lids sustain such dew here pour your tears  behold in endless sleep the swain who all your haunts and frolics knew xviii ye fauns and fairies wheresoeer ye rove over hill over dale or mid the virgin throng ye nymphs ye dryads of the brook the grove who sing so sweet in many a witching song xix come fancys offspring every child of verse whatever clime your printless feet shall tread assemble all  alternate griefs rehearse in solemn song funereal honors shed xx and as ye pass the mountain mead or dell where lavish nature strews her gifts profuse from hawthorns point grubs beard or lillys bell collect the sweets that most delight the muse xxi bring every spell and charm each fruit and flower each herb each plant to poet fragrant found with all due rites erect the cypress bower and bless the turf and consecrate the ground xxii then while coy phoebe grants her glimmering beam and flitting ghosts entrance the fearful eye on broken vows while maids forsaken dream and start and weep with many a mournful sigh xxiii while wanton rearmouse winds her mazy rout and squeaks to listening glowworm antic song your vigils keep  with shrill and sudden shout scare each unhallowed foot from forth your throng xxiv enough fair fancy lightly bound away  advance philosophy lo truth appears who with her sober mien and moral lay foretells the sad events of future years xxv young ammon alexander the great  once admired beloved obeyed grasped half the globe and daft the hours away crowns gave for playthings slaves of monarchs made then dropped a little lump of lifeless clay xxvi now what avails the fair historic page where all his acts are blazoned to the world what though thantipodes once selt his rage and against the poles his thunderbolts were hurled xxvii had he not better far in peaceful lore turned over the moral page and smiled serene than thus delighting in the battles roar to have made the shrieking world one tragic scene xxviii lost is his valor lost to him his fame he heeds not hears not rumours fickle blast and all who live to hear and read his name are posting after him with heedless haste xxix with fancied dignity important grown man acts as though his follies were to last builds plants or mounts perhaps a thornstrewd throne dies rots and gives the worms a short repast xxx what melancholy scenes salute his eyes prophetic lessons of approaching fate still he pursues each phantom as it flies and loses happiness in finding state xxxi blessed be the sons of science nymph sublime she lures her children to the calm retreat and solves the problem and suggests the rhyme and to the dulcet sound directs the feet xxxii she prompts the song to love to peace and joy the matchless music of content she chants her heavenborn beauties never her lovers cloy she knows no sorrows for she feels no wants xxxiii she philosophic temperance loves to cheer and bids to shun like death imagined ills their sweets are bitter through the plenteous year who know no medium to their wayward wills xxxiv blessed be alexis science loves the name he well approved him of her darling race and be that wretch accursed who damns his fame or would his little follies backward trace elegy ii on age  advertisement there is not any thing i believe which calls forth the melancholy and sympathetic passions more forcibly than a sight of those men who have once been great or famous and have outlived their fortune or faculties who can forbear sighing when he beholds a belisarius whose heart is not wrung when he views a swift in his dotage  reflections of this kind gave birth to the following stanzas they were written upon an old man in a countryvillage whose strength activity and rustic accomplishments were once the frequent admiration of his fellowswains and when age had deprived him of them and rendered him feeble and decrepid the remembrance of his past exploits was often the subject of their exclamations and the honest motive of their pity and condolence as well as the frequent topic of his own lamentation the effect that this remembrance had upon his mind cannot perhaps be conveyed more feelingly than by informing the reader that the sentence which i have chosen for a motto was common in his mouth and generally attended with a sigh  elegy there is a time to be born and a time to die i i once was young alack the day and mirth and jollity my theme now fourscore summers flown away appear a halfforgotten dream ii i once could dance who nimbler seen when may day garlands decked the pole or prize proposed to glide the green who sooner reached the distant goal iii how slow and feeble now my tread those feet which erst have won the prize are only swift to reach the bed where undistinguished merit lies iv this arm athletic once could raise the massy beam the ponderous stone loud echoed forth the village praise when i the whirling quoit have thrown v behold it withered now and weak its brawny texture quite forgot its languid pulse slow winding seek the mansion where to rest and rot vi when i into the circle sprung what hardy youth durst ever engage who but would check his daring tongue if much provoked he saw my rage vii where is now the terror of my eye what coward quakes though i should frown when agile feats they yearly try who brings to me the festive crown viii my auburn ringlets once so gay could win the sigh the wishing glance and envied went that lass away who joined me in the rustic dance ix my bald head sprinkled over with gray wins nothing but predictive tears reminding man from day to day the effects of muchdesired years x i once could sing what voice so sweet could charm an inattentive ear or move the merrymaking feet or melt the sighing virgins tear xi who now delights to hear my voice who now shall press the cheerly song who now shall listen who rejoice or give the praise they gave me young xii alas what voice has drooping age to charm the sprightly ear of youth his eye delights not in the sage his heart delights not in the truth finis
