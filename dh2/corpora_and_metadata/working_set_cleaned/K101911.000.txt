the fourcourts marshalsea mr kavenagh attorney at law mr croker ald emerson at the spinningwheel castlestreet and others who all assure me they dont think howards ode superior to drydens in my own opinion drydens is preferable  with your applause the garden rings with your applause the garden rings  the garden commonly called the newgardens or dr bartholomew mosss gardens they were opened in

works having a better sale at my shop in parliamentstreet i undertook a journey to london to collect materials for his life but after remaining there   months for this purpose i could only learn that he was accustomed to sit in a big chair among the wits at buttons and this my friends telling me not being sufficient for a life of said poet i acordingly discontinued it  for who that howards ode can taste will relish alexanders feast should foolish george attempt to turn all your works to burlesque in his journal you will make him of your wit the butt and prove a deadlier foe than foot and prove a deadlier foe than foot  samuel foot esquire manager of the theater royal in the haymarket london he exposed alderman faulkner under the character of peter paragraph in one of his pieces acted upon smockalley stage in dublin he was prosecuted for said offense by mr faulkner and tried before mr justice robinson who inveighed very eloquently against stage players and said he might be considered as rubbish or a dunghill and brought under the head of nuisances  the learned council for the prosecutor also compared him unto aristophanes and the alderman unto socrates adding also that socrates was not the worse for the comparison the playhouse would have run with blood on this occasion and many swords would have been drawn had not mr faulkner prevailed on his friends who were present every night of the representation to hear the piece out and let him take his remedy by law to which they very obligingly consented  n b said foot has with impunity exposed upon the stage some of the greatest men and greatest wits now living such as the late duke of newcastse mr glover the late alderman beckford mr langford the auctioneer mr peter tailor and the rev mr whitfield he lost his leg by

underneath sharp prickles lie in vain the freeman aid shall bring youre not a be without a sting youre not a be without a sting  there is a pecullar felicity as i am told in this comparison of howard unto a be although the epistle says that he is not a be for whereas a be never rests upon one bud or flower but styeth about in wandering and uncertain angles from shrub to shrub and from hollyhock to poppy and never is content until his bags be filled so howard has amassed an ample fortune by different occupations and also has completed a volume of apothegms from the diverse rich spoils of learning which he has happened to encounter in his poring over books many of which he has had access to in my shop in parliamentstreet  though wisely every sweet you cull of which your apothegms are

from whence it is plain this lazy nation owes to your pen its preservation my muse the architect now greets whose lofty domes adorn our streets whose lofty domes adorn our streets  howard owneth many houses in parliamentstreet i built my own house myself howard having nothing to say to it nor shall ever come within my doors unless it be to pay for advertisements in my jonrnal or to buy medicines of my nephew todd  it may be worth while to mention a very entertaining anecdote for the satisfaction of the curious relating thereunto when my house was building i happened to be out of the way one morning penning an advertisement for an agreeable companion to pay half the expense of a post chaise to see that stupendous curiosity of nature the giants causeway about which it is still a doubt amongst the learned whether it be done in the common way by giants or whether it be an effort of spontaneous nature and my house was erected without any staircase whereby the upper stories were rendered useless unless by the communication of a ladder placed in the street but upon considering my misfortune in wanting my member and the carelessness of hackney coachmen who drive furiously through the streets at all hours in a state of drunkenness from spirituous liquors whereby the ladder might be shook or thrown down when i was ascending it i thought it better to rebuild my house and it has at present a staircase by which there is a convenient and elegant communication between all parts of said tenement  it is somewhat remarkable that my house in essexstreet had no staircase whereby nature seems to point out that having but one leg i ought not to attempt climbing and should always remain on the ground floor  who vanburgh like claims double bays who vanburgh like etc  sir john vanburgh he was a great poet and architect i was not personally acquainted with him any farther than printing his works because he died before my time being imprisoned in the bastile and having no light nor pen or ink allowed him he amused himself with drawing diverse plans of the bastile which he has since introduced into many buildings with great success particularly blenheim which much resembles the bastile  for piling stones and writing plays your skill instructs gymnastic schools your skill instructs gymnastick schools  howard wrote a treatise on fencing and is accounted an expert swordsman  he declined accepting a challenge which i sent him to fight my nephew todd in the way of proxy at the fifteen aces with pistols i could not fight myself because i am pledged to the public for my journal three times a week and have the care of the city upon me in my capacity of an alderman my nephew was at first unwilling to accept the combat but upon my promising to leave him the journal after my death and making him take two spoonfuls of his own elixir vitae he at last consented this medicine is only imported by him and is excellent for preventing accidents by sudden death

following underwritten letter of mr howards from killarney with the signature of poblicola with a description and likewise a comparison of the giants causeway whereunto he subjoineth an inscription for the tombstone of dr averel bishop of limerick and uncle to the right hon francis andrews provost of trinitycollege dublin who represents the loyal city of londonderry in parliament  n b that killarney is a small village of that name in the county of kerry it is a market town but does not send two members to parliament as most other boroughs do it is part of the estate of lord viscount kenmare who has forfeited his title he being a catholic nobleman although very hospitable and keeps a most plentiful table furnished with all the varieties the season affords i also had the honor to dine with him when i journeyed into these parts to see the beauties of this wondrous lake  to the printer of the dublin mercury  sir killarney sept   th      i have at length seen what i have long wisted to see this wondrous lake to attempt to describe it would require the ablest pen of the ancient poets or of modern poets the famous painter of said lake wherefore i shall never attempt it  yet notwithstanding all the beauties of the lake i cannot think it as a curiosity equal to the giants causeway i have seen both i never saw any thing like the first nor any thing equal to the latter this distinction is agreed to by all i have mentioned it to but alas this lake has been the death of a man for whom the whole province here is in tears the late bishop of limerick dr averel our countryman  to sum up all shortly as i can i heard the people of limerick where i was shortly after his death say that there has not been such a bishop since the time of the apoftles that the romish clergy said they should not wonder had he lived any time if they had lost many of their flocks  what obligations then are due to our lord lieutenant for having appointed such a man their pastor for though heaven has pleased to take him away his successor will hear so much of him that he cannot but endeavor to imitate him i heard this acknowledged by several as also for his concurrence in appointing that well known friend to his country and their city especially speaker from these and many other like instances of his impartial conduct it is wished that we may never lose him  and every day the advantage of a resident viceroy becomes more and more manifest that from this new mods of government there is far more likelihood that merit will be rewarded proper persons appointed to offices and the laws supported and executed a gentleman of your city happening to be at limerick shortly after the interment of the bishop and hearing the prodigious great character of him from all persons wrote the following lines extempore as an inscription for a monument  poblicola   beneath this marble stone weep mankind weep averel your friend lienwrappd in endlefs sleep who for the poor alone did fortune

cannot but agree with mr kavanagh and other ingenious friends that it were better not to divulge family brangles  of right divine in monarchs chatter nor can thou on extortion bent raise insurrections and thy rent raise insurrections and thy rent  this relates to a recent fact which passed about ten years ago in the north of ireland the doctor being unwilling for the benesit of the incumbent who was to succeed him that his living should be let at an under value insisted with his parishioners who offered him twelve hundred yearly to be paid fourteen which they thinking unreasonable went to law
