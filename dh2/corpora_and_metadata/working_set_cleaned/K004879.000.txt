experiments and observations on the blood when mixed with urine  by everard home esquire f r s  experiments etc read before the royal society june         the greater number of cases in physic and surgery are only important and interesting to those engaged in the study of medicine they are not connected with general science and therefore do not properly come under the consideration of this learned society  practitioners however in these professions have upon many occasions brought to light facts of importance in the animal economy which could only be discovered while the human body was laboring under disease and those have been distinguished with a place in the philosophical transactions  as every change the blood undergoes must appear an object of importance to those who study the economy of animals i am induced to believe the present observations on the change produced on it by being mixed with the urine will not be considered as wholly undeserving of notice  i was led to pay attention to this subject from considering the following case which came under my care  a gentleman seventyone years of age in the spring      found that in making water the urine had the appearance of blood and congealed into a solid mass as soon as received into the vessel this complaint appeared to have arisen from the rupture of a vessel in one of the kidneys for he had a pain in his loins but none in the region of the bladder he seemed to void no water for the whole quantity which was expelled at any one time amounting to about   ounces formed itself into a coagulum next day he voided bloody water which did not coagulate this continued for three or four days and then went entirely off  in the spring      he had a return of the same complaint it came on in the evening of the  d of april on the  th it was very violent and in the afternoon there was a total suppression a catheter was passed six or seven times but the oval holes near the end of the instrument were always filled with coagulated blood and no urine could be drawn off on the  th a larger catheter was passed with small round holes less likely to have the coagulum entangled in them but no urine came away in the evening it was introduced again having its cavity completely lined with a flexible gum catheter which was withdrawn as soon as the instrument was carried to the fundus of the bladder and in this way   ounces of a bloody fluid were drawn off which on exposure coagulated  on the morning of the  th a pint of bloody urine was drawn off this operation was repeated three times in the twentyfour hours and the same quantity was brought away each time  on the  th the urine drawn off was less tinged with blood and when it was allowed to stand the upper part became tolerably clear there was little change in the circumstances for six days but on the   th the urine drawn off was of a darker red color and in smaller quantity on the   th the color was more of a light brown and after standing some time a whitish powder was deposited the urine drawn off in the morning upon getting up was nearly of the natural appearance but that brought away in the course of the day had a deeper tinge and more of the white sediment it is also to be remarked that the sediment evidently passed off only with the last part of the urine on the   th the urine was tolerably clear and the white sediment more completely separated and in greater quantity in the course of the might while lying in bed the patient voided naturally in many different attempts   ounces of water but could not make any when up the urine now continued clear from any tinge but no more passed without the catheter being introduced till the   th when he again made some water naturally but could not completely empty the bladder on the   th the quantity which required being drawn off was less and by the  th of may he made water as usual at which time the sediment began to diminish and gradually disappeared  from the symptoms which have been stated it appears that part of the blood which passed into the bladder from the kidney had remained there and formed a coagulum which coagulum gave a bloody tinge to the urine and caused an inability to void it without assistance till the coagulum was dissolved  with a view to ascertain how far this had been the case and discover what changes the blood undergoes when placed in such circumstances i instituted the following experiments they were performed by mr charles grover a very ingenious surgeon at present house surgeon in st georges hospital  experiment i four ounces of blood were drawn from the arm into a phial containing   ounces of fresh urine and the phial was kept in the temperature of the human body in fifteen minutes the whole mixture formed an uniform firm coagulum and appeared wholly composed of blood  this experiment was made to ascertain the probable time the blood would take to coagulate in the bladder  experiment ii six ounces of blood were drawn from the arm into   ounces of fresh urine in fifteen minutes the whole mass became one solid coagulum in seven hours   drams of clear fluid were separated from it this was poured off and the same quantity of fresh urine was added after standing nine hours it was poured off some red globules were mixed with it but sunk to the bottom undissolved the coagulum had fresh urine added to it three times a day the former urine being previously poured off and allowed to stand some hours for examination  for the first five days the coagulum appeared to undergo little change except becoming smaller in size and the urine poured off from it was tolerably clear but on standing deposited a dark cloudy sediment  on the sixth day the urine when poured off from the coagulum was of a dark red color and deposited a greater quantity of a dark colored sediment but on standing became tolerably clear  on the ninth day the coagulum was reduced to the size of the original quantity of blood drawn from the arm  on the   th day the size of the coagulum was a good deal reduced the urine poured off from it was still more tinged with the red globules but when allowed to stand the upper part became clear and free from the red tinge and the sediment had the appearance of a whitish powder from this time the quantity of white sediment increased and the size of the coagulum diminished in its decrease from this period the loss was from its external surface and nearly equally all round what remained appearing like the nucleus of the original coagulum on the twentyfifth day it was of the size of a large cherry and on the twentyninth it entirely disappeared some red globules were very distinctly seen in the sediment along with the white powder  to see how far the changes the blood had undergone in this experiment depended on the peculiar properties of the urine the following experiment was made with blood and common water  experiment iii six ounces of blood were drawn from the arm into   ounces of water in a quarter of an hour the whole became one solid coagulum in twelve hours   ounces of a clear water of a bright red color were separated nor did it on standing deposite any sediment  this coagulum had fresh water added to it twice a day and what was poured off was allowed to stand for examination  the coagulum on the second day began to break on the fifth had a putrid smell and in eighteen days was almost entirely dissolved  the water which was poured off was of a bright red color from the beginning to the end of the experiment in consequence of the red globules being dissolved it had a very offensive smell but never deposited any white sediment the coagulating lymph dissolving from putrefaction  as it is evident from the result of the last experiment that the coagulum remaining so long undissolved in the second experiment depended upon its being mixed with the urine i was desirous of knowing whether it was the urine incorporated with the coagulum or that which surrounded it which produced this effect to determine this point i instituted the following experiment  experiment iv four ounces of blood were drawn from the arm into a cup and allowed to coagulate   ounces more were drawn into a separate cup from each of these equal portions of coagulum at the end of three hours   ounce of serum was separated and poured off to one of them fresh urine was added to the other common water the urine and water were changed night and morning  the water was tinged of a bright red color throughout the whole experiment and deposited no sediment on the eighth day the coagulum was rather looser in its texture on the thirteenth day it began to break and by the twentieth day it was nearly dissolved the progress corresponding with that of the coagulum in experiment iii  the urine the second day of the experiment was clear but the bottom of the basin was covered with red globules undissolved  on the fifth day the urine poured off was tinged of a bright red color similar to the water taken from the other coagulum and after standing some hours a white sediment was deposited  on the thirteenth day it was looser in texture and more dissolved than the coagulum in the water it continued to tinge the urine of a bright red color and what was poured off deposited a white sediment in greater quantity on the eighteenth the coagulum was nearly dissolved so that the coagulum immersed in the urine dissolved two days sooner than that in the water  from this experiment we find that it was the urine incorporated with the coagulum in experiment ii that prevented the red globules from dissolving and preserved the coagulum for so long a time since these effects were not produced by urine while simply surrounding the coagulum  if we compare experiment ii with the result of the case they agree so entirely that it leaves no doubt of the process carried on in the bladder being similar to that which took place out of the body the patient was unable to make water for twentyfour days although the passages readily admitted during the whole of that time an uncommonly large instrument which could not have been the case had there been any obstruction in them for six days more he voided it with difficulty but afterward made water very well  the coagulum out of the body was reduced in twentyfive days to the size of a cherry and in four days more it was completely dissolved  the patients urine became darker from the red globules mixing with it in nine days in the experiment this took place in five days  the white sediment was first observed in both instances about the twelfth day it continued to be deposited till the patient got well and to the end of the experiment  that the blood is capable of uniting with a quantity of urine equal to itself so as to form a firm coagulum that the red globules do not dissolve in a coagulum so formed that an admixture of urine prevents the blood from becoming putrid and that the coagulating lymph breaks down into parts almost resembling a soft powder are facts which i believe to be new  they may however have been before ascertained although i have not been acquainted with them  they are certainly not generally known and one object of the present paper is to communicate them to others  these facts considered abstractedly may not appear of much importance but when compared with what takes place in the living body and found to agree with the process the blood undergoes in the urinary bladder they become of no small value since they enable us to account for the symptoms that occur in that disease and lead to the most simple and effectual mode of relieving them
