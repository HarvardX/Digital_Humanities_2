the third and last volume of the memoirs of mrs laetitia pilkington  written by herself  wherein are occasionally interspersed variety of poems as also the letters of several persons of distinction with the conclusive part of the life of the inimitable dean swift  finis coronat opus london printed for r griffiths at the dunciad in paternoster row       to the right honorable sir john lewis ligonier knight of the bath one of his majestys most honorable privy council etc etc sir it is customary with mankind to deem all dedicators flatterers who rather pay court to the fortune of their patrons than to any real merit they possess  but in order to avoid censure on account of this too obvious meanness i have happily made choice of a gentleman to present this last offspring of my beloved mother to of whom had i eloquence enough to say all that is good and great the world must allow twere but barely doing justice to his exalted character  to expatiate sir on the various points in which you excel would be a task more fittly adapted to the accuracy of a plutarch or the perspicuity of a rapin than a pen so unskilled as mine in every polished art  since to display your magnanimity in the field wisdom in the council singular politeness and universal benevolence demands the flowers of rhetoric and poesy  yet sir that you are dear to the soldier as his honor to the public as a guardian and to all who are blessed with a participation of your social hours as a sincere friend and most agreeable companion i hope i may be allowed to say  i should never sir have arrived at the honor of drawing even this imperfect sketch of sir john ligonier but that i retained the sentiments from my mother whose intent it was had she lived to have inscribed this volume to you  in this address therefore sir at the same time that i satisfy my own ambition i do an action grateful to the manes of a departed mother since though she hated vice and was bold enough to reprove it goodness like yours was her darling theme  i have the honor to be with unspeakable respect  sir your most devoted most obedient and most humble servant j c pilkington longacre jn         the preface lest the world should imagine i published this volume in order to displease my father or any other person the reflection of which would give me the utmost uneasiness i thought it quite necessary in this place to declare the reason it lay so long in obscurity and why it is at this time made public  my mother before her death had taken in a number of subscriptions in ireland and after her departure from life as i was left quite destitute of money or friends i was obliged to pursue the design of printing the volume to which i was encouraged by several persons of real worth and distinction but though i became indebted to the public it was never in my power to raise a sufficient sum to defray the expense of printing but on the contrary through the resentment of those whom my mother had formerly described i was not only basely traduced in my reputation but plunged into a world of calamities which i may perhaps at some time hereafter relate together with the various passages of my life however amongst many accusations that fell heavy on me one was that i had defrauded the public by taking subscriptions to a work which i not only had not a design of printing but one that never existed except in my imagination as they were kind enough to declare that my mother never wrote such a book  yet should i have been content to have stood all this reproach and much more nay as the subscribers were persons of fortune and humanity whose contributions proceeded more from a desire of serving me than a curiosity to see the book i would have remained their debtor for ever sooner than have brought such an affair over but that having a wife and family to support and finding it impossible to obtain from my father the smallest succor though i applied to him in the most submissive and pathetick manner on the contrary when i found him endeavoring to hurt me in the opinion of particularly the lord bishop of derry to whom i am much obliged those with whom i had some interest i thought it but prudent to acquit myself of the charge of dishonesty by delivering the books to my benefactors and at the same time to endeavor to make as much as possible by it to this end i came to london last october but had not brought the manuscript with me which was in the hands of mr powel printer in dublin i thought it prudent not being overstocked with cash to try how a subscription would take in london before i ventured to pay a sum which was due to powel i therefore printed proposals and communicated my plan to mr foot who had when in ireland professed a great friendship for me not without some cause as will be seen hereafter he highly approved my project and assured me i might make a considerable sum by it and that for his own part he would get me at least a hundred subscribers all which not knowing the gentlemans real disposition i sincerely believed his farce of the englishman in paris was at this time acting and i ventured to write the following lines upon it which i sent to him in a letter and begged his permission to insert them in the daily advertiser to samuel foot esquire on seeing his englishman in paris when brilliant merit justly claims applause commands esteem and admiration draws when every action suits to please mankind delights the sense and elevates the mind each bard enraptured should exalt his lays and gladly pay his tributary praise yet british wits are silent when they see thy last inimitable comedy in which a spirit lives through every part that charms that sooths that captivates the heart it is thine o foot with a peculiar ease at once to lash tinstruct us and to please so sweet yet poignant all your satires flow that patiently from you our faults we know the dunce the fribble the affected wit chastised by you must silently submit still may britannia with a grateful sense thy matchless labors strive to recompense thus we in time may every error find and foot still prove a mirror to mankind   the gentleman was pleased to honor me with the following answer dear sir it is impossible for me to thank you as i ought for your enclosed favor and full as impossible for me to answer the contents of your obliging letter to correct it  there is at present such a conflict in me between modesty and vanity that as neither can get the better i must leave the destination of your elegant piece to your own discretion  i am dear sir most sincerely yours samuel foot covent garden    an indifferent person would now imagine that this gentleman was inclinable to serve me but whether he contracted insincerity in his late tour to paris or whether it is native to him i know not but when i went to him with the subscription papers he took a quantity of them and desired me to call in about a week he then excused himself by saying he had been unwell but finally when i pressed him hard he wrote me the following polite and obliging note sir i am sorry the disadvantageous light in which some of your countrymen have placed you here has put it out of my power to be as useful to you as i could wish i have sent you half a guinea together with all your subscriptions you will consider that the many calls i have of this kind though not too much for my inclination are a little too heavy for my income  yours etc samuel foot     i shall make no comment in this place upon this extraordinary revolution perhaps as he says himself it is pride nay something worse the pockets low epilogue to the englishman in paris but on his acting the characters of ben the sailor and buck in the englishman in paris one night some envious anonymous scribbler furnished out the following lines and as that gentlemans transcendant abilities are superior to any low things of this nature that can be said i hope it will not be thought malice in me to transcribe them here to s  l f  te esquire on his condescending to enact ben and buck often have thou sought the comic muse in vain while thy strained gesture but excited pain for when sir courtly nice was played by thee the murmuring audience cried it cannot be with like success some other parts you tried nay even for favor in the buskin vied but all in vain you were compelled to drop it and act the satyr the buffoon and poppet i e in the haymarket  till wisely pondring what composed your mind where you no generous sentiment could find you saw the error and to end dispute shined in your native character a b  te i am told that the ludicrous author of this was not threatened with so slender a revenge as tea or coffee but absolute newgate and the pillory which poor subtersuge gave him so much reason to pity his antagonist that he has since held him incorrigible below the notice even of a scribbler  and here i cannot help remarking at the same time that i return my most sincere acknowledgments to my noble subscribers in england that amongst the number of persons whose characters my mother had endeavored to illustrate by due praise not one except his grace the duke of marlborough and sir john ligonier to whose superlative bounties i am unspeakably indebted would assist me but as they are the greatest and noblest characters which compose her writings i must even content myself and though this volume is not in octavo which i at first proposed but was afterward obliged to alter my design in order to make it match the other two i am persuaded that as my subscribers are composed of the greatest and best persons in england they will pardon that defect since it contains the purposed quantity the irish edition is in octavo  however any person who imagines they have paid too much shall have the overplus returned on sending to me  n b a list of subscribers is omitted for particular reasons which the reader will be better qualified to guess at after he has perused the ensuing pages  memoirs of mrs letitia pilkington a third volume of memoirs is really a bold undertaking as they are generally light frothy and vain yet i have met with such unhopd success that i am quite encouraged to proceed more especially as my word is passed to the public and my word i have ever held sacred i cannot like a certain female writer say i hope if i have done nothing to please i have done nothing to offend for truly i mean to give both pleasure and offense lemon and sugar is very pretty i should be sorry to write a satire which did not sting nor will i ever write a panegyric on an undeserver if a rogue should happen to be mine honest friend i owe him silence but that is the most he can expect  many indeed are glad to become purchasers of it persons whom i know nothing of come and beg i may not put them into the third volume and they will subscribe surely then they should knock at their own hearts and if it confess a natural guiltiness let it not breathe a thought upon their tongue to my dishonor  shakespeare i threaten not any nor did i ever do it but characters are my game who eye natures walks shoot folly as it flies and catch the manners living as they rise   i should now be glad to know how i could prosecute my own history without intermingling that of others i have not lived in deserts where no men abide nor in a cave like echo therefore it is no more in my power to grant such unreasonable requests when a book is required of me than it is in that of an historical painter to give a good piece when he is positively commanded never to draw the likeness of any thing in heaven or on earth  but oh my dear ladies why are you so frightened why so many supplications to a person unacquainted with you have you all then a sore place which you are afraid i should touch but now taken from the play of pyramus and thisbe in shakespeares midsummer nights dream  i say this to you or to the same defect ladies or most fair ladies i would request you not to fear not to tremble my life for yours if you think i come as a lion twere pity of my life no no i am no such thing i am a woman as other women are   but after all it does not a little surprise me that every person who suffers a panick lest their own reputations should be attacked has not a little compassion for that of another no no let them find a flaw in a brilliant and by the help of their magnifying talents they shall dim it all over if they look upon this as a virtue it is one i shall never be emulous of  i remember doctor swift told me he once dined at a persons house where the part of the tablecloth which was next to him happened to have a small hole in it which says he i tore as wide as i could then asked for some soop and fed myself through the hole the dean who was a great friend to houswifery did this to mortify the lady of the house but upon my word by the general love of scandal and detraction in dublin one might reasonably imagine they were all to feed themselves through the holes which they had made in the characters of others but it is of no consequence to me as treason and malice now have done their worst shakespeare  reputation once gone is never to be retrieved the wise say it is as often gained without merit as lost without a crime so i must comfort myself the best i can the fable of reputation fire and water is too well known to want a recital and to quote a paragraph from a late letter of mr cibbers to me in answer to one of mine wherein i had acquainted him that a gentleman who had formerly been prejudiced against him was now his very sincere admirer as his lines may in some measure be applicable to me i shall insert them as follows it is now growing too late in life to be much concerned about whatever good or evil the world may think it worth their while to say of me all i have to do is to fix a consciousness of my own integrity and then let the devil do his worst truth has a strong arm and in that the weakest person living with an honest heart may trust for their protection  so let this serve by way of preface while i proceed in my narrative or take the sprightly reed and sing and play careless of what the censuring world may say   and here before i proceed to give ease to every heart which may possibly suffer any anxiety on account of what might be said of them i proclaim peace to all but those who have directly affronted me it is but a mean piece of cowardice to insult a woman and as some gentlemen have had the courage to challenge me by the known laws of chivalry i have a right to choose the weapons a pen is mine let them take up another and mayhap they will meet their match  but hibernian writers are evermore threatened not with the wit of their antagonists but the arm of the flesh and truly that is such a knockdown argument as i at least am utterly unable to resist  upon my word were any folly of mine to produce real wit in another person i should not be displeased to be roundly rallied  i was very well diverted with mr woodwards when this gentleman exhibited at dublin in opposition to mr footes tea coffee and humorous description of me crying subscribe or else i will paint you like the devil though how i who never either was a dramatick writer or a player came to have such extraordinary marks of distinction paid me from the theater is more than i can readily account for  however i enjoyed the jest and the worst mark of resentment i showed was to send him a crown for a box ticket which he graciously accepted and in return got his friend in the college to add six couplets of scurrility to his former encomium on me  no marvel for i remember the dean told me he paid a mans debt on account of his having wrote something tollerably good and the next proof he gave of his talents as soon as he was released from jail was to write a satire on his benefactor and deliverer i told this passage to mr cibber who assured me he had been just served in the same manner  gratitude is of all virtues the most seldom practiced the cause of this defect i take to be our innate pride few persons can bear to be under the weight of an obligation not considering that the grateful heart by paying owes not but stands at once indebted and discharged milton doctor swift very well observes that many persons have done a just many a generous but few a grateful act  i have indeed experienced gratitude even to painful ecstasy especially when you my dear and honored lord kingsborough vouchsafe to cheer my habitation with the muses loves and graces in your train with all the virtues that adorn the good and every shining excellence which distinguishes the fine gentleman so cyrus deigned to visit zoroaster and bless his solemn grotto  you have my lord another talent which as leisure and fortune give you a power of exerting it i hope you will and which by the honor you have allowed me of being your correspondent i have discovered and like a true woman cannot bear the pain of keeping a secret amongst all the letters i have yet seen published i never saw any so truly elegant learned and polite as those with which your lordship has condescended to honor your poor servant invoke then my lord the sacred nine not one of the beauteous virgins can be coy to such a lover resembling so much their own apollo i am very certain they have all bestowed their favors though you are too much the man of honor to reveal it  let britannia boast her shaftesburys dorsets mulgraves and let us tell her in return we have our kingsborough and here i must vindicate the learning as well as the politeness of the nobility though it be in opposition to mr popes opinion who says what woeful stuff this madrigal would be in some starved hackney sonnetteer or me but let my lord once own the happy lines how the wit brightens how the style refines why sure every person must acknowledge that while he is insulting his betters his ethic epistles are little more than lord shaftsburys rhapsody berhymd his windsor forest stolen from coopers hill and his eloisa and abelard the most beautiful lines in it taken from miltons il penseroso and if i wrong his merit let the learned judge mr pope says in his description of the convent where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light milton says and storyd windows richly dight shedding a dim religious light which of these is best i leave to any person of taste to determine pope from the full choir when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice milton there let the pealing organ blow to the fullvoicd choir below for service high etc but i forget and am launching into a criticism ever i am aware of it  now though i have held out the olive branch to my friends to whom i would be kind as the liferendering pelican yet my foes are not included in the treaty you my lady of the fishponds and lakes of lebanon must be remembered  and i cannot avoid paying my acknowlegements to the vice queen of a certain village vicequeen i term you for the lovely lady ann connlly goddess of the plains has as much humanity and politeness as you want and i cannot pay her a higher compliment though indeed it is no wonder as she is the daughter of an english earl and you derive your pedigree from a scotch pedlar i will not name you because you shall not take the law of me but describe you i will  pray when i sent you a book how came it to entitle me to an affront and your civil message that if my third volume was worth reading you would buy it at the stationers why it will cost you a crown there  but how long have you commenced a judge of the belles lettres that you may be a competent one of men nobody disputes and for your honor i believe a certain relation of mine was pretty intimate with it at   and do you and your two companions take a frisk still now you are grown old certainly it must be as entertaining as the witches in macbeth  why madam had i said that your fa  r died blaspheming the almighty and of the foul disease had i said that he refused to see his wifes cubbs as he called your sisters at the hour of his death had i said that you hid lady d  behind the arras to see  nothing  which you said your little tom titmouse of a husband had you could not have used me worse  but i scorn your low invectives which savor more of malice than of wit these and many other valuable secrets which i have the honor of knowing of you shall be buried in oblivion stand apart now ye roderick randoms foundlings bastard sons of wit hence ye profane be far away all ye that bow to idol lusts and altars raise or to false heroes give fantastic praise   while i the cream of historians mirror of poets worthy not only the bays but the laurel made for mighty conquerors for my signal victories proceed in my true history which take as follows from me the genuine successor of cid hamet and immortal swift thus much may serve by way of proem proceed we now to tale or poem   one day as i was sitting in my shop vide the  d vol of these memoirs a woman who though very badly dressed had a dignity in her air which distinguished her from the vulgar stood reading the paper i had stuck up with regard to writing letters and petitions at length she came in and begged of me to write a petition for her to his majesty from whom as she said she hoped for a pension i asked her what title she had to it she said if i could have patience to hear her story she was certain i would think she had a very just one as i was fond of novelties i assured her she could not oblige me more so to avoid interruption i took her into the parlour when she began her history as follows i am said she grandaughter to the marquis of vendosme my mother whose name was margaretta de tiaange was one of the most celebrated beauties in the court of france the late electress of hanover poor lady though her husband was crowned king of england she never was acknowledged as queen had so fond an affection for her that she could not think of parting with her but when she was married entreated she would accompany her to hanover their united prayers prevailed on my grandfather to give his assent and the electress placed her in quality of the first lady of her bedchamber that she might ever have her near her person   whatever regret my mother felt at the strange difference she found between the court of paris and the house of herenhausen yet being happy in the favor of her royal mistress young and cheerful she made herself quite easy and she and count conningsmark used to set their heads together to study what might be most amusing to the lovely lady  but alas while they thought only of innocence the princess sophia and the duchess of munster a discarded mistress of the electors had other schemes in their heads which not long after they put in practice to the destruction of the count the disgrace of the electress and the banishment of every person whom she honored with her confidence  i have frequently heard my mother declare that she believed there was not in the world a more virtuous person than the electress and indeed her conduct from the time of her separation from the late king to the hour of her death sufficiently convinced the world of her unspotted purity  well in the general ruin my mother as her first favorite was inevitably involved she was ordered to return home to france and as she was a woman of quality a man of war was fitted out for that purpose    i could not here avoid interrupting her to say i wondered that the princess sophia should enter into any scheme which might in the least reflect on the honor of her own illustrious family she answered the princess loved nothing so well as dominion and as the ladies of france had a natural turn to politics she was afraid the electress might interfere so as to injure her power which was almost absolute oh ambition by what cruel means do thou compass thy ends i desired her to proceed which she did as follows my mother returned home safe though much dejected at a separation from her mistress with whom had she been permitted she would willingly have embraced an exile from the gay world but as time insensibly wears off affliction and lessens the object by removing it to a greater distance so she began to resume her native cheerfulness and once more shone at court  the first night she appeared there an english nobleman for as such he passed himself neither did his good mien or politeness in the least contradict this generally received opinion paid his addresses to her gallantry and complaisance are so much the mode at paris that my mother took all he said of his passion and her charms merely as words of course and told him so he answered that he found she was unacquainted with the temper of the english who above all other people particularly valued themselves on sincerity and scorned deceit or hypocrisy even to the fair to whom most men practice it she answered the ladies in his country must certainly be very happy he said the most convincing proof he could give of the reality of his passion was that provided her heart and hand were disengaged he would use his utmost endeavors to merit both she assured him she was entirely at her fathers disposal and that if he was serious in his declaration he must apply to the marquis of vendosme accordingly next day he paid the marquis a visit and brought such credentials of his being a man of fortune and quality in england that the marquis had but one objection which was an unwillingness to part with my mother however my father promised they would once a year pay the marquis a visit so all things being agreed on the marriage was celebrabrated with great pomp and festivity  no sooner were the rejoicings ended than it was whispered my father was not a man of quality but an impostor this greatly afflicted both the marquis and my mother they mentioned it to my father who assured them it was a malicious falsehood raised by some persons who envied his happiness as it was too late to retract what was done they could only hope the best shortly after my father urged a necessity of his returning to london to which the marquis reluctantly consented  at dover my fathers chariot met them carried them to a very handsome house where there were a number of servants in rich liveries waiting the commands of the bride and bridegroom  but after all not to hold you longer in suspense my father was a limner but so excellent in his art that he could well afford to keep his wife like a man of quality however as there is no country where persons set a higher value on noble blood than france my mother was cruelly mortified to find herself imposed upon and fell into a deep melancholy which preying on the very pith of life she languishd in a consumption for three years and died leaving me and another daughter desolate orphans  after this loss which i was too young to regret my father brought in a woman whom it seems he had some time kept as a mistress to order his household and take care of us which she did so well that at length my father married her  here happened a most strange reverse of fortune to us for no sooner did this woman attain her ends than she altered her conduct and from a fawning servant turned a haughty and despotick tyrant my father was obliged to turn off all his old servants because they did not pay respect enough to her ladyship for he had the honor of knighthood conferred on him by king william  this stepdame now continually endeavored to set my father against us till at length wearied out with injuries i hired myself as a servant to the governors lady of st christophers and she being informed who i was treated me with the utmost kindness  this unhealthful climate soon deprived me of her who with her dying breath recommended me to the care of the governor he called me up told me her request and kindly said whoever was dear to her it should be his particular care to protect even for her sake  i kneeled down by the bedside to bless them both for their goodness my mistress took my hand grasped it very hard and instantly expired  i fainted away and my master as i was afterward informed quitted the chamber bidding the servants take care of the poor child  when the funeral was over and that the first transports of my masters sorrow were abated he desired to see me and renewed his kind assurances of protection and favor to me he made me dine at his table saying that my innocent prattle diverted his melancholy and i studious to please him did it so effectually that instead of my being his servant he became mine and as he was too humane and generous to entertain a dishonorable thought he proposed matrimony to me an offer too considerable for me to reject  the evening before the day appointed for our nuptials my dear master friend and lover was taken very ill on which they were deferred but his illness increasing he thought proper to have the marriage ceremony performed made his will and as he had no children left me all his fortune and died the next day  though i cannot say i was in love with this gentleman yet gratitude made me a sincerely sorrowful widow though i was young rich and as the world said handsome  when my year of mourning expired i had several matches proposed to me of which i made choice of the worst he was an englishman but to say the truth had nothing but his person to recommend him he was addicted to every vice and consequently soon squandered the plentiful fortune i had brought him  and at last one day when i was abroad he robbed the house of every thing it contained that was valuable and he with a negro woman servant i had got on board a vessel bound for england  i was now plunged into not only the extremity of sorrow but also of want however being very expert at my needle particularly in embroidery and also very curious in shell work i set up a school and instructed young ladies money is very easy to be got there and so it ought for the island is productive of nothing for the service of life neither fruit nor herbage and consequently there are no cattle but what they have either from the continent or salted from england  well bad as the place was i lived there thirty years after the departure of my second husband tolerably easy till at length i received from an english captain of a ship a letter from the sister i have mentioned who was extremely well married in london and gave me a kind invitation to come and pass the remainder of my life with her  accordingly i embraced the first opportunity of returning to my dear native country all the ladies entreated me to stay but finding me determined to the contrary they gave me signal marks of their favor each making me a present and assuring me that if ever i returned i should be affectionately received  we had a tolerable voyage even till we were in sight of the english shore when a furious tempest arose which set us almost beside ourselves the goods were thrown over board so that i lost all my clothes and a few minutes after we struck upon a rock but by gods providence not a soul perished all that i saved was a basket of curiosities such as the island afforded  but not to detain you with trivial circumstances i got to london and went to my sisters house which i found hung with black she in her coffin and the hearse ready to convey her to the grave  this was a dreadful disappointment to me for i was quite a stranger moneyless and could not reasonably hope for much favor from a brotherinlaw whom i had never seen especially as the link of the chain which united us was now dissolved  the next day i went to him and upon telling him the circumstances of my life exactly as my sister had done he had the goodness to give me her clothes a seasonable relief as my own were lost  the following day i went into a brokers shop to know if the person who kept it would buy some of my merchandise he desired me to come in and seemed surprised at the variety and beauty of my collection and perceiving me very faint for indeed i was all almost famished he offered me a dram which i refused as i was sensible it must have got the better of one so weak as i was  however i accepted of some toast and ale which i really think saved my life after this act of civility i told my distress to him and he kindly gave me a lodging and recommended me to you    i wrote a petition for this unhappy stranger which had no manner of effect on his majesty i afterward wrote to her brotherinlaw who gave her five guineas with which sum she again set out for st christophers and as i afterward learn the ship with all the passengers were lost  i think this poor ladys life was but a continual scene of storms and misfortunes as if heaven had barred her bosom to the thunderstone   but alas how shall we poor reptiles presume to judge the ways of providence all things are ordered with harmony and beauty though like a fly our feeble ray sees but an inch around yet dares dislike the structure of the whole  as well might a mariner in the midst of the wide world of congregated waters hope with his line to sound the deep abyss as our finite minds to comprehend the ways of deity here then let us rest whatever is is right wisdom and goodness govern all  reader have patience with my philosophic whimsies which i must sometimes indulge it is frequent in conversation to say of those that are drowned that they are gone to the bottom of the sea but with due deference to better judges i cannot conceive the ocean to have any bottom except near the shore i have observed every single drop of water to be an entire globe put another to it they unite by adhesion of parts like quicksilver to form a larger thus the tributary streams pour in globulous chrysolites to form that wondrous mass of waters which we term the ocean and which no doubt goes quite through the center of the earth without any middle way to stop it  i know it may be here objected that a ship lost on one side ought by this rule to rise at the opposite place not at all the pressure of the atmosphere is everywhere equal nor is there any such thing as up or down in nature as many stars bespread the firmament beneath us as above us as travelers such as have sailed round the world sufficiently evidence and did not the strong laws of gravitation hold all in firm union the sea no doubt would tumble on our heads  oh thou revered spirit of newton who could take the dimension of each planet in our solar system and then demonstrate to us how other planets circle other suns giving us thereby the most august view of that being who poured forth new worlds to all eternity and peopled the infinity of space if i have erred through pride in endeavoring to search into the secrets of nature wherein i may very possibly err let thy honored manes vouchsafe to set me right for i so much a catholic will be as for this once great saint to pray to thee cowley  i think i have scarce ever read two better lines than mr popes epitaph on this prince of philosophers which to prove my regard to him as a poet i will insert nature and natures laws lay wrapped in night god said let newton be and all was light   his inscription on sir godfrey knellers monument is as remarkably bad as this is excellent see westminsterabbey kneller by heaven and not a master taught whose art was nature and whose pictures thought when now two ages he had snatched from fate whatever was beauteous and whatever was great rests crowned with princes honors poets lays due to his merit and brave thirst of praise living great nature feared he might outvie her works and dying fears herself shall die and bad as it is it is but a lean translation from the italian an enervate language well adapted to the soft warblers of it but incapable of manly strength dignity or grace  i always find in myself a strong inclination to criticism and if i live to finish this volume i shall certainly indulge it for my part let the world say what they please of critics i esteem them as very useful members of the commonwealth of learning whatever is well written will stand the test of strict examination ay and of ridicule too and when that is past the work appears like gold from the furnace with tenfold luster therefore i fairly invite the whole body of critics to canvas my writings if they point out an error i shall esteem them as friends and endeavor to amend if they make an injudicious criticism for some such i have seen published against me they prove their own ignorance and cannot give me a greater triumph i only wish i may have a longinus not a zoilus to judge me  well now mrs pilkington says perhaps my reader what in the name of wonder have we to do with all this  why truly no more i think than with a buff jerkin or mine hostess at st albans but i am no methodist either in writing or religion sometimes irregularities please shapeless rock or hanging precipice present to the poetic imagination more inspiring dreams than could the finest garden where grove nods at grove each alley has a brother and half the platform just reflects the other i am in short an heteroclite or irregular verb which can never be declined or conjugated  but however considering it was a history of myself i promised to the world i now proceed in it thus  two very fine young gentlemen whom i did not know came to buy some prints and observing a large book in manuscript open before me one of them demanded was that my accountbook i assured the gentlemen my revenue was easily cast up and that i was but a bad arithmetician though i frequently dealt in figures and numbers  this gentleman whom i presently after found was an earl by his companions calling him by his title insisted on seeing the subject of my amusement this was the first volume of my work which when once he had began he went quite through with and gave it more applause than ever an authors dear partiality to their own offspring could possibly make me believe it deserved  however his lordship made a just remark that i was very fond of introducing the sun by way of simile in all my poems and said he had a mind to cut it out wherever he met it  i told his lordship he would then leave my book in the land of darkness and the shadow of death  the earl then asked me if i intended to print it i said i would if i could get subscribers to it otherwise it must like many other valuable things be buried in oblivion he gave me a subscription and as it was dinnertime took his leave with a promise of drinking coffee with me the next evening when as it was sunday i should be disengaged from business which promise however he did not fulfill and having vainly expected him till eight i then went up stairs to sit with the countess of yarmouths stewards wife and on my return found my shop broke open and every article of my wearing apparel taken away this was a dreadful mortification and a sad loss all my comfort was that the thieves had taken nothing but what belonged to me  this robbery quite ruined me as i was obliged to lay out my money for necessaries to appear decent my landlord seized for a quarters rent though he was my countryman and professed great friendship for me  i was once more in doleful plight however i got a readyfurnishd lodging just tolerable  one evening when i came home from a friends my landlady told me there was a young woman to visit me who wept sadly that i was abroad i asked her what sort of a person she was she told me she thought she greatly resembled me and that she would be with me early in the morning accordingly she came and i knew her at first sight to be my daughter the surprise made me faint away not but i was very glad to see her but joy is overcoming as grief and when i considered how little it was in my power to help her it quite surk my spirits she was in a garb which bespoke poverty and gave me a long account of her fathers inhumanity to her and his youngest son  a few days after her arrival came the son i have now with me from on board a privateer as ragged as a prodigal returned from keeping swine but poor child i wonder how he subsisted at all considering the hardships he had suffered and what to do with them both i could not tell mr richardson author of clarissa was so kind to give my son a new suit of clothes which put him in a capacity of going amongst my friends from whom i received a transient relief  at length the girl finding how matters were went to wait on a lady and captain meade took my son with him on board a man of war with which a number of transports and others then went on a secret expedition but were prevented in their design by having their intentions betrayed to the french  well this was a little respite to me i heard worsdale was in london and wrote to him but received no answer a day or two after as i was going through springgarden pretty early in the morning who should i see but the very identical man standing at a coffeehouse door  i stopped and looked at him when he immediately recollected me and seemed overjoyed to see me he invited me to breakfast and told me he was upon his keeping so that he had been obliged to quit a pretty readyfurnishd house he had in mountstreet berkleysquare and leave it to the care of a servant to retire to this privileged place  after breakfast he desired i would write a letter for him to the bavarian ambassador and to two others whom i have now forgot to beg their protection which accordingly he obtained though not directly he made me dine with him and promised to reward me when he should be at liberty to pursue his work and in the mean time he said i should be welcome to his house in mountstreet an offer which i readily accepted as well for the fine air as being rentfree  he allowed me a shilling a day to live on which i could very well do but he came every morning to know how much i had wrote he would give me fifteen subjects at once and expected i should compose something excellent on every one of them in short there was no end to my labor nor any relaxation from it except sometimes a kind of troubled sleep for amongst other misfortunes i was not able to make my bed nor light the fire and the old woman his housekeeper proud ignorant and insolent beyond imagination asked me where the devil i was bred that i could not sweep rooms light fires and make beds as well as other servants and that truly mr worsdale was a fool to hire me who did nothing but write all day long  though i conceived a good deal of indignation at being thought the servant of a colourgrinders son yet i could not forbear laughing at the ideas of this good creature  never did any soul lead a more solitary life than poor laetitia for worsdale had positively ordered the old woman not to let any human creature come near me and she punctually obeyed him more out of malice than integrity  in this sequestration from the world i wrote three ballad operas one of them pland on the story of the old song a pennyworth of wit where i have so exalted the wife over the harlot that at last as worsdale is a professed libertine i began to think it was quite necessary to apologize for his writing any thing to the honor of virtue or exposing of vice so i wrote the following epilogue to be spoke by a woman epilogue to virtue triumphant duce on it i wonder what the author means to pester thus the stage with moral scenes the fool he sent me hither to excuse him faith i will be even with him and abuse him i hope he listens while i speak my thoughts and tell what he must bear to hear his faults first he endeavors in a freeborn nation to bring the wearing fetters into fashion nor would have loving couples go together till they are yoked by matrimonial tether here he does plainly liberty invade and is besides an enemy to trade should his advice be followed through the land what must became of drury and the strand in france when age appears through walls of paint each battered jade turns devote or saint and when her looks no longer love inspire does wisely to a nunnery retire but here should pretty females leave off sinning what must they do betake themselves to spinning why sure twoud vex the heart of jew or turk to see the pretty playful creatures work well after all his railing thus at harlots it is said he liked them once by lying varlets and that unless be perfectly had known em he never could so perfectly have shown em but jests apart the poet bad me say he to the generous fair commends this play to show their matchless excellence designed and cure the roving madness of mankind to show the fair though husbands may be led by artful wiles to stain the nuptial bed yet virtue shall at last triumphant prove and husbands bless the joys of faithful love studious the worthy and the good to please if such with approbation crown his lays our happy author seeks no other praise   i am sorry i have not the opera but worsdale was too cunning for me and seized it sheet by sheet as fast as i wrote it and having now liberty by means of the protection and a good deal of work bespoke in the city he took a floor near the royal exchange in a large oldfashioned house with very antique furniture and there he gave me a little room to myself but as it was withinside of his paintingroom i was a prisoner all the morning and might fast and write till three oclock in the day then i was called to dinner of beefsteaks or muttonchops cooked by himself the manner of our eating i must describe  we had four playbills laid for a tablecloth knives forks or plates had we none no matter for that  i had a blade with which my tuneful pens were made  and so to make my dinner sure i for a fork employed a skewer the butter when we had any was deposited in the cool and fragrant recess of an old shoe a coffeepot of mine served for as many uses as ever scrub had for sometimes it boiled coffee sometimes tea it brought small beer strong beer and i am more than half afraid it has been applied to less noble uses but be that as it may i have done the man some service and he knows it  no more of that  he happened to paint as he told me the young chevaliers picture at manchester as he went to richmond he left all his pictures in my care when one morning a very beautiful young lady of about sixteen and her brother a fine young gentleman came to the house i was called down and they walked up stairs when after a little hesitation the lady asked me could she see the picture of the highlander i answered yes and brought it to her she kissed the face feet and every bit of it and judging from this that she was a roman catholic a religion that lord lucan eldest son to the earl of kilmalock patrick sarsfields neice can never hate let who will take offense at it for he was generous noble and humane and in gods name let every one of his creatures be as upright and just as he and no doubt but he will look down well pleased and bless the fair variety  the young lady repeated two lines of a poem of lady mary wortley montague on seeing this picture in every linament of which we trace the injured saint and royal martyrs face   their curiosity being satisfied the lady would have given me some money i told her i was not a servant but that as i lodged in the house mr worsdale left the pictures in my care madam says she i beg pardon but how can i make you a recompense for your trouble by giving me madam the remainder of the poem she repeated it and finding i had something like taste she kindly embraced me giving me a direction where to wait on her and we parted i believe delighted with each other but i only speak for myself   worsdale came to town and called on this lady and gentleman they were so kind to praise me highly and ask him who i was he declared he did not know he left he said an old chairwoman to look after his house perhaps it was she   this answer did not satisfy them they were so unreasonable as to insist on it that i was a gentlewoman that they knew it by my speech and hands by my refusing money and begging poetry but worsdale renounced me more heartily than ever he did the devil whose servant he is   he came home very angry abused me at an unmerciful rate and told me i should not stay in his house to show my wit and breeding forsooth when i had neither and boast of my family when it would have been better for me to have been the daughter of a cobbler as this fellow always boasted of his being sir godfrey knellers bastard i could not avoid telling him that some people were so fond of family that to keep it up they would prove themselves sons of whores  the hour of my deliverance from this worse than egyptian bondage now approached a young woman for whom i had wrote several love letters to a gentleman who had it seems kept her till he married and then forsook her as indeed he ought found me out  the scheme was to persuade him that at the time he dismissed her she was with child by him though she in reality confessed she was never in that circumstance in her life but bite the biter was fair enough if he cheated her out of innocence a loss never to be retrieved i think she had a just title to some of his money of which he had more than he knew how to use  i was writing a melancholy epistle for her when in came worsdale he gave me a furious look and withered all my strength before he spoke then he went out of the chamber and sent for me demanding of me whether i intended to neglect his business and turn secretary for the whores i was really surprised that he of all men should fall so hard on kind females and as their money was honestly earned by me and they are generally liberal i never thought i did any thing amiss in helping them out with a soft epistle he stormed at me she heard him and finding his wrath was raised on her account was very much troubled and slipping a guinea into my hand softly whispered me to come to her house in goldensquare and she would make me full amends for my vexation  of all men i ever saw w  e has the strongest appearance of charity and compassion and the least of it in reality he would take any curious artist out of trouble provided their work which he appropriated to himself would yield him tenfold interest love favor or even common decency no person ever met with from him except on terms of becoming his slave i have often reflected with wonder on the vast propensity that appears in persons of quality to provide for the spurious offspring of beggars vagrants etc by depriving themselves of the enjoyments of life to amass vast treasure and when that tremendous hour arrives in which all earthly glories honors wealth and titles cannot give a moments ease or prolong frail life the question is how shall i dispose of this to appease that god at whose tribunal i expect shortly to appear oh i will leave it all to the poor  as if the omnipotent could not see through the shallow device or that his eternal kingdom was to be purchased with their leavings  i have observed that most of those who have chosen to be public spirited after their death have in their lifetime been mere unhospitable narrow hearted souls and if a person of birth and polite education had by any misfortune fallen into distress and made an application to them such would not fail of meeting with an affront and having their letter sent back open with the civil message that truly my lord or my lady did not know any thing of it and had dependants enough of their own to provide for  and pray now let us enquire who are these poor that the public and private are eternally providing for are there not collections daily in churches besides the vast legacies left to parishes hospitals etc and yet to appearance no soul the better  are not the streets infested with beggars of all denominations and in the houses objects that would raise compassion in any humane welljudging person  here we shall find a poor wretch for a few shillings a week slaving to support a wife and children and perhaps at the end of the quarter is stripped by a cruel landlord and torn relentlesly from the relief of his family while they are exposed to the sharpest pangs of want cold and nakedness  and where shall they apply for relief if to the parish perhaps they may obtain a few halfpenee but no real succor  if to a beneficent lady who distinguishes herself by giving a gown once in the year to some particular old beggar women and sixpence a week for their support to give them a taste of life as the same woman must not expect to be served two years successively why truly my lady bountiful is not at home or the servant durst not carry up any letter or petitions so the poor sufferer may return laden with poverty and swollen with sorrow  and yet this lady expects to be almost deified for her munificence and patriotism she laid out her money on a house not to satisfy her vanity but to employ her distressed countrymen she never saw the naked but she clothed them nor the sick but she visited them nor the hungry or thirsty but she relieved them whilst the rich she sent empty away in which charitable opinion of her own virtues she expects to go directly to heaven but now hear the opinion of impartiality  indeed she never saw her fellow creatures in distress but she being of a compassionate temper found it necessary for her own quiet to relieve them therefore she always chose a back room to sit in that she might not view such disagreeable objects and in order to save her money for some great last stroke if persons of rank dine or sup with her they must take such as the house affords by which means the rich are always sent empty away  if no body knows this picture without writing the name under it i will confess myself to be as bad a painter as w  e  dean swifts excellent scheme for building an hospital for lunaticks and idiots was of a different cast from those of most other men as it was not a matter uttered with his last breath but studied calculated and determined for many years before as the following lines in his elegy on his own death sufficiently evince he left the little wealth he had to build a house for fools and mad and showed by one satyrick touch no nation wanted it so much and according to his usual wisdom he committed the regulation of it to gentlemen of real worth honor and probity in which would others follow so great so laudable an example perhaps the many sums that were designed for good mem the workhouse in dublin uses but are now appropriated to the purchasing estates and splendid equipages for some particular people might have the wished effect of being a universal benefit  the dean could not abide the thought of being like other mortals forgot as soon as his venerable dust was conveyed to the earth and therefore he always endeavored to render himself worthy of a grateful remembrance in the hearts of the people yet how true are his own lines  and now the dean no more is missed than if he never did exist except amongst oldfashioned folks who now and then repeat his jokes a remarkable instance of his whimsical disposition which i omitted in my first volume as i find his sacred name remains still dear to every just hibernian ear i will here insert and must say it is with infinite pleasure i find that my weak attempts to delineate his inimitable character have met with such unhoped approbation both here and in england not so much for the vanity of an author as the pleasure i feel at seeing so vast a respect paid to his memory  i believe the dean on his first coming to ireland was very melancholy and indeed it was not to be wondered at as he was then separated from those whom he loved mr pope lord bolingbroke etc and in one of his poems he seems to despair of meeting with friendship in a strange country or that not a judas could be found to sell him for three hundred pound i one day asked him how he came to write that poem he told me he had three times like to have been hanged and pox take me said he but i believe the people thought i could bring the pretender in my hand and place him on the throne  i remember a worthy gentleman who had the honor of his acquaintance told me that the dean and some other persons of taste whom i do not now recollect came to a resolution to have a feast once a year in imitation of the saturnalia which in heathen rome was held about the time we keep our christmas whereat the servants personated their masters and the masters waited as servants  the first time they put this scheme in practice was at the deanery house when all the servants were seated and every gentleman placed behind his own man the deans servant took an opportunity of finding fault with some meat that was not done to his taste and taking it up in his hand he threw it in his masters face and mimickd him in every other foible which he had ever discovered in him  at this the dean flew in a violent rage beat the fellow and put every thing into such disorder that the servants affrighted fled the room and here ended the feast of saturnalia  stella mrs johnson said to be his own sister whom he has so beautifully praised through his writings was actually his wife though they never i am convinced tasted even the chaste joys which hymen allows  it is certain they retained for each other a most tender love and though they did not indulge the desires of the body yet their souls were united by the strictest bonds of divine and social harmony  he in the latter part of his life offered to acknowledge her as the partner of his heart but she wisely declined it knowing that while she continued only as a visitor he would treat her with respect which would cease as his temper was unpassive if she lived entirely with him and every fault of his servants would be attributed to her i am certain he must have tenderly loved that lady as i have been a witness that the bare mention of her name has drawn tears from him which it was not easy to effect  i remember he sent for me one morning very early to breakfast and as i always drank tea or coffee i expected to have found one of these ready but after he had detained me two hours discoursing on his household economy and other matters amongst which one was that a piece of his garden wall had fallen down and so said he one of my fellows forsooth must needs get a trowel and mortar and undertake to mend the breach  i happened continued the dean to spy him out of my window at this employment and called to him to know why he did that he told me he had been bred a bricklayer and that his doing it would save me money so i let him finish it which he did very completely in about an hours time i gave him a moidore and pox take me but the fellow instead of going as he ought to the alehouse or a whore went and bought silver buckles and is grown very proud upon it  i think sir said i the man made a good hours work of it  come said he shall we go to breakfast i know you were once bermudas mad now i will give you some of that country cheer open that drawer and reach me a flat bottle you will find there i ran to obey him and as the drawer was low kneeled down to it  i no sooner attempted to unlock the drawer but he flew at me and beat me most immoderately i again made an effort and still he beat me crying pox take you open the drawer i once more tried and he struck me so hard that i burst into tears and said lord sir what must i do  pox take you for a slut said he would you spoil my lock and break my key why sir the drawer is locked oh i beg pardon said he i thought you were going to pull it out by the key well open it and do what i bid you  i did so and found the bottle now said he you must know i always breakfast between my own house and the church and i carry my provision in my pocket upon this he pulled out a piece of gingerbread and offered me some  as i was terribly afflicted with the heartburn the very thoughts of any thing so dry made me ten times worse which i told him and begged he would excuse me he positively insisted on my eating a piece of it which i was on penalty of another beating obliged to comply with  now said he you must take a sup out of my bottle i just held it to my mouth and found it so strong that i entreated he would not ask me to taste it he endeavored to persuade me but finding that would not avail he threw me down forced the bottle into my mouth and poured some of the liquor down my throat which i thought would have set my very stomach on fire he then gravely went to prayers and i returned home not greatly delighted but however glad to come off no worse i went the ensuing evening to pay a visit to my kinsman doctor s  ge then lately consecrated lord b  p of  this gentleman and his family were extremely fond of my father and always pleased when i did myself the honor to call on them and received me with that ease and politeness peculiar to well bred people i congratulated the bishop on his preferment he modestly told me that his honors did not sit easy on him and that he would willingly dispense with his friends not saluting him by his title of lord as it always made him uneasy he then asked me as he saw my fathers chariot at the door where i intended to go i told him to the dean well said he i beg you will give my compliments to him and tell him that as it is to his recommendation i owe my present happiness i am surprised i never had the pleasure of seeing him since he conferred so great a favouron me while i was plain doctor s  ge continued he the dean used to send his wine and bread before him and frequently take a dinner with me but now i believe he is ashamed to own me pray speak to him and let me know his answer i promised i would and then departed  i found the dean at home and alone which gave me an immediate opportunity of delivering the b  ps message he listened to me very attentively and then said oh i remember something of it l  d c  t applied to me for a person to make a bishop of whom i knew was not an honest man and as i wanted the living of w  bs for d  y i recommended s  ge to the bishopric with an assurance that he would answer his excellencys purpose and pox take me if i ever thought him worth my contempt till i had made a bishop of him  the dean then told me that as he had no company and did not know how to dispose of his time i should have the honor to sup with him and said he i will give you a most kingly entertainment  i accordingly waited in expectation of some extraordinary repast till about nine oclock in which interval my readers may be assured i wanted not amusements for the mind however at length the cloth was laid on a small table and to my great surprise the servant brought up four blue eggs on a china plate here hussy said he is a plovers egg king william used to give crowns apiece for them and thought it profanation in a subject to eat one of them as he was amongst his other immortal perfections an epicure a glutton and a  hold said he i had like to have spoken treason but how do you like the eggs sir i have eat none yet well eat like a monarch then and tell me your opinion i did eat and told him i had not that elevated notion of his banquet which he might possibly have from so great a precedent well said he these eggs cost me sixpence apiece which is a little extravagant considering a herring will cost but a halfpenny but i never exceed two and this is the only article in which i am luxurious  i must here again apologize to my reader for my frequent digressions in which however it is possible they will find more entertainment than a simple narrative will afford  i believe there never was any set of people so happy in sincere and uninterrupted friendship as the dean doctor delany mr pilkington and myself nor can i reflect at this hour on any thing with more pleasure than those happy moments we have enjoyed it is for this reason i am fond of mentioning matters which bring the pleasing ideas to my mind i have observed that the scent of a flower or the tune of a song always conveys to remembrance the exact image of the place in which they were first noticed well therefore in the relation of a story where one circumstance insensibly brings on another may a writer who scorns to deal in romance be led like me to digress  mrs barber whose name at her earnest request i omitted in my first volume and who was the lady i mentioned to have been with me at my first interview with the dean at dr delanys seat was at this time writing a volume of poems some of which i fansy might at this day be seen in the cheesemongers chandlers pastrycooks and secondhand booksellers shops however dull as they were they certainly would have been much worse but that doctor delany frequently held what he called a senatus consultum to correct these undigested materials at which were present sometimes the dean in the chair but always mrs grierson mr pilkington the doctor and myself one day that he had appointed for this purpose we received from him the following lines which as they contain a compliment to me from so eminent a hand i must insert take notice that as we were both diminutive in size mr pilkington was styled thomas thumb and i his lady fair mighty thomas a solemn senatus i call to consult for saphira so come one and all quit books and quit business your cure and your care for a long winding walk and a short bill of fare i have mutton for you sir and as for the ladies as friend virgil has it i have aliud mercedes for letty one filbert whereon to regale and a peach for mrs grierson pale constance to make a full meal and for your cruel part my mother who used to argue with the doctor about his declamations against eating blood  who take pleasure in blood i have that of the grape which is ten times as good flow wit to her honor flow wine to her health high raised be her worth above titles or wealth   we obeyed the summons and had a very elegant entertainment and afterward proceeded to our business which we completed to the satisfaction of all parties  of all the gentlemen i ever knew this i must say that doctor delany excels in one point particularly which is in giving an elegant entertainment with ease cheerfulness and an hospitality which makes the company happy  lord carteret in his lieutenancy being very fond of this gentleman who is indeed worthy of universal esteem came one day quite unattended and told the doctor he was come to dine with him he thanked his excellency for the honor he conferred on him and invited him to walk into his beautiful gardens which his excellency did with great good humor they took a turn or two when the servant came to inform them that dinner was on the table the doctor had generally something nice in the season for himself and his mother to whom he behaved with true filial tenderness and respect for which no doubt his days will be long in the land which the lord has given him  the doctor made the old lady do the honors of his table for which nor for the entertainment he never made the least apology but told his lordship that to stomachs cloyed with costly fare simplicity alone was rare   this demeanor of his was infinitely agreeable to lord c  t who though a courtier hated ceremony when he sought pleasure which is indeed inconsistent with it and what respect soever our nobility may think is owing to the french mode of cringing and complimenting i must confess i never see it practiced without a peculiar pain which i can compare to nothing but the apprehensions i am under at the sight of tumblers ropedancers etc such as i believe all rational creatures share at seeing men deform their visages by a thousand awkward grimaces and their bodies like jointed babies only because it is alamode francoise neither do we often see any but the most illiterate coxcombs practice it  his excellency after the cloth was taken away and the bottle introduced when consequently the lady departed told the doctor that he always believed him a most wellbred gentleman but never had so clear a demonstration of it as he had this day seen others said he whom i have tried the same experiment on have met me in as much confusion as if i came to arrest them for high treason nay they would not give me a moment of their conversation which and not their dinner i sought but hurry from me and then if i had any appetite deprive me of it by their fulsome apologies for defects this said his excellency is like a story i heard the dean tell of a lady who had given him an invitation to dinner as she heard he was not easily pleased she had taken a month to provide for it when the time came every delicacy which could be purchased the lady had prepared even to profusion which you know swift hated however the dean was scarce seated when she began to make a ceremonious harangue in which she told him that she was sincerely sorry she had not a more tolerable dinner since she was apprehensive there was not any thing there fit for him to eat in short that it was a bad dinner pox take you for a b  said the dean why did you not get a better sure you had time enough but since you say it is so bad i will even go home and eat a herring accordingly he departed and left her justly confused at her folly which had spoilt all the pains and expense she had been at  and here if it will not be thought impertinent in me to intrude into such company i also have a story which i somewhere heard not unapplicable to the above  a certain english nobleman who had the honor to be sent ambassador to france was said to be one of the most polite accomplished fine gentlemen in europe this reached the ears of the french king who thought such a character due to none but himself but as every thing is proved by trial his majesty took this method of informing his curiosity one morning that the ambassador had a private audience the king told him he should be glad of his excellencys company to take an airing with him the ambassador did not hesitate on accepting the offer but told his majesty he was ready to wait on him the kings chariot was at the door which he very carelessly desired the nobleman to step into no sir replied the ambassador not before your majesty at which the king burst out a laughing and said no no my lord you are not the best bred man in the world otherwise you would have done what i desired since you might well know that if it was not agreeable to me i should never have paid you the compliment  and indeed i have heard those who ought to be the best judges of manners declare that in company with superiors to act implicitly according to their directions is the most effectual method of being always acceptable which leads me to another little circumstance related by mrs percival  this lady with a company of very agreeable persons resolved in the summertime to take a trip to the hague they accordingly set out and landed at some place in holland the name of which i have now forgot however on their first days journey they stopped at an inn to dine and enquired what they could have to eat they were told there was nothing in the house but a neck of veal which though insufficient they desired to be dressed as there was not an inn for some miles forward therefore they made it up with some of their sea provisions which the servants had fortunately brought in after dinner they called a bill and amongst other articles of extortion they were charged for meat one pound four shillings which was so palpable an imposition that though each of the company had fortune and liberality enough yet they called for the man and told him they absolutely would not pay so extravagant a price sooner than which as they came merely for pleasure they would stay a month and spend a hundred pounds a piece in law the boorish fellow told them that it was the common price in this place which if they doubted he was willing to appeal to the magistrate this they readily agreed to and were all preparing for a serious trial of the matter when minheer told them in an ironical tone that he was himself the rulingofficer and dispenser of law and justice in that place finding this to be the fact and that the defendant must be the judge in this cause the plaintiffs thought proper to submit and paid him  if the reader thinks this little narrative is not quite in point which now it is related i begin to find out myself he may blot it out of his book if he pleases but he shall not blot it out of my manuscript for that would be to deprive me of a page that is worth a crown to me nay and as it is truth who knows but it may prove worth two crowns to the reader if he should happen to make the same tour  my dear mr cibber to whom for his amusement i used to relate such little incidents would frequently admire what a fund of matter for entertainment my brain contained and he bad me write it all since if it pleased him it might possibly have the same effect on others this gentlemans frequent conversation with the great gave him a better opportunity of knowing their disposition as he had infinite penetration than most others in consequence of which he advised me when i ever had occasion to solicit a favor from any persons of distinction to take care to time it properly for instance said he never write to him or her of a dark foggy frosty morning particularly before breakfast at which time it is ten to one they are out of temper nor though you send at any time and even received an unmannerly answer do not let a rash pride drive you to return the affront since it is impossible for you to know what at that instant had chagrind their temper he who will not be your friend at one time may at another and though you never can bring him to do you any service yet do not provoke him to be your enemy a man may have had ill success at play missed an appointment with a fine woman or twenty such accidents which may for the present sour his disposition whereas if you continue your assiduities in process of time he might do you more service than you could hope these are truths which i have since experienced and i should be wanting in gratitude as well as sincerity if i did not make it public here follows an instance  nicholas loftus hume esquire whom i mentioned in my second volume that came to see me in london but declined subscribing to me because he was going to the duke of dorsels to dinner has since my being in this kingdom been kind enough to send me five guineas as a subscription for which i rest his most obliged servant  i remarked to mr cibber upon this conversation that though the english nobility were outdone by none in munificence and liberality yet i could by no means conceive that their buildings were the least expressive of it since there was scarcely one fine house in london which was not obscured by a monstrous high wall that entirely intercepted the prospect and took much from the magnificence the streets might possibly have he told me it was the method in italy from whence our peers and others transplanted it as a great beauty because the surprise has a vast effect sir said i in italy those walls are requisite to keep off the extreme heat of the sun and if possible to shut out the eye of god from their abominable pollutions but as we enjoy a mild and temperate region and are i hope untainted with their beastly vices i see no reason for our peers to affect it there is besides generally at these gates a most avaricious cerberus who should a stranger happen to stand and gaze at any occasion of the gates being opened would very judiciously slap it in their faces as if our eyes like the sphynx of egypt could penetrate stone walls if you have the smallest suit to make to his master the fellow will be as dull of apprehension as the mock doctor till you tip him the symptoms which when you have given him he prevails on the valet to deliver it which must also be accompanied by a daub in the fist i have computed the expense of writing to a great man as under l s d for pen ink and paper 0 0   for a person to find when his lordship is at home 0   0 to the porter 0  0   to the valet     0 to the footman who brings the answer 0   0 the amount of which is         these observations i thought proper to communicate as i am persuaded some of the nobility of england will be curious enough to read this work and i do assure them nothing so much dims their luster as the arrogance and penury of their vassals which when they know perhaps they may reclaim dean swift discharged a servant only for rejecting the petition of a poor old woman she was very ancient and on a cold morning sat at the deanery steps a considerable time during which the dean saw her through a window and no doubt commiserated her desolate condition his footman happened to come to the door and the poor creature besought him in a piteous tone to give that paper to his reverence the servant read it and told her with infinite scorn his master had something else to mind than her petition what is that you say fellow said the dean looking out at the window come up here the man trembling obeyed him he also desired the poor woman to come before him made her sit down and ordered her some bread and wine after which he turned to the man and said at what time sir did i order you to open a paper directed to me or to refuse a letter from any one hark ye sirrah you have been admonished by me for drunkenness idling and other faults but since i have discovered your inhuman disposition i must dismiss you from my service so pull off my clothes take your wages and let me hear no more of you  the fellow did so and having vainly solicited a discharge was compelled to go to sea where he continued five years at the end of which time finding that life far different from the ease and luxury of his former occupation he returned and humbly confessing in a petition to the dean his former manifold crimes he assured him of his sincere reformation which the dangers he had undergone at sea had happily wrought and begged the dean would give him some sort of discharge since the honor of having lived with him would certainly procure him a place accordingly the dean called for pen ink and paper and gave him a dismission with which and no other fortune he set out for london  among others he applied to me who had known him at his late masters and produced his certificate which for its singularity i transcribed and believe it may not be displeasing to the reader whereas the bearer  served me the space of one year during which time he was an idler and a drunkard i then discharged him as such but how far his having been five years at sea may have mended his manners i leave to the penetration of those who may hereafter choose to employ him  j swift deaneryhouse jan  th         i advised him to go to mr pope who on seeing the deans handwriting which he well knew told the man if he could produce any credible person who would attest that he was the servant that the dean meant he would hire him on this occasion he applied to me and i gave him a letter to mr pope assuring him that i knew the man to have been footman to the dean upon this mr pope took him into his service in which he continued till the death of his master  it is now i think full time for me to take up my clue and go on with my memoirs previous to which it is however i think it incumbent on me to entreat my readers forgiveness for my so frequently mentioning in the prosecution of my story a person so contemptible so unworthy even of satire as one worfdale a painter yet those who examine these writings will find that he is so unluckily interweven in my history that it is as impossible for me to eradicate him as it was for jack in the tale of a tub to strip his coat of its fopperies without visibly defacing the whole  worsdale went abroad and i took an opportunity to make my escape to visit mr cibber and met according to custom a very kind reception for his friendship to me was inviolable he was writing the character and conduct of cicero considered and did me the honor to read it to me i was infinitely pleased to find by the many lively sallies of wit in it that the good gentlemans spirits were undepressd with years  long may they continue so this gave me an opportunity of writing a poem to him which w  e had the confidence to ask from me but i did not choose to compliment him with it the editor has applied to mr cibber for a copy of this poem but he having disposed of them all we are obliged to omit it  mr cibber was exceeding well pleased when i waited on him with it and said he would give it a place but that it wanted correction which he promised to bestow on it this i readily agreed to being convinced his judgment far surpassed mine  i waited on him next morning and found he had greatly improved my work i thanked him for his obliging pains but remarked his modesty in having struck out some lines in which he was most praised  well madam said he there are two guineas for your flattery and one more for the liberty i took i blessed my benefactor sincerely from my soul he smiled benevolent come said he i have more good news for you mr stanhope altered a line for which he desires you will accept of a guinea mr hervey also pays you the same compliment for changing one monosyllable for another to say the truth i only wished every gentleman at whites had on the same terms taken the same liberty till my work like admiral drakes ship had been so often mended that not a bit of the original stuff it was composed of should remain for here in nice balance truth with gold she weighs and solid pudding against empty praise   i could do no more than after some joyful tears to assure mr cibber that neither his own favors to me nor those he had solicited for me should ever be forgot while this poor machine of mine had any existence  surely i hope we shall know our friends after death that we may hold sweet communion with them and  quaff immortality milton if in the melancholy shades below the flames of friends or lovers cease to glow yet mine shall sacred last mine undecayd burn on through death and animate my shade homers odyssey  what strange things are thought and reflections how do they wander who but the almighty can account for them i went when in london to be electrified when finding the motion given to a glass globe not only made sparks of fire come out of my arm but also set a bowl of sand under it a boiling i could not help thinking that the earth revolving each day on its own axis must of course take fire as i have seen a chariotwheel do our globe may then become a comet and the inhabitants of others gaze on it with surprise and admiration i think no philosopher has yet been able to tell us by all their mathematical rules what comets are i have been told many stars which once adorned the blue etherial space have disappeared worlds perhaps lost in a conflagration which no more fill the wide expanse  but how i ramble out of my sphere in a vain attempt to soar above it for while this muddy vesture of decay does grossly close me in i cannot do it milton  i long to listen to the young eyed cherubims and am weary of the world but what of that i gave not life to myself nor dare i attempt to abridge it  reader excuse me if you are a man of sense i am certain you will and from the ladies i yet hope compassion though rarely met with from one woman to another  had i strayed from the paths of virtue when turned out desolate to the wide world forsaken by all my once dear seeming friends and tender relatives i might at least have hoped for pity and given necessity as a plea for error this has made me so circumstantial in every particular of my nine years living in london where i am certain i have many friends and those such as would be an honor to any person to gain and i really was ranked with their friends not numbered with their train pope  my dear and honored lady codrington thou lovely epitome of every female virtue whose ear is shut to scandal whose hand is liberal whose chastity immaculate whose zeal to serve the disstressd unwearied whose friendship i experienced when you kindly pleaded in my behalf to her grace the late duchess of marlborough to the royal offspring of our august monarch and whose politeness is as conspicuous as your every other amiable virtue  pardon me abstract of all goodness that i dare to whisper your immortal name but your sweet epistle when you told me it was necessary for me to write a letter of acknowlegement to her grace which letter i submitted to your ladyships superior judgment to correct where there was any thing defective pardon my vanity i must insert to mrs meade madam i have observed that superior geniuses have ever more a diffidence of themselves you pay me a very high compliment in believing me capable of mending what comes from you i wish it may have the effect i desire of a farther bounty from her grace i am  madam your real friend and most obedient servant eliza codrington arlingtonstreet    as i had wrote my letter to her grace in a very small hand a fault we scribblers are apt to run into whence arise numerous mistakes i asked lady codrington whether her grace who was now declined into the vale of years could see to read it she assured me she could as well as i this put me in mind of some very fine lines wrote on this illustrious lady in the kitcat toasts which cannot but be acceptable to my readers on the duchess dowager of marborough let others youth esteem this glass shall boast a great immortal undecaying toast in the quick luster of whose radiant eye still lives the beauteous spark of liberty whose spirit undepressd by fourscore years except for englands safety knows no fears from whom a race of toasts and patriots came england shall pledge me when i malbro name   to all this noble family my respect and gratitude are due it is a blessing to our island that some of their descendants equal in wisdom and virtue to their ancestors vouchsafe to reside in it where may they flourish like the cedars of libanus  but to return i was now able to quit my confinement for worsdale made his house a severe one to me oh how i rejoiced at my deliverance and took a little decent lodging but my joys were perishable as the baseless fabric of a vision captain meade with whom i mentioned my sons going on the secret expedition came to tell me that the boy and he landed the day before that my son was seized with all the symptoms of a violent fever and wanted to see me i went to the captains lodgings in scotlandyard and found my poor wanderer quite lightheaded the captain sent a physician and a surgeon to him with orders to the mistress of the house to provide for him whatever was necessary and he would answer the expense for many days we despaired of his life till at length gods mercy restored him to my prayers and tears when he came perfectly to himself he told me they had been in a violent tempest where the waves rolling mountains high he was wet to his skin and the ship in imminent danger of being lost captain meade he said begged of god that he might just see his wife and children and then he should die without the smallest reluctance his prayer was heard the storm abated and all got safe on shore  as he was impatient to see his family he had left directions for my son to follow him to teddington if it pleased god he recovered as i knew nothing could be a greater restorative after a fit of sickness than a pure air i recommended that sovereign elixir to him he went the moment he was able and sent me the next day the following letter dear mamma i have returned to what i had just left sickness the captain is in a malignant fever beyond any thing i ever saw he knows nobody nor has he any physician i dont believe he can outlive tomorrow night i am really greatly grieved as i am sure he loved me and on account of his poor wife who is almost distracted the four little girls i fear will be quite unprovided for all things here are in confusion adieu my dear mother heaven preserve you to  your affectionate and dutiful son john carterert pilkington teddington friday morning    my sons prognostic happened to prove true the captain expired about four the next morning of which the boy was first informed by the dismal outcry of the widow and children this womans character has something in it so far surpassing any thing i have yet met with that i hope it may at once divert and instruct my readers the story is genuine  she was the daughter of mr wh  f  ld of canterbury an ancient and honorable family many of whom had seats in parliament but it seems he had strayed from the wisdom and virtue of his ancestors and devoted himself entirely to belial women and wine were all his joy till he broke his ladys heart and oh strange to hear shocking to human nature had the the cruelty to attempt his virgin daughters one of whom to protect herself from such devilish solicitations ran away with his coachman she thought it neither shame nor sin for john was come of honest kin swift  the heroine of our story being left alone was so tormented by his incestuous infernal fire that she fled to her younger brother who was an apothecary and lived at w  d  r  as he was a bachelor he was very glad of her to oversee his domestic affairs which i dare say she did very well as she was a good housewife especially in the frugal part of management it happened another apothecary fell in love with her but nothing could prevail on her to accept of him as a husband though her brother tried every art he could to persuade her to it  things were in this situation when captain mead was commanded on duty to w  d  r and as he had often been there was well acquainted with the town and as well esteemed miss wh  f  d and her brother with some young ladies were walking on the terrass when captain meade accosted them they fell into chat and mr wh  f  ld invited the captain to supper after which the young lady retired  mr wh  f  ld then acquainted the captain with his sisters obstinate refusal of an advantageous match she has said he seemed to pay a particular deference to every word you spoke tonight and i am certain if you undertake the lovers cause you will bring my sister to reason  the captain said it would be too abrupt to pretend to advise a lady he had never seen before in so delicate a point as that of matrimony wherein many circumstances ought to be considered in order to a union firm and lasting it may be said he the young ladys heart is preengaged in that case how cruel would it be to force her into a hateful wedlock the consequence of which is misery  mr wh  f  ld then assured him he had no such intention all he aimed at was her happiness cultivate added he a friendship with her you may easily do it and discover the true cause of her aversion toward an honest good man who loves her and is in circumstances to maintain her in ease and plenty  captain mead promised all in his power and when by frequenting the house he had got into a little intimacy with her he in a paternal style when they were alone expostulated with her to no purpose she said she was determined never to marry as she was certain she should never have the man she only could love  he pressed very hard to know who it was assuring her of his friendship and at the same time laying hold of her hand said he must be insensible indeed who did not above all other consideration regard so much tenderness and beauty  he perceived she trembled blushed and seemed quite confounded would to god madam said he that i was the happy occasion of all those tender emotions which swell your fair bosom how blessed should i think myself and are you said she in a faultring voice are you in earnest or do you only trifle with a weakness which your penetration must have observed even from the first moment i beheld you  although this declaration was very plain yet it was so unexpected that the captain was for some moments at a loss how to make a suitable return but recovering himself he told her joy had made him speechless but from that hour he was entirely devoted to her for life  he then asked her in marriage of her brother who absolutely refused her to him on account of his being in the army  but as the lady was willing to be the kind companion of his flight he hired a chariot and six and took her with him  this story captain meade told me before her nor did she in the least attempt to deny it but said she had gained a good husband by her sincerity  indeed while i was with them they seemed to me perfect patterns of conjugal love but her fondness seemed to surpass all things for she would kiss her husbands linen saying they smelt of violets and roses but truly though i loved my dear relation very well i was grown so delicate i did not like a dirty shirt for that was sometimes the case to be offered to me as a nosegay  her piety was so great that whitsunday morning when we were going to church which was near half a mile from captain meades house a young lady called to us to know did the bell ring mrs meade answered yes but finding even the churchyard door not opened she said she would not receive the sacrament that morning i asked her why she should not because said she i have told a lie in saying the bell rang i told her scruple to doctor hales who joined us and presently dispelled her fears by assuring her an innocent mistake could never be deemed a lie  upon this we both ventured to receive the blessed eucharist administered to us by a truly holy hand for assuredly doctor hales yours is such and let no person say i do not reverence the clergy for i really do but not any one of them who does not as near as humanity can go aim at the perfection of their maker and redeemer  as i have already related the manner of captain meades death let us see how his pious widow behaved herself on the occasion after having yelld and screamd to save appearances she locked up his body and had him next day buried  she desired my son who remained disconsolate in the house to go to the tower and bring home whatever of the captains was there but he being apprehensive that perhaps on account of his youth and his not having a line with him they might be refused to him begged of me to accompany him which as i was truly desirous of rendering any service i could to his family i readily did when we arrived at his apartment there for the officers keep one in every place where they are obliged to be on guard and told the mistress of the house my melancholy errand she gave me the keys of his bureau portmanteau trunk etc  when i took out his regimentals his sash and many other things appertaining to him in which i had so often seen him arrayed i could not refrain bursting into tears to think the dear wearer of them was now no more amongst other things we found two guineas which was a seasonable relief to the widow the soldiers on duty wept like children at his deaths sad story my son conveyed all things safe but the sight of them did not take the same effect on his relict that they had done on me for she only said she was very glad to get them  my boy who colors prints beautifully was employed by mr millan so that he was innocently and elegantly employed the sweets of getting money made him doubly diligent and to be quite undisturbed which it was impossible he should be with me so many persons coming for letters petitions etc he took a lodging for himself i was one day exceedingly surprised when the pennypost brought a letter directed to my son as it was marked teddington i opened it judging it was some business that mrs meade wanted to have transacted when o shameful it was a loveletter to the child who was but sixteen years of age and she is four years older than i am with a direction to him to meet her at a coffeehouse in london and an offer of marriage to him  i really could scarce believe the true and credible avouchment of my own eyes bless me she amazed me yet thinking this might be a counterfeit i showed it to the boy and desired he would go and see into this matter neither of us being acquainted with her hand which was a desperate bad one  he went accordingly and stayed most part of the evening abroad when he returned he said he had inquired after her everywhere and could not learn any tidings of her so i conceived this letter was either wrote by some enemy of hers or else for sport by some of the girls at teddington in order to send him on a wildgoose chase  about six weeks after the captains death an officer inquired for me as i did not know him i asked what commands he had for me he desired to know of me whether i was not a near relation to captain meade to which answering in the affirmative i desired the gentleman to sit for he looked as if he had something of importance to deliver pray madam said he can you inform me what is become of the captains widow my reason for inquiring is this a prior wife has set up a claim to the pension and produced a certificate which we believe to be a counterfit as it is dated twenty years ago and it is but reasonable to think she would in that time have asserted her just rights but this is not all the officers have made a collection for the lady he acknowledged and the children but there is a report spread that she is married to a boy young enough to be her son who was a helper in the captains stable this has damped the charity of those who had she even been deceived by the captain would have assisted her  i told him i had often heard the captain relate that in his younger days he got in a league with one mrs meadows who after having been divorced from her husband set up a coffeehouse where he boarded and lodged he found her in every respect so unfaithful to him that he quitted her not long after she broke and being in distress applied to captain meads who in consideration of former friendship agreed to give her annually  0 l provided she retired which she agreed to  i cannot sir said i help thinking this is some piece of her contrivance it is very possible madam returned he and if you will be so kind to inquire into it that these reports may be confuted it will be of the utmost consequence toward the future welfare of the widow and orphans of your deceased relation i shall pay my respects to you again in two or three days the gentleman left me and after a good deal of search amongst mrs meades acquaintance i learned she lodged in the strand there i went and found her in a very indifferent lodging the children were in deep mourning but madam herself was decked out very gay after customary compliments i told her i was surprised to see her out of mourning why cawzan for that was her manner of pronunciation i am married what already returned i ever the man you seemed to dote on even to extravagance is cold in his grave cold says she aye he is cold enough and rotten too by this time may be you made him so before death why should you think so because you seem to have thrown of common decency and is this all the respect you pay to so good a husband in answer to this and to my great surprise she assured me she never was married to the captain in her life  here was hypocrisy that sly fiend who escapes all but the piercing eye of god in its utmost perfection if one may make use of such an epithet to such a devilish sin to live in fornication yet go to the communion without the least purpose of amendment of life and to pretend such strong affection to a man whose very memory she showed she hated i shall ever after this suspect the sincerity of such an overacted fondness  i told her my errand and that i was really sorry she had put it out of my power to vindicate her conduct which cut of regard to the poor children i would gladly have done she told me doctor hales approved of her proceeding and so she did not care what i thought though i am certain this must have been false for the doctor had such high notions of conjugal fidelity that he was true to the ashes of his spouse whom he lost when he was but a very young man and having an agreeable person a sweet temper and unbounded learning might no doubt have raised his fortune by a second marriage  amongst other instances of her hypocrisy this woman used to pretend that even small beer got into her head and would severely censure any lady who drank a glass of wine yet now though it was but nine of clock in the morning she called for a dram drank it off and would have had me follow her example but i had no inclination to such a breakfast besides having no other estate but my head on which were hourly demands it was by no other means my interest to destroy it  i took my leave and when i related this to my son the boy laughed excessively and as he then had no manner of respect for her he told me he had gone to her according to her appointment that she had treated him with two bottles of mountain and pressed him hard to marry her indeed i remember when he came home i saw he had been drinking but he said some young gentlemen of ireland whom he met gave him a bottle of wine  however some time after she made him pay for his liquor for she opened a punchhouse which i believe she still keeps at least she did when i left london she wrote a letter to my son to desire to see him accordingly he went and madam temperance carried him into the dining room and ordered her husband who served in quality of waiter to bring up a bowl of arrackpunch and half a dozen glasses of jelly the boy was well pleased with this sumptuous fare but when the good cheer was ended she demanded payment and he was obliged to part with his weeks earning which he had just received what could the most mercenary prostitute have done worse  but i believe she is sufficiently punished for i was well assured the groom took the liberty of correcting her and nobody pitied her  i think the philosopher was in the wrong who wished for windows in the human breast how miserable must we have been when we beheld those whom we esteemed friends under specious appearance plotting our destruction the object of our love even in the midst of wellfeignd rapture wishing themselves in the arms of another the son who bows his knee in filial reverence to his hoary sire cursing the gout pitargo and the rheum for ending him no sooner in short the scenes would be too shocking they would quite imbite life  those philosophical gentlemen who have searched into the secrets of nature have admired the wisdom of providence in kindly concealing from us many things which known would make us wretched i am sure it was well for poor captain meade this womans breast was not transparent  they have farther observed that were our perceptions stronger than they are the senses which convey pleasure to us would become the instruments of intolerrable pain the touch if tremblingly alive all over would smart and agonize at every pore or quick effluvia darted to the brain die of a rose in aromatic pain should nature thunder in our opened ears and stun us with the music of the spheres popes essay on man how terrible must be our condition  most married persons even in the happiest wedlock which is at best but tolerable look back with secret regret on the sweet hours of freedom when no anxiety reigned such as the care of a family the sickness or disobedience of children the total loss of them and a thousand troubles which perplex the married life and yet no sooner are they single but they run into the same toils again hardly affording time for a decent mourning strange infatuation in which i think the ladies more excusable than the men since their weakness may make them want a protector yet they who can have resolution enough to know no second bridebed but the grave certainly claim a higher degree of respect and veneration  in this aimable light shines the present lady dowager meade who though left a widow in the bloom of her youth and beauty the widow of a gentleman old enough to be her father who lost her sole guardian to their offspring turned all her thoughts to the improvement of her childrens minds and fortunes in both of which heaven crowned her goodness with success and the world with honor  i could mention another great lady not unallied to her who though she has many virtues as i have acknowledged in my first volume being left exactly in the same situation was so faithful a steward for her son that with his rents which she received during his minority she purchased an estate for herself a thousand pounds a year jointure not being sufficient for her neither would she ever come to any account with him for the produce of his estate the gentleman had too high a sense of filial piety to commence any suit in law against his mother though she was married to a second husband much younger than herself and has been like to a stepdame or a dowager long withering out a young mans revenue shakespeare  i am sure mr pilkington i pray heartily for your life lest i should ever be such a fool as to engage in new scenes of trouble for if i could not keep your heart properly due to me at a time when the flattering world called me agreeable much less would my declining age a second husbands love engage nor from the dregs of life could i receive what the first sprightly running could not give   and now to convince you that i bear no malice to you i will tell you an authentic truth true as the gospel for one truth is even by mathematical demonstration adequate to another  i was since i came to dublin invited to a widowers house to dinner as his business called him out he had left orders for my reception your youngest son was with me and we were shown into a parlour where a gentleman sat reading my first volume i did not interrupt him as he seemed to be deeply engaged the master of the house coming in and saying mrs pilkington i am very glad to see you and your son made the gentleman look at us attentively after dinner he told us he had a bond and judgment entered on it against you at the suit of mr clark the brewer that hitherto he had been compassionate supposing us to be such creatures as your imagination had painted us out to the worl to be but said he now i am convinced of my error i shall show him no farther mercy my boy starting up cried what do you mean to do to my father nothing said mr edwards only to try how he will brook imprisonment it is full as fi for him as for your mother for my own part i was weak enough to burst into tears and your son swore a good privateer oath that he would shoot any man who should offer to distress his father  mr edward seemed surprised as judging no doubt we should have rejoiced in your calamity as you had done in ours yet being of a generous humane disposition he was touched with our sorrows and granted that liberty you now enjoy to our intercession you know the persn and if i set down a falsehood let him disprove me  upon my word i must contradict the witty mr congreve who says heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned nor hell a fury like a woman scorned for i do not hate you i am in an apathy a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain both of which i must acknowledge i received from you but that was when you wrote in my praise and at the very same time said every thing disagreeable to me was not this done to deceive the world i will make them believe i love her and as she has too much pride and decency to complain of me i will indulge my pleasure abroad with miss his present wife n  y s  d  s or the widow or any w  e  i cannot indeed say but miss s  d  ss father owed a favor to mr pilkington who kindly taking compassion on his necessities when his lady was not satisfied with his keeping a mistress in the house with her and insisted on her being dismissed mr p  n ever humane received her to his habitation with open arms gave the old gentleman free ingress and egress for which he gratefully permitted the parson to go to bed to his daughter indeed i should have pitied her had she been deceived by the report of my death so industriously spread into marriage but she had it under my own hand that i was living for i did the creature the honor s  t as she is to write to her in order to prevent her being imposed on i think the form of matrimony really wants an explanation if we go according to the strict letter of the law what a happy state must a young woman imagine herself entering into where she is to be loved honored cherished nay even worshipped she has a protector till the hour of death who is to forsake all even his parents for her if it be required who endows her with his fortune and promises all this solemnly at the altar  then follow the words those whom god has joined let no man put assunder  now let us see how this is really to be interpreted at least how far this covenant is usually kept  no sooner is the honeymoon expired but the fawning servant turns a haughty lord instead of honoring his wife it is odds if he treats her with common civility he shall tell her to her face he wishes her death in order to marry another the custom authorizes this free way of speaking yet i never knew it agreeable to any wife nor did i ever doubt but the husband spoke in the sincerity of his heart  as for our being endowed with the worldly goods of our husbands it is known they are so little apt to share with us that it has always been found necessary in a marriagesettlement to stipulate for pinmoney a very useful clause even to the husband and it is much better his wife should have a share of his fortune than be obliged to a gallant for a trifle which gratitude may make her repay in too tender a manner  indeed the last article against divorcement i entirely disapprove of and am glad it has seemed good to the wisdom of the church to act in direct contradiction to it this has made numbers easy and as they tell us it is not lawful to separate on any cause save that of adultery a woman of spirit who is married to a sordid disagreeable wretch has nothing to do but to make him a cuckold and then welcome thrice dear liberty yet methinks the husbands should in justice return to their wives when they abandon them the dowry they brought with them now lest my worthy husband should say by this rule i should have nothing who had not a portion regularly paid and yet was a pepetual fortune to him i will tell him a story  the countess of eglantine one of the greatest beauties in scotland fell under the displeasure of her lord for no other cause but having brought him seven daughters all charming as this fair northern lass and never a son on this his lordship assured her he was determined to sue for a divorce the lady told him she would readily agree to a separation provided he gave her back what he had with her he supposing she meant pecuniary affairs assured her she should have her fortune to the last penny nay nay my lord said she that winna do return me my youth beauty and virginity and dismiss me as soon as you please his lordship being unable to answer this demand spoke no more of parting with his lady and ever the year expired she made him the glad father of a lovely boy whose birth restored love and harmony to his noble parents this was related to me by the late lord primrose and therefore i believe it  but now mr p  n though i presented you with this piece dont think i meant you should take a hint and endeavor to end our matrimonial warfare in the same manner no no though you linger about the door in an evening in your long cloak and slops and that i do believe thee to be my spouse by the amorous glances darted through thy spyglass at the window of my sacred and sequestered bower where no profane thing priest dog nor worm dare enter i am resolved to remain obdurate sooner shall lambs make love to lambs tigers to tigers and every creature couple with its foe as the poet wittily expresses it than i unite with thee  yet verily thou do manifest some tokens of grace inasmuch as thou dare not to contradict the truth i fancy when thy penusing talents perished thy penmaking ones shot forth which have been so fortunate as to recommend thee more effectually to a certain b  s favor than could ten hundred thousand folios sprung from thy shallow brain  and truly this is an useful accomplishment i wish i possessed it twould save me some pence in the year but there are different talents bestowed on different people i must even rest contented with such as i have and sooner will i wear my plectrum to the stump in using of it nay not blacker tube nor of a shorter size smoaks cambriobriton versed in pedigree who on a cargo of famed cestrian cheese high overshadowing rides philipss splend shill than mine shall be  ere once my learned pate ducks to a golden fool i make no application  there are many strange ways of getting into the favor of the great pimping lying flattering who can be proof against the force of such united virtues for your great men who have too much honor to pay a just debt never fail to reward the servant of their vices and it may be some odd knack recommends them where those baser applias are not required on which i have thought of a story not quite foreign to the present purpose  a man who had a spent a good part of his life in driing pins into a wall on the point of each he would with infinite dexterity throw a pea his fame spread even to the emperor who desired to see this matchless son of science overjoyed he came showed his trick to the infinite pleasure of the spectators the emperor highly applauded him and as he supposed this must be a work of long practice to arrive at such a proficiency in it demanded of him how many years he had spent in attaining it the fellow being willing to inhance his own merit assured the monarch he had spent thirty years in it on which the emperor ordered him thirty bastinadoes on the soals of his feet for having so much misspent his time  and my dear husband if you have your desert you merit just such a reward for misapplying time in trifles writing one good sermon or useful book both of which when i knew you you were as capable of as most young men would have tended more to your reputation than any merely mechanical art  but in short i sincerely pity you and if ever you want a shilling let me but know it and if i have the good fortune to have a guinea subscription for gentlemen seldom send me any smaller coin you shall not go without one  the dignified clergy indeed have been niggardly to me yet not against them all do i bring this accusation many of them have even a bleeding humanity for the distresses of their fellow creatures and have not only pitied but assisted me and while i can in that noble list inroll the sacred names of berkley and delany patterns of virtue in their lives really apostolic in their doctrine winning straying souls with goodness and humility learned as far as humanity can soar surely no other of the clergy need send me a message when they subscribe not to divulge so terrible a secret i always in this case judge there is more fear than charity in their contributions but here i must remember a certain cross dean to whom as my father was physician i took the liberty of applying my son went with the letter he came out and cried boy opening his ponderous and toothless jaws what do you want an answer sir said he why then my answer is i will not my son protested he was quite startled at his ferocious features and stentorian voice yet after all we laughed away our indignation as he was really not worth it  this admirable orator ought to have a larger rostrum than the narrow limits of a pulpit to display his graceful action and neverenough to be admired grimace a theater would suit his genius a puppet one i mean where glorious punch himself must yield the prize  i remember once to have seen this reverend flamen in his lengthened dress ascend st andrews pulpit where recollecting the enormous iniquities of the congregation he of sudden gave so furious a toss to his head like a metalsome horse hard reind that back fell his wig and down flew his sermon which not being well secured fluttered in numerous leaves about the church scattered like the ungodly as chaff before the wind the sleepers awoke the old men who dreamed dreams and the virgins who saw visions started from their downy trance and he willing at least to give us his benediction cried aloud depart ye cursed into everlasting fire which that ye may all do etc etc etc  the late lady rawden not long after she became a widow invited the dean as her parish minister to dinner the lady went to take the air and sir john then a child was in the parlour the dean fell into chat with the sweet boy and amongst other questions said do you know me no sir why i am dean c  your parish minister poor master innocently verified the old proverb that children speak truth for he cried out o indeed i heard my mamma say you were the worst preacher in dublin his reverences wrath was hereupon so raised that he failed not to reproach the lady who to pacify him corrected the poor child however she could not avoid relating the story which i heard from lady rawden at mrs percivals to the infinite laughter of the auditors and which i from henceforth consign to fame in these my immortal labors  i was much obliged to sir johns humanity in london which i gratefully acknowledge but there is one great man i cannot pass over great according to sergeant kites definition of one for he is full six foot high his fortune raised from the noble spirit of malt for i do remember like prince henry that poor creatures smallbeer which his father sold to mine and from the golden grains arose a princely fortune from the humbly dray appeared a coach such as ambassadors use when on public occasions they by their state give us a picture of the grandeur of the potentate they represent for if the man such honor have what must be his who keeps the knave   not that i would hence infer all ambassadors to be rogues farther than lying a little for the good of their king and country  it was this worthy gentleman who told them at whites that i had nothing to publish i had quick intelligence of his favor after which obligation he came to visit me and would have been very kind to me because i was a gentlewoman a person he could depend on and he was then in distress being at a distance from his lady and native country to be sure i ought to have been charitable but that i always stood in the way of my own preferment and another unlucky circumstance for my swain was that i remembered the deplorable condition to which he reduced his first wife who died of his love as did also his child the nurse it was given to and her husband noble achievements worthy of your illustrious birth and lineage for it is you can taint the sweetest joy and in the shape of love destroy however i should have passed you over in silence but that you told a nobleman here i had been quite compliant to your desire why then you prove yourself a generous lover in sending me five british shillings for a book a wondrous bounty really why your neighbor the b  always pays a moidore commutation for adultery and sure you ought to give more than a man who by the power committed to him from above is entitled to give himself absolution  your hoary canting sire was a votary to venus even in old age when a certain widow and her dancing daughter lodged at glasnevin a young gentleman who was much enamoured of the younger dame used to visit her every evening as he did not care to have it known he went in through a low window to misss bedchamber it happened that miss being abroad the venerable pair made choice of that place to indulge the gentler passions the young gentleman came according to custom and without ceremony threw up the sash flew in and unfortunately started from their downy couch the reverend elder and the chaste matron  miss following her mothers example resigned her virgin charms to you and lost at once her health and reputation  this might have been my unhappy lot but that however careless i have been about reputation i was always determined not to put my own precious person into any peril  now says my reader if he be a giber how this prating old woman who certainly never had any temptation boasts of chastity ay it is no matter i have had so many amorous epistles odes songs anacreonticks saphics lyricks and pindaricks in praise of my mind and person too sent to me since i came to ireland that i believe some gentlemen though i cannot have found me out to be a mavelous proper woman i will get my room hung round with lookingglasses and entertain a score or two of tailors and study fashions to adorn my body   and some time or other as i find it is the mode in london for the ladies to publish the triumphs of their eyes and how many men fell a prey to their luxury or as dr young says had ever nymph such reason to be glad in duel fell three lovers two ran mad though i cannot indeed produce such dreadful proofs of my beauty as some of them nor choose i to have my print exhibited before my work but testimonies of authors with regard to it i hope i may be allowed the same vanity mr pope shows in the vindication of his wit learning and humanity may be pardoned in a female in the vindication of that far nobler part external loveliness for a mind in a woman is of little consequence dr young seems of a different mind but great authors sometimes vary as it is now my interest to be of his side the question i shall give his opinion and who knows if it should chance to be true but my admirers may be real ones what is female beauty but an air divine through which the minds all gentle graces shine they like the sun irradiate all between the body charms because the soul is seen hence some we see are captives of a face they know not why of no peculiar grace and so much for what i never had except according to his judgment there as a proof of my humility i put in my claim and will like see zenophons banquet socrates dispute the prize even with alcibiades  now i have mentioned this small but inimitable well wrote book which was recommended to me by dr swift and which i in return commend to all such of my fair readers as have a taste for real wit in which the divine socrates as conspicuously shone as he did in purity of life and constancy in martyrdom that they peruse it with care as it will refine their ideas and improve their judgments polish their style show them true beauty and lead them gently and agreeably to its prime origin and source here they will find divine philosophy not so harsh and rugged as some falsely think but musical as is apollos lute and a perpetual feast of nectard sweets where no crude surfeit reigns milton  i must here observe in my tracing authors through each other zenophon and plato borrowed from socrates whose disciples they were zenophon acknowledges it as freely as i do the instructions i received from dr swift lord shafts burys search after beauty is copied from socrates mr popes ethics stolen from both and the learned mr hutchesons beauty and harmony an imitation of the great philosophers and excellent moralists first mentioned  had mr hutcheson stopped at this book by which he had acquired some degree of reputation both as a writer a divine and a mathematician he had done wisely but o his essay on the passions overturned his scarce established praise if it has any meaning it is like dark veiled cotyto in her ebon chair close curtained round impenetrably obscure or from his flames no light but rather darkness visible i really thought it was the defect of my head that made me not comprehend this piece till i heard the present lord bishop of elphin whose learning or judgment were never yet doubted declare he did not understand it after all whether the defect lay in the book or the b  p let the reader determine  wollastons religion of nature delineated though frequently intermingled with mathematical proofs is yet so plain that it demonstrates the authors thoughts clearly which whoever does can never fail to write with equal perspicuity but learning seems encumbered with words or technical terms signifying nothing and our schoolmasters lest our children should attain it too soon if they should lead them to the fountain from whence the streams of knowledge flow copious to quench or rather to increase that desire of it which we observe from their first prattling infancy choose rather to make them begin at the bottom of some rivulet from whence with infinite difficulty when they have waded about half way they are obliged to retire by the command of another then begin at another till wearied they give over and hate the fruitless endless unprofitable toil i believe that formerly they had a better method of instructing than what is now practiced i judge this by the eloquence shown by the youth of those ages and the beautiful pieces of poetry still extant some of them styled the minor poets perhaps to distinguish them from the venerable ancients or on account of the juvenile years of the authors  perhaps nature in her prime creation was productive of more strength and beauty even in the mind than at this time when luxury and excess pull down our rosdcheekd youth emaciate their bodies and enervate their understandings for mind and body are so closely united that whatever affects the one must of consequence affect the other  i hope my reader will pardon my reflections on the works of those valuable writers i have mentioned for i mean no disrespect to their sacred memories but as i am accused of being a plagiary myself which i own i am my intention is to prove all writers to be thieves as well as their humble servant shakespeare alone excepted  some of my learned correspondents send me word i do not write these my own memoirs why i fancy were i to publish their epistles the world would not believe that any of them were my assistants but their modesty makes them conceal their names and i have no curiosity to discover them  with such all authors steal their works or buy garth did not write his own dispensary pope but authors are a little too fond of fame to let any one run away with it from them or a tolerable performance pass for the work of another i speak from experience i have wrote for numbers and do still but no human creature ever helped me out with a single line if they did let it appear against me and my writings be torn to fragments or condemned to flames  and talking of burning puts me in mind of dear lord kingsborough who because he saw that i endeavored to do but barely justice to his inimitable pen bid me burn all his letters upon which in a passion i snatched up my pen even before his face and scribbled the following lines to the right hon the lord kingsborough for the benefit of the illiterate to whom these lines may appear as obscure as some in persius let them read the works of livy and pythagoras and mayhap they may guess at the meaning if they cannot their time at least will be innocently employed till they can come at the grand arcana of the rosicrusians or discover the longitude how could my dear lord make me such a request i flatter myself you are only in jest those epistles which all my soft raptures inspire do you think i could bear to commit to the fire like mutius i would put my own hand in the flame for the elements used to compose your loved name should i promise obedience i surely should lie give me a more gentle command i will comply but here i should baffle the best of your art for each line you have wrote is engraved on my heart   his lordship was so humane as not to insist on my obedience and now my lord i tell you publicly that not the grim tyrant death shall divorce me from the inestimable treasure i possess they shall rest with me in the grave next to my heart when every motion sense and pulse is over and even my kingsborough beloved no more   i have often my lord reflected with pleasure on the blessing my father gave me when he brought your lordship into the world why according to the midwifes phrase you are one of his children and consequently my brother for i must prove a kindred to you though i fetch it from japheth as i have been long buried to my brother and by your lordships bounty have acquired a kind of second birth new born i may a nobler brother claim and joined to thine immortalize my name pardon my presumption if i am too bold it is owing to your lordships indulgence both to my scribbling and prattling vein so you must excuse a nymph of letters thus poets often treat their betters but i think i must speak in the superlative mood and call you best of men for what day of your life passes without a worthy deed to crown it your virtue would sigh to lose one  indeed my lord i love you and if you are too great to be beloved be greater greater still and be adored now in return i beg a place in your friendship where if i grow the harvest is your own  but oh i am sick of many griefs and this frail tenement of clay must quickly very quick decay but perhaps all things are ordered for the best on which hope i relate what i know to be truth  a captain of a man of war took a fancy to despise his wife and engage with another woman the wife took it patiently till at last he had the impudence to tell her he would either bring his harlot to live with her or she and his three children should turn out the lady was confounded at so strange a proposal and begged three days time to consider of it and then she would give him a determinate answer he agreed she told her affliction to a friend and begged her advice on which they resolved to consult doctor potter late lord archbishop of canterbury accordingly they took a boat and went to lambeth the good prelate proposed an invocation to the almighty to direct their counsels after prayers he desired the lady not by any means to quit her house but to acquiesce in her husbands desire and let him bring the woman home and depend on it said he god will assist you and what at present appears an evil will turn out a blessing to you so giving them his benediction they departed full of hope of an happy issue  the husband who flattered himself that the wife would quit the house was not a little astonished to find her quite submissive to his commands and consenting to live with his mistress  accordingly he ordered his chariot bade his wife prepare dinner and went for his harlot whom he brought home triumphant and handed into the dining room the wife received her with a civility that confounded and enraged her she brought her a glass of lisbon wine and then left her with the captain who in a few minutes came down and seeing all things ready for dinner ordered his wife to go and bring the lady down she obeyed but madam called her a hundred names flew at the captain beat him and put herself in such a rage that she fell into fits was seized with a fever and died  after this catastrophe the captain seriously reflecting on the submission and virtue of his wife thus addressed her my dear if i thought there was a possibility of your pardoning my past errors and never reproaching me with them i do assure you i would never fall into them again but make a faithful tender husband to you the lady burst into joyful tears at this happy change and kindly assured him she would never even think of what was past she told him it was by the archbishops advice she had acted with the moderation she now found to be so happy in the event and they both went to thank the venerable prelate who truly partook in their joy the captain died about a year after and left his whole fortune to his lady who lives an honorable widow at greenwich  thus we may see if we persevere in our duty the almighty is not slow to hear nor reward but when we sink beneath a load of grief by unforeseen expedients brings relief   i was told a pretty circumstance of his grace when he was at westminster school it seems he stood terribly in awe of the rod and having committed some mistake that deserved chastisement which doctor busby was very liberal in bestowing he was ready to die with the apprehension of it when a good boldspirited lad taking compassion on him owned the fault and took the whiping for which his timid friend promised to be grateful if ever it came in his way to serve him they both took holy orders but met not till many years after when his grace was an archbishop his friend remained a curate but time which brings all things about so ordered it that the archbishop and the curate met at a noblemans house his grace hearing him named recollected both the gentleman the whipping and his own promise of gratitude and finding the curate had no preferment he gave him a very good living  i hope these incidents will not be disagreeable to my readers as i really set down nothing but what i know to be truth which is more than most of our modern memorialists can say who present us with heaps of improbabilities and expect implicit faith from us and if what some of them have told us be genuine though it may redound to their profit it never can to their honor for their actions are neither worthy being recorded nor their writings of being read the true end of writing being to give instruction with pleasure which whoever is so happy to do may justly hope for a place in the temple of fame but all human kind will needs be wits though millions miss for one that hits our chilling climate hardly bears a sprig of bays in fifty years yet every fool his claim alleges as if it grew in common hedges swifts rhapsody  and having once more quoted our unrivalled dean and being well assured no part of my work can be half so agreeable or entertaining to the public as that which relates to him i shall as far as in my power present them with his lively portraiture the most minute circumstances relating to so great a man cannot i hope be deemed trivial since we find by experience that the nightscene so beautifully drawn by shakespeare between brutus and his domestics sleeping in his tent the little incident of his taking the lute out of the boys hand and saying when he fell asleep this is a sleepy tune  o murtherous sleep layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music gentle knave good night i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee if thou do nod thou breakst thy instrument i will take it from thee and good boy good night   do we not love him more in this amiable view of him than in all his conquests or that sad act whereby he thought to give his country liberty the world are sufficiently acquainted with the deans public character be it then my task to trace him in private life for there only it is we can frame a true judgment of any person the rest is frequently mere outside  when the dean was at bellcamp at the house of the reverend doctor gratton he wrote to doctor delany to come and dine with him mighty thomas thumb and her serene highness of lillyput meaning my husband and me accordingly we went the dean came out to meet us and i by agreement hiding my face mr pilkington told him they had picked up a girl on the road and desired to know whether they might bring her in he guessing who it was said let her show her face and if she be likely well admit her on this i took down my fan and said o indeed sir i am well then said he give me your hand he led me into a parlour where there were twelve clergy men and said those fellows coming in had brought a wench with them but added he well give her a dinner poor devil and keep the secret of our brethren  as most of the gentlemen knew me we were very merry on this odd introduction  pox on you you slut said the dean you gave me a hint for my polite conversation which i have pursued you said it would be better to throw it into dialogue and suppose it to pass amongst the great i have improved by you o dear sir said i it is impossible you should do otherwise matchless sauciness returned he well but i will read you the work which he did with infinite humor to our high entertainment  it was christmas time and froze very hard the dean meditating revenge set the wine before a great fire the corks of the wine being secured with pitch and rosin which began in a little while to melt no sooner did the dean perceive they were fit for his purpose but he slyly rubbed his fingers on them and daubed my face all over instead of being vexed as he expected i would i told him he did me great honor in sealing me for his own plague on her said he i cannot put her out of temper yet he seemed determined to do it if possible for he asked the company if they had ever seen such a dwarf and insisted that i should pull off my shoes till he measured me to this i had no inclination to submit but he was an absolute prince and resistance would have little availed me so when i obeyed he said why i suspected you had either broken stockings or foul toes and in either case should have delighted to have exposed you  he then made me stand up against the wainscot leaned his hand as heavy as he could upon my head till i shrunk under the weight to almost half my proportion then making a mark with his pencil he affirmed i was but three foot two inches high  dinner was brought up and i being like mrs qualmsick the curates wife always a breeding could not eat any the gentlemen guessing at my circumstances by my decreasing face and increasing waste were so overobliging to know what i liked best that at last i told the dean i wished i was a man that i might be treated with less ceremony why said the dean it may be you are i wish sir said i you would put the question to the company and accordingly to their votes let my sex be determined i will said he filkington what say you a man sir they all took his word and in spite of petticoats i was made a man of after dinner i was obliged to put a tobaccopipe in my mouth but they so far indulged me as to let it be an empty one as were the deans doctor delanys and my husbands  the dean asked me could i play cribbidge i said i could upon which he called for cards but upon recollection said he would not play with a beggar for he should stand no chance for if he won he would not take the money and if he lost he must in honor pay but why a beggar mr dean said doctor delany a married curate must of consequence be a beggar returned he and you are another and pox on me if i can ever get acquainted with any persons but beggars and i dont think but this woman or man here is in the way of producing another then sir i hope you will be so kind to stand godfather which will secure it from so hard a fate so said he more demands upon me well if it be a boy i dont much care if i do but if it be a little bitch i will never answer for her  a day or two after this the dean came to town and summoning a senatus consultum as he called those few friends whom he peculiarly regarded he placed us round a great table where he told us we were an empannelld jury and he placed himself at the head of it where he sat as judge he then told us the reason why we were summoned mr grattons favorite hen was put to death by an unlucky stroke of a whip by one of my fellows as i suppose i accused them and they denied the fact but as murder always will come to light i found the hens head and neck in the seat of my chaisebox and now i want to convict the criminal accordingly he ordered his three men servants to come before us and related the following story to them when doctor done afterward dean of st pauls london took possession of the first living he ever had being a speculative man he took a walk into the churchyard where the sexton was digging a grave and throwing up a skull the doctor took it up to contemplate thereon and found a small sprig or headless nail sticking in the temple which he drew out secretly and wrapped it up in the corner of his handkerchief he then demanded of the gravedigger whether he knew whose skull that was he said he did very well declaring it was a mans who kept a brandyshop an honest drunken fellow who one night taking two quarts of that comfortable creature was found dead in his bed the next morning had he a wife said the doctor yes sir is she living yes what character does she bear a very good one only indeed the neighbors reflected on her because she married the day after her husband was buried though to be sure she had no great reason to grieve after him this was enough for the doctor who under pretense of visiting all his parishioners called on her he asked her several questions and amongst others what sickness her first husband died of she giving him the same account he had before received he suddenly opened the handkerchief and cried in an authoritative voice woman do you know this nail she was struck with horror at the unexpected demand and instantly owned the fact and so fellow said dean swift do you know this head the criminal confessed his fault and the jury brought him in guilty of henslaughter in his own defense for he declared he was hungry and did eat it having no malice prepense to it but rather love on account of his sincerity and our intercession the dean pardoned him  mr gratton had presented the dean with a small cask of fine ale of which he was very choice good maltliquor not being easily purchased even in ireland on sunday evening the deans set of intimates came as usual to pass it with him and he being in high good humor said he would treat us with a pot of this ale i had the honor of being entrusted with the key of the cellar with a particular order to hold the candle in such a position that it might drop into the tankard as also not to put the spiggot fast in but let the drink run about after receiving his commands which i promised punctually to obey i went down but had scarce opened the door when doctor delany and doctor sheridan were with me o breach of trust unpardonable we sat down on a bench and each of us drank but we laughed so heartily at cheating the dean that he stole down having some suspicion that where there was a woman and two clergymen there might be a plot and surprised us i in imitation of his servant told him the parsons seduced me and i did drink pox choke you all said he  in vain did i with all the moving eloquence of a female orator plead for pardon the key was taken from me and mr rochford was before my face invested with my honors and i oh fatal sentence condemned to be sockwasher to the blackguard boy who waited on the under butlers under butler  i would have persuaded mr rochford to plead in my behalf but he was obdurate as adamant especially as by my disgrace he rose however not long after i presented him with an humble petition wherein i failed not to extol the neatness of the boys feet since they came into my hands insomuch  that not the nicest nose could in the dog days smell his toes   and as a reward i was made inspectoressgeneral of all the drinking vessels but no more entrusted with the key of the cellar to say the truth i could not well vindicate my conduct in that important point  the dean had twenty of those agreeable whims which kept us all cheerful as was his intent for i suppose my readers will believe that neither he nor we valued the ale but for the jests sake  no man living told a story to more advantage than the dean there never was a word too little or too much in it it was always apt full clear and concise truly epigrammatick  it would be well for their readers if some of our writers had learned this happy art but they draw out their tales to a tiresome length dwelling on every trivial circumstance and omitting things of greater consequence and when they would seem wise they grow obscure thus the small silkworm spins her slender store and labors till she clouds herself all over pope  the dean told me he did remember that he had not laughed above twice in his life once at some trick a mountebanks merryandrew played and the other time was at the circumstance of tom thumbs killing the ghost and i can assure mr fielding the dean had a high opinion of his wit which must be a pleasure to him as no man was ever better qualified to judge possessing it so eminently himself  yet was he so free from any vain osstentation of it that he could suit his converse to the talents of his company insomuch that i believe had they proposed to play pushpin or talk nonsense he would have complied even with the latter if it had been in his power  i have known him fill up rhymes given after the manner of the french though he had found it true musical rhythm so esteemed by the ancients nay he could deal in the pun ambiguous or conundrum quaint which some booklearned blockheads for such i have seen with each a store of lumber crude and undigested in their brains would no doubt have scorned but as horace observes there is a sweetness in sometimes mingling folly with wisdom and i am well convinced no person without a good understanding can even play the fool agreeably triflers cannot even in trifling excel for only solid bodies polish well young  one night that i had the honor to be in as polite a set of company as ever europe bred they took a fancy that each of them would imitate the voice of a different animal either bird or beast each having fixed on what suited their inclination they began the consort at once would not any one who had refused to join in the frolic have seemed ridiculous it is true indeed this was attended with one mortifying consequence for the servants scared at the hideous yelling and concluding we were all fighting ran hastily in to part us but finding all was right they left us however we heard them laugh heartily at our entertainment  as i have often mentioned the deans charity one ill conferred instance of it cannot i believe but make my readers smile  he observed a woman whose whole estate was a sieve of fruit which she had in a stall where she sat footing wornout stockings seeing the woman very decent and always at work he judged her to be a proper person for him to assist especially as by the report of her neighbors she was a very honest woman the dean asked her why she did not try to borrow twenty pounds and set up a handsome fruitshop alasaday sir said she who would trust a poor creature like me with such a sum why said he if i thought you would improve it i would lend it you the woman promised fair and the dean lent her the money and at the same time wrote down the particular kinds of fruit he would have her furnish herself with she was to let him know when she was stocked and he promised to recommend her to customers  the woman overjoyed at her good fortune went about five oclock next morning to a gardeners produced her bill of fare on which they judging by her appearance she could not pay for such a cargo laughed at her this provoked the pride of the newraised beggar who to convince them of her wealth produced it to their astonished view upon which they altered their note and as it was a cold morning said that bargains were never made with dry lips they drew in the poor woman to drink plentifully of brandy and ale mixed hotpot which soon left her stupid in the alehouse but not till they had first done her the favor to rob her  when she came a little to herself the woman of the house demanded payment the fellows being gone she was going to pay the reckoning but alas her money was gone too it was in vain for her to enquire for it everybody disavowed the fact but the gardener out of his great charity gave her a basket of windfalls with which she was obliged seeing no remedy to return to her original poverty  the dean vainly looked for the product of his charity he could neither see shop nor woman for she kept out of his way at length he happened in church to be seized with the cholick and went out in the middle of service and who stood at the churchdoor but the very person he stopped and demanded why he had not heard from her and how she proceeded upon this the woman flew into a rage abused him all the way to his own house told him that his cursed money had bewitched her that all the neighbors knew she was a modest virtuous sober woman and that he had made her turn whore and drunkard the dean ran in clapped the the door upon her and begged the protection of his domestics against the mad woman  and here i must observe that as the dean was very justly satirical on the vices of human kind yet when he fell on infirmities he seemed to have done a displeasing act to heaven inasmuch as he was punished with them all in a remarkable manner he lived to be a struldbrugg helpless as a child and unable to assist himself  i say not this as any reflection to his sacred memory heaven forbid i should but with all the reverence i have for the dean i really think he sometimes chose subjects unworthy of his muse and which could serve for no other end except that of turning the readers stomach as it did my mothers who upon reading the ladys dressing room instantly threw up her dinner  here i digress oddly enough on a whimsical circumstance having once had the honor of being known to lady  i took the liberty of applying to her for a subscription her neice came out and mistaking the person who brought the letter for me said her lady wondered at my impudence to apply to her when i knew how i had used sir  but if ever i used him or he me then am i no twolegged creature for to my knowledge i never even saw him if the man did dare to contradict me i would make him eat a piece of my pen but how used him not unlawfully i hope did your ladyship ever see me lewdly lolling on a lovebed with him no if we ever met he was supported by two reverend prelates proper supporters for a christian hero but i never heard that the gentleman was addicted to women so that i hope i may rest uncensured by him and also by your l  p  i do this madam in regard to the gentlemans character for my own is of no consequence it is barebit and knawn by treasons cankertooth shakespeare  and pray now sir c  for to thee i call but with no friendly voice what time what day what hour did i ever disoblige you the injuries you have done me i freely forgive and if you please will honor you with panegyric lays but then take notice you must come down handsomely you are not lord kingsborough nor will my verse flow spontaneous his virtues might the humblest bards inspire and fill their bosoms with poetic fire   so now for ever and for ever farewell brutus if we do meet again why we shall laugh if not why surely we shall never weep a more inspiring theme demands my attention so sir knight of the oracle adieu if thou dyest before me as you should since you stepped into the world thirty years ever my dim speck of entity was animated i have wrote your epitaph which i beg you may have engraved on your tombstone lest you should not i will raise you a monument more lasting than brass  i presume by the information of your boots you have read horace take your encomium here lies the greatest man that ever was born all womankind sincerely did he scorn and kept the good old proverb in his mind he that will not go before  must go behind   and if my printer should dare to put a dash or blank in your illustrious name i will in capitals insert it and you know when in bold capitals expressed the dullest reader takes the jest   this sir i give you as a farther proof of my impudence in which i own your family to have far the superiority to mine for though some of them did execution in the wellfought field yet none of them were condemned to suffer one so read this and then to breakfast with what appetite you may  but after all i have said i bear you no ill will but you began with me this tennisgame and i have matched my racquet to the balls and depend on it whoever begins with me i bear the motto of the thistle nemo me impune lacessit   the hour now came when the deans promise was to be claimed as i brought forth a son i wrote to him but he was in the country and in five days the boy died the dean did not return till i was a fortnight brought to bed  he came directly to visit me mr pilkington opened the door for him and brought him up to me after wishing me joy he asked where was his godsonelect i told him in heaven the lord be praised said he i thought there was some good news in the way your husband looked so brisk pox take me but i was in hopes you were dead yourself but it is pretty well as it is i have saved by it and i should have got nothing by you  he drank a little caudle with me and then went away about an hour after his servant brought me a letter and a great bundle of brown paper sealed with the utmost care and twisted round with i know not how many yards of packthread my curiosity led me to read the letter before i examined the contents of the paper which to the best of my knowledge was this madam i send you a piece of plumbcake which i did intend should be spent at your christening if you have any objection to the plumbs or do not like to eat them you may return them to  madam your sincere friend and servant j swift     i now examined the contents of the paper in which i found a piece of gingerbread in which were stuck four guineas wrapped in white paper on the outside of each was wrote plumb  i sent the dean a real piece of pumb cake with this answer sir i have heard that ostridges could digest iron but you give me a harder task when you bid me eat gold but suppose i should like the rich streams of the tagus flow potable gold the interpretation of which is that i mean to drink your health this minute in a glass of sack and am with the utmost respect sir  your ever devoted servant l pilkington     just when he had fixed mr pilkington to be chaplain to alderman barber the dean received from spain from one mr wogan a green velvet bag in which was contained the adventures of eugenius as also an account of the courtship and marriage of the chevalier to the princess sobiesky wherein he represents himself to have been a principal negotiator it was wrote in the novel style but a little heavily there was also some of the psalms of david paraphrased in miltonick verse and a letter to the dean with remarks on the beggars opera in which he says he believes the people of england and ireland had quite lost all remains of elegance and taste since their top entertainments were composed of scenes of highwaymen and prostitutes who all remain unpunished and triumphant in their crimes he concluded with paying the dean the compliment of entreating him to correct the work  the dean said he did not care to be troubled with it and bid mr pilkington take it to london and look it over at his leisure which accordingly he did  he was scarce gone when the dean came to me for the bag i told him my husband had according to his commands taken it with him he protested he never gave him any such permission that i was impudent to say it and my husband more so to do it the conclusion of which was that he ordered me to write to him to return it immediately and least i should forget it he gave me a very good beating well i writ mr pilkington an account of the deans wrath and he sent me the fatal bag by a clergyman i directly carried it to the dean and hoped he would be pleased by my punctual and ready obedience to his will but far otherwise it fell out for the dean flew into a passion for my daring to presume to write for it and gave me another beating  but did not this more resemble the actions of a lunatic than of a gentleman of superior wit and knowledge indeed i believe too much learning had turned his head or too deep a search into the secrets of nature as nothing could escape his observation and this wrong turn in his brain i fancy had possessed him a long time before it was taken notice of as numberless proofs might be produced and even amongst the facts that i have related there are some strong instances of it had he been less witty it would sooner have been taken notice of but as the poet observes great wit to madness sure is near allied and thin partitions do their bounds divide   the first proof he gave of his incivility was affronting the lord lieutenant at the lord mayors table who because he had not paid his compliments to him in due form he very civilly accosted by the extraordinary title of you fellow with the blue string some little time after this he invited two clergymen to take the air with him and when he got them into a coach he did so belabour them and knock their heads together that they were obliged to cry out for assistance  from this he fell into a deep melancholy and knew no body i was told the last sensible words he uttered were on this occasion mr handel when about to quit ireland went to take his leave of him the servant was a considerable time ever he could make the dean understand him which when he did he cried o a german and a genius a prodigy admit him the servant did so just to let mr handel behold the ruins of the greatest wit that ever lived along the tide of time where all at length are lost  if ought else relating to him should occur to my remembrance i will faithfully relate it as i am certain it cannot but be acceptable to the public whose interest he had evermore at heart and whose liberties on all occasions he warmly and nobly asserted  it is mine o honored shade to celebrate thy goodness without extenuating thy faults i deal impartially which is the true task of an historian and i would inscribe thy tombstone were i permitted but without characters fame lives long thine will last while wit or genius are admired in this sublunary globe  however disagreeable it may be to me i find i must prosecute my own history till my leaving london to which metropolis i never intend to return as has been insinuated in order to hurt my subscription while ever i can find means of subsisting in my native country where i have received more favor than i could reasonably hope for i should esteem myself not only ungrateful but unjust to raise contributions on the public and carry the money from this poor island to spend it in a rich and opulent city  besides my days of vanity are over the woods groves fountains sacred recesses dear to the muses would be my choice even had i a fortune to entitle me to enjoy the splendour of a court in its utmost magnificence o how i languish for retirement even as the heart pants after the water brooks so longs my soul after it where i might sit upon sunless side of some romantic mountain forest crowned i wish my best and dearest friend would take this into consideration and in some part of his wide extended domains afford his muse an humble hermitage  i should not then be distracted with fears of an imperious landlords threats no your happy tenant would pay her debt in weeds which when i once told your lordship you very politely answered that such verses as mine were the finest flowers in the garden of the muses  i must here relate to your lordship a little circumstance which happened to me lately i took a lodging in drumcondralane the two ladies sisters who keep the house kindly invited me to dinner it was very natural for me to enquire what persons of distinction lived in our neighborhood they told me lord kingsborough had lately purchased a house in it a most worthy fine gentleman i happened to express so much pleasure at hearing this agreeable piece of news and at the same time so warmly joined in their sentiments that one of the ladies said well madam though you have made a mystery of your name i am certain you are mrs pilkington i am sure you are the person because you speak of his lordship in the very same style you have wrote of him i have the two volumes  as i found they were prepossessed in mrs pilkingtons favor i confessed they had guessed right but whenever i want concealment if your lordship is mentioned i will take care to be silent otherwise i shall soon betray myself as out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks though i am afraid that like holy david it would be grief and pain to me and while i sat musing the fire would kindle the sacred fire of friendship and gratitude would unlock my tongue and give me utterance even though i had been born dumb  why my dear lord were but a few persons of distinction in your way of thinking earth itself would become a paradise no more would the sorrowful sighing of the prisoner nor the voice of lamentation be heard in our streets and it is with infinite pleasure i see our long stained nobility who were only famous for undoing and built their characters on rapes and ruin now almost to a man not only just but beneficent not only learned themselves but encouragers of science in others if amongst our countrys worthies i name you lord molesworth who have distinguished yourself in fields and senates in the seats of the muses and academic groves whose well tried valor has approved itself not in rashness but a noble intrepidity and scorn of death whenever your god your king or country required your service i hope it will not offend you to say may your god your king and country make you as happy as my much obliged and most truly grateful heart sincerely wishes shall ever be my ardent prayer  your lordship has kindly visited the virtues of my father on his daughter i am sure i had no other claim to the favors or honors for which i am indebted to your lordship and for which i rest your faithful servant  at length through strange vicissitudes and variety of misfortunes finding i could get no relief from ireland i determined with my son to revisit it and though late in life try my fortune in hibernia but how to compass a journey and a voyage without money was really a difficult task to this end i set my wits to work to find out whether any persons of my own country were in london from whom by revealing my distress i could hope for relief at length i learned that dr delany was there who never rejected the petition of the afflicted even though they had no other merit to recommend them but that of anguish my suit was granted in the most compassionate and obliging manner accompanied by his tears for my misfortunes and prayers for the preservation of my soul and body and sure the oraisons of one so good must have uncommon efficacy in them to turn the sinner and confirm the just in welldoing while his own example strengthens all his precepts  how different was the reception i met with at the hands of this worthy man from the rough return made to my solicitations for a subscription from lady  who wondered at my impudence in applying to her  ladies let me entreat you will drop that nasty paw word impudent at least dont annex it to my name who never yet had the assurance to appear in any public place since i came last to this kingdom nor ever to apply in person for a favor but a woman who has suffered in reputation knows not what to do it is all impudence though her betters have more for that in the captain is but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy  upon my word if instead of the impudence i am charged with you would call me a desolate afflicted wretch you would speak the truth for poor laetitia is become the football of fortune but why should i complain when the son of man says that the foxes had holes and he himself had no place to lay his head in answer me some of ye great learned and pious divines why is our blessed redeemer styled the son of man when we are told that a virgin should conceive that the power of the highest should overshadow her how was he then the son of man we are all ordered to apply to our heavenly father and therefore may style ourselves the children of god why then is there any exception made in this case  i hardly dare allow myself the liberty of thinking lest i should do it too deeply and reason be my disease and yet i believe it was given me to follow and search after truth where then shall i find it not on earth no more than peace or justice who are long fled from these lower regions boldly then let me pursue them even to the high place from whence they sprung the seat of calms and ease the mansions of the blessed where holy hope and constant faith shall be lost in fruition of that happiness which has not yet entered into the heart of man to conceive  mr woolastons religion of nature delineated shows us powerfully how much a lie must offend the creator as i am taxed with numerous quotations which are tedious as some of my readers tell me i shall not borrow one from him but refer the learned to his inimitable work though i am persuaded no person who has not a clear head can taste his beauties and truly i have paid myself no small compliment here but as it is written even let it pass  and here mr blake ignatius blake esquire permit me to tell you though no person can more revere your every amiable quality than i do yet as the objection you started to my philosophic doctrine of the oceans having no bottom has deprived me of rest ever since i could find in my heart to be angry with you you asked me then how i could account for islands which must have a foundation i am not sure of that perhaps they float like delos it is demonstrable that wherever we dig deep we find water not salt indeed like that of the sea but may it not be purified by running through the veins of the earth and arise to us in fresh fountains mineral streams or milky currents such as mallow affords our foundation we know is on the waves our building on the great deep this was so at the first creation then when the windows of heaven were opened and the deep abyss or receptacle of waters broke up what had we but the ruins of a world to inhabit the fragments of which may swim at least most worthy sir i can find no better solution for the doubt you raised in my mind pray consider the question yourself and if your learning which i own is extensive be adequate to your virtue you are better qualified to give me an answer than most men living  now do i know i give your modesty pain but amongst other instances of my impudence i could not forbear this  and had i never honored you for your own goodness yet your answer when i asked you did you love lord kingsborough who knows him but must love him would have commanded my respect and best wishes and they both sincerely attend you and here my polite roman john brown of the neal esquire then going to take his trial my friend beloved by all but the malicious and unworthy who persecute you for no other cause but that you excel in courage and learning accept of my thanks for the many fine encomiums you have bestowed on me think of me as one incapable of pursuing the advice you gave me of forsaking a friend in the hour of calamity sure it is then our duty to administer consolation as far as our power extends the fortunate want it not your magnanimity of soul bears up against the storms of fortune and amidst the noise of chains and keys thou can of cupid sing the warders their hoarse bawling cease and drawers watch thy string but says my reader what have i to say to your philosophy or particular attachments proceed in your story inform us how you got to ireland well now you have reminded me of it i think i will to confess the truth i had like to have forgotten myself my thoughts are apt to wander through eternity and like pompeys transported to regions of day disdain to be tied to a mansion of clay   after receiving the worthy doctor delanys bounty which was sufficient to pay every debt i owed in london which as i was cautious in contracting any a sum though less would have paid but i had not a sufficiency to answer the expense of traveling charges for two persons the parliament was dissolved the nobility gone to enjoy the sweets of spring april having decked all things in fresh and fragrant bloom all but wretched humankind from whom whence parted it no more returns to blush or beautify the cheek again but let us not sorrow after that as those who have no hope beyond this life if we can go unstained through this world which it is almost impossible to do or seeing the errors of our ways forsake them we have assurance given us of a joyful and triumphant resurrection mark with what hope upon the surrowd plain the cheerful plowman casts the pregnant grain there hid as in a grave a while it lies till the revolving season bids it rise till natures genial power command a birth and potent call it from the teeming earth then large increase the buried treasure yields and with full harvest crowns the plenteous fields i wrote in order to gain relief to a prelate of ireland then resident in london i sent the letter by the daughter of a dissenting clergyman of whose honor and virtue i was confident he received her civilly read over my letter and declared he did not know me but as he had some slight knowledge of my family there was a guinea for me this answered no end but yet he gave me some comfort by bidding her call again and he would think of something for my service accordingly in a weeks time she went again and again till at length his lordship vouchsafed to send out a very rough answer not in the least befitting his function or dignity especially to one whom he knew from her infancy to be a woman of good birth and education  but i resolving to be as chuffy as he sent him in reality another epistle not overcourteous i own yet it wrought a better effect than my complaining one produced for his gentleman came to me early next morning with a very civil letter and produced ten guineas to my unspeakable joy but there was a drawback on my happiness for i was obliged to return ten shillings change which i very reluctantly complied with  with this sum my son and i quitted london and being on the saving scheme took places in the wagon a most tiresome way of traveling may morning we set forth our slowpaced cattle were adorned with ribbands and flowers and till then i never understood the meaning of the vulgar expression of being as fine as a horse for it seems it is customary on this month to present the waggoners with a ribband at every inn till our fleabitten nags were almost blinded by the tawdry partycolored flowing honors of their heads i was really almost fatigued to death for i was called up at three oclock in the morning though perhaps you dont set out till five tea or coffee none to be had unless in some of the towns indeed if i could like our driver have eat a breakfast of salt beef and cabbage at that squeamish hour it was laid there ready they bait not all day so one might have an appetite by evening but it happened not so to me the heat and dust quite deprived me of any inclination to food and especially to the rough fare provided  my chief delight was listening to the nightingale who then warbled forth her lovelaboured song to indulge the pleasure of hearing the soft warbler pour forth her plaintive and harmonious lay i used when we were near our resting place to alight and walk through the flowerenamelld meads filled with cowslips primroses and wild violets for in rural scenes the soul of beauty reigns the soul of pleasure lives in rural scenes pope my son and i found out a sweet place canopyd with woodbine which had enringed itself in plats about a large apple tree whose blossoms shed perfumes while the whole season warbled round our heads we seated ourselves under the wide spreading shade listening with delight to those wild musicians suddenly the boy cried out o mamma what shall i do what is the matter child look at my leg i did so and behold a snake had twisted up it i though heartily startled had presence of mind sufficient to beg he would not strike it he took my advice though indeed both he and i were ready to faint and the evil worm crawled away without doing him any prejudice but not being well assured that all the serpent race sworn foe to man might be so complaisant i was never after tempted to sit down in albions fruitful fields  we lodged this night at a strange old village whose name i have forgot i believe the inn had formerly been a convent by the numerous little cells and cloisters small windows almost darkened with jessamine and vines it had a most romantic melancholy air fit for studious contemplation but not replenished with rich repast or cheerful wine the next day being sunday a day of rest we took up our quarters at another inn where we got a chicken and a pint of wine and lived sumptuously  we then walked out to see what kind of curiosity this place afforded worth remark but finding none we strayed out on a common when the first object which struck my sight was that of a man suspended high in the air hanging in chains on a gibbet shocking as it was it engaged my attention i concluded he must have been a most undutiful son when the birds of prey had devoured him and the ravens picked out his eyes suddenly i was surprised with the voice of a man who cried o my dear coshen paddy i wish those who put you there for noting were there themselves i looked about and saw fifteen or twenty men and women lying in a dry ditch i would have fled but considering that might not be safe i rather chose to walk at an easy pace one of the fellows made up to us and asked where we were going i told him to our country ireland arah said he are you a catolic i said i was upon i which he said faith poor paddy lawler who hangs there was a good one and what sir brought him to so unfortunate an end why said he he was in love with a proud scornful hussy and she slighted him so he met her in this plaish and because she would not accept of his shivility he lent her a nock on the head and so he got his will of her she died the next day after she had given information against him to be sure her skull was broke but he did not deshine that  while he was telling me this story i trembled but made the best speed i could to the village being infinitely more frightened at him than i had been at the snake he accompanied us there for which i returned him thanks how sincerely my readers may judge but i made a virtue of necessity and gave him fair words now said he are not all these heretics damned rogues ay said i and i hope our true king will put all villains to death arrah give me your fist for that i was obliged to comply when i got to the inn i told him i should be glad of his company but that i had a jealous husband who would certainly kill me if he found any man in my company damn the rogue said he if i was as you i would make him a cuckold in a crack i desired he would please to accept of a pot of drink which he did and making a leg walked off leaving us unmolested and i blessed god i had purchased life at so cheap a rate  that soft answers turn away wrath is most assured for i remember some years ago when the cavan rabble were up in arms my mother sister and i went to pay a visit at rathfarnam to the lady of our excellent eaton stannard esquire who resigned recorder on our return home we were surrounded by a pack of these wretches who ordered my fathers coachman to pull off his hat to them which he refusing and they being all armed with short thick oak tree clubs they swore we should not ride in a coach and they walk my mother with surprising presence of mind said gentlemen you are very welcome to the coach my daughter and i will walk to oblige you with it which villains ruffians and murderers as they were they would not permit but only desired we might huzza for them this notwithstanding our terror we cheerfully did and my mother said gentlemen perhaps you are dry and gave them a crown with which they were so well pleased that they huzzad for us offering to guard us safe to town but she alleging that would be too much trouble they left us with a kind assurance that they would drink our healths and fight for us any time we stood in need of their protection  nothing material happened to us till we got to chester we took a survey of the cathedral church which had nothing like beauty to recommend it any more than the old black walls which environ part of the city  next day we set out for parkgate which was crowded with nobility and gentry waiting for a fair wind here we were so long detained that my purse was quite exhausted even my last shilling gone this was a sad situation we were fixed to a point without any power of moving one way or another wanting the necessary agent money there was but one way left which was even to apply to lady kildare who was there but being ashamed to do it in my name i even did it in my sons who waited on her ladyship with it met a favorable reception and brought home a guinea the wind sprung up fair and we embarked on board the race horse as i am always deadly sick at sea i chose to keep on deck as long as i possibly could my son being well inured to the watery element skipped about and sung marine songs most of the passengers went to their cabbins when mr hudson the clergyman seeing my boy speak to me asked me was not that young lads name pilkington i said yes i thought so said he for he is very like mr pilkington the clergyman he has some cause to be so sir for he is his son how can you answer for that madam why indeed sir i have some cause of knowledge of it for i am that worthy divines wife and the boys mother the gentleman confessed the force of my plea and expressed great compassion for us both and i do verily believe had he known our circumstances he would have added relief to pity  he seemed to be a learned and worthy gentleman which i had the better opportunity of discovering as he my son myself and a gentleman whom i did not know sat all night in lady kildares coach which was lashed upon deck we there were becalmed and amongst other things mr hudson said that had he ever been so unfortunate to take a common woman and she had brought forth a son so like him as mine was to my husband he would at least have concluded that to be his own  upon which i related to him a true story a servant maid who had lived with mr pilkington in ireland enquired of the persons who kept the next house who were the new lodgers they had got the name made her but more inquisitive and she begged i would permit her to see me but as i had met with many a trick in life i bid my son and daughter sit behind the bed curtain and then desired her to come up i asked her did she know me she said no indeed but she had lived with one mr pilkington in ireland who had turned his wife out of doors and that he lived on lazers hill and what said i were the names of the children why returned she there was master billy miss betty and master jack and how came you to leave him why indeed he was beating miss and master sadly and i asked him why he did it he said because they were none of his oh sir said i sure master jack is yours for he is your own picture ay said he the mother was thinking of me when he was got in troth sir said she i dont doubt that for i believe you were the nearest person to her for which offense she was directly dismissed and could he have found matter against her life he would have prosecuted her  the children knew her and whatever little favors she had by stealth done for them in my exile i did my utmost to return to her a benefit is seldom lost  at length the day broke and discovered us my native earth i hailed the mother land which gave me birth but knowing how little money i had did not choose to land at dunlary which must be attended with more expense than i had any possibility of answering the other passengers all went ashore twas about three oclock and my boy and i waited in the ship not doubting but we should be soon at ringsend but it happened otherwise for we were becalmed we once more took our seats in the coach and found there the hammer cloth in which i wrapped myself and fell fast asleep in the night i was awaked by the terrible curses of the captain of the ship who swore dreadfully we should be that moment lost i dropped the glass and asked him what was the matter he said he had fallen asleep and trusted the ship to one who had directly thrown us on the north bull and are we then to be lost i see no remedy we shall strike in a minut i pulled my son who laughed at my fears which really were very great the ship struck upon a sandbank with such force that it rebounded on another and beat it almost to pieces however the morn arose that gilded all the flowery plains and presented to our view a most agreeable prospect both of land and water the tide left our ship on the strand so that without expense or difficulty we walked to ringsend  here we took a little decent lodging till i could be able to remove to dublin and i immediately dispatched my son with a letter to a nobleman whom i had formerly seen at my fathers who obligingly sent me a guinea this enabled me to dismiss my lodging my son brought me a coach in which we put our portmanteau and removed to an apartment he had taken for me at a small rent in aungierstreet  well reader i have now brought you with me to hibernia where you will suppose the daughter of a gentleman so universally esteemed as doctor van lewin would after so long an exile have surely found some friends  i wrote a very mannerly epistle to my beloved spouse in which i slightly mentioned his merciless treatment of me and his poor children and told him that if he would pay me the sixty five pounds for which i had his bond in counselor smiths hands i would not only forego the interest which amounted to a considerable sum but also immediately leave the kingdom provided also he would give me assurance that he would take care of his youngest son i leave every person of candor to judge whether or not this was a fair proposal and i most solemnly protest to almighty god that i had no other intention as there was not at that time above forty pages of my first volume wrote however he scorned to send me an answer of any kind well i wrote again yet still his reverence was silent as the grave  this i confess a little incensed me and first determined me in the design of publicly vindicating my innocence and laying open for universal benefit his unparalled character in which if i have erred it is through tenderness as his actions call virtue hypocrite pluck the fair rose from a young innocent love and plant a blister there  shakespeare i wrote to counselor smith and told him how mr pilkington had treated me and withal informed him that if he had too much lenity to sue him for my lawful right i insisted on his delivering me the bond that i might put it in force for the relief of myself and my child  the counselor was at a loss how to act in so critical a point he knew mr pilkingtons talent of traducing every person who did not act in compliance to his inclination and on the other hand justice compelled him to think i had a right to be paid what had so long and so unlawfully been withheld from me and by which i was drove to such extremities in london  he therefore wrote to him and i suppose acquainted him how much it was out of his power as an honest man to defend him from the consequences of that bond mr pilkington finding all his policy of no effect in this particular affair condescended to honor the counselor with a most stupid epistle in which he insinuated that his motive for giving that bond was in order to make me live virtuously for the future which he could sufficiently prove i had not done produce your evidence mr parson that if he was allowed only such time to pay it as his circumstances would not allow he would try what remedy he could obtain from a court of equity when a full state of the case was laid before them these are pretty near the words i wish you had my dear spouse as it must have given pleasure to any court to see you look conscience in the face  but not to be tedious after much trouble and vexation of spirit i procured from him twenty pounds at one payment with which i took a little rural habitation near bowbridge  i wrote a letter to my dear old friend mr cibber and told him that however improbable it might seem to him i had actually twenty pounds in my pocket and added that i had a little room to lodge a friend a river at my gardens end and wanted nothing but the delights of his conversation to make my situation completely agreeable i believe mr cibber had not till then heard of my expedition so that my letter must have surpised him by the return of the post i received from his dear hand the following humorous epistle to mrs laetitia pilkington etc thou frolicksome farce of fortune what is there then another act to come of you yet i thought you had some time ago made your final exit well but without wit or compliment i am glad to hear you are so tolerably alive i have your agreeable narrative from dublin before me and shall as you desire answer every paragraph in its turn without once considering its importance or connection in the first place you say i have for many years been the kind preserver of your life in this i think i have no great merit as you seemed to set so little value on it yourself otherwise you would have considered that poverty was the most helpless handmaid that ever waited on a high spirited lady you seem to have a glimpse of a new world before you think a little how you are to squeeze through the crowd with such a bundle at your back and do not suppose it possible you can have a grain of wit till you have twenty pounds clear in your pocket with half that sum a greater sinner than you may look the devil in the face  few people of sense will turn their backs on a woman of wit that does not look as if she came to borrow money of them but when want brings her to her wits end every fool will have wit enough to avoid her  i am not sure your spouses having taken another wife before you came over might not have proved the only means of his becoming a better husband to you for had he picked up a fortune the hush of your prior claim to him might have been worth a better separate maintenance than what you are now likely to get out of him  as to my health and spirits they are as usual and full as strong as any bodys that has enjoyed them the same number of years  if the value i have for you gives you any credit in your own country pray stretch it as far as you think it can be serviceable to you for under all the rubbish of your misfortunes i could see your merit sparkle like a lost jewel i have no greater pleasure than in placing my esteem on those who can feel and value it had you been born to a large fortune your shining qualities might have put half the rest of your sex out of countenance if any of them are uncharitable enough to call this flattery tell them what a poor devil you are and let that silence them  i hope you have but one volume of your works in the press because if it meets with any success i believe i could give you some natural hints which in the easy dress of your pen might a good deal enliven it  you pay your court very ill to me by depreciating the natural blessings on your side the water pray what have we to boast off that you want but wealth and insolent dominion are not the glory of gods creation there  woman lovely woman there in their highest luster i have seen several and frequent samples of them here and have heard of many not only from yourself but others who for the agreeable entertainments of social life have not their equal playfellows in old england  and pray what would life be worth without them dear soft souls for now too they are lavish of favors which in my youth they would have trembled to trust me with in a word if instead of the sea i had only the dry ground alps to get over i should think it but a trip to dublin in the mean time we must even compound for such interviews as the post or packet can bring or send to  your real friend and servant c cibber     i communicated this letter to lord chief baron bows the hon arthur hill esquire and several persons of taste who were infinitely delighted with it as they were with many others which i had from mr cibber and which would considerably have embelished my work had i not the misfortune to lose them by lending them to a man of distinction who by some accident mislaid them so i must even entertain you with the neat product of my own brain  mr victor whom i have mentioned in my second volume and who is now treasurer of the theater royal in smockalley came to visit me several times and frequently favored us with an order to see the play as we were upon a very friendly and familiar footing my son used when he had an inclination to call on my friend for a pass one night he sent once or twice for that purpose when the gentleman was abroad what does the giddy creature do but aukwardly counterfeits his hand in an order for two he told me of it and said he was sure mr victor would not deny it when he was informed who had taken that freedom with his name i laughed at the reflection of the jest when it came to be known as mr victor had had the boy in his arms when an infant accordingly we took a coach went to the play and the forgery seemed to pass extremely well the first act was scarce begun when a person entered and as the house was thin of company tapt my son on the shoulder i did not apprehend the cause of it but began to grow uneasy when i found him stay a full hour at length he returned and informed me that he had been at the instigation of mr sh  n arrested by two constables from whom he was only delivered by the solicitations of mr victor this greatly astonished me as i thought mr sh  n ought to have had a little more respect for the son of a clergyman especially as he was well convinced that as i knew his father whom the dean entertained more as a buffoon than a friend or companion and his mother i had a power of furnishing the world with some anecdotes which were hitherto unrevealed but the scheme of letting my son escape was not any lenity in him but a bait to catch me going out whom they imagined they should discover by the boy but it happened that a gentleman handed me me out by which this generous intent was frustrated  his little deformed brother had the assurance to tell my son some nights after that mr s  n would esteem any satire i wrote on him a panegyric which when i heard in order to oblige him with a compliment to his taste i enclosed to mr victor the following lines to be forwarded to his mightiness to mr s  n fain would the muse record thy crimes and leave them to succeeding times but finds it difficult to trace the vices of thy motly race whether thy insolence and pride spring from thy s  l fathers side that pedant who with rod in hand could in his paultry school command and underneath his cruel yoke many a generous spirit broke who else were formed in camps to shine or grace the noble patriot line or did thou from thy dam inherit thy fordid avaricious spirit of whom i heard old swift declare so many vices were her share that were her sex created all pure as the first before the fall and but her crimes through all distributed the best would merit to be gibbeted thy father he applauded next studying a wench more than a text who having got of money store lavishing all upon a whore was sent to hell his latest journey by her base brother an attorney such be thy fate thou wretch accursed or else with spleen and envy burst or with thine uncle brave mfaddin whose infamy thy soul is clad in to free the suffering stage and nation be doomed like him to transportation but who thy destiny can alter thy very looks presage a halter oh may i live to hail the day when the glad players shall survey their tyrant stripped of all command high on the well fixed ladder stand and taking thence one glorious swing how will they spout god save the king then shall those clothes in which disguise you would seem a lord to vulgar eyes did not thy base and abject mien betray the beggars brat within be by thy kinsman hangman worn and still a scoundrel thief adorn this sir i most humbly beg your acceptance of as it is indeed the only thing which i could without dissimulation say of you  i was told that this worthy gentleman in a letter to the inimitable mr garrick said we shine like castor and pollux you adorn great britain while i illuminate hibernia nothing sure but his matchless ignorance could have drawn so disproportionate a parrallel i remember the first time i had the pleasure of seeing mr garrick perform it was the character of king lear i was in one of the boxes and when he came to the mad scene i was so much affected at it that i got up insensibly and was going out till i was waked like one from a trance by the lady who accompanied me pulling me by the sleeve and demanding where i was going and to say the truth he made me marble with too much conceiving milton i am certain no person was ever capable of making the audience feel a part which they did not sincerely do themselves and i am convinced mr garrick never played a part wherein he did not through the whole performance believe himself the man whereas pollux as sh  n modestly styles himself is no other than tom sh  n though he change dress and perriwig twenty times a night he is indeed semper eadem worse and worse as my countryman has it  this brings to my memory a story of a very eminent player who was to perform the part of hannibal a nobleman behind the scenes took the liberty to give a twitch to one tie of his peruke the enraged hero turned on his heel and with his martial truncheon smote the peer over the cheek a blow by heaven and from an actors hand he did not stab him for that were poor revenge but when he came off the stage my lord told him he believed he thought himself really hannibal when he could give with impunity such an indignity to a man of his consequence my lord said the player if i did not think myself hannibal i should never be able to make the audience do so  so much for theatrical affairs  i now began seriously to resolve on publishing my writings and to that end had proposals printed persons were at first a little timorous lest i should print a list of subscribers and by that means they might unwittingly give offense but when i declared no names should be inserted i had a numerous contribution from all the nobility clergy and gentry amongst whom when i name our excellent lord chancellor in whom titles and honors had made no alteration but that of increasing his politeness munificence and liberality to every individual our patriot speaker and worthy recorder eaton stannard esquire i believe no person of distinction will blush to have their names mentioned  well at length my first volume was finished and i wrote a bantering letter to sir j  n f  ke to whom i have the dishonor to be allied to tell him that i intended to dedicate it to him nemine con he whose mind is truly pictured in his illfavored face told my son that for himself every body would take it as a thing done to make him ridiculous since he had not any accomplishments that might merit an encomium which indeed was true except it is his matchless impudence in keeping possession of an estate which his own mother the lady  told him he had no more right to than to the dukedom of burgundy  when his supposed father sir b  ph f  ke died this young spark was an ensign in the army and stepping at once into affluence he being naturally of a covetous disposition refused to pay his mother the jointure which she claimed and was going to commence a suit with her when one morning she called on him and said hark ye sir john do you resolve to go to law with me for what is my right he begged to be excused but told her selfpreservation was the first law of nature so it is sir said she calling him by his real fathers name then you are no longer sir j  n f  ke which i will go instantly and make public  he fell dutifully on his knees entreated her pardon for his disobedience and promised for the future to pay all proper resignation to her superior understanding  this sir john you and many others know to be fact  he pointed out to me as a subject for everlasting praise my beloved lord kingsborough then sir robert king and though i had not the felicity i have since experienced of a personal acquaintance with him yet the character pleased me and accordingly i wrote a trifling dedication far inferior to his merit which notwithstanding he kindly accepted and sent me the following letter madam i return you my thanks for the favor of your dedication which though i am sensible is too high a compliment yet my vanity will not permit me to refuse i beg you will take the trouble to send your servant to me tomorrow morning and you will oblige  madam your devoted humble servant r king     i accordingly sent my son who returned with a letter in which were enclosed two notes for ten pounds each the letter was only this madam i once more return you thanks for the favor you intend me and have the honor to be  madam your obliged humble servant r king yorkstreet tuesday morning    an obliging and easy manner of conferring the highest favors is what few even amongst the most polite have been able to arrive at a perfection which alone is given to adorn a marlborough or a kingsborough  but alas how vain how fleeting were all the joys i ever proposed to myself this nobleman in whose esteem i imagined myself to be so deeply riveted that not fortune time or fate could ever displace me was as i have since learned by the insinuations of one clancy an old blind beggar whose wants i had often supplied both in london and dublin persuaded to believe that i had spoken disrespectfully of his lordship and that my son said he would print his letters and sell them for halspence apiece all which was most notoriously false however it had such an effect that his lordship came to me and giving me ten guineas in a sort of commanding tone desired me to give him his letters i burst into tears and told him i would resign them or even any thing if possibly dearer to his pleasure i went to my drawer took as many as i could find and delivered them as i would the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart   he took them abruptly and departing told me he would send in the morning for the remainder of them he left me in a condition which i am utterly incapable of describing a circumstance so unlooked for sunk me into a train of the most gloomy reflections which might have been attended with fatal consequences had not the entrance of some agreeable company dissipated my present reflections  the next morning before i was up a chairman came and knocked at the the door the servant asked who he wanted he said he came from lord kingsborough and must see mrs pilkington herself he told him i was not up but he swore and stormed saying he would not leave the place till he had his lords letters from me i happened to overhear him and desired the maid to tell the chairman i would send to his lordship presently i according arose and piqued at the usage i had received from the fellow i must confess with shame i wrote a little warmly on the subject to my lord and without allowing myself time for thought dispatched it off for i bear anger as the flint bears fire which much enforced shows a hasty spark and strait is cool again shakespeare the fatal epistle had scarce left my hand ever my heart was agitated with the most sensible remorse i in vain dispatched a messenger after the first twas past twas gone twas irrecoverable it reached his hands and he only sent for answer it is very well  i believe the judicious part of my readers must have apprehended that the sin of ingratitude is not amongst the number of mine since i have endeavored through my work if possible to make the contrary conspicuous by rendering due praise to all my benefactors yet what could my beloved lord imagine but that he had bestowed all his favors on an unworthy person  i did not believe that after all the anguish of mind i had sustained through my life any thing could move my philosophy which had made me determine never to be overjoyed or surprised at any advancement in life nor dejected or cast down at any adversity on this side futurity so much as this  downy repose was a stranger to my pillow and i fell a prey to the greatest languor and heaviness of soul however as i knew his lordship was filled with the milk of human pity i imagined by apologizing for the rash act i should be blessed with his forgiveness and a renewal of his friendship to me to which end i wrote the following lines to the right hon the lord kingsborough no more my lord with pleasure i expect your friendly aid my weakness to protect lost to those transports you have often inspired and every happiness my soul desired oh where for succor whither shall i fly but buried in unheard of sorrows die the soul of pity dwells not in a slave but kind compassion dignifies the brave at darius woes great philips warlike son was moved when conquests and when toils were done each godlike hero has a tender part and woes like mine would melt a savage heart ever long my soul had no desire in view no hope or wish but that of pleasing you one smile from you could make a rich amends for shattered fortune and the loss of friends esteemed by you i could with ease survey my name and honor to the world a prey but now no more i am ravished with that voice whose sacred sound bids agony rejoice the vernal blooms no longer give me ease nor painted violets my fancy please each darling object but elates my grief and deaths cold hand can only give relief yet when laetitia shall exist no more but dust to dust as she must short restore shed one kind tear of pity on her hearse thou matchless subject of her latest verse and let no stone or marble ever tell what woes her children or herself befell but mixed and covered with forgotten clay time shall dissolve her memory away   his lordship sent me the following answer which only added more weight to my oppressed soul madam i am extremely honored by that esteem and friendship which you profess for me in your really fine copy of verses yet when i reflect on a late letter of yours which i still have by me i cannot help thinking myself as unworthy of your praises as i was of your threats  i am madam your very humble servant      i concluded from this letter that i had lost all the share in his esteem that i once flattered myself i was possessed of which shows the instability of human affairs  and here gentle reader my story and my life draw to a period i am convinced from the present situation of my health that i shall never live to see this volume published it is the only legacy i have to leave my poor boy who i fear will meet with many enemies on account of my writings when it will be out of my power to protect him but oh ye good and great to you and the almighty i commend him and hope that tenderness which melted you to compassionate my woes will incline you to assist him believe me my dear lord kingsborough no creature living holds your lordship in higher esteem than he and as you told me in one of your letters your inclinations were and endeavors should be to serve him let not the memory of my offense prevent your keeping that promise sacred  appendix i promised in my proposals for printing this volume by subscription to give the readers a key to the first second and third volumes in this place but having been advised by some judicious friends that such a thing would only tend to create ill blood and excite a resentment too powerful to be withstood by so inconsiderable a person as myself it has been thought expedient to furnish them with an account of my mothers death which i am the more capable of doing as i remained with her to her last moments  she had been a long time in a declining state of health having an extreme bad stomach and digestion nor did she imagine that nature could have held out as long as it did  she never seemed in the least uneasy at the knowledge of her approaching end often declaring that if she could take me with her to felicity she would leave this world without reluctance  and indeed i am not surprised that her maternal love extended so far as she even then foresaw the calamities which i have since sustained and knew that if the world at her first setting out as a writer with her extraordinary talents scarce afforded her bread my fate must be even harder except i met the patronage of some illustrious person  and providence seemed inclinable to comply with her wish for in the latter end of june      i was seized with a most violent pleuretic fever which i got by an extreme cold i sent for doctor fergus a most eminent physician and worthy gentleman my mother was at this time so weak as to be obliged to keep her bed when the doctor saw me and heard the symptoms of my disorder he told me i was a dead man that i should have applied some days sooner since he was now of opinion it had got too far the ascendency over me for any cure to be effected however he ordered me to be blooded four times that day and then went up to my mothers apartment  she asked him his advice upon her own case and mine and he told her a little too frankly that nature might do something for my recovery but that her death was inevitable she smiling said to him that the worms would have but a poor feast of her she being quite worn away  well i was blooded according to his order and the fever abated considerably i had the next night an excessive perspiration which carried off all the symptoms except a little weakness  in the morning a young lady who honored me with a particular regard came to see me she was so excessively delighted at my speedy and unexpected recovery that she resolved to spend the day with me and my poor mother ever willing to contribute to my satisfaction told the nursekeeper that she found herself much better and desired she might be brought to my apartment accordingly she lifted my dear mother like a child in her arms and placed her in an elbowchair by my bedside she affected in order to please me to be extremely cheerful and the young lady kneeled down and asked her blessing telling her she wanted to have a wedding in the house instead of a burying from it my mother who retained her spirits and good humor to the last gave us both her blessing very devoutly and her sincere permission to marry i had a small chicken dressed for my dinner of which my mother partook but her stomach was too weak to keep it or a glass of wine which she drank after it so she was obliged to be carried to bed  after her departure as the weather was vastly warm i ordered the maid to open the sashwindow and in the mean time comes the doctor we were just going to drink tea this gentleman is a little nearsighted but seeing the sash up and company in the room what said he this poor boys gone i thought so and was going out no sir said i i am still alive alive said he and what are all these people doing here he immediately went and darkened the window taking the company by the shoulders and turning them out he then charged the nursekeeper not to open the window nor let any person talk to me for a week  i thought this prescription a little hard as i imagined myself quite well accordingly the next morning i sent the nurse out got up dressed myself and went to my poor mother she was agreeably surprised to see me but upon opening the curtains i found she had a great cast in her eyes which shocked me extremely and she told me that every thing appeared double to her i did not give her to understand that i perceived it but told her she looked better than i had known her do a long time she said the doctor had given her over why so he did me madam and yet you see i am alive and if you will take my prescription i dare say you will make a fibber of him  she said she would and i proposed that my spouse as i called miss c  m and she and i should the next morning go to chapel izod a place about three miles from dublin and spend the day she seemed quite pleased with my request and sent to have a landau bespoke for that purpose  in the morning she was up and dressed before me and was as sprightly as i had ever seen her though quite weak insomuch that she was obliged to be carried into the machine and out again  we set out before breakfast and went through the phoenix park it was a fine day and we had the landau opened the fresh air vastly revived her and she repeated a good many lines of the poem on windsorforest she even complained of being hungry when we came to the tavern i ordered some tea and to my infinite surprise my mother called for a plate of ham and some oil and vinegar eat very hearty and drank two glasses of white wind  the readers may judge that i was overjoyed at seeing so fair a prospect of her recovery she after made a shift to walk down into the flowergarden and seemed to enjoy the balmy fragrance with great inward satisfaction i then went in and bespoke dinner which was young ducks and green pease my mother lay down and slept till twas ready at which hour she rose and eat very hearty there happened to be a couple of gentlemen in the house of our acquaintance who after dinner joined company with us and my mother told them that the doctor had given her over but shewas resolved to outlive the whole faculty in short she related twenty agreeable stories to our infinite entertainment  little did i imagine that our present joy was only the prologue to the grief i too soon after received we did not leave chapel izod till ten at night when we all set out in the landau i know not whether the air might not have been very fatal to her for no sooner were we got a hundred yards but she began to cough and continued so all that night during which i sat up with her  we lodged at this time in the house of one sheil in phraperlane dublin we had a first and second floor for which we constantly paid ten shillings and sixpence a week the man of the house had been a parishclerk and had held that dignity under my father for some years he afterward turned farrier or horsedoctor in which meeting with no success he came to dublin took a house which he let to lodgers except the parlours and kitchen and commenced a famous quack i question whither the most eminent of that profession in london which i take to be r  k ever tried more salutary methods to destroy the human species than this profound esculapius had done nor with more success whom we shall hereafter distinguish by the title of doctor sheil  this wretch who was ignorant beyond conception was a compound of pragmatacism and hypocrisy his eyes were eternally bent to heaven with the most solemn and austere aspect while his heart was perpetrating the destruction of all who had the misfortune to be thrown into his house  the first instance which convinced me of it was this the light guineas were now cried down so that people would scarcely accept them on any account this doctor was very particular every saturday to call for his money being the most avaricious mortal i had seen it happened one evening that we had no money in the house but these guineas one of which was very remarkable and wanted six shillings this i gave him and allowed him the deficiency in a few days after every light guinea which my mother had she sold and took current guineas for them she had exactly five weight ones in her purse one morning that i went out she left her pocket hanging on a chair as she was never suspicious of any one when i returned she was going to send me to pay some cash when what should i see but the light guinea i had some days before given sheil the thing astonished me i asked if sheil had been in the room she said no nor any person besides nurse this nurse under the rose was much addicted to liquor i called her and examined her closely about the matter she strenuously denied her knowing any thing of it at length by threats and entreaties she confessed that sheil had given her half a pint of rum to change them in her pocket he assuring her it was the same thing  i now besought my mothers permission to lay the old canting r  l in newgate but she begged that i would let her die in peace and not cause her last moments to be disturbed with contention she farther conjured me not to mention it till she was either dead or in some other lodging in compliance to her request i dropped the affair  but notwithstanding her desire of quietness this bloodhound for such alone i can style him resolved to hasten her exit for the next day watching his opportunity when i was out he came up and with an austere countenance demanded three weeks rent which was that day due to him she told him in a faint voice that i was gone for money and would pay him at my return but he swore he would not be trifled with any longer and if she did not instantly pay him he would turn her into the street  imagine what a shock this behavior must be to one in her feeble condition she could make no answer but burst into tears come madam said the inhuman cannibal these arts will not pass on me give me either my money or value for it or by g  d you shall go out of this lodging  she gave him the keys of her drawers and desired him to take any movables he thought proper for his security and entreated for christian charity he would leave the room as his presence was baneful to her  this was all he aimed at so very modestly helped himself to every thing that was valuable and left the room  i returned soon after and was greatly surprised to see my poor mother trembling and pale so that she scarce seemed to live she faintly looked up at me and said my dear child that villain sheil has been the death of your mother i knew i had not long to exist but sure it was cruel to stab at half an hour of my frail life  i could scarce contain the various passions rising in my breast love pity horror and resentment reciprocally took place and i should doubtless have gone and taken his life but that filial duty withheld me from adding to my dear mothers affliction  i prevailed on her to take a little mulld wine after which she went to bed and i found on the table these lines which were the last she ever wrote my lord my savior and my god i bow to thy correcting rod nor will i murmur or complain though every limb be filled with pain though my weak tongue its aid denies and daylight wounds my wretched eyes   i sat up with her all this night during which she slept little for the heavy cough on her lungs but she retained her senses so well that she entertained me with many stories and repeated part of a poem written on mrs waller i believe madam said i she is a subscriber to you yes said she she paid the money to my father i now found her brain begin to grow defective which gave the most piercing anguish to my heart i had ever received  she dozd a little about four oclock in the morning and when she awoke told me she had a mighty agreeable dream which was that her father came to her in a mourning coach and six and told her he was very angry she had been so long ill and yet never sent for him whom she knew was always ready to assist her i am come continued he to bring you out of all your troubles and with that took her in his arms like a child and carried her away in the coach  my boding heart readily interpreted this dream as indeed did her own my dear said she you know the usage i have received from your father together with the knowledge i have that there are but few good clergymen to be found have ever made me declare that i would permit none of them to visit me in my last hours except dear doctor delany however since he is from town and the world would add impiety to all they have said of me if i dont have some one of them pray send for the curate of this parish i accordingly did and we all joined in prayer after which she fell into a good deal of discourse with him and they drank a glass of wine together he asked her if she forgave my father and she related the following story to him  there was an honest irish papist on his deathbed and when the priest was going to give him absolution he asked the sick man if he freely forgave all his enemies otherwise he could not administer that sacrament to him the man replied arah faith father i do forgive every one only teddy brenan that pounded my cow nay but said the priest you must forgive him also or i cannot absolve you well said he father if i die i will forgive him but if i live i never can will that do said the sick man arah faith said the priest if it will not do it must do and accordingly proceeded  so sir said she if i die i do forgive him and i wish the god whom he has offended may do the same but if i live mark you that master parson i never will  the clergyman departed and in about an hours time came a great long letter written i suppose at the desire of doctor sheil by some of the enthusiastical methodists of which dublin is now the chief receptacle in his majestys dominions it was written in their whining style declaring that she my mother was damned beyond redemption that she was now on the brink of hell and that not the blood of the lamb could intercept her  we both laughed at this fantastic contrivance and she only wished for strength to be able to answer it properly but alas that she never had  this day she retained her senses tolerably till evening when she began to talk incoherently i sat up till four in the morning at which time i grew very heavy what said she cannot you watch and pray a moment till this bitter cup passes from me a moment and i shall be no more come said she kneel down and take my blessing and the last adieu with a heart rent in twain i complied and she laid her hand on my head and said very devoutly the god of abraham isaac and jacob bless you the father the son and holy ghost protect and guard you and bring you safe to everlasting peace where i go a little before you for surely my dear child i believe through christ i shall be happy hereafter  the words made so deep an impression on my soul that i could not help repeating them and i do it more particularly because some people have been cruel enough to say she died an atheist but surely every person who examines her writings will find that she was a sincere believer in the doctrines of christianity as taught by the church of england the perpetual benefit of which i hope she now enjoys i remember in the beginning of her illness she called me to her and said i have a thing to request and you must by no means deny me but promise on your life your honor and your soul to perform it i told her as i had not often disobeyed her she need not be so particular in charging me it is this said she in a few days you will lose your poor little mother and as you know i have no money your father undoubtedly will bury me and perhaps may propose putting my remains in his family burial place but if you suffer that you have my heavy curse nay if it is possible i will come from the grave to resent it lay me by my dear father and let our kindred ashes mingle together for were i put in the ground with your father she and her father are buried in st annes church dawsonstreet the miracle of thebes would be renewed and the dividing flames burn different ways these were her very words now said she if ever you grow rich erect a little square marble stone over me and let this inscription be on it here lies near the body of her honored father john vanlewen m d the mortal part of mrs laetitia pilkington whose spirit hopes for that peace through the infinite merit of christ which a cruel and merciless world never afforded her  i sincerely promised to obey her injunction but to return  between five and six her breath grew short and her eyesight failed her i went and embracing her hand which was now almost lifeless asked her if she knew me yes said she you are my eldest son come from the college for my blessing you might have called before but god bless you it seemed as if her not being permitted to see him disturbed her last moments she then desired me to kneel down and pray by her which i did still keeping her hand in mine i found it grow cold and heavy and looking up just saw her expire with a sigh  i now beheld the most tender and endearing mother departed from me my only prop and succor gone while i saw myself ready to be exposed to all the malice of fortune i too well before experienced the obdurate temper of my father to hope any favor from him however summoning up all my philosophy and reposing my entire confidence in divine providence i left that scene of sorrow and lamentation and retired to take a little repose  i had some few days before this secured all my mothers manuscripts in the hands of a friend which was very fortunate for me since the moment old sheil heard she was dead he ran into the dining room and secured every thing he could lay hands on after which he went to inform my father of the long wished and joyful news he could scarce credit it at first but when the pious mr sheil assured him on the word of a christian that he spoke truth my father with great composure said it had been well for her to have died some years ago old sheil assured him that he believed she would not have died this bout but for the fright he gave her in her sickness for which kind office my father could not but thank him  he gave immediate orders for her funeral which you may depend on it was not profuse he allowed her however a decent oak coffin and shroud and the nursekeeper told me that sheil was so unparalleled a wretch that she could scarce keep him out of the room while she stripped the corpse which the moment she had done and put her shroud on he came and took the linen in which she died and secured that also  when i arose in the morning the old hypocrite asked me to breakfast with him and endeavored to comfort me by saying my father was too good a christian to let me want and that as the cause of his anger to me was now removed by the death of my mother the effect would undoubtedly cease  i told him i expected nothing from him nor should i though infinitely distressed make any application to him that nature instructed me to love and protect my mother whose cause my duty prompted me to espouse of which i could not be ashamed since i would do it were it to be done again  he said i ought to submit to my father and write to him and said he those papers and letters you have send them to him which will prove your respect and i will engage to mediate matters so well between you that he shall allow you twenty pounds a year though he will not see you  as i am too apt to be credulous had any person but this man whom my soul abhorred made such overtures i should have thought there was something in it but if the harmony of angels proceeded from his lips whom i looked on as the murderer of my dear mother it would to me be hateful as the hissing of serpents  however i listened to him and answered that those papers would certainly obtain money for me and promises were often broke that as to twenty pounds a year my father would as soon give twenty of his teeth but if the officious mr sheil would prevail on my father to give me fifty pounds i would not only resign them but would go to some part of the world where he should never hear of me  the latter part of this my father would readily agree to nay have given me his blessing at my departure but not a word of the nine and forty pieces indeed another pious divine offered me a sum of money to go to america which because i did not consent to he has since utterly rejected me but a little time will show the world his motives for that and open a very unexpected scene to the public and though i have not kept my promise to him in making the affair known before now yet i take this opportunity of informing his reverence that i have not forgot him  in short the doctor  sheil i mean went to my father and told my conditions but he only laughed and said i had not my mothers genius and must quickly fall into contempt therefore he very fairly set me at defiance and should i dare to print any thing against him he had interest enough to send me over the water i am sorry for the disagreeable necessity i am under of speaking or writing any thing to displease him but facts may be related i hope without offense  the next day mr faulkner inserted the following paragraph in his paper  yesterday morning died mrs letitia pilkington and the author of pues occurrences one of the worst papers published there i suppose by my fathers direction inserted a very false and scandalous paragraph while mr esdall who is a gentleman of known worth and integrity published a genteel encomium on her  a few days after i wrote the following little piece which as it was almost my first attempt in rhyme and on so particular a subject i hope the readers will pardon me for introducing it here on the death of my beloved mother and shall no mournful elegiac lay thy matchless worth and excellence display from me at least it is but a poor amends thou tenderest mother and thou best of friends while from my eyes the streaming sorrows run accept this tribute from thy darling son who taught by thee in melting numbers tells what agonizing pain his bosom swells what dreadful anguish preys upon his mind that thou art fled and he remains behind pleased if with you he might ascend the sky to the bright regions of felicity but here no joy no comfort no delight can charm his fancy or divert his sight will thou from neverfading bliss descend me from the storms of fortune to defend midst the rude strokes of adverse fate protect or in sweet visions all my ways direct alas too many blessings wait on thee to know one anxious tender pang for me yet sure the pure celestial joys above cannot extirpate thy maternal love which with a care description that surpast defended me from each untimely blast raised me to knowledge in each polished art refined my manners and improved my heart taught me from pleasing sacred truths to know the source from whence perpetual mercies flow then to the throne of neverdying worth taught me to pour my supplications forth may that transcendant power which called you hence be still my shield my refuge and defense till the grim tyrant kindly ends my pain and we enraptured meet in heaven again   i never communicated these lines to any one and now transcribe them only from my memory  since by writing this little account i have obtained the honor of speaking to the public it gives me an opportunity of saying something in favor of myself who i am convinced have been misrepresented to them and for which i hope i shall be excused as selfpreservation is the first law of nature there are many persons of some note in life who have on hearing me mentioned cried oh horrid dog shocking fellow etc pray gentlemen and ladies for what where are my accusers let them name the particular crimes for which i deserve those epithets or else not mention me at all  my lord stafford i think is the only instance which english history furnishes us with of a person being condemned for accumulated treason nay even he had a fair hearing for his life but these people are for condemning me unheard for no particular fault only that such and such people say so and so  a consciousness of this has made me resolve to write my own life by which means only i shall have a power of setting things in a clear light and of adjusting many present ambiguities and though i confess the public are burdened with things of this kind already many of which have no tendency to reform the manners of the age but rather vitiate them yet i flatter myself among the variety of real incidents and whimsical revolutions i have met with they may find as well entertainment as matter to moralize on  as i do by no means assume the name of a writer so the public may be assured i shall never attempt satyr if my betters have faults that is no affair of mine i am to pursue my own story a man who cannot put up with a tweak by the nose and a foot in the rump is not fit to live in this fashionable world i therefore assure the public before hand that i will be quite passive and though i name the error not the man by which manner of proceeding it is not improbable that by the time i am fourscore i may have an annuity of forty pounds a year upon the hopes of which i may reasonably subsist and keep up my spirits and in this i strictly follow the advice of a certain great man in ireland whose place of abode is not remote from the phenixpark and whose acquirements have justly raised him from obscurity to opulence his extensive plans in building have excited an universal admiration of his taste in architecture this worthy person i applied to after the death of my mother and informed him that i was possessed of some letters which he had in her lifetime been pleased to honor her with and that as her papers would undoubtedly fall into the hands of a printer i thought proper lest the publication of them might be offensive to him to give him this information  he sent his compliments by the messenger and desired to see me the next morning i accordingly waited on him and though my circumstances were not in the flow yet in order to convince him that i had no lucrative motive in addressing him i put the letters under a cover and sent them in before me  i was then introduced to his presence he received me with the utmost good manners desiring me to sit young man said he i have had a letter from you lately concerning some writings of mine to your mother she was a lady whom i regarded on account of her father and family whom i well knew and therefore i corresponded with and assisted her my letters you have here sent me and young man i will keep them and will give you a piece of advice better than gold if you will follow it  there has been lately at my house his g  ce the p  te  and several other persons of the most eminent stations in this kingdom and discoursing of your mothers writings introduced you and it was said that you had taken the liberty to write to several great men very much in the style of your mother they imagined when she was dead they should have heard no more of the matter but you seemed to keep her spirit alive now young man said he consider you are not a woman from whom even a blow cannot hurt honor we tolerated those things in her which in you would be culpable in the highest degree in short if you have any talents as i am told you have apply them to make friends instead of troubling your head about the follies of mankind find out their virtues and make that your theme indeed sir that said i will be a difficult matter in short sir continued he if you do not apply your genius according to the will of your superiors care will be taken to send you out of the kingdom before you are aware of it  i thanked him sincerely for his admonition which i determined from that moment to establish as my principle and on my return through the park upon examining the affair found it more rational to suppose that i should live by writing panygeric than satyr i resolved to try the experiment and at the same time determined to bestow random praise no matter to me though the person i addressed was tainted with the most diabolical vices i was to form the supposed virtues and graces from my own copious idea the first i exerted my talent on was the son of a bashaw then resident in these dominions and one whose wise interposition in the s  te matters of that kingdom have made him so much the darling of the grateful people and so far raised envy on this side the water that on his return instead of acclamations he is accosted with sneers and hisses wherever he appears while he conscious of his innate worth sheds a contemptuous smile on the senseless idiots who are weak enough to censure his superior abilities  i remembered to have heard him receive the applause of the senate house for telling mr s  r that as the season was far advanced and the gentlemen desirous of returning to their seats he thought it best to p  ge the p  t till april ensuing  this sublime piece of elocution was matter enough for me who from my present system you will allow was a professed sycophant i accordingly wrote some lines on the occasion which were not of consequence enough to subsist till this time therefore cannot be here recited i waited on his l  p and put them into his hand as he stepped into his chariot he received them and drove off the next morning i waited at the same place till he was going out and had the honor of a gracious smile upon which i lived elegantly that day the succeeding morning i received what a familiar nod upon which i subsisted tollerably till five that afternoon at that time indeed some extraordinary emotion in my stomach gave me to understand that nods and smiles though conferred by the sons of bashaws will not fill the belly  the indifferent success of my first enterprise made me almost determine never to attempt any thing more in that way though an affair of like nature which happened some time before might if i had common sense have been sufficient to deter me  as i was walking one day pensive and pennyless through henrystreet i saw some footmen and chairmen with white gloves and cockades and on enquiring the occasion was told that l  d h  th was that day married to miss k  g i immediately ran to a coffeehouse called for pen ink and paper and wrote a flaming epithalamium which i as suddenly dispatched resolving to have the start of all grubstreet his l  dship came out and told the messenger that when mr pilkington wrote better verses he would send him a reward  i was at this time in a window opposite to his lordship who saw the man come over and deliver me the answer i took a pen and before his face wrote extempore the following truth to the right hon the lord h  th in a coffeehouse hurried and pressed by my fate i wrote a few lines to get something to eat perhaps though the subject a dunce might inspire the want of subsistence has slackened my fire but if your kind lordship that want will supply no man shall write faster nor better than i   his lordship sent word it was very well it may be so thought i but faith i found it very ill  i could not avoid repeating the story in some companies i after fell into and whether they resented the reception i met or had some former pique to that n  n i shall not pretend to say but shortly after the following epigram was handed about when in proper terms we dullness would cloth we say you are as dull as the hill that is in h  th it is frequent in dublin to say you are as stupid as the hill of hoath  but would you give dullness the force of record say that every thing stupid resembles my l  d i should be sorry by producing these pieces to be thought to harbor the least resentment for the fate of my marriage poem the judgment of a p  r must ever be superior to that of the insect called a scribbler whose views extend no farther than a dinner or a shilling and i only relate these little anecdotes to show that i am quite incapable of resenting any thing my superiors are pleased to do  as this is the first time i have been blessed with an opportunity of addressing the polite world i find myself much inclined to prate though i already begin to fear i shall be censured for this impertinent intrusion where i am an entire stranger yet as i have got so far and my publisher who is a man of real taste and distinguished abilities neither of which my printer is destitute of as they i say have not yet rejected any part of this appendix as nonsense i have a strange inclication to venture upon a page or two more  i remember to have seen amongst my mothers papers an advertisement which she intended to have published in london and as it contains some humor i here recite it as well as i can recollect since it is become customary with every person to advertise the talents they either in reality or imagination possess i have been told i have a stock on my hands which is of no manner of use to me and having sold every thing but the gift of god to me if any simon will purchase i will dispose of it as follows  if any illiterate divine from cambridge or oxford has a mind to show his parts in a london pulpit let him repair to me and he shall have a sermon not stolen from barrow tillotson or other eminent preachers as is frequently the practice with those who have sense enough to do it but firenew from the mint if any painter has a mind to commence bard without wit and join the sister arts i also will assist him if any author wants a copy of commendatory verses to prefix to his work or a flattering dedication to a worthless great man any poor person a memorial or petition properly calculated to dissolve the walls of stone and flint which invirn the hearts of rich men p  tes in particular any printseller lines to put under his humorous comic or serious representations any player an occasional prologue or epilogue any beau a handsome billetdoux from a fair incognita any old maid a copy of verses in her praise any lady of high dress and low quality such as are generally the ladies of the town an amorous melting delicate epistle any projector a paragraph in praise of his scheme any extravagant prodigal a letter of recantation to his honored father any minister of st  te an apology for his conduct which those gentlemen frequently want any undertaker a funeral elegy or any stonecutter an epitaph or in short any thing in the poetical way shall be dispatched in the most private easy and genteel manner by applying to me and that at the most reasonable rates    i think this advertisement may seriously now serve for me since i find i have no means of subsisting but by a small smattering of wit which is somehow inherent to me to which i do assure the readers nothing but necessity could make me have recourse i too well know that the greatest geniuss in that way have been scarce able to keep a coat to their backs therefore if some generous noble or humane person would bestow on me a small annuity which might barely set me above want i would resign all pretensions to the pen into the hands of those who by education and native endowments are better qualified to use it some persons of rank who are inclined to banter tell me they would by no means deprive the world of their entertainment by giving me a provision but if they will please to consider that one leisurewellfinished line is of more importance than volumes written in a hurry they will be of another mind if the great mr dryden had been possessed of an easy affluent fortune his works which are now almost buried in oblivion would have been had in much greater esteem than they are since it is impossible to think but a person of so extensive a capacity must at one time or other have produced something excellent  and since i have said so much one thing more truth gratitude and honor compels me to say which is in relation to mr james worsdale so often mentioned in these memoirs i am sorry i am obliged to confess that i think my mother carried her resentment too far in describing the character of this gentleman but all persons who have any superior qualification have generally some imperfection adequate to it which is done by providence to show us that none are perfect on earth thus we see an apollo in music a swine in his appetite thus swift unrivaled in wit was a slave to peevishness and ill temper which obscured his merit in the most social hour and my mother who possessed a pretty manner of writing was apt to fall too hard on those whom she imagined herself injured by  however i am convinced mr worsdale never did nor intended injury to her or any other person as he is goodnatured to a fault and as he has said himself anxious to gain but not to keep his pelf a friend to every creature but himself and this is a truth that i can assert having lived some years in his house which was truly hospitable to every indigent person that fell in his knowledge but particularly such as had any pretensions to merit  what my mother has said of him proceeded from some little pique and therefore i hope people who read it will only laugh at her humor but not seriously reflect on it to the disadvantage of a person who is incapable of acting but with honor justice and integrity which will be more fully in my power to demonstrate in the little account i intend to give of my own life  and though it would exceed the small limits i am prescribed to apologize to every particular person pointed at in this volume yet i hope they will be humane enough to harbor no resentment against me for any thing it contains since i have before specified the necessity i was under of publishing it and as many characters are there of which i am really ignorant so it would be impossible to break in upon the connection of one part with another by making alterations or leaving any part out  there were some persons whom my mother was highly obliged to and to whom had she lived to complete this work she would have returned her acknowledgments publicly one of them was the earl of clanrickarde a nobleman of most illustrious descent and one who conspicuously retains the united virtues of his ancestors my mother having wrote his lordship a letter for a subscription he sent her in return a most polite epistle which i have now the honor to possess in which his lordship promised shortly to favor her with a visit and in some time he came after having sat about half an hour chatting he told her he had promised to subscribe to her works but that he imagined a poem in her praise written by himself would be of infinitely more service to her upon which he delivered her a sheet of paper and she really believing him serious was about to open it pardon me madam said my lord you must not read my verses while i am present or you will offend my modesty she laid the paper down and shortly after my lord took has leave when she opened it she found a draft on dillon and company for twenty pounds i hope i shall obtain his lordships forgiveness for the freedom i here take of mentioning his name but i think such actions and such alone compose his life ought not to be obscured and though doubtless this is but a trivial instance of the munificence and honor of that worthy nobleman yet as my mother was an entire stranger and that his lordship did it purely in compassion to her sufferings and regard to her talents she ever esteemed both the gift and the manner it was given in as the genteelest thing that could possibly be done and as she did not survive to speak her sentiments on that occasion i hope i shall be pardoned for attempting it  finis
