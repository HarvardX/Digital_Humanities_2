letters of the late rev mr laurence stern to his most intimate friends  with a fragment in the manner of rabelais  to which are prefixed memoirs of his life and family written by himself and published by his daughter mrs medalle  in three volumes  vol iii  london printed for t becket the corner of the adelphi in the strand       letters letter lxxviii to miss s bond street april        this letter my dear lydia will distress thy good heart for from the beginning thou will perceive no entertaining strokes of humor in it  i cannot be cheerful when a thousand melancholy ideas surround me  i have met with a loss of near fifty pounds which i was taken in for in an extraordinary manner  but what is that loss in comparison of one i may experience  friendship is the balm and cordial of life and without it it is a heavy load not worth sustaining  i am unhappy  thy mother and thyself at a distance from me and what can compensate for such a destitution  for gods sake persuade her to come and fix in england for life is too short to waste in separation  and whilst she lives in one country and i in another many people will suppose it proceeds from choice  besides i want thee near me thou child and darling of my heart  i am in a melancholy mood and my lydias eyes will smart with weeping when i tell her the cause that now affects me  i am apprehensive the dear friend i mentioned in my last letter is going into a decline  i was with her two days ago and i never beheld a being so altered  she has a tender frame and looks like a drooping lily for the roses are fled from her cheeks  i can never see or talk to this incomparable woman without bursting into tears  i have a thousand obligations to her and i owe her more than her whole sex if not all the world put together  she has a delicacy in her way of thinking that few possess  our conversations are of the most interesting nature and she talks to me of quitting this world with more composure than others think of living in it  i have wrote an epitaph of which i send thee a copy  it is expressive of her modest worth  but may heaven restore her and may she live to write mine  columns and labored urns but vainly show an idle scene of decorated woe the sweet companion and the friend sincere need no mechanic help to force the tear in heart felt numbers never meant to shine twill flow eternal over a hearse like thine twill flow whilst gentle goodness has one friend or kindred tempers have a tear to lend say all that is kind of me to thy mother and believe me my lydia that i love thee most truly  so adieu  i am what i ever was and hope ever shall be thy  affectionate father l s as to mr  by your description he is a fat fool i beg you will not give up your time to such a being  send me some batons pour les dents  there are none good here    letter lxxix to mr and mrs j old bondstreet april         i am sincerely affected my dear mr and mrs j  by your friendly enquiry and the interest you are so good to take in my health god knows i am not able to give a good account of myself having passed a bad night in much feverish agitation  my physician ordered me to bed and to keep therein till some favorable change  i fell ill the moment i got to my lodgings  he says it is owing to my taking jamess powder and venturing out on so cold a day as sunday  but he is mistaken for i am certain whatever bears that name must have efficacy with me  i was bled yesterday and again to day and have been almost dead but this friendly enquiry from gerrardstreet has poured balm into what blood i have left  i hope still and next to the sense of what i owe my friends it shall be the last pleasurable sensation i will part with  if i continue mending it will yet be some time before i shall have strength enough to get out in a carriage  my first visit will be a visit of true gratitude  i leave my kind friends to guess where  a thousand blessings go along with this and may heaven preserve you both  adieu my dear sir and dear lady  i am your ever obliged l stern  letter lxxx to the earl of  old bondstreet may        my lord i was yesterday taking leave of all the town with an intention of leaving it this day but i am detained by the kindness of lord and lady s  who have made a party to dine and sup on my account  i am impatient to set out for my solitude for there the mind gains strength and learns to lean upon herself  in the world it seeks or accepts of a few treacherous supports  the feigned compassion of one  the flattery of a second  the civilities of a third  the friendship of a fourth  they all deceive and bring the mind back to where mine is retreating to retirement reflection and books my departure is fixed for tomorrow morning but i could not think of quitting a place where i have received such numberless and unmerited civilities from your lordship without returning my most grateful thanks as well as my hearty acknowledgments for your friendly enquiry from bath illness my lord has occasioned my silence  death knocked at my door but i would not admit him  the call was both unexpected and unpleasant  and i am seriously worn down to a shadow  and still very weak but weak as i am i have as whimsical a story to tell you as ever befell one of my family  shandys nose his name his sash window are fools to it  it will serve at least to amuse you  the injury i did myself last month in catching cold upon jamess powder  fell you must know upon the worst part it could  the most painful and most dangerous of any in the human body it was on this crisis i called in an able surgeon and with him an able physician both my friends to inspect my disaster  it is a venereal case cried my two scientific friends  it is impossible however to be that replied i  for i have had no commerce whatever with the sex not even with my wife added i these fifteen years  you are however my good friend said the surgeon or there is no such case in the world  what the devil said i without knowing woman  we will not reason about it said the physician but you must undergo a course of mercury  i will lose my life first said i  and trust to nature to time or at the worst to death  so i put an end with some indignation to the conference  and determined to bear all the torments i underwent and ten times more rather than submit to be treated like a sinner in a point where i had acted like a saint  now as the father of mischief would have it who has no pleasure like that of dishonouring the righteous it so fell out that from the moment i dismissed my doctors my pains began to rage with a violence not to be expressed or supported every hour became more intolerable  i was got to bed cried out and raved the whole night and was got up so near dead that my friends insisted upon my sending again for my physician and surgeon i told them upon the word of a man of honor they were both mistaken as to my case  but though they had reasoned wrong they might act right but that sharp as my sufferings were i felt them not so sharp as the imputation which a venereal treatment of my case laid me under  they answered that these taints of the blood laid dormant twenty years but they would not reason with me in a point wherein i was so delicate but would do all the office for which they were called in namely to put an end to my torment which otherwise would put an end to me  and so have i been compelled to surrender myself  and thus my dear lord has your poor friend with all his sensibilities been suffering the chastisement of the grossest sensualist  was it not as ridiculous an embarrassment as ever yoricks spirit was involved in  nothing but the purest conscience of innocence could have tempted me to write this story to my wife which by the bye would make no bad anecdote in tristram shandys life  i have mentioned it in my journal to mrs  in some repects there is no difference between my wife and herself  when they fare alike neither can reasonably complain  i have just received letters from france with some hints that mrs stern and my lydia are coming to england to pay me a visit  if your time is not better employed yorick flatters himself he shall receive a letter from your lordship en attendant i am with the greatest regard  my lord your lordships most faithful humble servant l stern  letter lxxxii to j d  n esquire old bondstreet friday morning i was going my dear d  n to bed before i received your kind enquiry and now my chaise stands at my door to take and convey this poor body to its legal settlement  i am ill very ill  i languish most affectingly  i am sick both soul and body  it is a cordial to me to hear it is different with you  no man interests himself more in your happiness and i am glad you are in so fair a road to it  enjoy it long my d whilst i  no matter what  but my feelings are too nice for the world i live in  things will mend  i dined yesterday with lord and lady s  we talked much of you and your goings on for every one knows why sunbury hill is so pleasant a situation  you rogue you have locked up my boots  and i go bootless home  and fear i shall go bootless all my life  adieu gentlest and best of souls  adieu  i am yours most affectionately l stern  letter lxxxiii to j h s esquire newark monday ten oclock in the morn my dear cousin i have got conveyed thus far like a bale of cadaverous goods consigned to pluto and company  lying in the bottom of my chaise most of the rout upon a large pillow which i had the prevoyance to purchase before i set out  i am worn out  but press on to barnby moor to night and if possible to york the next  i know not what is the matter with me  but some derangement presses hard upon this machine  still i think it will not be overset this bout  my love to g  we shall all meet from the east and from the south and as at the last be happy together  my kind respects to a few  i am dear h  truly yours l stern  letter lxxxiv from ignatius sancho to mr stern reverend sir it would be an insult on your humanity or perhaps look like it to apologize for the liberty i am taking  i am one of those people whom the vulgar and illiberal call negroes  the first part of my life was rather unlucky as i was placed in a family who judged ignorance the best and only security for obedience  a little reading and writing i got by unwearied application  the latter part of my life has been through gods blessing truly fortunate  having spent it in the service of one of the best and greatest families in the kingdom  my chief pleasure has been books  philanthropy i adore  how very much good sir am i amongst millions indebted to you for the character of your amiable uncle toby  i declare i would walk ten miles in the dogdays to shake hands with the honest corporal  your sermons have touched me to the heart and i hope have amended it which brings me to the point  in your tenth discourse page seventyeight in the second volume  is this very affecting passage  consider how great a part of our species in all ages down to this  have been trod under the feet of cruel and capricious tyrants who would neither hear their cries nor pity their distresses  consider slavery  what it is  how bitter a draught  and how many millions are made to drink of it  of all my favorite authors not one has drawn a tear in favor of my miserable black brethren  excepting yourself and the humane author of sir geo ellison  i think you will forgive me i am sure you will applaud me for beseeching you to give one half hours attention to slavery as it is at this day practiced in our west indies  that subject handled in your striking manner would ease the yoke perhaps of many  but if only of one  gracious god what a feast to a benevolent heart and sure i am you are an epicurean in acts of charity  you who are universally read and as universally admired  you could not fail  dear sir think in me you behold the uplifted hands of thousands of my brother moors grief you pathetically observe is eloquent figure to yourself their attitudes hear their supplicating addresses  alas you cannot refuse  humanity must comply  in which hope i beg permission to subscribe myself  reverend sir etc l s  letter lxxxv from mr stern to ignatius sancho coxwould july         there is a strange coincidence sancho in the little events as well as in the great ones of this world for i had been writing a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negrogirl and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it when your letter of recommendation in behalf of so many of her brethren and sisters came to me  but why her brethren or yours sancho any more than mine it is by the finest tints and most insensible gradations that nature descends from the fairest face about st jamess to the sootiest complexion in africa  at which tint of these is it that the ties of blood are to cease and how many shades must we descend lower still in the scale ere mercy is to vanish with them but it is no uncommon thing my good sancho for one half of the world to use the other half of it like brutes and then endeavor to make em so  for my own part i never look westward when i am in a pensive mood at least but i think of the burdens which our brothers and sisters are there carrying and could i ease their shoulders from one ounce of them i declare i would set out this hour upon a pilgrimage to mecca for their sakes  which by the bye sancho exceeds your walk of ten miles in about the same proportion that a visit of humanity should one of mere form  however if you meant my uncle toby more he is your debtor  if i can weave the tale i have wrote into the work i am about  it is at the service of the afflicted  and a much greater matter for in serious truth it casts a sad shade upon the world that so great a part of it are and have been so long bound in chains of darkness and in chains of misery and i cannot but both respect and felicitate you that by so much laudable diligence you have broke the one  and that by falling into the hands of so good and merciful a family providence has rescued you from the other  and so goodhearted sancho adieu and believe me i will not forget your letter  yours l stern  letter lxxxvi to ignatius sancho bond street saturday i was very sorry my good sancho that i was not at home to return my compliments by you for the great courtesy of the duke of m  g  s family to me in honoring my list of subscribers with their names  for which i bear them all thanks  but you have something to add sancho to what i owe your good will also on this account and that is to send me the subscription money which i find a necessity of duning my best friends for before i leave town  to avoid the perplexities of both keeping pecuniary accounts for which i have very slender talents and collecting them for which i have neither strength of body or mind and so good sancho dun the duke of m the duchess of m and lord m for their subscriptions and lay the sin and money with it too at my door  i wish so good a family every blessing they merit along with my humblest compliments you know sancho that i am your friend and wellwisher  l stern ps i leave town on friday morning  and should on thursday but that i stay to dine with lord and lady s     letter lxxxvii to ignatius sancho coxwould june  0 i must acknowledge the courtesy of my good friend sanchos letter were i ten times busier than i am and must thank him too for the many expressions of his good will and good opinion  it is all affectation to say a man is not gratified with being praised  we only want it to be sincere  and then it will be taken sancho as kindly as yours i left town very poorly  and with an idea i was taking leave of it for ever  but good air a quiet retreat and quiet reflections along with it with an ass to milk and another to ride out upon if i choose it all together do wonders  i shall live this year at least i hope be it but to give the world before i quit it as good impressions of me as you have sancho i would only covenant for just so much health and spirits as are sufficient to carry my pen through the task i have set it this summer  but i am a resigned being sancho and take health and sickness as i do light and darkness or the vicissitudes of seasons  that is just as it pleases god to send them  and accommodate myself to their periodical returns as well as i can  only taking care whatever befalls me in this silly world  not to lose my temper at it  this i believe friend sancho to be the truest philosophy  for this we must be indebted to ourselves but not to our fortunes  farewell  i hope you will not forget your custom of giving me a call at my lodgings next winter  in the mean time i am very cordially  my honest friend sancho yours l stern  letter lxxxviii to mrs h coxwould october         ever since my dear h wrote me word she was mine more than ever woman was i have been racking my memory to inform me where it was that you and i had that affair together  people think that i have had many some in body some in mind but as i told you before you have had me more than any woman  therefore you must have had me h  both in mind and in body  now i cannot recollect where it was nor exactly when  it could not be the lady in bondstreet or grosvenorstreet or  square or pall mall  we shall make it out h when we meet  i impatiently long for it  it is no

of russia i could not write to you or speak of you under any other relation  i felicitate you i dont say how much because i cannot  i always had something like a kind of revelation within me which pointed out this track for you in which you are so happily advanced  it was not only my wishes for you which were ever ardent enough to impose upon a visionary brain but i thought i actually saw you just where you now are  and that is just my dear macartney where you should be  i should long long ago have acknowledged the kindness of a letter of yours from petersbourg but hearing daily accounts you was leaving it  this is the first time i knew well where my thanks would find you  how they will find you i know well  that is  the same i ever knew you in three weeks i shall kiss your hand  and sooner if i can finish my sentimental journey  the duce take all sentiments i wish there was not one in the world  my wife is come to pay me a sentimental visit as far as from avignon  and the politesses arising from such a proof of her urbanity has robbed me of a months writing or i had been in town now  i am going to lyin being at christmas at my full reckoning  and unless what i shall bring forth is not pressed to death by these devils of printers i shall have the honor of presenting to you a couple of as clean brats as ever chaste brain conceived  they are frolicksome too mais

letter greeted me with the seal of friendship and most cordially do i thank you for so kind a proof of your good will  i was truly anxious to hear of the recovery of my sentimental friend  but i would not write to enquire after her unless i could have sent her the testimony without the tax for even howdyes to invalids or those that have lately been so either call to mind what is past or what may return  at least i find it so  i am as happy as a prince at coxwould  and i wish you could see in how princely a manner i live  it is a land of plenty i sit down alone to venison fish and wild fowl or a couple of fowls or ducks with curds and strawberries and cream and all the simple plenty which a rich valley under hamilton hills can produce  with a clean cloth on my table  and a bottle of wine on my right hand to drink your health i have a hundred hens and chickens about my yard  and not a parishioner catches a hare or a rabbet or a trout but he brings it as an offering to me if solitude would cure a lovesick heart i would give you an invitation  but absence and time lessen no attachment which virtue inspires  i am in high spirits  care never enters this cottage  i take the air every day in my post chaise with my two long taild horses  they turn out good ones and as to myself i think i am better upon the whole for the medicines and regimen i submitted to in town  may you dear l  want

cannot forgive you le for your folly in saying you intend to get introduced to the  i despise them and i shall hold your understanding much cheaper than i now do if you persist in a resolution so unworthy of you  i suppose mrs j  telling you they were sensible is the ground work you go upon  by  they are not clever though what is commonly called wit may pass for literature on the other side of temple bar  you say mrs j  thinks them amiable  she judges too favorably but i have put a stop to her intentions of visiting them  they are bitter enemies of mine and i am even with them la bramine assured me they used their endeavors with her to break off her friendship with me for reasons i will not write but tell you  i said enough of them before she left england and though she yielded to me in every other point yet in this she obstinately persisted  strange infatuation  but i think i have effected my purpose by a falsity which yoricks friendship to the bramine can only justify  i wrote her word that the most amiable of women reiterated my request that she would not write to them i said too she had concealed many things for the sake of her peace of mind  when in fact l  e this was merely a child of my own brain made mrs j  s by adoption to enforce the argument i had before urged so strongly  do not mention this circumstance to mrs j  twould displease her  and i had no design in it but for the bramine to be a friend to herself  i ought now to be busy from sun rise to sun set for i have a book to write  a wife to receive  an estate to sell  a parish to superintend and what is worst of all a disquieted heart to reason with  these are continual calls upon me  i have received half a dozen letters to press me to join my friends at scarborough but i am at present deaf to them

with as much true gratitude as ever heart felt that i sit down to thank my dear friends mr and mrs j  for the continuation of their attention to me but for this last instance of their humanity and politeness to me i must ever be their debtor  i never can thank you enough my dear friends and yet i thank you from my soul  and for the single days happiness your goodness would have sent me i wish i could send you back thousands  i cannot but they will come of themselves  and so god bless you  i have had twenty times my pen in my hand since i came down to write one letter to you both in gerrardstreet  but i am a shy kind of a soul at the bottom and have a jealousy about troubling my friends especially about myself  i am now got perfectly well but was a month after my arrival in the country in but a poor state  my body has got the start and is at present more at ease than my mind  but this world is a school of trials and so heavens will be done  i hope you have both enjoyed all that i have wanted  and to complete your joy that your little lady flourishes like a vine at your table to which i hope to see her preferred by next winter  i am now beginning to be truly busy at my sentimental journey  the pains and sorrows of this life having retarded its progress  but i shall make up my leeway and overtake every body in a very short time   what can i send you that yorkshire

august        my dear friends mr and mrs j  are infinitely kind to me in sending now and then a letter to enquire after me  and to acquaint me how they are  you cannot conceive my dear lady how truly i bear a part in your illness  i wish mr j  would carry you to the south of france in pursuit of health  but why need i wish it when i know his affection will make him do that and ten times as much to prevent a return of those symptoms which alarmed him so much in the spring  your politeness and humanity is always contriving to treat me agreeably and what you promise next winter will be perfectly so  but you must get well  and your little dear girl must be of the party with her parents and friends to give it a relish  i am sure you show no partiality but what is natural and praiseworthy in behalf of your daughter but i wonder my friends will not find her a playfellow and i both hope and advise them not to venture along through this warfare of life without two strings at least to their bow  i had letters from france by last nights post by which by some fatality i find not one of my letters has reached mrs s  this gives me concern as it wears the aspect of unkindness which she by no means merits from me  my wife and dear girl are coming to pay me a visit for a few months i wish i may prevail with them to tarry longer  you must permit me dear mrs j to make my lydia known to you if i can prevail with my wife to come and spend a little time in london as she returns to france  i expect a small parcel  may i trouble you before you write next to send to my lodgings to ask if there is any thing directed to me that you can enclose under cover  i have but one excuse for this freedom which i am prompted to use from a persuasion that it is doing you pleasure to give you an opportunity of doing an obliging thing  and as to myself i rest satisfied for it is only scoring up another debt of thanks to the millions i owe you both already  receive a thousand and a thousand thanks yes and with them ten thousand friendly wishes for all you wish in this world  may my friend mr j continue blessed with good health and may his good lady get perfectly well there being no womans health or comfort i so ardently pray for  adieu my dear friends  believe me most truly and faithfully yours  l stern ps in elizas last letter dated from st jago she tells me as she does you that she is extremely ill  god protect her  by this time surely she has set foot upon dry land at madras  i heartily wish her well and if yorick was with her he would tell her so  but he is cut off from this by bodily absence  i am present with her in spirit however  but what is that you will say    letter xcvii to j h s esquire coxwould august         my dear h i am glad all has passed with so much amity inter te and filium marcumtuum and that madame has found grace in thy sight  all is well that ends well  and so much for moralizing upon it i wish you could or would take up your parable and prophecy as much good concerning me and my affairs  not one of my letters have got to mrs s  since the notification of her intentions which has a pitiful air on my side though i have wrote her six or seven  i imagine she will be here the latter end of september though i have no date for it but her impatience which having suffered by my supposed silence i am persuaded will make her fear the worst  if that is the case she will fly to england  a most natural conclusion  you did well to discontinue all commerce with jamess powder  as you are so well rejoice therefore and let your heart be merry  mine ought upon the same score  for i never have been so well since i left college  and should be a mavelous happy man but for some reflections which bow down my spirits  but if i live but even three or four years i will acquit myself with honor  and  no matter we will talk this over when we meet  if all ends as temperately as with you and that i find grace etc etc i will come and sing te deum or drink poculum elevatum or do any thing with you in the world  i should depend upon g  s critic upon my head as much as molieres old woman upon his comedies  when you do not want her society let it be carried into your bedchamber to flay her or clap it upon her bum  to  and give her my blessing as you do it   my postillion has set me aground for a week by one of my pistols bursting in his hand which he taking for granted to be quite shot off  he instantly fell upon his knees and said our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name at which like a good christian he stopped not remembering any more of it  the affair was not so bad as he at first thought for it has only bursten two of his fingers he says  i long to return to you but i sit here alone as solitary and sad as a tom cat which by the bye is all the company i keep  he follows me from the parlour to the kitchen into the garden and every place  i wish i had a dog  my daughter will bring me one  and so god be about you and strengthen your faith  i am affectionately dear cousin yours  l s my service to the c though they are from home and to panty    letter xcviii to mr and mrs j coxwould august         my dear friends i but copy your great civility to me in writing you word that i have this moment received another letter wrote eighteen days after the date of the last from st jago  if our poor friend could have wrote another letter to england you would in course have had it  but i fear from the circumstance of great hurry and bodily disorder in which she was when she dispatched this she might not have time  in case it has so fallen out i send you the contents of what i have received  and that is a melancholy history of herself and sufferings since they left st jago  continual and most violent rheumatism all the time  a fever brought on with fits and attended with delirium and every terrifying symptom  the recovery from this left her low and emaciated to a skeleton  i give you the pain of this detail with a bleeding heart knowing how much at the same time it will affect yours  the three or four last days of her journal leave us with hopes she will do well at last for she is more cheerful  and seems to be getting into better spirits and health will follow in course they have crossed the line  are much becalmed which with other delays she fears they will lose their passage to madrass  and be some months sooner for it at bombay  heaven protect her for she suffers much and with uncommon fortitude  she writes much to me about her dear friend mrs j  in her last packet  in truth my good lady she loves and honors you from her heart but if she did not i should not esteem her or wish her so well as i do  adieu my dear friends  you have few in the world more truly and cordially  yours l stern ps i have just received as a present from a man i shall ever love a most elegant gold snuff box fabricated for me at paris  it is not the first pledge i have received of his friendship  may i presume to enclose you a letter of chitchat which i shall write to eliza i know you will write yourself and my letter may have the honor to chaperon yours to india  they will neither of them be the worse received for going together in company but i fear they will get late in the year to their destined port as they go first to bengal    letter xcix to miss s  coxwould august         i am truly surprised my dear lydia that my last letter has not reached thy mother and thyself  it looks most unkind on my part after your having wrote me word of your mothers intention of coming to england that she has not received my letter to welcome you both  and though in that i said i wished you would defer your journey till march for before that time i should have published my sentimental work and should be in town to receive you  yet i will show you more real politesses than any you have met with in france as mine will come warm from the heart  i am sorry you are not here at the races but les fetes champetres of the marquis de sade have made you amends  i know b  very well and he is what in france would be called admirable  that would be but so so here  you are right  he studies nature more than any or rather most of the french comedians  if the empress of russia pays him and his wife a pension of twenty thousand livres a year i think he is very well off  the folly of staying till after twelve for supper  that you two excommunicated beings might have meat  his conscience would not let it be served before  surely the marquis thought you both being english could not be satisfied without it  i would have given not my gown and cassock for i have but one but my topaz ring to have seen the petits maitres et maitresses go to mass after having spent the night in dancing  as to my pleasures they are few in compass  my poor cat sits purring beside me  your lively french dog shall have his place on the other side of my fire  but if he is as devilish as when i last saw him i must tutor him for i will not have my cat abused  in short i will have nothing devilish about me  a combustion would spoil a sentimental thought  another thing i must desire  do not be alarmed  it is to throw all your rouge pots into the sorgue before you set out  i will have no rouge put on in england  and do not bewail them as   did her silver seringue or glyster equipage which she lost in a certain river  but take a wise resolution of doing without rouge  i have been three days ago bad again  with a spitting of blood  and that unfeeling brute  came and drew my curtains and with a voice like a trumpet hallood in my ear  z  ds what a fine kettle of fish have you brought yourself to mr s  in a faint voice i bad him leave me for comfort sure was never administered in so rough a manner  tell your mother i hope she will purchase what either of you may want at paris  it is an occasion not to be lost  so write to me from paris that i may come and meet you in my postchaise with my longtailed horses  and the moment you have both put your feet in it call it hereafter yours  adieu dear lydia  believe me what i ever shall be  your affectionate father l stern i think i shall not write to avignon any more but you will find one for you at paris  once more adieu    letter c to sir w september         my dear sir you are perhaps the drollest being in the universe  why do you banter me so about what i wrote to you  though i told you every morning i jumped into venuss lap meaning thereby the sea was you to infer from that that i leaped into the ladies beds afterward  the body guides you  the mind me  i have wrote the most whimsical letter to a lady that was ever read and talked of body and soul too  i said she had made me vain by saying she was mine more than ever woman was  but she is not the lady of bondstreet nor  square nor the lady who supped with me in bondstreet on scollopd oysters and other such things  nor did she ever go teteatete with me to salt hill  enough of such nonsense  the past is over  and i can justify myself unto myself  can you do as much  no faith  you can feel aye so can my cat when he hears a female caterwauling on the house top  but caterwauling disgusts me i had rather raise a gentle flame than have a different one raised in me  now i take heaven to witness after all this badinage my heart is innocent  and the sporting of my pen is equal just equal to what i did in my boyish days when i got astride of a stick and galloped away  the truth is this  that my pen governs me  not me my pen  you are much to blame if you dig for marle unless you are sure of it  i was once such a puppy myself as to pare and burn and had my labor for my pains and two hundred pounds out of pocket  curse on farming said i i will try if the pen will not succeed better than the spade  the following up of that affair i mean farming made me lose my temper and a cart load of turnips was i thought very dear at two hundred pounds   in all your operations may your own good sense guide you  bought experience is the devil  adieu adieu  believe me  yours most truly l stern  letter ci to the same coxwould sept         dear sir you are arrived at scarborough when all the world has left it  but you are an unaccountable being and so there is nothing more to be said on the matter  you wish me to come to scarborough and join you to read a work that is not yet finished  besides i have other things in my head  my wife will be here in three or four days and i must not be found straying in the wilderness  but i have been there  as for meeting you at bluits with all my heart  i will laugh and drink my barley water with you  as soon as i have greeted my wife and daughter and hired them a house at york i shall go to london where you generally are in spring  and then my sentimental journey will i dare say convince you that my feelings are from the heart and that that heart is not of the worst of molds  praised be god for my sensibility though it has often made me wretched yet i would not exchange it for all the pleasures the grossest sensualist ever felt  write to me the day you will be at york  it is ten to one but i may introduce you to my wife and daughter believe me  my good sir ever yours l stern  letter cii to mr p at paris york october        dear sir i have ordered my friend becket to advance for two months your account which my wife this day delivered  she is in raptures with all your civilities  this is to give you notice to draw upon your correspondent  and becket will deduct out of my publication  tomorrow morning i repair with her to coxwould and my lydia seems transported with the sight of me  nature dear p  breathes in all her composition and except a little vivacity  which is a fault in the world we live in  i am fully content with her mothers care of her  pardon this digression from business  but it is natural to speak of those we love  as to the subscriptions which your friendship has procured me i must have them to incorporate with my lists which are to be prefixed to the first volume  my wife and daughter join in millions of thanks  they will leave me the  st of december  adieu adieu  believe me  yours most truly l stern  letter ciii to mr and mrs j  coxwould october        i have suffered under a strong desire for above this fortnight to send a letter of enquiries after the health and the wellbeing of my dear friends mr and mrs j  and i do assure you both twas merely owing to a little modesty in my temper not to make my good will troublesome where i have so much and to those i never think of but with ideas of sensibility and obligation that i have refrained  good god to think i could be in town and not go the first step i made to gerrard street  my mind and body must be at sad variance with each other should it ever fall out that it is not both the first and last place also where i shall betake myself were it only to say god bless you  may you have every blessing he can send you it is a part of my litany where you will always have a place whilst i have a tongue to repeat it  and so you heard i had left scarborough which you would no more credit than the reasons assigned for it  i thank you for it kindly  though you have not told me what they were being a shrewd divine i think i can guess  i was ten days at scarborough in september and was hospitably entertained by one of the best of our bishops who as he kept house there pressed me to be with him  and his household consisted of a gentleman and two ladies  which with the good bishop and myself made so good a party that we kept much to ourselves  i made in this time a connection of great friendship with my mitred host who would gladly have taken me with him back to ireland  however we all left scarborough together and lay fifteen miles off where we kindly parted  now it was supposed and have since heard that i even went on with the party to london and this i suppose was the reason assigned for my being there  i dare say charity would add a little to the account and give out that twas on the score of one and perhaps both of the ladies  and i will excuse charity on that head for a heart disengaged could not well have done better  i have been hard writing ever since  and hope by christmas i shall be able to give a gentle rap at your door  and tell you how happy i am to see my two good friends  i assure you i spur on my pegasus more violently upon that account and am now determined not to draw bit till i have finished this sentimental journey  which i hope to lay at your feet as a small but a very honest testimony of the constant truth with which i am  my dear friends your ever obliged and grateful l stern ps my wife and daughter arrived here last night from france  my girl has returned an elegant accomplished little slut  my wife  but i hate to praise my wife  it is as much as decency will allow to praise my daughter  i suppose they will return next summer to france  they leave me in a month to reside at york for the winter  and i stay at coxwould till the first of january    letter civ to mrs f  coxwould friday dear madam i return you a thousand thanks for your obliging enquiry after me  i got down last summer very much worn out  and much worse at the end of my journey  i was forced to call at his graces house the archbishop of york to refresh myself a couple of days upon the road near doncaster  since i got home to quietness and temperance and good books and good hours i have mended  and am now very stout  and in a fortnights time shall perhaps be as well as you yourself could wish me  i have the pleasure to acquaint you that my wife and daughter are arrived from france  i shall be in town to greet my friends by the first of january  adieu dear madam  believe me  yours sincerely l stern  letter cv to mr and mrs j  coxwould november         forgive me dear mrs j  if i am troublesome in writing something bewixt a letter and a card to enquire after you and my good friend mr j  whom it is an age since i have heard a syllable of  i think so however and never more felt the want of a house i esteem so much as i do now when i can hear tidings of it so seldom  and have nothing to recompense my desires of seeing its kind possessors but the hopes before me of doing it by christmas  i long sadly to see you  and my friend mr j  i am still at coxwould  my wife and girl mrs medalle thinks an apology may be necessary for publishing this letter  the best she can offer is  that it was written by a fond parent whose commendations she is proud of to a very sincere friend here  she is a dear good creature  affectionate and most elegant in body and mind  she is all heaven could give me in a daughter  but like other blessings not given but lent for her mother loves france  and this dear part of me must be torn from my arms to follow her mother who seems inclined to establish her in france where she has had many advantageous offers  do not smile at my weakness when i say i dont wonder at it for she is as accomplished a slut as france can produce  you shall excuse all this  if you will not i desire mr j  to be my advocate  but i know i dont want one  with what pleasure shall i embrace your dear little pledge  who i hope to see every hour increasing in stature and in favor both with god and man  i kiss all your hands with a most devout and friendly heart  no man can wish you more good than your meager friend does  few so much for i am with infinite cordiality gratitude and honest affection  my dear mrs j  your ever faithful l stern ps my sentimental journey will please mrs j  and my lydia  i can answer for those two it is a subject which works well and suits the frame of mind i have been in for some time past  i told you my design in it was to teach us to love the world and our fellow creatures better than we do  so it runs most upon those gentler passions and affections which aid so much to it  adieu and may you and my worthy friend mr j  continue examples of the doctrine i teach    letter cvi to a l  e esquire coxwould november         you make yourself unhappy dear l  e by imaginary ills  which you might shun instead of putting yourself in the way of  would not any man in his senses fly from the object he adores and not waste his time and his health in increasing his misery by so vain a pursuit  the idol of your heart is one of ten thousand  the duke of  has long sighed in vain  and can you suppose a woman will listen to you that is proof against titles stars and red ribbands  her heart believe me l  e will not be taken in by fine men or fine speeches  if it should ever feel a preference it will choose an object for itself and it must be a singular character that can make an impression on such a being  she has a platonic way of thinking and knows love only by name  the natural reserve of her character which you complain of proceeds not from pride but from a superiority of understanding which makes her despise every man that turns himself into a fool  take my advice and pay your addresses to miss  she esteems you and time will wear off an attachment which has taken so deep a root in your heart  i pity you from my soul  but we are all born with passions which ebb and flow else they would play the devil with us to different objects  and the best advice i can give you l  e is to turn the tide of yours another way  i know not whether i shall write again while i stay at coxwould  i am in earnest at my sentimental work  and intend being in town soon after christmas  in the mean time adieu  let me hear from you and believe me dear l  yours etc l stern  letter cvii to the earl of  coxwould november         my lord it is with the greatest pleasure i take my pen to thank your lordship for your letter of enquiry about yorick  he has worn out both his spirits and body with the sentimental journey  it is true that an author must feel himself or his reader will not  but i have torn my whole frame into pieces by my feelings  i believe the brain stands as much in need of recruiting as the body  therefore i shall set out for town the twentieth of next month after having recruited myself a week at york  i might indeed solace myself with my wife who is come from france but in fact i have long been a sentimental being  whatever your lordship may think to the contrary  the world has imagined because i wrote tristram shandy that i was myself more shandean than i really ever was  it is a goodnatured world we live in and we are often painted in diverse colors according to the ideas each one frames in his head  a very agreeable lady arrived three years ago at york in her road to scarborough  i had the honor of being acquainted with her and was her chaperon  all the females were very inquisitive to know who she was  do not tell ladies it is a mistress my wife has recommended to me  nay moreover has sent her from france   i hope my book will please you my lord and then my labor will not be totally in vain if it is not thought a chaste book mercy on them that read it for they must have warm imaginations indeed  can your lordship forgive my not making this a longer epistle  in short i can but add this which you already know  that i am with gratitude and friendship  my lord your obedient faithful l stern if your lordship is in town in spring i should be happy if you became acquainted with my friends in gerrardstreet  you would esteem the husband and honor the wife  she is the reverse of most her sex  they have various pursuits  she but one  that of pleasing her husband     letter cviii to a l  e esquire coxwould december        dear l i said i would not perhaps write any more but it would be unkind not to reply to so interesting a letter as yours  i am certain you may depend upon lord  s promises  he will take care of you in the best manner he can and your knowledge of the world and of languages in particular will make you useful in any department  if his lordships scheme does not succeed leave the kingdom  go to the east or the west for traveling would be of infinite service to both your body and mind  but more of this when we meet  now to my own affairs  i have had an offer of exchanging two pieces of preferment i hold here for a living of three hundred and fifty pounds a year in surry about thirty miles from london and retaining coxwould and my prebendaryship  the country also is sweet  but i will not cannot come to any determination till i have consulted with you and my other friends  i have great offers too in ireland  the bishops of c  and r  are both my friends  but i have rejected every proposal unless mrs s  and my lydia could accompany me thither  i live for the sake of my girl and with her sweet light burden in my arms i could get up fast the hill of preferment if i chose it  but without my lydia if a mitre was offered me it would sit uneasy upon my brow  mrs s  s health is insupportable in england  she must return to france and justice and humanity forbid me to oppose it  i will allow her enough to live comfortably until she can rejoin me  my heart bleeds l  e when i think of parting with my child  twill be like the separation of soul and body  and equal to nothing but what passes at that tremendous moment and like it in one respect for she will be in one kingdom whilst i am in another  you will laugh at my weakness  but i cannot help it  for she is a dear disinterested girl  as a proof of it  when she left coxwould and i bad her adieu i pulled out my purse and offered her ten guineas for her private pleasures  her answer was pretty and affected me too much no my dear papa our expenses of coming from france may have straightened you  i would rather put an hundred guineas in your pocket than take ten out of it  i burst into tears  but why do i practice on your feelings  by dwelling on a subject that will touch your heart  it is too much melted already by its own sufferings l  e for me to add a pang or cause a single sigh  god bless you  i shall hope to greet you by newyearsday in perfect health  adieu my dear friend  i am most truly and cordially yours  l stern  letter cix to mr and mrs j york december         i was afraid that either mr or mrs j  or their little blossom was drooping  or that some of you were ill by not having the pleasure of a line from you and was thinking of writing again to enquire after you all  when i was cast down myself with a fever and bleeding at my lungs which had confined me to my room near three weeks  when i had the favor of yours which till today i have not been able to thank you both kindly for as i most cordially now do  as well as for all your professions and proofs of good will to me  i will not say i have not balanced accounts with you in this  all i know is that i honor and value you more than i do any good creatures upon earth  and that i could not wish your happiness and the success of whatever conduces to it more than i do was i your brother  but good god are we not all brothers and sisters who are friendly virtuous and good surely my dear friends my illness has been a sort of sympathy for your afflictions upon the score of your dear little one  i am worn down to a shadow  but as my fever has left me i set off the latter end of next week with my friend mr hall for town  i need not tell my friends in gerrardstreet i shall do myself the honor to visit them before either lord  or lord  etc etc  i thank you my dear friend for what you say so kindly about my daughter  it shows your good heart for as she is a stranger it is a free gift in you  but when she is known to you she shall win it fairly  but alas when this event is to happen is in the clouds  mrs s  has hired a house ready furnished at york till she returns to france and my lydia must not leave her   what a sad scratch of a letter  but i am weak my dear friends both in body and mind  so god bless you  you will see me enter like a ghost  so i tell you beforehand not to be frightened  i am my dear friends with the truest attachment and esteem ever yours  l stern  letter cx to lady p mount coffeehouse tuesday   oclock there is a strange mechanical effect produced in writing a billetdoux within a stonecast of the lady who engrosses the heart and soul of an inamorato  for this cause but mostly because i am to dine in this neighborhood have i tristram shandy come forth from my lodgings to a coffeehouse the nearest i could find to my dear lady  s house and have called for a sheet of gilt paper to try the truth of this article of my creed  now for it   o my dear lady  what a dishclout of a soul have thou made of me  i think by the bye this is a little too familiar an introduction for so unfamiliar a situation as i stand in with you  where heaven knows i am kept at a distance  and despair of getting one inch nearer you with all the steps and windings i can think of to recommend myself to you  would not any man in his senses run diametrically from you  and as far as his legs would carry him rather than thus causelessly foolishly and foolhardily expose himself afresh  and afresh where his heart and his reason tells him he shall be sure to come off loser if not totally undone  why would you tell me you would be glad to see me  does it give you pleasure to make me more unhappy  or does it add to your triumph that your eyes and lips have turned a man into a fool whom the rest of the town is courting as a wit  i am a fool  the weakest the most ductile the most tender fool that ever woman tried the weakness of  and the most unsettled in my purposes and resolutions of recovering my right mind  it is but an hour ago that i kneeled down and swore i never would come near you  and after saying my lords prayer for the sake of the close of not being led into temptation  out i sallied like any christian hero ready to take the field against the world the flesh and the devil not doubting but i should finally trample them all down under my feet  and now am i got so near you  within this vile stones cast of your house  i feel myself drawn into a vortex that has turned my brain upside downwards and though i had purchased a box ticket to carry me to miss  benefit yet i know very well that was a single line directed to me to let me know lady  would be alone at seven and suffer me to spend the evening with her she would infallibly see every thing verified i have told her  i dine at mr c  rs in wigmorestreet in this neighborhood where i shall stay till seven in hopes you purpose to put me to this proof if i hear nothing by that time i shall conclude you are better disposed of  and shall take a sorry hack and sorrily jogg on to the play  curse on the word i know nothing but sorrow  except this one thing that i love you perhaps foolishly but  most sincerely l stern  letter cxi to mr and mrs j  old bond street january   not knowing whether the moisture of the weather will permit me to give my kind friends in gerrard street a call this morning for five minutes  i beg leave to send them all the good wishes compliments and respects i owe them  i continue to mend and doubt not but this with all other evils and uncertainties of life will end for the best i send all compliments to your fire sides this sunday night  miss ascough the wise miss pigot the witty your daughter the pretty and so on  if lord o  is with you i beg my dear mrs j  will present the enclosed to him  twill add to the millions of obligations i already owe you  i am sorry that i am no subscriber to soho this season  it deprives me of a pleasure worth twice the subscription  but i am just going to send about this quarter of the town to see if it is not too late to procure a ticket undisposed of from some of my soho friends and if i can succeed i will either send or wait upon you with it by half an hour after three tomorrow  if not my friend will do me the justice to believe me truly miserable  i am half engaged or more for dinner on sunday next but will try to get disengaged in order to be with my friends  if i cannot i will glide like a shadow uninvited to gerrard street some day this week that we may eat our bread and meat in love and peace together  god bless you both  i am with the most sincere regard  your ever obliged l stern  letter cxii to the same old bond street monday my dear friends i have never been a moment at rest since i wrote yesterday about this soho ticket  i have been at a secretary of state to get one  have been upon one knee to my friends sir g  m  mr lascelles  and mr fitzmaurice  without mentioning five more  i believe i could as soon get you a place at court for every body is going  but i will go out and try a new circle  and if you do not hear from me by a quarter after three you may conclude i have been unfortunate in my supplications  i send you this state of the affair lest my silence should make you think i had neglected what i promised  but no  mrs j  knows me better and would never suppose it would be out of the head of one who is with so much truth  her faithful friend l stern  letter cxiii to the same thursday old bond street a thousand thanks and as many excuses my dear friends for the trouble my blunder has given you by a second note i am astonished i could read saturday for sunday or make any mistake in a card wrote by mrs j  s in which my friend is as unrivaled as in a hundred greater excellencies  i am now tied down neck and heels twice over by engagements every day this week or most joyfully would have trod the old pleasing road from bond to gerrard street  my books will be to be had on thursday but possibly on wednesday in the afternoon  i am quite well but exhausted with a room full of company every morning till dinner  how do i lament i cannot eat my morsel which is always sweet with such kind friends  the sunday following i will assuredly wait upon you both  and will come a quarter before four that i may have both a little time and a little day light to see mrs j  s picture  i beg leave to assure my friends of my gratitude for all their favors with my sentimental thanks for every token of their good will  adieu my dear friends   i am truly yours l stern  letter cxiv to l s esquire old bond street wednesday dear sir your commendations are very flattering i know no one whose judgment i think more highly of but your partiality for me is the only instance in which i can call it in question  thanks my good sir for the prints  i am much your debtor for them  if i recover from my ill state of health and live to revisit coxwould this summer i will decorate my study with them along with six beautiful pictures i have already of the sculptures on poor ovids tomb which were executed on marble at rome  it grieves one to think such a man should have died in exile who wrote so well on the art of love  do not think me encroaching if i solicit a favor  it is either to borrow or beg to beg if you please some of those touched with chalk which you brought from italy  i believe you have three sets and if you can spare the imperfect one of cattle on colored paper twill answer my purpose which is namely this to give a friend of ours  you may be ignorant she has a genius for drawing and whatever she excells in she conceals and her humility adds luster to her accomplishments  i presented her last year with colors and an apparatus for painting and gave her several lessons before i left town  i wish her to follow this art to be a complete mistress of it  and it is singular enough but not more singular than true that she does not know how to make a cow or a sheep though she draws figures and landscapes perfectly well which makes me wish her to copy from good prints  if you come to town next week and dine where i am engaged next sunday call upon me and take me with you  i breakfast with mr beauclerc and am engaged for an hour afterward with lord o  so let our meeting be either at your house or my lodgings  do not be late for we will go half an hour before dinner to see a picture executed by west most admirably  he has caught the character of our friend  such goodness is painted in that face that when one looks at it let the soul be ever so much unharmonized it is impossible it should remain so  i will send you a set of my books  they will take with the generality  the women will read this book in the parlour and tristram in the bedchamber  good night dear sir  i am going to take my whey and then to bed believe me  yours most truly l stern  letter cxv february  0 old bond street my dearest lydia my sentimental journey you say is admired in york by every one  and it is not vanity in me to tell you that it is no less admired here  but what is the gratification of my feelings on this occasion  the want of health bows me down and vanity harbors not in thy fathers breast  this vile influenza  be not alarmed i think i shall get the better of it  and shall be with you both the first of may and if i escape twill not be for a long period my child  unless a quiet retreat and peace of mind can restore me  the subject of thy letter has astonished me  she could but know little of my feelings to tell thee that under the supposition i should survive thy mother i should bequeath thee as a legacy to  no my lydia it is a lady whose virtues i wish thee to imitate that i shall entrust my girl to  i mean that friend whom i have so often talked and wrote about  from her you will learn to be an affectionate wife a tender mother and a sincere friend  and you cannot be intimate with her without her pouring some part of the milk of human kindness into your breast which will serve to check the heat of your own temper which you partake in a small degree of  nor will that amiable woman put my lydia under the painful necessity to fly to india for protection whilst it is in her power to grant her a more powerful one in england  but i think my lydia that thy mother will survive me  do not deject her spirits with thy apprehensions on my account  i have sent you a necklace buckles and the same to your mother  my girl cannot form a wish that is in the power of her father that he will not gratify her in  and i cannot in justice be less kind to thy mother  i am never alone  the kindness of my friends is ever the same  i wish though i had thee to nurse me  but i am denied that  write to me twice a week at least  god bless thee my child and believe me ever ever thy  affectionate father l s  letter cxvi to mrs j  tuesday your poor friend is scarce able to write  he has been at deaths door this week with a pleurisy  i was bled three times on thursday and blisterd on friday  the physician says i am better  god knows for i feel myself sadly wrong and shall if i recover be a long while of gaining strength  before i have gone through half this letter i must stop to rest my weak hand above a dozen times  mr j  was so good to call upon me yesterday i felt emotions not to be described at the sight of him and he overjoyed me by talking a great deal of you  do dear mrs j  entreat him to come tomorrow or next day for perhaps i have not many days or hours to live  i want to ask a favor of him if i find myself worse  that i shall beg of you if in this wrestling i come off conqueror  my spirits are fled  it is a bad omen  do not weep my dear lady  your tears are too precious to shed for me  bottle them up and may the cork never be drawn  dearest kindest gentlest and best of women may health peace and happiness prove your handmaids  if i die cherish the remembrance of me and forget the follies which you so often condemned  which my heart not my head betrayed me into should my child my lydia want a mother may i hope you will if she is left parentless take her to your bosom  you are the only woman on earth i can depend upon for such a benevolent action  i wrote to her a fortnight ago and told her what i trust she will find in you  mr j  will be a father to her  he will protect her from every insult for he wears a sword which he has served his country with and which he would know how to draw out of the scabbard in defense of innocence  commend me to him  as i now commend you to that being who takes under his care the good and kind part of the world  adieu  all grateful thanks to you and mr j   your poor affectionate friend l stern  letter cxvii to mr b exeter july      sir this was quite an impromptu of yoricks after he had been thoroughly soused  he drew it up in a few moments without stopping his pen i should be glad to see it in your intended collection of mr sternes memoirs etc if you should have a copy of it you will be able to rectify a misapplication of a term that mr stern could never be guilty of as one great excellence of his writings lies in the most happy choice of metaphors and allusions  such as showed his philosophic judgment at the same time that they displayed his wit and genius  but it is not for me to comment on or correct so great an original i should have sent this fragment as soon as i saw mrs medalles advertisement had i not been at a distance from my papers i expect much entertainment from this posthumous work of a man to whom no one is more indebted for amusement and instruction than  sir your humble servant s p  an impromptu no  not one farthing would i give for such a coat in wet weather or dry  if the sun shines you are sure of being melted because it closes so tight about one  if it rains it is no more a defense than a cobweb  a very sieve of my conscience that lets through every drop and like many other things that are put on only for a cover mortifies you with disappointment and makes you curse the impostor when it is too late to avail ones self of the discovery had i been wise i should have examined the claim the coat had to the title of defender of the body  before i had trusted my body in it  i should have held it up to the light like other suspicious matters i have seen how much it was likely to admit of that which i wanted to keep out  whether it was no more than such a frail flimsy contexture of flesh and blood as i am fated to carry about with me through every tract of this dirty world could have comfortably and safely dispensed within so short a journey  taking into my account the chance of spreading trees  thick hedges oerhanging the road  with twenty other coverts that a man may thrust his head under  if he is not violently pushed on by that d  d stimulus  you know where  that will not let a man sit still in one place for half a minute together  but like a young nettlesome tit is eternally on the fret and is for pushing on still farther  or if the poor scared devil is not hunted tantivy by a hue and cry with gives and a halter dangling before his eyes  now in other cases he has not a minute to throw away in standing still but like king lear must brave the peltings of a pitiless storm and give heaven leave to rumble its belly full  spit fire  or spout rain  as spitefully as it pleases without finding the inclination or the resolution to slacken his pace lest something should be lost that might have been gained or more gotten than he well knows how to get rid of  now had i acted with as much prudence as some other good folks  i could name many of them who have been made b  ps within my remembrance for having been hooded and muffled up in a larger quantity of this dark drab of mental manufacture than ever fell to my share  and absolutely for nothing else  as will be seen when they are undressed another day  had i had but as much as might have been taken out of their cloth without lessening much of the size or injuring in the least the shape or contracting aught of the doublings and foldings or continuing to a less circumference the superb sweep of any one cloak that any one b  p ever wrapped himself up in  i should never have given this coat a place upon my shoulders i should have seen by the light at one glance how little it would keep out of rain by how little it would keep in of darkness  this a coat for a rainy day do pray madam hold it up to that window  did you ever see such an illustrious coat since the day you could distinguish between a coat and a pair of breeches  my lady did not understand derivatives and so she could not see quite through my splendid pun pope sixtus would have blinded her with the same darkness of excessive light what a flood of it breaks in through this rent what an irradiation beams through that what twinklings  what sparklings as you wave it before your eyes in the broad face of the sun make a fan out of it for the ladies to look at their gallants with at church  it has not served me for one purpose  it will serve them for two  this is coarse stuff  of worse manufacture than the cloth  put it to its proper use for i love when things sort and join well  make a philtre this allusion is improper a philtre originally signifies a love potion  and it is used as a noun from the verb philtrate  it must signify a strainer not a sucker  cloth is sometimes used for the purpose of draining by means of its pores or capillary tubes but its action is contrary to philtration his meaning is obvious enough but as he drew up this fragment without stopping his pen as i was informed it is no wonder he erred in the application of some of his terms of it  while there is a drop to be extracted  i know but one thing in the world that will draw drain or suck like it  and that is  neither wool nor flax  make  make any thing of it but a vile hypocritical coat for me  for i never can say sub jove whatever juno might that it is a pleasure to be wet  l stern  the fragment chap i showing two things first what a rabelaic fellow longinus rabelaicus is and secondly how cavalierly he begins his book my dear and thrice reverend brethren as well archbishops and bishops as the rest of the inferior clergy would it not be a glorious thing if any man of genius and capacity amongst us for such a work was fully bent within himself to sit down immediately and compose a thorough  stitched system of the kerukopaedia fairly setting forth to the best of his wit and memory and collecting for that purpose all that is needful to be known and understood of that art  of what art cried panurge good god answered longinus making an exclamation but taking care at the same time to moderate his voice why of the art of making all kinds of your theological hebdodomical rostrummical humdrummical what do you call ems  i will be shot quoth epistemon if all this story of thine of a roasted horse is simply no more than s  sausages quoth panurge thou have fallen twelve feet and about five inches below the mark answered epistemon for i hold them to be sermons  which said word as i take the matter being but a word of low degree for a book of high rhetoric  longinus rabelaicus was foreminded to usher and lead into his dissertation with as much pomp and parade as he could afford and for my own part either i know no more of latin than my horse or the kerukopaedia is nothing but the art of making em  and why not quoth gymnast of preaching them when we have done  believe me dear souls this is half in half  and if some skilful body would but put us in a way to do this to some tune  thou would not have them chanted surely quoth triboulet laughing  no nor canted neither quoth gymnast crying  but what i mean my friends says longinus rabelaicus who is certainly one of the greatest critics in the western world and as rabelaic a fellow as ever existed what i mean says he interrupting them both and resuming his discourse is this that if all the scattered rules of the kerukopaedia could be but once carefully collected into one code as thick as panurges head and the whole cleanly digested  pooh says panurge who felt himself aggrieved and bound up continued longinus by way of a regular institute and then put into the hands of every licensed preacher in great britain and ireland just before he began to compose i maintain it  i deny it flatly quoth panurge  what answered longinus rabelaicus with all the temper in the world  chap ii in which the reader will begin to form a judgment of what an historical dramatical anecdotical allegorical and comical kind of a work he has got hold of homenas who had to preach next sunday before god knows whom knowing nothing at all of the matter  was all this while at it as hard as he could drive in the very next room  for having fouled two clean sheets of his own and being quite stuck fast in the entrance upon his third general division and finding himself unable to get either forwards or backwards with any grace  curse it says he thereby excommunicating every mothers son who should think differently why may not a man lawfully call in for help in this as well as any other human emergency  so without any more argumentation except starting up and nimming down from the top shelf but one the second volume of clark  though without any felonious intention in so doing he had begun to clap me in making a joint first five whole pages nine round paragraphs and a dozen and a half of good thoughts all of a row and because there was a confounded high gallery  was transcribing it away like a little devil  now  quoth homenas to himself though i hold all this to be fair and square yet if i am found out there will be the deuce and all to pay  why are the bells ringing backwards you lad what is all that crowd about honest man homenas was got upon doctor clarks back sir  and what of that my lad why an please you he has broke his neck and fractured his skull and befouled himself into the bargain by a fall from the pulpit two stories high alas poor homenas homenas has done his business  homenas will never preach more while breath is in his body  no faith i shall never again be able to tickle it off as i have done i may sit up whole winter nights baking my blood with hectic watchings and write as solid as a father of the church  or i may sit down whole summer days evaporating my spirits into the finest thoughts and write as florid as a mother of it  in a word i may compose myself off my legs and preach till i burst  and when i have done it will be worse than if not done at all  pray mr suchaone who held forth last sunday doctor clark i trow says one pray what doctor clark says a second why homenass doctor clark quoth a third o rare homenas cries a fourth your servant mr homenas quoth a fifth  twill be all over with me by heaven  i may as well put the book from whence i took it  here homenas burst into a flood of tears which falling down helter skelter ding dong without any kind of intermission for six minutes and almost twenty five seconds had a mavelous effect upon his discourse for the aforesaid tears do you mind did so temper the wind that was rising upon the aforesaid discourse but falling for the most part perpendicularly and hitting the spirits at right angles which were mounting horizontally all over the surface of his harangue they not only played the devil and all with the sublimity  but moreover the said tears by their nitrous quality did so refrigerate precipitate and hurry down to the bottom of his soul all the unsavory particles which lay fermenting as you saw in the middle of his conception that he went on in the coolest and chastest style for a soliloquy i think that ever mortal man uttered  this is really and truly a very hard case continued homenas to himself  panurge by the bye and all the company in the next room hearing all along every syllable he spoke for you must know that notwithstanding panurge had opened his mouth as wide as he could for his blood in order to give a round answer to longinus rabelaicuss interrogation which concluded the last chapter  yet homenass rhetoric had poured in so like a torrent slapdash through the wainscot amongst them and happening at that uncritical crisis when panurge had just put his ugly face into the abovesaid posture of defense  that he stopped short  he did indeed and though his head was full of matter and he had screwed up every nerve and muscle belonging to it till all cried crack again in order to give a due projectile force to what he was going to let fly full in longinus rabelaicuss teeth who sat over against him  yet for all that he had the continence to contain himself for he stopped short i say without uttering one word except zds  many reasons may be assigned for this but the most true the most strong the most hydrostatical and the most philosophical reason why panurge did not go on was  that the forementioned torrent did so drown his voice that he had none left to go on with  god help him poor fellow so he stopped short as i have told you before and all the time homenas was speaking he said not another word good or bad but stood gaping and staring like what you please  so that the break marked thus  which homenass grief had made in the middle of his discourse which he could no more help than he could fly  produced no other change in the room where longinus rabelaicus epistemon gymnast triboulet and nine or ten more honest blades had got kerukopaedizing together but that it gave time to gymnast to give panurge a good squashing chuck under his double chin which panurge taking in good part and just as it was meant by gymnast he forthwith shut his mouth  and gently sitting down upon a stool though somewhat excentrically and out of neighbors row but listening as all the rest did with might and main they plainly and distinctly heard every syllable of what you will find recorded in the very next chapter
