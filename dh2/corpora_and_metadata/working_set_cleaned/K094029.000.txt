discourses for the use of families on the advantages of a free enquiry and on the study of the scriptures  by w hazlitt ma   parvis quoque rebus magna juvari hor london printed for j johnson no    st pauls churchyard mdccxc  advertisement the author of the following plain discourses hopes they will be useful plain discourses in his opinion are best calculated for general benefit he must remark also that most clergymen seem to suppose their audiences wiser than they really are and that on this ground they frequently address to them such profound disquisitions as can be of no use because above their comprehension it will be allowed that the best mode of diffusing a knowledge of the scriptures and of practically enforcing all its doctrines is the great business of preaching he does not therefore give into the fashion of amusing the reader or the hearer with a sentimental ignis fatuus or with a trim philosophic essay which seems to have almost any other object more in view than christian edification others will continue to think differently from him let every one be fully persuaded in his own mind  a list of subscribers mr abraham crediton mr george allman bandon mrs allman

or to apply ourselves to the discovery of our true way to happiness the first part on this text jeremiah vi    thus says the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls an indolent habit and a precipitate conduct are equally prejudicial to our best interests  the mind as well as the body was it is obvious originally intended for labor  but that we might not labor in vain it has pleased god in his goodness to give us reason to examine and an understanding to know the things that are true  and as he is the absolutely perfect being who does nothing in vain it must therefore be his sovereign will that we exert and improve those great talents which he has committed to our trust certainly therefore it must be our highest honor and happiness to comply with the divine appointment  we accordingly find that misery is the inevitable consequence of vice and that vice always shelters itself under an inconsiderate and thoughtless habit or under a blind and stubborn attachment to systems of opinions which were either framed by ourselves at random or handed down to us by others without any enquiry  in short as activity is the health and strength of the body and the source of its greatest perfection enquiry in like manner is the enlightener the improver and the bracer of the mind without enquiry the mind must always continue in a weak and languid state whatever accidental advantages it may now and then have had to relieve it whereas a serious and impartial enquiry through whatever perplexing mazes it may lead us will at last terminate in precious truth  true religion therefore the religion of reason and the religion which has god for its author calls us to the light that our deeds may be made manifest what they are and that from repeated circumspection and information we may daily more and more grow up into the divine likeness  on the contrary every false religion is afraid of the light demands our passive acquiescence in all its contradictory doctrines wrappeth itself up in impenetrable clouds of mystery neither comes to the light lest its sandy foundation should be detected and exposed  every sinner in like manner lurketh about in secret places and loves darkness rather than light because his deeds are evil he shunneth reflection because his conscience will not bear the inspection of such a judge and as he sinketh in ignorance he proportionably sinketh into the dregs of iniquity  hence all the wickedness and misery of the jewish nation as we may learn from all their prophets and their whole history from beginning to end my people will not consider thus said the lord in his repeated admonitions to that abandoned race they hated instruction and cast reproof behind them they said peace peace when there was no peace and they committed abomination without shame from the least of them even to the greatest some few characters always excepted every one was given to covetousness from the prophet even to the priest every one dealt falsely  therefore the judgments of god which were long retarded through his forbearance and long suffering stood in array against them  yet the adorably benignant sovereign was not willing that they should perish but that they should turn to him and be saved to this purpose then as an effectual remedy against all the evils that threatened them he graciously directed them in the words of the text to exert those faculties which he had given them for attaining true happiness and not to their own shame and confusion of face despise the riches of his goodness which would lead them to repentance thus said the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls as if he had said  be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is for i have given you a lamp to your feet which ye need only to observe and follow and all will be well  the first thing which i shall consider in the words of the text is the infinite compassion and loving kindness of god even to sinners to notorious and abandoned sinners hence we may secondly be gratefully disposed to give the greatest attention to those means of salvation which he has graciously proposed to reinstate us in his favor  the first thing observable in the words of the text is the infinite compassion and loving kindness of god even to sinners to notorious and abandoned sinners  though ignorance has frequently represented this all glorious being an implacable severe and inexorable judge inexorable to the least offending supplicant reason and revelation universally declare that he is not the enemy of any creature he has made but rich in mercy unto all  the jews are a most illustrious manifestation of this truth who from their first origin were a stubborn and gainsaying people  immediately after their redemption from egyptian bondage they murmured against that good providence which wrought out their salvation for them and turned aside from the commandments of their god  again soon after they were settled in the promised land they stupidly and ungratefully suffered themselves to be drawn into all the vices of the neighboring nations into those very vices for which the canaanites were driven out before them  in succeeding ages in return for repeated mercies they too generally became the more unthankful and unholy and at last the whole head was sick the whole heart was faint from the sole of the foot even to the head there was no soundness in them but wounds and bruises and putrefying sores  yet in these most deplorable circumstances god was not willing that they should perish but that they should turn unto him and find rest for their souls thou said this gracious being to that people have played the harlot with many lovers thou have forsaken me and have burnt incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of thy own hands  but notwithstanding these things return again unto me says the lord  assuredly then this is not the language of an inexorable sovereign or of a reprobating god this is plainly the language of the father of all mercies if we stand in the ways and see there is not any god like unto our god as he clearly and condescendingly represents himself as great as his power is so great is his love all his works proclaim him god our savior and he calls us by all his dispensations by all his prophets and by his own son to flee from the wrath to come  we should not therefore indeed we cannot without giving ourselves up to be led blindfold and stifling the natural reflections of our own minds forsake him the fountain of living waters and hew us out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water we should and we will if we sufficiently rouse up our intellectual faculties wash and be clean seek the lord whilst he may be found and instantly resolve to lay hold upon the crown of eternal life  but what we should do what it must be at all times of infinite importance to us to do that it must be the most stupendous folly and madness in us ever to neglect doing  every impenitent sinner ought to be struck with horror at his own deformity and be ashamed to show his head he is a monster in the creation he is a traitor to his best friend he rebels against the lord of heaven and earth he defaceth the image of god within him all his ways are darkness and his steps take hold on hell what an odious and despicable character does he therefore exhibit to the world how full of infamy and wretchedness is every part of this character and how earnestly and constantly therefore should we avoid it and abhor it  to this purpose then let us seriously attend in the second place to those directions that were given to the jews in the text and which we may easily apply to our own particular circumstances thus says the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths which is the good way and walk therein  now the first information which we gain from these words is that god has furnished us with sufficient powers to acquire the knowledge of our duty here again it is implied in the second place that this is plain and easy to us and in the third place that we should exercise ourselves in the discovery of it we learn in the next place what is the best method of acquiring the knowledge of our duty and we are taught in the last place that obedience as well as knowledge is expected from us  in those directions which are given us in the text how to escape the wrath to come and to approve ourselves the objects of infinite mercy it is in the first place demonstrably implied that god has given us sufficient powers to acquire the knowledge of our duty  our lot indeed must have been peculiarly hard if our duty were beyond our reach and if notwithstanding we were liable to punishment for remaining ignorant of it but this is evidently not the case because thus says the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way we can therefore stand in the ways and see and also find out the good way unless it be our own fault  it would be infinitely debasing the character of the supreme and matchless jehovah it would be insulting him with the most blasphemous language to suppose him capable of mocking such feeble creatures as we are whom if power were the only measure of his government he could instantly destroy with the breath of his mouth as he has commanded therefore we must have the power to obey we must be able to seek and find him to discover his will and yield a sincere obedience to it  but his command is clear and positive he does not say you can do nothing being as destitute of power as the ground you tread upon nor does he say wait you the lords time because every time is the lords time if we be willing to improve it he no where teaches us to consider ourselves as the passive instruments of fate incapable of a good word or thought or action unless we be first irresistably wrought upon by some miraculous interposition but on the contrary universally addresseth us as beings who by the endowments of his wisdom and goodness can ourselves examine discover and embrace the things that belong to our peace stand says the lord and see we therefore as i have already observed can stand and see otherwise indeed we could not be accountable for any part of our conduct nor could there be any distinction of character between those who are reputed the best and those who are reputed the very worst of mankind  but here it is farther obvious that as we are constituted moral and accountable creatures it must be of the utmost importance to us to be persuaded that we are such for we may be as well without the power of doing good as from the notion that we have not this power neglect the exertion of it we should not therefore give way to a benumbing torpor of mind nor be tempted to imagine whilst god has spoken to us that he has spoken to us to no manner of purpose but should humbly hearken to his voice which is universally confirmed by the testimony of our own breasts and whilst we gratefully acknowledge his gifts we should be anxious to improve them to those benevolent purposes for which they were bestowed that thus we may finally have praise of him and rejoice in ourselves for evermore  but we may learn in the second place from the words of the text that the knowledge of our duty is in general so far from being mysterious or unintelligible to us that with a little attention it must be universally plain and easy  we are not supposed by the prophet to be left in the dark but considered in the light of travelers who have some particular distant habitation in view and who capable of ascertaining at what point this lies have only to observe amidst a variety of ways that lead to different habitations and see which is the right way and as those who are traveling eastward have only to keep the eastern point in view and then to observe amidst ten thousand different ways which guides them in a right line to their wishedfor habitation and to follow this we in like manner have only to enquire and know to seek and find to open our eyes and see what our duty is as moses said to the children of israel this commandment which i command thee this day is not hidden from thee neither is it far off  but the word is very nigh unto thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou may do it he would have expressed the same thing if he had said it is so far from being beyond the reach of man that it is all within himself unless he be an idle and unprofitable servant  and according to his declaration our own experience will convince us that we have only to commune a moment with our own hearts upon the different pursuits of men and we shall soon discover which is the good way  as pleasure and riches and honors are transient and unsatisfying goods our reason will therefore instantly teach us that neither of these can be the good way the good way must give us joy upon reflection and as we advance in it give us still nearer and more enlarged views of complete happiness  if we consider then a little farther we shall find that the love of god and man only can administer peace continually increasing peace to the soul whatever way therefore amongst numberless different ways most effectually promoteth and establishes this love must be the best of those ways  in other words every mans own conscience will readily inform him that to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with our god must be the sure road to happiness and what justice and mercy mean and what it is to render all due homage and praise to god the sense of right and wrong which is implanted in every man will in almost all cases help us to discover the prophet therefore says he has showed thee o man what is good and the apostle paul proposes the question know ye not of your own selves what is right again he very consistently teaches that those who have not the law are a law unto themselves and though those who have not the law could not of themselves find out the law yet it is no sooner proposed to them all it precepts being so plain and forcible and so exactly correspondent to the natural sentiments of the human mind than they must pronounce it to be holy just and good  the law of the gospel in particular is so pure and heavenly that we must almost instantaneously acknowledge its divine authority and is at the same time so obvious that he that runs may read it to submit ourselves entirely to the divine will and to do to all others as we would be treated ourselves is that very perfection for which we would naturally wish but this conspicuously manifests itself in every page of the gospel to be the sum of what god requires of us as the candidates for his everlasting blessedness  the prophet therefore calls the gospel an high way and adds that the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein our lord in like manner says my yoke is easy and my burden is light and the apostle john his commandments are not grievous  but it is not argument so much as experience that impresses an irresistible conviction of those truths upon the mind  argument indeed may fully satisfy us that the way of the wicked is as darkness and that this way is clearly delineated with all its concomitant horrors in the gospel and again that wisdoms ways are ways of pleasantness and that all her paths are peace and that these ways are written as with a diamond in the same gospel but it is experience which makes every thing easy and endearing to us when we can once be persuaded to search the scriptures as we ought every difficulty concerning those terms of acceptance which they prescribe will gradually vanish and the more we accustom ourselves to this divine study the more shall we know from the harmonious testimony of the spirit and of our own spirits that the doctrines are of god  as then we are furnished with sufficient powers to acquire the knowledge of our duty and as this is so plain and easy to us it hence demonstrably follows in the third place and as we are expressly taught in the words of the text that we should seriously exercise ourselves in the discovery of it thus says the lord stand in the ways and see and ask  where is the good way  it would be supposing that the great god has in vain constituted us what we are that is capable of enquiry if we were to think at the same time that he does not require nor expect us to make any enquiry it would likewise be offering the greatest mockery to god to expect from him any further directions or supernatural aids for finding out the good way before we had first carried into practice those directions which he has already abundantly given us  if we would therefore give any honor to god or do any justice to ourselves we must arouse all the powers within us and apply these to all those lessons of wisdom which both nature and revelation clearly inculcate or we must give all diligence to know what we must do to be saved  as christians this duty is peculiarly incumbent upon us we cannot otherwise indeed with any degree of consistency assume the christian name for our lord expressly teaches that if we would enter into life we must seek and search and ask and watch and pray and the apostle directs us to prove all things and to hold fast that which is good  enquiry therefore is as necessary as it is important and should therefore be always accounted of supreme importance  however the affairs of the world may attract our attention or whatever numberless cares may continually press around us the prevailing language of our hearts ought to be at all times wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the most high or what shall we do to inherit eternal life how shall we try search and examine whence shall we receive the greatest light and assistance by what measures shall we most effectually obtain the jewel of great price what vices are to be discarded what practices are to be altered and amended and what affections are to be cultivated and improved  after we have made the greatest progress in this divine science we should be still putting the question with the young man in the gospel and with more humble and serious dispositions what lack i yet what is farther to be done what passions to be corrected what new duties to be considered and pursued and how shall we go on advancing to greater perfection  thus only indeed can we walk worthy the high vocation with which we are called  the contrary conduct unmans and unchristianizes us divests us of our rationality and degrades us not only to a level with inferior animals but even to a level with the clods of the valley and as it discovers such ingratitude to our maker and so daring a contempt of his authority must therefore necessarily debar us of his favor yea we must finally in the severest terms condemn and reproach ourselves as inexcusably guilty and unworthy of everlasting life for having neglected the one thing needful for having neglected this only whilst we were anxiously inquisitive about every thing that respected our interests in this world  we cannot indeed at present offer any plea in justification of our conduct for bestowing more care upon the body than upon the mind nor for making that an excuse for omitting spiritual duties which we would by no means allow as an excuse for omitting any temporal concerns if for instance when there is any competition between our duty and our present emoluments we give the preference to this world it is plain that the love of this world and not the love of god is the prevailing principle by which we are actuated if again the influence of company can prevail upon us to absent ourselves from public worship when our hearts inform us that this is an important duty it is plain that we regard the pleasure of our company more than the favor of god and if we will not in any case indeed in every case take those pains to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ which we always readily take for filthy lucres sake it is plain much too plain that the commands of god and his final approbation are amongst the last of our concerns  in short if we suffer the great salvation which is proposed to us in the gospel to give way to any other object whatever if this salvation be not always or at least generally supreme in our affections we must confess ourselves unworthy of it and therefore cannot reasonably hope that we shall at last be rewarded with it  we should therefore examine ourselves and see that we prize wisdom as much as profit and that we labor as much or indeed more for that bread which endures to everlasting life than we do for that bread which only passes into the belly and then perishes or as we are authorized enabled and commanded so to do as the apostle exhorts let us not be unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is  but having thus shown you that since god has graciously furnished us with powers for attaining the knowledge of our duty and since he has moreover made this plain and easy to us we should therefore exercise ourselves in the discovery of it i should now proceed to point out what seems to be the best method of accomplishing our purpose and likewise to show that obedience as well as knowledge is expected from us these considerations however with the conclusion of the whole must be reserved for our next meditations  in the mean time let us seriously consider what we are of what we are capable what duties are required from us and how fully and clearly these are made known to us and let us therefore give glory to god by vigorously exerting those faculties which he has given us by making our eternal interests the grand object of our pursuits and by working out our own salvation with fear and trembling with the utmost caution and circumspection and with the utmost horror and aversion of the least allowed transgression of the least of the divine commandments  discourse ii showing that the knowledge of our duty is the way to life and what is the best method of acquiring this knowledge the second part on this text jeremiah vi    thus says the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls these words i have already observed are a positive manifestation of the infinite compassion and loving kindness of god even to sinners to notorious and abandoned sinners he is not willing that any should perish after we have forsaken him the fountain of living waters and hewed us out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water he even then proposes rest for our souls  hence then we see that this allglorious being is not as he has been sometimes blasphemously represented the enemy of any creature he has made but rich in mercy unto all from everlasting as adorable in his forbearance and longsuffering as for the astonishing displays of his uncontrollable power thus says the lord even to those who had rejected his dominion over them stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls  it is his pleasure therefore to restore and perfect us unless it be our own fault  to this purpose the language of our text holds out this first object to us that he has furnished us with sufficient powers to acquire the knowledge of our duty for as he is incapable of mocking the creatures of his power it is therefore evident since he has commanded us to stand and see and enquire where our true happiness lies that we can be obedient to the heavenly voice  but in the second place we are likewise informed that the knowledge of our duty is plain and easy to us we have only to stand and we shall see to seek and we shall find to knock and it shall be opened to us it is not hidden from us neither is it far off but within the reach of every man who is solicitous to obtain it  hence it is obvious in the third place that we should seriously exercise ourselves in discovering the knowledge of our duty this is our most important study and since the authority of the supreme being concurs with our own assured and dearest interests to make us work out our own salvation we must be inexcusable if we neglect it we must indeed be absolutely inexcusable if the great salvation proposed to us have not at all times the sovereign hold of our affections  but having already i hope sufficiently considered the preceding particulars i shall now proceed to enquire in the fourth place what is the best method of attaining the most clear and satisfactory knowledge of our duty  enquiry i know is represented by some to be the most dangerous way of proceeding that we can take for we are weak they say and fallible creatures and the majority of mankind have so much of their time unavoidably devoted to the affairs of this life that they cannot sufficiently examine or discern truth and that their only means therefore of keeping clear of error is to trust to the decisions of the learned and submit their opinions to their superior wisdom  but notwithstanding all the artificial arguments that have been offered to this purpose the only danger arising from a free and impartial enquiry is the danger of departing from irrational antiquated systems which have no solid foundation but are built upon hay straw stubble and such corruptible materials which will therefore tumble down as soon as they are impartially examined  learning it is granted is of unspeakable advantage to the sincere and unbiassed lovers of truth  but there are men of great learning who through their early imbibed prejudices and the subsequent soporiferous golden charms of their particular situations have been tempted to apply all their learning in the defense of selfevident contradictions  of what use is all that learning of a horsley and a hurd which they have employed in support of a trinity and which may with propriety be termed sophistical quibbling  as an expert arithmetician may puzzle us upon a variety of questions without being able to convince us that two and two are not equal to four they may confound and overwhelm us with metaphysical subtleties but can never persuade us unless we previously become apostates to common sense that one indivisible essence is composed of three distinct persons  besides if after the most extensive enquiry we should still be found to embrace some erroneous sentiments we can certainly do no honor to god by counteracting the clear decisions of our own minds but must on the contrary by this conduct incur his displeasure for he requires us to serve him according to our own understandings and not according to the understanding of any other man or of any body of men  as we have seen therefore that god has commanded us to enquire unquestionable experience will soon convince us that an honest unbiassed enquiry will lead us still farther and farther into all truth  besides we have already seen that the knowledge of our duty is not beyond the reach of any man but is plain and easy to every man who only desires to understand it and resolves to examine into it the spread of error is never to be ascribed to the incapacity but on the contrary to the indolence of man or to his wayward lusts and passions which make him wilfully blind or obstinately incorrigible let these obstacles be but once removed and then we shall have only to ask as we are directed in the text which of the old paths is the good way and it will immediately offer itself to our view  to this purpose then we must in the first place especially endeavor to lay aside all prejudice and not determine that this or that is the good way but ask or examine which amongst the very different ways that are presented to us is the best way  it is farther to be observed that by being directed to ask for the good way it is not intended that we should ask for that way which is crowded with the greatest numbers or for that way in which our fathers have walked or for that way which is most frequented by those who are accounted the great and the wise but for that way which most effectually promoteth goodness amongst men which will afford them the greatest peace and security whilst they are in it and which in the end will assuredly lead them in a strait line to happiness  but it is farther evidently implied in our being directed to ask or enquire at all that we are expected to make use of our own reason and not yield an implicit faith to any doctrines however universal because others may believe these doctrines to be true or the magistrate may have set his seal of orthodoxy upon them we are not taught as was already observed to ask which is the most common but which is the good way nor are we taught to ask for others nor to lead or be led by others but to ask for ourselves and indeed it is indisputable that we must ask for ourselves to ask to any purpose and that we must believe what after the most serious examination appears to ourselves to be right and not what appears to others to be so otherwise we should have been directed instead of exerting our own faculties only to ask of the pope or of our priests or of our governors and to do just as they command us  it is plainly ridiculous therefore and contrary to the divine admonition in the text to profess any doctrines or any religion merely because these have been the doctrines or the religion of our ancestors or the doctrines or religion of the state or our own doctrines or religion in time past  as rational beings we can in reality profess nothing but what has approved itself to our impartial enquiry and whatever too after successive enquiries shall appear to us to be wrong we are as rational beings bound to forsake and oppose however long we may have been accustomed to it by whatever numbers it may still be countenanced and by whatever authority it may continue to be supported  but it is farther to be observed that when we are taught to ask for the old paths it is not by this intended to be signified that whatever comparing things with things has the greatest antiquity on its side is for this reason the best for idolatry is older than the mosaic religion and this again is older than christianity popery likewise is older than the reformation though the most excellent way of all is much older than popery in short if the claim to antiquity were to direct us in our choice of systems besides renouncing the exercise of our mental faculties we must run the hazard of falling into numberless monstrous corruptions it is also to be considered that we might dispute for ever which of so many systems that could be mentioned was the most ancient  to prevent our being bewildered then in this matter we are directed to ask for the good way as well as for the old way which is to the same purpose as if we had been directed to ask which amongst the old ways is the best way or which seems to be most fully approved and recommended to us by the fountain of all wisdom and knowledge  now our only successful method of discovering this is to judge of all the different religions that are proposed to us according to that reason and conscience which god has graciously given us these are the primary lights of heaven to mortals in their journey through life and if we only examine all the different religions in the world by the assistance of these pure and infallible guides we shall easily discern which is the most perfect or which is most fully calculated for promoting the reasonable spiritual worship of the infinitely wise and righteous moral governor of the world and the father of our spirits or which most clearly and forcibly teaches the most exalted and universal love of god and man  but before i proceed to determine this point i shall just observe that the old paths to which the jews were directed in the text might signify that way of holiness which god had established from everlasting or rather those testimonies that were delivered to them by moses and which might be called old paths when compared with their own later wicked inventions for which all the prophets successively threatened and condemned them and the precept to them was of the same force as if they had been taught to compare their own impious ways with those ways which god their redeemer had taught them of old and been directed to walk in the good way  but when we apply the direction in the text to ourselves it must not then be understood to lead us back to the law but on the contrary to establish us in the good way of the gospel in this best of all those ways which the divine wisdom has appointed and enabled us to discover  as soon as the gospel appeared the law which was suited to different times and circumstances could no longer be considered when compared with it to be the good way and the more we now examine the gospel the more and more will it approve itself of all the different ways which the children of men have chosen from the foundation of the world to be the most sure and plain way all other ways when compared with it will appear dark and crooked this will be found to be most pure and peaceable most gentle and easy to be entreated most abounding in all mercy and good fruits and without any partiality or hypocrisy  in other words if we enquire and examine for ever with a constant eye to truth and to truth only the gospel of jesus christ will be found to be the most clear and only infallible way to eternal life him has the father sealed and him has the father appointed to be the king and head of his church he was anointed with the spirit above measure he was filled with the fullness of god he spoke so as never man spoke he therefore is the truly good way and the living way unto the father  but here i may remark that it is only because the most impartial enquiry must convince us of this that we are required to consider him as such jesus though he had all necessary power from the father never claimed notwithstanding that authority which many of his pretended successors have assumed he required our belief in himself only upon the strength of those testimonies which the father had given men of him he amply confirmed his divine mission by numberless most incontestable miracles and we know that with him the father was always well pleased because he has raised him from the dead and taken him up into heaven and poured out the holy spirit upon the apostles after him and we may likewise always know from the doctrines themselves if we deliberately examine them according to that sense of right and wrong which is originally made a part of our constitution that they are demonstrably from god  but i must once more observe upon this head that the good way which jesus taught is to be learned only from himself he gave no power to his followers to exercise power over one another nor appointed any set of fallible men to lead us blindfold in what they may decide to be his way all human establishments therefore and all creeds and confessions of faith composed by men are contrary to this way this way is to be known only from those who heard him and this again only from their own unquestionable records these are the good old paths to all christians all human additions to these paths instead of making them more plain will only confound and mislead us  though we may therefore profitably use our commentators as helps we must lay them aside as guides we must reject all public acts of orthodoxy and adhere to the new testament only if we would press right forward to our best interests this of itself independently of all the different explications of it that have been given by different men and by different churches is the wisdom that descended from above we need only read to see and know this we have only to read the scriptures daily without prejudice and prepossession and to endeavor whilst we read to forget all other knowledge and we shall feel with joy from that peace of god which they administer to our hearts that we are in the good way experience will soon convince us that these are the really good way the farther we extend our enquiries the more clearly and certainly shall we know that these are spirit and that these are life and that our souls can rest fully satisfied upon no other ground  but having thus shown which seems to be the best method of acquiring a thorough knowledge of our duty and at the same time considered where this knowledge is revealed to us it now remains to be briefly remarked in the last place that it is not sufficient to have found by the full exercise of those faculties which god has given us which is the good way and to acknowledge no other but that we must likewise walk therein if we would seriously study to approve ourselves to god stand in the ways and see which is the good way and walk therein says the lord  to know the best way in any case can be of no advantage to us if we walk in another way to know the gospel then to be the way of holiness and at the same time to live in allowed wickedness or to know the gospel to admit no encroachments upon conscience and at the same time to refuse liberty of conscience to others or to know the gospel to be of itself perfect and at the same time to submit to manifest corrupt additions to it or to give any countenance to human authority in matters of faith whilst we know the gospel to be against all such human authority must render us unworthy of the gospel must confessedly debar us of all its benefits and likewise aggravate our guilt and punishment  our lord therefore says if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them and the apostle james that faith without works is dead and the apostle paul that the gift of prophecy and of working of miracles and all other spiritual possessions are nothing without brotherly love  as christians then to apply to ourselves the directions of the text and at the same time to derive any consolation from them we must not only know what is that pure faith which was once delivered to the saints but we must likewise in all respects act suitably to it we must endeavor to be sober and temperate gentle and peaceable pure in heart holy in all manner of conversation without wrath or animosity kind and merciful and walking humbly with our god ever meditating upon his goodness adoring him for all his benefits and cheerfully acquiescing in all his dispensations  thus our lord himself applied the words when he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly of heart and you shall find rest to your souls  the word which is here rendered rest signifies refreshment and the knowledge and practice of the gospel and a constant imitation of our spotless guide and conductor must necessarily above all other objects whatever refresh us even in this life we cannot faint in the way whilst we walk in the light of heaven and perceive that we are led by this light to heaven what indeed can discourage us or make us afraid when we consider that the conclusion of the whole will be everlasting life or those refreshing and infinitely satisfying pleasures which flow at gods right hand for evermore this was the grand object for which the instructions in the text and all the other divine admonitions that occur to us in the scriptures were originally given thus says the lord stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls  let us now then by way of improvement of what has been said be taught in the first place to fix our thoughts upon this grand object  rest for the soul this is the most desirable rest this is a sufficient compensation for all troubles this includes in it the removal of the bitterest sorrows the removal of the burden of sin and shame and death and likewise the enjoyment of god to all eternity  this then is every thing that we can hope or wish or labor for  compared with this what is the world and what are the things of the world what are millions of worlds what are all their wealth and honors what are all the pleasures and gratifications that can be prepared for the body what is fame what is wisdom what is health and what is life itself  the sun and the moon and the planets and the world and every thing that we see around us will vanish and be forgotten or if they were to continue for ever will all soon be of no kind of use to us the body itself must soon pass away besides all its joys are momentary they are moreover unsatisfying our health and all our other present possessions are transient as the clouds that fly over our heads  but when we once find rest for our souls we shall find that which can never be taken away from us which is beyond the reach of every change or accident  we can then look forward to an inconceivable fullness of perpetually increasing bliss through all the successive moments of a boundless eternity as our own we can then look up to the great god as our sanctuary and everlasting friend we can then anticipate with the highest delight our approaching communion and fellowship with jesus and with all the spirits of the just made perfect and we can then stem the torrent of every affliction that shall befall us here in hope of the glory hereafter to be revealed for this is enough this is the jewel of great price  but nothing else is enough  could we surround the four quarters of the globe and call every part of them our own yet we know the time would come when we should be constrained however reluctantly to confess that all was vanity and vexation of spirit  but the soul that enters that rest which the lord has proposed to us shall live for ever and shall have full enjoyment for ever  here then let us fix our thoughts let us command down every high and proud imagination let us triumph over all the blandishments of sense over every anxious care over every slothful habit and over every sinful passion and let us lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven  but let us be taught in the second place seriously to consider admire and adore the wonderful goodness and most mavelous loving kindness of god who has called us to this rest  what are we the beings but of yesterday that we should be begotten unto such lively hopes to what could all our services amount or what could they merit had we even never transgressed against him in thought or word or deed  but we have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god we should have often cut ourselves off from his favor and incurred his displeasure were he not infinitely gracious and long suffering  and yet he has spared us he yet continues to offer to us his pardon and reconciliation he yet entreats us by all his prophets and by his own son to turn unto him that he may have mercy upon us he even now would refresh our souls refresh our souls for ever  how then should we praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men  it is owing to his mercies that we are not consumed still he is willing to introduce us to all the riches of eternal life  how surpassing all description is such love how endearing how joyful how overwhelming to the attentive mind and how worthy our daily thanksgivings and our constant and devoutest meditations god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life most emphatically then may he be styled the father of all mercies  let us therefore be taught in the third place not to walk unworthy of such goodness nor to abuse the riches of that forbearance and longsuffering which would lead us to repentance let us therefore shake off every idle habit and indolent disposition and seek the things that belong to our peace before they be hid from our eyes  god has called us with an holy calling let us be obedient to the heavenly voice  god has given us reason to examine and an understanding to know the things that are true let us exercise and improve the great talents committed to our trust let us awaken all the powers within us and with these divine assistants look well about us consider his perfections and will and all pride and prejudices and temporal interests aside search out all the duties that we owe him  we shall otherwise remain in ignorance be agitated with various tumultuous doubts and fears and be continually tossed about by every wind of doctrine or lost in the destructive current of irresistible temptations and our situation will be as inexcusable as it is deplorable because god has commanded and enabled us to keep clear of all difficulties and also made our duty plain and easy  let us not then be such enemies to ourselves as to contemn his gifts or to suffer them to become languid or useless  particularly after we shall have separated the wheat from the chaff broken through every cloud of darkness seen the light in its full splendor or found out the good way let us walk therein for if the ignorant as has been just intimated can have no plea to justify or excuse themselves much less can those have any who sin with their eyes open  we are accordingly informed from the best authority that that servant who knew his lords will and did not according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes  as we again learn obedience is better than sacrifice and the knowledge that is the acknowledgement of the lord or an entire submission to all his pleasure more than whole burnt offerings  let us therefore be faithful in every good word and work  let us set our affections on the things that are above and daily grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ and let us endeavor to observe all the commandments of the one lord all our days blameless and we shall find refreshment for our souls  discourse iii the first on this text john v    search the scriptures as man is capacitated to know and to understand the things that are true whilst it is clearly the will of the sovereign jehovah that we should apply the faculties he has given us to those wise and excellent purposes for which they were bestowed and as the health strength and enjoyment of the mind must necessarily depend on our endeavors to fulfill the noble designs of our creator i have therefore shown you that enquiry is a most important and essential duty as honorable to our nature as it is suitable to that rank we hold amongst the immensity of the works of god  again since a free and impartial enquiry must finally open to our view the holy scriptures as a full perfect satisfying and unerring guide to eternal life it hence demonstrably follows that we should particularly constantly and seriously examine these that from our frequent and intimate intercourse with those divine instructions which they contain we may build ourselves up in our holy faith and make daily nearer approaches to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ until we shall at length have reached the summit of that perfection to which we are called  we may therefore immediately perceive the force of the direction in the text and what reverential attention and obedience it demands  the scriptures are profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfected thoroughly furnished unto all good works  as they then unfold to us the greatest possible advantages we should if we would be wise and happy assuredly search the scriptures  but the words were peculiarly emphatical as addressed to the jews this people both gloried in the scriptures as a rule of life and in their exact knowledge of them and yet at the same time rejected the longexpected messiah who was so fully and circumstantially pointed out to them in these very scriptures after our lord therefore in the preceding verses had exposed their great obstinacy and hardness of heart in not only not receiving that testimony which john had given them of him but in not even receiving that testimony which the father himself had given them he convicted them likewise in the words of the text of the greatest blindness and ignorance in not admitting that testimony which so fully abounded in their own scriptures concerning him search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and these be they which testify of me  now those scriptures to which our lord here evidently referred were only the scriptures of the old testament for the scriptures of the new testament had not as yet been fully revealed nor had any part of them been committed to writing until several years after  it is plain however from the argument subjoined and on which our lord founded his direction to the jews that the same direction when applied to ourselves implies that we are particularly required and constrained to search the scriptures of the new testament for if it was incumbent on the jews to search the scriptures of the old testament because these testified of christ or predicted the time and manner and design of his coming and his glorious achievements over sin and death we certainly much more ought to search the scriptures of the new testament which so circumstantially relate all the actions of christ his life and death and resurrection and ascension and likewise all his doctrines and promises which in short show us the one sovereign in all the riches of his love and are the true and living way to the father and eternal life  but having thus briefly proved that though our lord in addressing himself to the jews spoke only of the scriptures of the old testament the precept notwithstanding now fairly implies and with additional energy our obligations to search likewise the scriptures of the new testament or the whole scriptures as they are at present commonly received amongst christians i shall proceed to show without any farther introduction why and how we should apply ourselves to search these scriptures and as this is a subject of great importance and to which i have paid some attention i shall consider it more fully than i generally do most others that come before us  we cannot it is obvious much concern ourselves how we should search the scriptures nor indeed anxiously attend to any rules that can be given us on this head unless we be first convinced that we are under some particular obligations to search them and in proportion as these shall be found the more or less weighty and important we shall necessarily be the more or less disposed to observe such directions as offer themselves to our assistance  i shall therefore first endeavor to furnish you with the reasons or arguments why we should seriously exercise ourselves in searching the scriptures and all these i think may be comprised under the following particulars because we profess them to be our rule of life because they contain the pure testimonies concerning christ whom we acknowledge to be the most endearing messenger of the grace of god because they are manifestly the will of the most high god revealed to us because they contain the most excellent and important knowledge because they are our best preservative against vice and our sure guide to perfection because they are even able to make us wise unto salvation and because they are never wearisome nor disgusting to the serious reader  the first argument that i shall mention why we should search the scriptures is because we profess them to be our rule of life  even this argument is a good one for  we would certainly always choose to act a manly and honorable part and not to appear in the light of those who are ever running they know not whither or assuming a character to which they are perfect strangers and we would not willingly be accounted irrational creatures nor become objects of contempt to every capable judge who makes any enquiry into our conduct  but it needs scarcely to be observed that it is always reproachful to us to be ignorant of our profession whatever this be  we could not suppress our indignation against the man who should attempt to teach the sciences without having ever learned to read or teach to read without being acquainted with the alphabet  even to make profession of any common trade and to appear constantly in the habiliments of those who usually exercise this trade and at the same time to be totally ignorant both of the theory and the practice of it renders a man ridiculous and despicable but to be an entire stranger to his religious profession renders a man still more ridiculous and despicable indeed lays a just foundation of not only charging him with folly and presumption but of charging him even with madness  for religion is not a concern between man and man but between man and the great ruler of the universe it is not a concern which affects us as members of society only but as the creatures and subjects of almighty god nor is it an object which merely respects our condition in this world but which respects our condition through eternity  to pretend then that we have considered our obligations to god which is implied in our making any profession of religion and to pretend that we know what these obligations are and that we desire to give them their due influence upon our minds and at the same time never to have studied them never to have understood any thing about them never to have known but they might be the very contrary to what we would be thought to suppose them and evidently not to care whether they be such or not is not only acting the fool and the deceiver in the face of man but is offering a high mockery to god our omnipotent creator our omniscient governor and our supreme judge  besides as rational spiritual and intelligent beings it reflects the greatest disgrace upon us to rise no higher than the beasts of the field to be found in a slothful and indolent state and not to furnish the mind our better part with such excellent employments as are suitable to it  we should seriously consider that whilst we give way to such degrading indolence we may with the show of honoring our profession load it with infamy and whilst we think we are successfully vindicating it be in fact railing against it in bitter language and be only vindicating under the name of it some vile superstition which is in every particular flatly repugnant to it  in this manner the roman catholic and all the members of established churches when vindicating popery or any of their other different establishments are at the same time reviling christianity because they are laboring to justify what is at irreconcilable variance with it and whilst this is the case we must be liable to be tossed about with every wind of doctrine to be bewildered with our own ignorance and to stumble every moment upon our own absurdities for being novices upon the subject we cannot know what to defend or what to oppose when any attack is made upon us we must therefore when drawn into a controversy or when forced to give our opinion upon any subject that may be introduced become the jest of our neighbors and a just object of contempt to ourselves  in other words when one calls himself a presbyterian when another calls himself an episcopalian when others call themselves members of different religious professions and neither of them can give any account of the principles of those sects to which they have severally united themselves they appear exactly in the light of a man who calls himself an architect without being able to explain any of the principles of architecture thus ridiculous is the man who calls himself a churchman without being acquainted with the meaning of the word church and the man who calls himself a christian whilst he is ignorant of the first principles of christianity  we ought therefore either to make no profession at all or frequently to search the scriptures were it for no other reason than this that we may show ourselves men who have understandings as well as other men or that we may maintain our claim to rationality by being able to give to every one who asks a reason of the hope that is in us or which we virtually announce to the world to be in us  but secondly a principal argument why we should search the scriptures is because they contain the pure testimonies concerning christ whom we acknowledge to be the heavenly anointed and the most endearing messenger of the grace of god  we have already seen how much it behooves us to be acquainted with our professions were it only to escape contempt this obligation then will increase and strengthen in proportion to the dignity and importance of the profession we make and the high excellence we ascribe to it  we would not choose to appear ignorant of the beauty and intrinsic worth of any precious jewel in our possession nor to be found when asked incapable of giving any satisfactory kind of description of it much less would we choose to be found boasting of some unspeakable treasure pretended to be in our hands when for ought we knew what we esteemed such might be only an imaginary good or something disgusting and burdensome or detrimental to us but this must be exactly our condition when we glory in the gospel as our best inheritance and at the same time have never known nor examined the design of the gospel nor in any respect considered whether it really be what it has been reported to us and what we ourselves have usually supposed it  besides as we must naturally desire to render supreme homage to god for his greatest blessings it is necessary to this purpose that we previously know why any particular blessing is accounted such otherwise we cannot offer to him a reasonable service but may so far impose upon ourselves as to consider as his blessings the snares and delusions of the wicked and all those things that are most inimical to us and which have a direct tendency to make us unmindful of his most estimable blessings  let it be still farther observed that as it is in him we live and move and have our being and as we should therefore bebehold him as the author of every good and perfect gift we should in these circumstances be thankful for all those benefits which we receive at his hands  but how can we be thankful for we know not what and how can we be sufficiently and devoutly thankful for the greatest benefits unless we particularly and seriously consider what these benefits are whence they flow upon us and how unmerited they are  if we would not therefore be guilty of uttering expressions of gratitude without any meaning or rather if we would not be found destitute of every principle of real gratitude to the god who made us we must search the scriptures that we may be acquainted with those treasures of grace which they contain or learn from them the mavelous extent of his great mercy toward us  besides as by calling ourselves christians we declare ourselves the followers of christ we ought to have some idea of the nature of his kingdom since otherwise we might as well pass under the name of the disciples of mahomed or confucius for who can with any propriety be styled his follower who knows not what christ himself was or what he taught and required of men  but how can this be ever known unless we apply ourselves to the study of the scriptures  these are the only pure testimonies concerning christ  all our authentic information either concerning him or his doctrines must be ultimately derived from these for it is to be found no where else  if we look for this information to any other fountain we may be wholly deceived find his plainest doctrines perverted and his glorious character shamefully debased and totally misrepresented  but in the scriptures we have a particular and genuine account of all the prophecies relating to him preceding his birth and again of all those prophecies exactly fulfilled in his person we here distinctly learn what he was whence he came what he taught in what promises we are led to trust and who are the children of his kingdom and the heirs of eternal life  whilst we presume therefore even to name the name of christ we should search the scriptures to know upon what foundation we stand or what we are to expect or hope  we must otherwise be a contradiction and walk in thick darkness whilst we would be accounted the children of the light we must otherwise be in the situation of those travelers who take no heed to their steps or who with a faithful guide at their right hand and not knowing whither they are going will neither consult him nor be admonished by him and thus whilst we would be considered as the servants of christ we must dishonor both christ and ourselves be perpetually wandering and stumbling in slippery places and become an easy prey to the first adversary that besets us in other words we must always continue in a most ignominious and wretched state and when pluming ourselves upon our superiority to other men be a just object of ridicule to the infidel to the jew to the mahomedan and even to the pagan  but not only that we may appear rational and consistent beings who would not be led blindfold nor exposed to the reproach of professing we know not what i have adverted to many other particular reasons why we should search the scriptures which i intend to illustrate in the following pages  in the mean time let us learn to maintain some degree of consistency in our character as professing christians and as our labors to become masters of the principles of any particular vocation should be always proportioned to the dignity and the solid advantages belonging to it let us consider how earnestly we should labor to become masters of the principles of our christian vocation  to what a long course of servitude do numbers voluntarily subject themselves to learn any of the common arts of life by which after they have learned them they can only procure food and raiment and very frequently at the time when they were to have commenced masters and to which they long looked forward with eager anxiety they are suddenly removed from the land of the living  again observe the merchant how incessantly he toils to understand the nature and all the advantages of any particular branch of commerce he mixes with every company who can furnish him with any information he studies all the turns of fortune that lie before him all the dangers that are to be guarded against and all the probable schemes of adventuring with the greatest certainty of success he turns the night into day in the prosecution of his object he is ready at all seasons to submit to any fatigue and to encounter all the extremes of the various contending elements he passes through all climates either approaches the freezing pole or burns under the torrid suns of africa and ransacks every quarter of the globe both to acquire experience and to seize every golden opportunity of rivalling all his fellows in the same line of unremitted exertion  even the soldier converts into a science the different modes that may be pursued of shedding blood he watches and fasts and perseveringly labors to invent new stratagems or to improve upon old ones and contentedly exposes himself to sickness wounds captivity and death to acquire what he calls glory by slaughtering the greatest possible number of his fellow creatures  many others give no sleep to their eyes nor slumber to their eyelids but work seven days in the week to obtain a small portion of wealth or fame which may not abide with them a day after they have obtained it and which after they have left this world can no more advantage them for ever  shall we then refuse to spend one day in the week to become masters of the sublimest science to examine the records of divine truth and to lay up those treasures that can never fail  let us not reconcile ourselves to such a state of indolence and folly but as the children of the light let us resolve to walk in the light and as those who are called unto liberty let us hold fast that liberty with which christ has made us free  discourse iv the second on this subject john v    search the scriptures from these words i proposed to show why and how we should observe the important direction which they contain and i remarked that there are many cogent arguments in support of the first proposition which may be comprised under the following particulars namely because we profess the scriptures to be our rule of life because they contain the pure testimonies concerning christ whom we acknowledge to be the most endearing messenger of the grace of god because they are manifestly the will of god revealed to us because they contain the most excellent and important knowledge because they are our best preservative against vice and our sure guide to perfection because they are able to make us wise unto salvation and because they are never wearisome nor disgusting to the serious reader  having in the preceding discourse sufficiently illustrated the two first particulars i shall now in the third place lead your attention to our high obligation to search the scriptures because they are the will of the most high god revealed to us  if we only believe this it will be a sufficient reason to examine whether we have formed a right judgment or whether we have only followed the dictates of prejudice or of a groundless prepossession  i shall probably embrace another opportunity of illustrating this point and of showing that we are not under the delusion of those who receive as divine a cunningly devised sable  i shall however just observe at present that the purity and perfection of the doctrines which the scriptures contain positively declare that they have proceeded from the father of lights from the only incorruptible fountain of truth from the god of all wisdom and the only wise god  such doctrines in such purity and perfection were never taught in the ancient or modern schools of philosophy nor can they be collected from all the other books in the world besides unless extracted from these and yet whereas other writers had every advantage of education learning and genius the penmen of these were persons of the lowest occupation were generally without any remarkable natural abilities and ranked amongst the most illiterate of mankind  whence then is it that shepherds and fishermen have been enabled to rise out of sight above an aristotle a plato and a socrates in their teachings and that the scriptures contain the only perfect system of morals that was ever published to the world whence we may say such strength from so much weakness and on the other hand such weakness from so much strength this is evidently in no other way to be accounted for than by admitting the divine original of the scriptures  besides the full accomplishment of various succeeding prophecies relating to extraordinary events which no human eye could discover nor even imagine the astonishing miracles which attended the delivery of the law from the mount and the mighty power that accompanied jesus during his ministry and his apostles after him demonstrably prove as the author of the epistle to the hebrews affirms that it was god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spoke to the fathers in time past by the prophets and who has spoken to us in the last days by his own son  assuredly then if any object in the universe can demand our utmost attention it must be the almighty sovereign of heaven and earth in the adorable exercise of his mercy and grace and in the mavelous condescensions of his love manifested in the communications of his will concerning us  we are continually his dependent creatures and beneficiaries all our present enjoyments are entirely owing to his good pleasure and on his will alone can any of all our hopes of future happiness be founded he does according to his pleasure in all the armies of heaven and amongst all the inhabitants of the earth and no being whatever who counteracteth his will can speak peace to his soul but must be every moment of his opposition posting to destruction  but who can so fully so clearly and authoritatively reveal to us the will of god as god himself  all human attempts to explore it may be vain all human explications of it may be fallible and delusive  but god cannot deny nor misrepresent himself  he can neither deceive nor be deceived nor can his infinite wisdom admit of giving us any wrong information or any instructions that do not powerfully lead to the security of our best interests  as therefore god has spoken to us in the scriptures these must contain the most clear and perfect will of god and consequently our path through life must be most effectually illuminated and the rectitude of our conduct be most essentially supported by our knowledge of this will  we should therefore search the scriptures if we would either regard the favor of god or make it a matter of concern to know what are the purposes of his wisdom relating to us and in what manner we should endeavor to please him  we should delight to search the scriptures if we would thoroughly understand any thing of the goodness mercy and truth of god or be at all solicitous to be informed for what ends he has designed us what services we owe him and what duties we should cultivate and practice to escape his displeasure and to obtain his loving kindness  no other concerns whatever can be of such infinite importance to us can so deservedly awaken our most earnest attention or give such a sweetness and spirit to all our labors we must strangely neglect our own interests therefore and forget our own dignity when we would rather in any respect devote ourselves to the wisdom of this world  nay even to refuse our supreme reverence for the will of god is a mark of blindness as well as of impiety the will of the great and honorable the will of the learned and the mighty and the will of the most puissant monarch who ever swayed a scepter are all weakness and folly when compared with this and are all therefore when preferred to this marks of the greatest servility degeneracy and meanness  besides the wisdom of this world darkens and consounds us involves us in numberless perplexing cares and can present no object to our eager thought that is not precarious unsatisfying and perishing  but the wisdom that descended from above enlighteneth the eyes gives understanding to the simple establishes peace in the heart and endures for ever and is therefore the very wisdom that becomes the creatures of this wisdom to study to admire and meditate upon with continually increasing pleasure and affection  but this leads me to consider in the fourth place that we are likewise under the strongest obligations to search the scriptures because they contain the most excellent useful and satisfying knowledge this will clearly follow from the supposition that they are the revealed will of god for as he is the fountain of wisdom the only fountain of all wisdom what he has taught us must be infinitely more pure and profitable and delightful than any other instructions we can possibly receive  it should also be considered that knowledge is naturally as desirable and refreshing to the mind as light is to the eyes or food to the body  we accordingly find that the discovery of every new truth brings with it an unspeakable additional pleasure and above all other objects charms animates and rejoices the heart  but those truths especially which fully display the divine perfections and represent the great god to us not in a tyrannical and forbidding light but as our adorable friend and father those truths especially i say must be most sweet and delightful to us must most powerfully reconcile us to all the dispensations of providence and cheer and console us in the midst of adversity  again those truths which lead us to the most intimate acquaintance with ourselves which show us our own characters in the strongest point of view and which not only represent to us every imperfection and defect in our tempers inclinations and pursuits but which likewise unfold to us a method of deliverance from every thing that is burdensome painful and dishonorable those truths also must be of the most salutary and of the noblest kind  the books therefore where those truths are to be found and are most illustriously displayed must contain the most valuable and illuminating knowledge  but the holy scriptures the holy scriptures only are those books  this conclusion is demonstrable from all those arguments which prove that they contain the revealed will of god  they must be necessarily pure and perfect since they have proceeded from the fountain of all wisdom and knowledge and what we would all wish and hope and expect according to the obvious deductions of reason happy experience will convince every man who enters upon the trial to be really the case  all other books whatever unless they be such as are drawn up under the guidance of those directions which are given us in the scriptures are lame defective and confused in their several numberless attempts to ascertain the character of the ever blessed god  but in the scriptures he is most clearly and invitingly represented to us in the adorable dress of love  he is here described as the one only peerless jehovah the supreme and omnipotent spirit by whose word the heavens and the earth were created by whose power and wisdom the immense universe is continually upheld and governed who is present with and whose tender mercies are always over all his works and without whose leave not so much as a sparrow can fall to the ground  here likewise we receive the fullest insight into our own situation and characters our weaknesses and wants are all laid open our errors and transgressions are all clearly detected our hearts are searched through and through and we are made to see and to feel where our only strength and security lie we are taught that our treasures are not here that poverty is not our greatest misfortune nor riches our greatest bliss and when we can feed our hopes upon none of the possessions of this transitory scene we are taught to draw near to god with a pure heart to cast all our cares and burdens upon him and are encouraged if we love him and keep his commandments to look forward to everlasting peace and rest under the shadow of his wings  it will appear then from these cursory observations as i have already intimated that such rational sublime and reviving knowledge is to be derived from no other source whatever  all other sources to which we have access are in general cloudy and unsatisfying and in many cases doubtful and perplexed  but this approves itself to be the bright luminary from heaven which opens the eyes and throws a full light into the mind the psalmist therefore says i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies o lord are my meditation i understand more than the ancients because i keep thy precepts and again how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey and the honey comb  if we would therefore attain the most excellent and important knowledge the knowledge of the great god and of his providence if we would behold the whole universe as one beautiful theater and all the various scenes that are passing in it as wonderously regulated to produce the greatest harmony and good under his omnipresent and omniscient eye if we would banish from us all the chaos of paganism all the despondency of infidelity all the gloom and horror of atheistical melancholy and rise to those joys which flow upon us from discovering the glorious perfections of god from observing that his throne is everlasting that his wisdom and power and goodness are boundless and unchangeable that all his works show forth his praise that he will rule for ever and for ever be the refuge of all those who put their trust in him and if we would attain the most exact knowledge of ourselves of our great origin and distinction and of those things that most intimately concern us through all the revolutions of time in short if we would acquire that knowledge which principally ennobles and exalts the human mind which will triumph over all those monuments of genius that this world has ever produced and which will be infinitely important to us through all the successive ages of a boundless eternity our readiest our only sure way to this is to search the scriptures to seize those rich treasures which they contain to drink freely of those living waters with which they flow and which they universally diffuse  but this brings me to mention another argument to this purpose which is indeed implied in what i have been just urging namely as i was to observe in the next place that we should search the scriptures because they are our best preservatives against vice against that which is peculiarly degrading and ruinous to us which is ever at variance with all our interests and is attended with pain and shame and all the horrors of the most excruciating punishment  we should surely decline no labors however arduous to guard ourselves against so great an evil and to become completely triumphant over it  but no other writings whatever besides those we are now considering mark out in the clearest lines the exact boundaries between vice and virtue or flash such conviction upon the mind concerning the tendency as well as the different natures of the one and of the other  other writings indeed represent many vices as virtues which at once appear in the scriptures without the help of arguments to be real vices  and though many other writings most eloquently declaim against vice in general yet they too commonly leave it in all its particulars in the full possession of our affections  they do not come with that authority which always commands attention nor do they speak with that force to the heart which opens our eyes to the things that belong to our peace  they have a studied acuteness without energy elaborate reasonings without evidence and an abundance of persuasive entreaties without sufficiently awakening motives  but the scriptures with the utmost of natures simplicity and yet with an authority decidedly descending from heaven pluck up vice by the roots expose it in that form of wretchedness and infamy which cannot be beheld without horror and aversion and like a twoedged sword cut it down on every side and destroy all its influence over us they represent it as it is in fact universally accompanied with disgrace and misery they detect it in all its haunts and in all its different dresses and show us the concealed poison which it always carries with it under its most pleasurable and alluring forms  whilst therefore we maintain an intimacy with the scriptures we can no more be drawn into the commission of vice than we can knowingly indulge and cherish our deadly and implacable enemy and this argument alone might be thought sufficiently weighty to influence us to follow the direction in the text and to embrace those golden opportunities with which we are graciously furnished for overcoming the world and escaping the most tremendous of all evils  but this will be farther evident when we consider the great efficacy of the scriptures to lead us to perfection and salvation which with some other arguments in support of the doctrine of the text i propose to illustrate in the following discourse after which i shall endeavor to show particutarly how we should always apply ourselves to search the scriptures to the best advantage  in the mean time let us learn from what has been said both the importance of the scriptures and the importance of our bestowing all due attention upon them and if there be those around us who manifest designs to debar us of the use of the scriptures or to impress us with a dislike or aversion to them let us consider such designs as levelled against our best interests and let us be persuaded that all those who endeavor to practice such designs against us are our most pernicious enemies who would tyrannize over us and rob us of our richest inheritance let us be fully persuaded that they would keep us in slavery and darkness make us fools and hypocrites bereave us of all the privileges of rational beings leave us a prey to every iniquity and banish the highest consolation and joy from our hearts  let us therefore not suffer ourselves by our own indolence to sink into that wretched and ignominious state into which the very foolish or the very wicked the empty scorner or the proud covetous and ambitious would villainously enslave us  but let us open our understandings to the things that are true  let us rejoice in that wisdom which descended from above  let us walk worthy of the high privileges with which we are favored and the heavenly vocations with which we are called  let wisdom influence us let integrity guide us and let us act as those servants who have not here any abiding city and who would be always ready to receive the approbation of their lord at his coming and to enter upon those joys which from the foundation of the world are prepared for all the faithful children of god  discourse v john v    search the scriptures discourse the third on this subject i proposed from these words to enforce in the first place our obligations to attend to the precept which they contain and to show in the next place how or in what manner we shall most fully testify our cordial and entire compliance with it  i have already argued that we ought to search the scriptures because we profess them to be our rule of life because they contain the pure testimonies concerning christ whom we acknowledge to be our divinely appointed lord and master because they are manifestly the will of the most high god revealed to us because they contain the most satisfying and useful knowledge and because they are our best preservative against vice and misery  i now proceed to show that we are under the strongest obligations to search the scriptures because they are our sure guide to perfection because they are able to make us wise unto salvation and because they are never wearisome nor disgusting to the serious reader  all these arguments together i should think must work a conviction in every rational mind and rouse us to be active and vigilant faithful and persevering in our endeavors to understand the records of divine truth  but having endeavored in the two preceding discourses to illustrate briefly the five first arguments i shall now consider in the sixth place the great and unparalleled excellency of the scriptures to establish us in every excellency and perfection and shall hence observe our indispensable obligations to be fully acquainted with them  to this purpose you may perceive that whilst the authors of other writings frequently give us fine lessons of virtue they too commonly notwithstanding treat it as a mere chimerical object beyond the reach of humanity and whilst they pretend to admire and love it and to raise in us an unabating ambition to attain it they but too pathetically at the same time declare as paul represents a man in his degenerate state that though to will is present with them yet how to perform that which is good they know not an illustrious heathen poet has said to the same purpose video meliora proboque deteriora sequor the same poet frequently discovered his ignorance of the meliora and unblushingly represented himself as addicted to practices which cannot be decently mentioned what ideas must we then form of the deteriora which he confessedly pursued contrary to the maxims of his very limited meliora and what then must have been our own situation without the light of the gospel this should be particularly considered by those persons who now continue to quote the poet in support of their total disregard to all moral obligations   but the scriptures give us examples of all these fine lessons carried into practice and even furnish examples which greatly eclipse them all  besides the lessons of virtue that are recorded for our instruction in the scriptures are greatly superior to all those that we meet in any other writings let us only consider our lords sermon upon the mount as a full proof of this  blessed are the meek blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness blessed are the pure in heart blessed are the merciful blessed are the peacemakers blessed are the persecuted for righteousness sake resist not evil him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away love your enemies bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use and persecute you  again when we hear our lord warning us judge not that ye be not judged or be ye not as the hypocrites are who only would be seen of men or when we hear him instructing us it is not every one who says lord lord who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven or when we hear him comprising the whole of our duty in the love of god and of our neighbor or teaching us that we should love others as ourselves and do to all others as we would that they should do to us what is there in all antiquity besides that so forcibly recommendeth every thing that is true excellent praiseworthy and of good report or that carries virtue to such a high pitch of perfection  again if we only examine the history of joseph what is there in all heathen antiquity that can be mentioned which is so well calculated to keep us in a constant subjection to all the laws of god through all the unexpected and astonishingly variegated scenes of life  again to support us under the most accumulated distress what is there that can equal or bear any kind of comparison with our lords consolatory discourse to the disciples a little before his sufferings or to rouse the supine and unreflecting sinner from his wretched and ignominious state what is there in all the other books in the world so pathetically powerful as the parable of the prodigal son  besides whilst other writings only imperfectly describe to us what the authors would wish men to be we have in the scriptures clouds of witnesses who even exceeded the wishes of such authors who walked before god in all holy conversation and godliness and who triumphing over the world and holding fast their integrity to the end all died in the faith  and we have here one particular glorious example who was without spot or blemish and who was always doing the will of his and our father who is in heaven  thus is vice dethroned from its highest seat and virtue recommended to us with an eloquence not to be resisted  the psalmist therefore says though acquainted only with a part of the sacred writings thy word have i hid within my heart that i should not sin against thee again he puts the question wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way and emphatically answers by taking heed thereto or watching over it according to thy word signifying that all other methods comparatively speaking would be vain and ineffectual or at least without any certainty of success  he again says the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul  from which we may conclude that he esteemed all other laws when considered in opposition to this as without any prevailing efficacy or power  but the apostle paul says after he became acquainted with the whole scriptures with the unspeakable treasures of the gospel as well as with the divine instructions of the law and the prophets in the old testament i can do all things through christ that strengthens me signifying that no temptation was invincible nor any virtuous endeavors too arduous through the life doctrines promises resurrection and glory of christ continually presented to the attentive mind  he again says to the same purpose thanks be unto god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ signifying that after all other means have failed the gospel is sufficient to deliver us from the dominion of sin  he says again showing himself to be completely triumphant neither death nor life nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come shall be able to separate me from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord  indeed the instructions and example of the apostle himself and of many other good men recorded in the sacred writings have a mighty force to raise us above the world and its lusts and to exalt us to that perfection and holiness which are necessary to our acceptance with god  but above all whilst we look unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross and despised the shame thereof our hearts in all circumstances must be fixed in the practice of what is good we must be steadfast immovable and always abounding in the work of the lord  if we would therefore conquer our worst enemy sin and by keeping a conscience void of offense have always confidence toward god as the father of mercies and our sure refuge and tower of defense we must search the scriptures  these chain down the monster sin under our feet and lead to the full possession of every virtue which can adorn the heart  these supremely aggrandize our rational natures and in prosperity or adversity through evil report or good report in life or in death infuse the most substantial joys into the soul  our lord therefore says be of good cheer i have overcome the world signifying that we also may overcome again take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly of heart and ye shall find rest to your souls again we are to consider on the one hand that the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment but on the other hand that the righteous will be admitted into life eternal and as we may become righteous by learning of christ that we may neglect no opportunity of becoming such to all the righteous is this blessed assurance given ye shall find refreshment to your souls  now this is the most persuasive of all arguments both to redeem us from sin and to establish us in all righteousness and goodness and truth or  as i was to observe in the next place we should be especially persuaded to search the scriptures because they are able to make us wise unto salvation that is as the apostle means they are fully sufficient to this purpose for here we have the true way to eternal life written in such plain characters that he that runs may read it and here we have the great god represented as ready to be reconciled to us as offering us pardon and acceptance whilst we are yet afar off and as willing and desiring that all may be saved  here again we are not only taught and enabled how to live godly in christ jesus but we are likewise guarded against all iniquity by observing that her steps take hold on hell and we are confirmed supported and held fast in a course of holiness by learning that the reward of holiness will be an eternal inheritance in the heavens and  here we have all those divine promises after which our souls naturally hope established beyond the possibility of failing  we are taught to rely on the faithfulness of the immutable god and jesus the mediator of the new covenant and our sorerunner into the mansions of the blessed has through his own resurrection which was effected by the manifest omnipotent operation of god brought life and immortality to light and demonstrably assured us that because he lives we shall live also and that where he is gone we shall likewise go if we follow his steps  we have here in short every motive direction assistance and encouragement to make us pure and holy in all manner of conversation and every assurance we could wish that we shall not labor in vain in the lord here we see sin divested of its power and hell and death led captives before our eyes and the heavens opened for our reception and glory and honor and immortality descending upon us and as we continue the search we proportionably increase in strength we mount up with wings as eagles we look down upon the world as a transient toy and from the glory that shall hereafter be revealed we are prepared for all events and even willing to depart and be with christ  surely then all these things put together are sufficient to raise our affections to the best goods and to support us through all the various struggles which can await us in running the race that is before us  if we would therefore discover any regard to our immortal interests if we would moreover infallibly secure these interests if we would ever love and be beloved by our heavenly father or if we would procure peace and rest and salvation to our precious souls we must search the scriptures  these are a tree of life to all who rightly use and improve them or a fountain of living water which descended from heaven of which he who drinks shall never thirst these therefore should be estimated above gold above much fine gold and should be always a lamp to our feet and a light to our path  but it may be once more observed as i proposed to show in the last place that the scriptures are never wearisome nor disgusting to the serious reader  this is known to all those who bestow any kind of attention upon them and best known to those who study them the most  it is known at the same time that we become tired of most other writings after we have read them once or twice over  but we may return to the scriptures again and again a thousand times with increasing pleasure and still meet with some object to delight and charm us let any one try for example sake the   th   th   th and   th chapters of johns gospel or our lords parables and other discourses or the apostle pauls description of charity or many of the psalms not to mention an abundance of other particular select passages and he will find that the oftener he reads them the better he is pleased and the more he is inclined to read them again  but let any one make the same trial of any other writings in the world and he will find the consequence to be totally different  other writings indeed are generally so labored formal and systematical that we soon lose all relish for the reperusal of them but in the scriptures the attention is always engaged by native simplicity and beauty and instead of being obliged to turn over some hundreds of pages to come at the discovery of some truth we have the most refreshing truths in almost every page and can never travel far without meeting with that jewel of great price which fully satisfies the soul and swallows up all the affections in the contemplation of it  and whereas other writings can frequently afford no consolation to the dejected mind these are a sovereign remedy for every complaint they pour such a flood of light into the soul concerning the love and grace of god that there can remain nothing to make us greatly uneasy unless we labor under the burden of sin nor can there be any thing in the world to alarm us if we be followers of god as dear children for he will never leave nor forsake his children but will give them light in darkness and be present with them and comfort them at all times  therefore to learn to be such to know that we are such and to be constantly exercising the mind in receiving the glorious privileges of all such must be our most delightful study  and therefore if we would read and not be weary if we would read and rejoice at the same time if we would always read to obtain pleasure and to strengthen and enliven the heart and if whilst we read we would rise above all the crosses and vexations of the world we must repeatedly apply ourselves to search the holy scriptures the psalmist therefore says o how i love thy law it is my meditation all the day and again thou art my hiding place and my shield i hope in thy word  your own reflections may furnish you with many additional observations in support of all those arguments which i have endeavored to lay before you  however from what has been already said i think myself fully justified to conclude that we are under the most forcible and important obligations to apply ourselves to a frequent examination of the scriptures  we cannot otherwise maintain the character of rational beings whilst we profess them to be our rule of life and would consequently be suposed intimately acquainted with them  we cannot otherwise indeed with any consistency call ourselves the disciples of christ by which it is at least implied that we have studied his doctrines and that we look up to them as the standard of our conduct  we cannot otherwise sufficiently reverence the wisdom of god nor give unto him the glory that is due to his holy name for as he above all beings demands our highest praises his will above all other considerations requires our supreme attention our most cheerful acquiescence and our devoutest heartfelt acknowledgments  we cannot otherwise discover any real concern to store our minds with the most satisfying and purifying knowledge  we cannot otherwise adopt the most direct means of emancipating ourselves from the servitude of sin and of becoming perfect in our measure and degree as our heavenly father is perfect  we cannot otherwise make the best preparations for eternity nor worthily regard the goodness forbearance and longsuffering of god which would lead us to repentance and salvation  nor can we otherwise make choice of the most rational and daily improving pleasures pleasures which are never wearisome nor disgusting but continually more and more refreshing strengthening and delightful to the soul  upon those objects therefore which lay us under the strongest obligations our attention should be most intensely fixed  these should take full possession of the mind and exclude every thing inferior when put in competition with them  we should not prefer trifling toys to inestimable jewels nor omit nor neglect doing any thing essential to our safety and happiness to indulge in indolence to escape the ridicule of fools or to avoid any temporary inconveniences  we should seriously and indefatigably endeavor to secure our highest interests to establish the best principles to lay up treasures of wisdom and to be always advancing to perfection in opposition to all the cares vexations and disquietudes of a tumultuous world  we should be ever therefore infinitely grateful to our almighty creator and benefactor for so unspeakable a blessing as the holy scriptures for his great goodness in putting so invaluable a possession into our hands which whilst it peculiarly enriches and ennobles the mind fills it with the most glorious hopes communicates to us the highest comforts and raises us to an immortal and unfading crown of glory  if we should be thankful for that which is least how supremely thankful should we be for that which is greatest or if we should be thankful for those wonderful instincts which lead us to watch over the concerns of this present life if we should be thankful for all those capacities which raise us above the other creatures of this world and for all the passing enjoyments of every passing moment how infinitely more thankful should we be for so unspeakable a gift for so ennobling a treasure as the holy scriptures our clear and unerring guide to all the enjoyments of eternal life  we should bless the god of all wisdom and knowledge the father of mercies the god and father of our lord jesus christ for so precious a gift and inestimable pledge of his love to men  and whilst we reflect that he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the gospel of his grace we should not be unmindful of any of his benefits  we should not abuse the indulgence of his forbearance and longsuffering by a shameful contempt or refusal of it  we should love him with all the heart delight to do his will and be all obedience to his voice  we should therefore repeatedly and seriously consider what answer shall we be able to make at the great day of accounts if we reject his counsel and cast his reproof behind us what justification shall we have to offer in arrest of judgment or how shall we escape if it shall then appear that we fools have despised instruction and neglected his great salvation  but having thus endeavored to show why or for what reasons we should earnestly search the scriptures our next enquiry was to be how or in what manner this is to be done which important object i shall endeavor to illustrate in the following discourses  in the mean time may god give a blessing to what has been said and open our understandings to the things that are true  may our attention be ever fixed upon that wisdom which descended from above and which is infinitely pure benignant and gracious and abounding with every requisite to rejoice the heart  and may we walk worthy the high privileges with which we are favored and the heavenly vocation with which we are called  discourse vi john v    search the scriptures discourse the fourth on this subject having already considered the reasons or arguments why we should pay all due attention to this important and gracious exhortation it now remains that i endeavor to show as was proposed in the second place how or in what manner we shall search the scriptures to the best purpose and so that we may continually profit by the repetition of our enquiries  the direction like many others may be complied with in a certain sense without answering the design of our lord as we may set apart a particular portion of time to any other select exercise or employment and yet for want of a proper attention to the business in which we are engaged be all the while laboring in vain  we may for instance read the scriptures as a task and even submit to the resolution of not allowing a day to pass in which we do not read a determinate number of chapters and yet if in all this labor we have no other view than the acquisition of some distinguished imaginary merit for having merely applied ourselves to such a task we shall constantly finish just where we first began with scarcely advancing a single step in the way of knowledge though we have habituated ourselves a number of years to this practice our lord therefore does not say read but search the scriptures  he never laid a stress upon external services any farther than these were so attended as to become happily instrumental in enlightening the understanding and improving the heart  as he knew that we might hear and cast reproof behind us and that we might call him lord and not obey the will of our heavenly father he knew in like manner that we might read and neither consider regard understand or apply what we read he has therefore guarded us against the abuse or misapplication of his direction in the text as he has at other times guarded us against the abuse or misapplication of his other instructions by requiring us not to repeat or turn over but to search the scriptures and this implies that we examine them with the utmost attention and care and that we acquire as much as possible a general view of the doctrines of the whole as well as consider the force and meaning of each select passage considered in itself  we may read them over an hundred times and not search them as we may pass through a garden an hundred times without taking any particular account of the productions it contains or pass through a cabinet of curiosities an hundred times without knowing or rightly considering the nature value or beauty of any of those articles of which it is composed  we may even in some measure get the scriptures by heart and not search them as we may a particular number of names without attending to the meaning of any one of them singly  to search the attention must be awake some degree of labor and study is required we must take a full view of every object that comes in our way and consider the purposes for which it is presented to us or in other words we must carefully examine all that the scriptures teach us to believe and likewise all the several duties which they teach us to practice and particularly apply these to ourselves as much as we respect them in their general relation to all the children of men  and to this purpose we must search them without prejudice we must search them as they stand connected together we must search them without being under the bias of our passions we must search them not as a matter of curiosity or for the sake of mere science we must search them not as calculated for particular circumstances only but for all circumstances and we must search them early and continually  in the first place if we wish to examine the scriptures to any valuable purpose we must lay aside all prejudice or preconceived opinions concerning them  unless we do this we shall always force them to speak our own sentiments and shall never become much wiser from our acquaintance with them we shall in this case put light for darkness and darkness for light call evil good and good evil and shall always fancy that we find in them whatever favorite opinions we before flattered ourselves they must contain  a roman catholic under this bias will discover in them his purgatory and transubstantiation and even a pagan will discover in them his paganism the one will say did not jesus preach to the spirits in prison and call the bread which he brake his body and the other will say is there not mention made of the gods of the hills and of the valleys a mere shadow will be mistaken by such a one for a reality and his imagination will be so fixed upon this as to annihilate the most positive demonstrations to the contrary for to read the scriptures with prejudice implies that we judge or determine before hand what doctrines they contain and that we read them only to produce in ourselves some show of argument in confirmation of these doctrines  to search the scriptures with prejudice then is in fact a contradiction for by searching them at all it is implied that we seriously enquire what they of themselves clearly require us to believe and practice independently of what all others may have represented them to require and independently of any previous notions which we ourselves may have formed concerning them  in other words we should sit down to the study of the scriptures as to the study of a book containing a revelation from god addressed to all his rational offspring in this world and all the doctrines of which have a certain determinate meaning without any retrospect to the pleasure of any creature  and fully to understand all those truths which they propose to us as these are in themselves we should labor as much as possible to forget all other knowledge and to keep out of sight every particular explication that has been given of them by others we should suppose that there are no such creeds or established articles of faith in the world as have been pretended to be deduced from them and we should take them up as a new book which had never been opened but which we know contains the will of god and we should then endeavor to discover according to their own plain and obviously consistent language what sentiments and practices they universally inculcate what prospects they open to our attentive view and upon what terms they assure us of the everlasting favor and friendship of god it is in this manner only that we can ever justly hope to attain any tolerable knowledge of the scriptures  but those who are under the influence of prejudice see every thing in a wrong light substitute sounds in the place of things catch at phantoms whilst they neglect the substance multiply objects that have no existence and pass over real and important objects that are visible to every eye  hence it is that we have so many sects and parties amongst christians  numbers having been severally taught particular systems and having even been taught that their salvation is concerned in receiving the scriptures as containing those systems have recourse to the scriptures not to learn what these teach but solely to torture them into a confirmation of their own sentiments and thus they continue dividing and wrangling about the shibboleth of a party and deviate all possible ways from the truth instead of harmoniously uniting in asserting their christian liberty in promoting piety and mutual forbearance and in cultivating the universal love of god and man  it is owing to prejudice also that the skeptic is frequently confirmed in his infidelity even by reading the scriptures  because he sits down to read them not to make a fair trial whether they be the will of god or not but to collect arguments to convince him that they are not the evidence of truth therefore leaves no impression upon his mind  he pays no attention to the sublimity of the language the energy of the sentiments the purity reasonableness and perfection of the doctrines or the demonstration of the spirit with power by which they are confirmed for all these things are contrary to the point at which he aims  he fixes upon some figurative passage and insists that it should be literally understood and therefore represents it as absurd and consequently as destitute of any foundation in truth and thus he vainly triumphs in his own weakness whilst he dogmatically rejects without the shadow of argument what he would allow to be fair and rational in any other writings besides these  or if he do not descend so low as to carp at different representations of indifferent things or to controvert facts by starting difficulties about circumstantials or to substitute in the room of sacred truth some mistranslations or mutilated passages or accidental additions of transcribers to the text he will however fix upon some particular historical passages of the same transaction and because one historian only mentions the principal persons concerned in this transaction and another mentions besides these all the persons present it will be pretended therefore that contradictions are discovered and that no credit is due to either of the historians and hence occasion is taken to dispute and explode those facts which are related to us in the same words and with exactly all the same circumstances  but whilst the sacred writings receive this treatment from him the same skeptic will admit every day similar accounts of things from different authors of intelligence without granting or even dreaming that the charge of falsehood should be fixed upon either  if he should read for instance in one greek historian that homer wrote the iliad and in another that homer wrote the odyssey or should he read in one historian that alexander entered asia at a particular time but in another that alexander at the head of a great army entered asia at that time he could easily reconcile all these relations and could not but admit that all the writers spoke truth or if he read in one roman historian that brutus and cassius conspired against julius caesar but in another that brutus and cassius and above sixty senators conspired against caesar and killed him in the senatehouse at rome he would readily allow that the first historian confined his attention to the principal conspirators whilst the other without meaning any contradiction introduced the whole party concerned and he would not think of imputing to either of them the least falsehood or inconsistency  but that which the skeptic will admit to be right and justifiable in all other writings and upon all other occasions he will deride and carp at in the scriptures and the reason we see is as appears from the instances now produced not because the scriptures are liable to the objections he urges against them but because he is under the power of prejudice which disposes him to find fault and leads him to find difficulties in the plainest truths to invert the order of things to involve in darkness the obvious dictates of common sense and to prevent the glory of god by the appearance of jesus christ from shining into our hearts  but again as already hinted it is owing to prejudice that christians hold such contradictory sentiments concerning the peculiar doctrines of the scriptures that the most palpably jarring and diametrically opposite systems have been at different times not only by particular churches but by particular individuals of the same church pretended to be deduced from them and that what one party has confidently presumed to prove another party has as confidently presumed to confute from the same scriptures  the scriptures themselves when fairly examined will not be found to contain contradictory doctrines but it is impossible so to express any thing in any particular language as to put it out of the power of prejudice to pervert and misunderstand it and what we are willing to find and positive that we can find we shall easily be persuaded we have found when we meet with any thing which in sound or at a distance looks at all like it  when therefore one party supposes before hand that such particular doctrines must be true and another party supposes that the quite contrary doctrines must be true and both apply to the scriptures not so much to examine what they declare as severally to confirm their own peculiar notions it is no wonder that those of each party fancy they have discovered something from which they think they may conclude what they determined to conclude at first namely that the scriptures were on their side of the argument for with such persons suppositions will pass for proofs and the most positive evidence in favor of any doctrine will be received as a proof of the contrary in short the crooked will be straight and the straight will be crooked a parable will be read as a history and a history as a parable the plainest precept will be understood ironically and the most figurative language explained literally  to search the scriptures then to any purpose we must suppose nothing beforehand but apply to them for information to be led to the knowledge and practice of every duty or as the apostle peter says as newborn babes we should desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby  newborn babes have no prejudices but are ready to receive knowledge just as it is proposed to them without being thwarted or baffled in their enquiries by any preconceived opinions and exactly with the same dispositions should we endeavor to come to the scriptures to derive any profitable or advantageous instruction from our perusal of them  all other knowledge which concerns us as pilgrims and sojourners here unless it be transcribed from these we should consider as depending on conjectures or founded on political views or at best as fallible and liable to be blended with a mixture of error and imposture  but the pure truths of god are perfect and sufficient and can receive no light nor strength nor efficacy from any human systems and decrees  when we come to study these therefore we should study them as they are in themselves consider them as they lie before us in their native simplicity allow them always to explain themselves and bring ourselves to admit that sense of their several doctrines which we would naturally admit had we no where else any account of these doctrines but that genuine unadulterated account which they give us  and thus should we all shortly come in the unity of the faith unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ for there could be but little room for any disputes about the general sense of scripture were we not previously bewildered by a blind attachment to certain systems of opinions which have been falsely imposed upon the world as containing in the sense of the imposers the very essence of scripture if not something much more infallible and efficaciously enlightening  indeed if we could once rise above the servility of prejudice lay aside all those standards of human pride and presumption which have been erected to determine the sense of the word of god and be prevailed upon to search for the sense of scripture in the scriptures only there would soon be an end of most of those controversies which have distracted the christian world  no questions could then be started about a triune being about birth sin about irresistible grace or an infinite satisfaction about purgatory saint worship and transubstantiation because no such tenets are any where mentioned in the scriptures  nor could any doubt arise concerning the infinite goodness and mercy of god his adorable love in our redemption or that repentance from dead works and holy conversation and godliness which are universally required of men because almost the whole scriptures are taken up with the plainest declarations and the most forcible recommendation of these doctrines  and as to any other differences that might still subsist amongst us concerning the meaning of some particular words or phrases or any inferior concerns these would all soon be swallowed up in that mutual forbearance harmony and love which are so clearly and repeatedly mentioned in the scriptures as absolutely inseparable from the christian life  the apostle therefore said if the gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost that is to those that are lost through their own obstinate prejudices or in whom the god of this world or some other attachment quite opposite to the gospel has blinded their eyes  to the honest and good heart who examines the scriptures as the only way of life every thing at least every thing of importance will be quite easy and he will daily grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ  but whilst we are under the influence of prejudice or resolve to explain the scriptures according to some preconceived opinions of our own or according to certain opinions of others to whom we ascribe the honor of infallibility or whilst we read the scriptures only to confirm some old doctrines or to establish some new doctrines that have suddenly started up in our own imaginations we may be ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth  it is also to be observed that if we would search the scriptures to any purpose we must examine them as they stand connected together we must throw off the bias of our passions and we must not have recourse to them as a subject of mere curiosity nor for the sake of science only but for the illustration of these and of other remaining particulars i must refer you to the following discourses  in the mean time we may learn from what has been said why there are still so many wranglings and angry debates amongst christians so much want of charity and such gross ignorance  it is plain that all those evils are either owing to their not searching the scriptures at all or to their reading them with prejudice or to their entering only into a very partial examination of them for could they be once prevailed upon to conquer their prejudices and to examine the scriptures fairly they must all soon walk in the light and live together in the mutual intercourse of all the lovely affections and of every kind and friendly office  we should then see and feel that charity is the grand distinguishing feature of christians  hence we should be taught to lay aside all wrath and malice  we should again see that the love of god and man or that to love god and keep his commandments is the whole duty of man and the true way to eternal life and that this is the sum and substance of the scriptures from beginning to end  hence all divisions would instantly cease amongst us  making holiness our grand aim and forbearing one another and forgiving one another we would strive together for the faith of the gospel holding fast the word of truth and strengthening and comforting one another in running the race that is before us  hence then we should be persuaded seriously to ask ourselves are we under the influence of any degree of prejudice and if we are what a hateful enemy has the dominion over us  is there one for paul and one for apollos  do we go to the scriptures to vindicate any doctrines of men  do we maintain any doctrines which are never once mentioned in the scriptures  do we believe any doctrines to be the doctrines of scripture only because they have been taught us by some venerable names  or do we make no other use of the scriptures than to force them into a kind of agreement with some particular sentiments which we have either imagined ourselves or received from others  then let us consider that we compliment our own wisdom or the wisdom of others to the disparagement of the divine wisdom  and let us again consider if this be the case what an insult we thus offer to the divine majesty  and let us learn therefore to rely upon the divine wisdom to have recourse to this only as altogether sufficient for our salvation and to trust wholly to it as our alone infallible guide to eternal life  may we always walk according to this rule  may we always thus search the scriptures amen  discourse vii john v    search the scriptures discourse the fifth on this subject to learn how or in what manner we shall search the scriptures to the best purpose i proposed to show thatwe must search them without prejudice that we must search them as they stand connected together that we must not search them according to the bias of our passions that we must not search them as a matter of curiosity or for the sake of mere science that we must not search them as if they were calculated for particular circumstances only and that we must search them early and continually  having already shown in the preceding discourse that we must lay aside all prejudice if we would search the scriptures to our great advantage i now proceed to observe in the second place that if we would make any progress in knowledge by searching the scriptures we must not form our opinion of them from the seeming tendency of particular detached unconnected passages thrown together or that we must not study them in scraps but according to the uniform tenor of them and the relation of each particular passage to the whole context of which it is a part  this is a piece of justice which is due to all writings whatever and which is absolutely necessary to enable us to form any tolerable idea of the sense and spirit of any writings  for who can judge of an history from an accidental extract from it or of a lesson of morality from an imperfect select sentence or halfsentence that may happen to be quoted from it  we must become acquainted with the general views of every author and the principal point he aims at to be able to understand him in particular places and this object can be accomplished only by reading the whole that he has written  we must not therefore single out one text from one place and another text from another place either to acquire any clear sentiments of the grand design of the whole scriptures or of the particular design of either of those texts which we may have selected but to form a right judgment of the whole we must read the whole and to form a right judgment of any particular passage we must carefully observe what gave occasion to it to what persons it is addressed and how it stands connected with what goes before and follows after  if likewise we would have a right apprehension of any particular character we must view the whole of it at once  the same direction must be observed if we would understand any of those divine exhortations that we meet with in the scriptures  in short when any part of a subject occurs of which we would form a right judgment it is necessary to read the whole relating to this subject  if we should touch for instance upon the destruction of the antediluvian world or upon the destruction of sodom and gomorrah afterward to be able to form clear sentiments of the divine justice in those tremendous effects of almighty power we should read the preceding history of the people so destroyed and observe all the reasons why the judgments of god were upon them  again if we would endeavor to understand any one of our lords parables it will not be sufficient to read a part of the parable but we must read the whole at once and likewise enquire into the occasion upon which it was introduced and also into the characters of those to whom it was addressed  and in particular with respect to the epistles of the apostles as each of these had some special point in view in order to form a right judgment of any part of each epistle the whole as mr lock justly observed should be read through at once  the epistles as the same admirable author has observed were letters addressed to particular churches in particular circumstances and as we cannot comprehend the meaning of any common letter by reading only a line or sentence at a time and taking several months to read through the whole neither can we by pursuing the same method comprehend the force and spirit of those sacred letters or indeed of any part of them  but to be sensible of the necessity of attending to the connection which every particular passage of scripture may have with what goes before and follows after some examples will probably furnish the most evincing evidence  if in the first place then we should quote these words of scripture detached from their connection with the context there is no god we should thus strain the scriptures to express an atheistical language but when we observe the connection they have with what goes before we find that the words only contain the stupid assertion of a fool and that as it was a fool who said there was no god the whole passage therefore teaches us the folly of atheism  again by a detached arbitrary quotation from the scriptures we might represent them as declaring that jesus christ was antichrist for we might quote them in this manner jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist but the whole passage runs thus many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist this means whoever of these who were already mentioned and the whole passage therefore teaches that they are deceivers and antichrists who deny that jesus christ is come in the flesh  again when we read in the sixth chapter of genesis that the imaginations of the thoughts of mens hearts were only evil and that continually we are not hastily to conclude that this was intended to be descriptive of every man in the world for we learn a few verses after that noah was a righteous man and perfect in his generation and we learn from the whole history that all those persons the thoughts of whose hearts were only evil and that continually were destroyed for their great wickedness but on the contrary that because noah was a totally opposite character he was for this very reason saved from the general destruction  again in forming our ideas of any particular character we must not determine the whole character from any of its parts nor merely from the examination of any particular feature presume to give the character entire for who for example could form any just idea of the character of david by either hearing that he was the man after gods own heart or the man whom god had chosen to be king or by hearing on the other hand of his conduct toward uriah  by searching the scriptures fairly we shall learn that david was neither a spotless nor yet an altogether diabolical but a very eccentric mixed character at one time very humble and pious at another time revengeful and boisterous and upon the whole distinguishable both for his great virtues and for his great vices  again when we are taught that the lord jesus christ is our savior we are not hence to conclude that the god and father of our lord jesus christ is not likewise originally and supremely our savior for by following our enquiries we shall find that our lord jesus christ did nothing of himself but that all he did was by the power and authority of the father that it was by the direction and good pleasure of the father that the great salvation was revealed which was graciously communicated to us by jesus christ and that it was a faithful and universal obedience to all the fathers commandments in accomplishing the great work of our redemption which according to the fathers appointment has eventually constituted the lord jesus christ our savior or in other words that it is god the fountain of all mercy grace and love who saves us by jesus christ  again when we likewise learn that jesus christ came into the world to save sinners we must egregiously mistake the case if we infer from this that he came into the world to save those sinners who presumptuously continue in their sins for a farther acquaintance with the scriptures will inform us that jesus christ also came to call sinners to repentance to redeem us from all iniquity to purify to himself a peculiar or excellent people zealous of good works and that we must therefore endeavor to be pure and holy or to walk even as he walked to have any part in that great salvation which he has proposed to us though it be true therefore that jesus christ came into the world to save sinners yet we see that the only meaning of this declaration is that he came to turn sinners from dead works to serve the living god that they might thus become qualified for and therefore assuredly obtain the inheritance of the saints in light  again if we return to the examination of historical passages and examine the history of lot and of his two daughters and remember that they were rescued from the destruction which befell the other inhabitants of sodom we are not to conclude that they were altogether righteous because of this circumstance for lot before he left sodom offered to do a thing which was very reproachful to him and rather than having done which he ought to have been willing to have suffered any kind of death and both he and his daughters afterward were guilty of what was very shameful and abominable their whole history therefore fairly examined will lead us to observe that their righteousness was very far from being perfect and that they were to be considered as righteous only in contradistinction to the horrid abomination of the sodomites though in other respects they were found transgressors  and hence we may learn that the righteousness of some of the personages of the old testament sometimes signifies no more than that they were not guilty of the crimes which others committed to whom they are held up as a contrast  again when we consider the character of abraham though upon the whole it was most excellent considering the age of the world in which he lived yet we are not to suppose it absolutely spotless contrary to positive evidence for though he was conspicuously obedient to the divine laws after he became acquainted with them and went and sojourned in a strange land not knowing whither he went yet he was not always a worshipper of the true god but was originally an idolater and though he afterward displayed such great faith in god as justly entitled him all circumstances considered to the appellation of the father of the faithful we are not yet to suppose that his faith never failed him in any particular instance in the affair of hagar he seems so far to have distrusted the divine promise as to suppose that it could not be accomplished in any other way and his faith peculiarly failed him when he meanly denied his wife and hazarded by this denial the most shocking consequences consequences which he should have much more dreaded than the loss of life  whilst we therefore justly admire his faith admire it as unspeakably greater than that of any of his contemporaries and as astonishingly displayed in his readiness to sacrifice his son we should not forget that it was not always quite uniform and we ourselves therefore should watch and pray against temptation  again if we examine the history of jacob though his posterity were chosen to inherit the promise made to abraham and isaac and the posterity of esau were excluded from having any part in it and though the promise made to abraham and isaac were repeated to jacob that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed yet we cannot help observing many dark shades in his character the churlish part which he acted toward his brother when he was faint with hunger the price which he demanded and obtained for a mess of pottage which he should have been willing to have purchased for him and the repeated falsehoods with which he imposed upon his father not to descend to other particulars are far from representing him to us in a favorable light  even the illustrious joseph who surmounted the most trying temptation at the expense of his liberty and of all his apparent worldly interests who preferred all the horrors of a prison to the violation of his duty whose magnanimity and generosity were so conspicuous to his brethren who had sought his life and sold him into slavery who on account of his singular virtues most signally prospered under the divine protection and who in every respect stands high amongst the greatest characters of antiquity was notwithstanding chargeable with some things which he ought not to have done  though his brethren deserved no favor at his hand yet he should not to mortify and punish them nor even to have discovered their present temper have departed from the truth and accused them with being spies when he was fully persuaded that they were not  he should not have assumed the character of a heathen and sworn by the life of pharaoh contrary to that high allegiance which he owed to god and from which no circumstance should have diverted him  he should not have punished his innocent brother benjamin in common with his other brethren by charging him with a theft of which he was not guilty and threatening to reduce him to a state of bondage  nor should he have taken that advantage of the necessities of the people of egypt which the opportunity afforded him to involve them in oppression and slavery and thus to do that which probably laid the foundation of the slavery of his own nation afterward  pharaoh was too powerful before as is evident from the story of the butler and the baker as well as from other circumstances and though joseph owed him much gratitude for raising him to great honor and riches and power yet this gratitude would have been most fully and laudably manifested by his endeavors to impress the king with sentiments of humanity generosity and benevolence instead of arming him with a tremendous power which placed his subjects in the situation of beasts of burden  he should have said  pharaoh you have now a golden opportunity of being enthroned in the hearts of your people of displaying your magnanimity and of compelling all your subjects to love you as their father there is corn enough in egypt to supply all their wants let it be distributed freely or at least let them have it for the price which was formerly received for it  but instead of acting in this manner joseph first purchased all the peoples cattle then all their lands and then their persons and though he afterward restored their seed to sow the lands and allowed them fourfifths of their produce yet the lands continued pharaohs and the people were dispossessed of their property and degraded to a state of vassalage  we see therefore that even joseph was not in all respects a perfect character and therefore that we should take into consideration his entire character his few failings as well as his many and great virtues to form a right estimate of what he was  and thus we should examine all the other characters that are described to us in the scriptures for otherwise we may account their faults a sort of sanction to us and by giving into their weaknesses far exceed them in transgressions whilst we fall greatly below them in their peculiar virtues  and to this purpose we should remember that the failings of great men are recorded in the scriptures not to lead us to indulge in the same failings but on the contrary to guard us against them and to teach us instead of falling by the same temptations to learn from their miscarriage to exert a greater vigilance and circumspection and to rise to greater purity of heart and life we therefore find that in the scriptures no vice of any kind is ever justified in any character and hence we should be taught not to justify and much more not to copy any vice in any character the apostles themselves did not conceal or palliate their imperfections nor authorize us to conceal or palliate them  we should also remember that the imperfections attending some extraordinary characters under the old testament dispensation afford no sanction to christians to run into the same imperfections for we enjoy an incomparably greater light and we have a perfect example proposed to our imitation which we should humbly and earnestly copy whilst we regard the failings of the best men before the gospel dispensation as so many mementos to us showing what the best amongst us must still have been if we had not been favored with the allefficacious light of the gospel  i might have considered the characters of moses job and many others and have gone almost through the whole scriptures in examining doctrinal passages to illustrate the point before us or to show that we can never fully understand the scriptures without considering them as they stand connected together and endeavoring to comprehend the whole that is delivered upon every character and upon every doctrine  but the examples which i have just produced will be sufficient i apprehend to convince us what strange work we should make with the scriptures unless we were to study every subject in entire connection with all its parts  indeed by collecting particular passages or separate mangled sentences fixing upon these an arbitrary sense of our own and reasoning and concluding from them without considering what goes before or follows after we may make out almost any doctrine from the scriptures and pervert the positive and obvious meaning of any books that were ever written  hence it is that faith has so often triumphed over charity that an odium has been cast upon good works and that the greatest barbarities that ever disgraced the human kind have been pretended to be authorized by the scriptures  hence also characters approved upon the whole have been made a standard in every particular case and men have allowed themselves to commit vices that are always condemned because some illustrious men of old had been unhappily surprised into them thus because jacob had been guilty of some unwarrantable practices pretended christians have thought themselves justified in copying him deliberately in these practices not considering that the example of jacob can justify nothing that is wrong that they are furnished with a greater light than he possessed and that they are expressly forbidden some practices against which jacob had no positive law  but whilst we carefully compare one part of scripture with another we may always see our way clear before us at least we can never fall into any mistakes that are repugnant to holiness but must continually advance in the knowledge of the truth whilst the truth shall make us free from the servitude of sin enlighten our understandings and purify and refresh our hearts  i shall only once more observe under this head what i wish to recommend as a rule of great importance that when the general tenor of scripture is decisive concerning any particular doctrine this is to be appealed to as our standard for determining the sense of any select passages which may at first sight appear to have a different aspect as the same fountain sends not forth sweet water and bitter what moses and the prophets what christ and the apostles clearly and harmoniously proclaim in a thousand texts they must be supposed to proclaim universally we should never enter into the supposition that a few obscure texts may contradict the thousand nor explain the thousand by them but explain them by the thousand assured that if they be really parts of scripture they must contain precisely the same doctrine  according to this rule the divine unity will be fully and irreversibly established for the unequivocal language of the whole scriptures is that there is only one god one creator one unchangeable and everlasting sovereign who has no equal peer or competitor who is the god and father of all and the god and father of our lord jesus christ who therefore could not be born could not die could not grow in wisdom and stature could not be weary nor hungry nor thirsty could not suffer pain nor anguish nor sorrow could not bow before the throne of another nor be indebted to another for all his wisdom and power and strength nor be compounded of different persons or of different beings surely then this universal language is not to be overthrown by one spurious text   john v   and three or four mistranslated texts which very texts as they stand are far from expressing the doctrine for which they are adduced and according to this rule we shall acquire the clearest views of the terms of our acceptance with god of his great love in reconciling us to himself and of all the important leading doctrines of scripture  but to accomplish the object proposed to us by the requisition in the text it will be farther necessary that we search the scriptures not according to the bias of our passions nor out of curiosity as a matter of mere science nor as if they were calculated for particular circumstances only but as the source of our greatest comfort and richest treasure in all circumstances  the mist of passion is as great an obstruction to our progress in knowledge as the worst kind of prejudice and is indeed one of the principal feeding springs of prejudice itself mere knowledge also unless our practice be correspondent with it can be of no real use to us and unless we perceive the importance of the scriptures to us in all circumstances we shall be apt to neglect them entirely or shall reap but little advantage from them when we accidentally make them a part of our study but i shall again resume the discussion of these particulars upon which we have not sufficient time to enlarge at present  let us be taught in the mean time if we have hitherto made only a partial examination of the scriptures or formed our judgment of the whole only from the sound of particular passages to pursue for the future a very different conduct and most carefully and attentively to compare one part with another  thus we shall clearly discern the spirit of the whole and of all its parts and continually increase in divine knowledge  and thus the more we read the word of god the more shall we perceive that it was planned by infinite wisdom and that in this as in all his works he is the god of order harmony and love  discourse viii john v    search the scriptures discourse the sixth on this subject after considering our obligations to search the scriptures i proposed to point out the best methods to be observed in order to search them to our profit and advantage  to this purpose i first noticed that we must lay aside all prejudices or preconceived opinions concerning them and secondly that we should not form our sentiments of them from the seeming tendency of particular detached unconnected passages nor study them in scraps nor in half sentences but as they stand connected together  i now proceed to observe in the third place that we must search the scriptures not according to the bias of our passions but with an ingenuous disposition of mind endeavoring to be as willing to discover and relinquish our own failings as to receive fresh light and strength toward establishing us in upright sentiments and practices  it needs scarcely be observed that we are all without the utmost caution liable to a variety of deceptions and apt to indulge a precipitate confidence in our own judgment in many cases where we are palpably wrong  each of us may observe in some of our acquaintance an obstinate perseverance in particular practices which are so plainly reproachful to them as we think must constantly strike themselves with the most forcible conviction and yet we may find these persons not at all ashamed of their conduct but ready to vindicate it upon every occasion and ready perhaps to condemn those who run not with them into the same excess of folly  when any such instances occur each of us should put these serious questions to himself may not i likewise whilst i cherish an overweening conceit of myself be under the same blindfold delusion in some respects in which those whom i condemn appear to me to be under in other respects and may there not be in me some sins which i am at present far from esteeming such and to which i am particularly attached for no other reason than this that they most easily beset me and the conclusion arising from these reflections ought to be let me examine all my own practices one by one and see whether there be not some of these which i now pursue and vindicate which i would as warmly oppose were it not for that strong affection which i have contracted for myself through a perversely indulged habit and inclination  passion which is the principal foundation of prejudice disorders the whole intellectual frame and must therefore necessarily mislead and deceive us  the apostle peter therefore informs us that before we can receive any benefit from the word of truth we must lay aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and evil speakings  the man who is determined upon malicious practices will never it is evident pay any regard to those lessons of love which are inculcated in the scriptures neither will that honesty sincerity disinterested joy in anothers welfare and that precept to render to all their dues which are so forcibly recommended to us in the scriptures have any influence upon the mind which is previously resolved to practice the arts of deceit and hypocrisy and envy and malice  in like manner he who makes money the first object of his pursuits and is fixed in his purpose to hold it fast will never be taught liberality from the scriptures  nor can he again who is predisposed at all events to gratify any of his inordinate lusts be ever persuaded from the scriptures to live soberly righteously and godly  indeed such a one is absolutely incapable of discerning the ugly features of his own character  because he is selfwilled he is therefore out of the reach of all conviction  because he delights in his iniquity all its malignant qualities are concealed from his view and he either will not hear or but slightly regard any motives that can be urged against him  in short any shuffling excuse will satisfy him  because he is frail and therefore liable to involuntary errors he will hence reconcile himself to known enormous transgressions and if at the same time he shows a just abhorrence of other vices to which he has no temptation nor any particular propensity his heart will be at ease and he will flatter himself that he is acceptable to god and that he should be so to his fellow creatures  this circumstance is most strikingly represented in the character of david king of israel  his heart smote him when he cut off the skirt of readiness garment though saul at the same time hunted him for his life  who then could have ever suspected such a one of brutal violence against unoffending innocence  who could have supposed him capable of laying a scheme to take away the life of a faithful servant  but david we again find discovered the utmost indignation and the most implacable resentment against the supposed plunderer of a poor man who robbed him of his own ewe lamb  yet the same david was guilty of a more aggravated instance of oppression and violence was guilty of the complicated crimes of murder and adultery without appearing to feel any great remorse  in the one case we see he had no passion to bias him in the other case he was blinded and rendered insensible by the whirlwind of his passion and it would appear from the parabolical address to him upon this occasion that had the prophet directly accused him of real crimes he might great as they were have made light of all his remonstrances nay he was possibly capable at this time of reading a pathetic lecture to others against his own crimes without bringing the charge home to himself or if he thought of his own particular case he might have invented such a number of alleviating circumstances as would in his opinion have almost entirely exculpated him  hence then we should be taught to consider the dreadful effects of being under the delusion of passion and how useless any instructions must be to us whilst we are subject to its tyrannical influence  and totally to subdue all our passions and to enable us to read the scriptures with candor and impartiality and a full scrutiny into our own hearts we should consider that nothing is the less criminal in itself because we are the persons guilty of it that what is criminal in one is equally criminal in all who are exactly in the same circumstances of light and knowledge and that neither our inclinations nor our interests can alter the nature of lying extortion debauchery and injustice or of any other vice  in short because we may be at present reconciled to particular practices or averse to particular duties or strongly convinced of the truth of particular opinions we should not therefore pronounce such practices innocent nor such duties unreasonable nor such opinions incontestible much less should we upon this presumption either search the scriptures to endeavor to persuade ourselves that they do not forbid such practices or to explode or find fault with them where they do or to be confirmed in the belief that they excuse our compliance with such duties or that they justify such particular opinions but we should first seriously coolly and impartially consider what the scriptures themselves say after we have carefully compared one part with another and then heartily appeal to our own hearts are not all those opinions which they teach in perfect consistency with the wisdom of god and are not all those duties which they inculcate altogether worthy of him to require and every way becoming man to perform and is it not essential to our true dignity and happiness to walk exactly according to that pattern which they hold up to view as the standard of our imitation  in this manner we should soon see the beauty perfection and excellence of every line of that wisdom which descended from above and whilst we perceived by a happy experience that our understandings were enlightened we should gradually find that all our lusts were mortified and subdued i repeat the sentiment that if we would first deliberately search the scriptures to observe what doctrines they clearly reveal and then seriously appeal to our own hearts are not such doctrines reasonable and every way worthy of us there is not a single vice which they condemn which we would not also condemn nor a single virtue which they enforce which we would not also approve  but passion like a tempest at sea will carry us out of the way that we should go will cast us headlong when we expect to move on steadily and whether we will or not will roll its billows over us and if it increase or continue will frustrate all our endeavors to resist it and at last leave us a melancholy wreck on the shore of destruction  this observation might be illustrated at large by examining various passages of scripture and considering the various senses which different men of opposite opinions have put upon them and by again considering the uniform and obvious sense which all sober impartial and dispassionate persons would naturally put upon them  but without enlarging upon this head i shall now proceed to show in the next place that to build ourselves up firmly in our most holy faith we should also learn not to search the scriptures as a matter of curiosity or for the sake of mere science for if we search them only with this view or just to obtain the insignificant honor of being able disputants or the paltry triumph of quibbling sophists we might as well have been engaged in mathematical problems or in arithmetical calculations or in any other speculative investigations whatever  we need only consider in proof of this the grand original design of the scriptures as the highly benevolent purpose of almighty god in furnishing us with those rich treasures which they contain  and this was we know not to amuse but edify not to teach us philosophy nor to rack our thoughts with deep speculations but to teach us to know ourselves not to make us expert in subtle distinctions and concise and elegant reasonings but to make us ashamed of vice to abhor it and fly from it nor to enlighten the understanding only or communicate mere knowledge to men but to reform purify and establish their hearts  mere knowledge puffs up genders pride and other evil passions and produces envy and aversion  but that knowledge which is reduced to practice which is applied to awaken and diffuse all the good affections to extricate the mind from the bondage of corruption and to produce in us the likeness of our great original is alone edifying and venerable and should ever engage our earnest attention and pursuit  we learn accordingly as i have particularly shown in a former discourse that the scriptures were given us to make us wise to salvation to give us such an amiable and endearing view of all the divine perfections as should lead us to love adore and serve our almighty sovereign by the best precepts and the best examples to ennoble and perfect our nature to emancipate us from every debasing folly and practice to remove our imperfections to rescue us from every corruption to elevate us to the possession of real greatness and to yield peace and hope and joy and everlasting life to our heavenborn souls  we should therefore search the scriptures purely with this view to this most important purpose we should apply every particular doctrine that they offer to our consideration  we should remember that they are communicated by the father of lights and we should gratefully regard them as that living bread which came down from heaven  we should read them therefore to enliven and nourish our better part to immortalize those spirits which god has given us to awaken our consciences to impress the divine image upon our hearts to inspire us with patience and resignation to all the divine appointments to prepare ourselves to be always ready to appear before the awful tribunal of judgment on the last day and to constrain us to love one another even as christ loved us that as he now lives we may live also and reign and triumph with him for ever  at every repeated exhortation that we read or hear or that at any time comes across our thoughts we should ask ourselves is this exhortation suited to our circumstances does that vice belong to us which it is calculated to heal or are we destitute of that virtue which it authoritatively recommends  and whilst on the one hand we are charmed with the loveliness of truth made to admire the grandeur and beautiful proportion of every principle of goodness and shocked at the deformity irregularity and forbidding features of every species of iniquity we should endeavor on the other hand to confirm every holy resolution and virtuous practice by attentively surveying all the pleasures of religion and by constantly calling to mind the threatenings denounced against all impenitent sinners and all the divine promises to the righteous is this or that threatening we should say directly pointed against us or is this or that promise revealed in our favor and as we continue our enquiries we should be constantly searching our own hearts that we may daily advance more and more to all that perfection which the scriptures require and to which they so powerfully lead  thus the lord said to joshua this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein continually that thou may observe to do according to all that is written for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success  thus we likewise find that the psalmist considered the word of the lord not as a matter of curiosity and amusement or an object to entertain or employ the attention of speculative men but as what aimed at infinitely higher purposes and what therefore should be always particularly applied to these purposes he therefore says thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light unto my path  but how much greater still is the light which we enjoy in that additional revelation with which we have been favored since the days of the psalmist and how much more earnestly should we apply it to the gracious purpose for which it was bestowed we should take it up as the light from heaven and say heavenly father guide us by this light to heaven  we should resolve to be directed by it to that other glorious world which it opens to our view  we should regard all the things that belong to our peace  we should lay aside every weight and the sins that more easily beset us  we should take christs yoke upon us and learn of him and find rest to our souls  the next observations which i proposed to make were that when we search the scriptures we should consider them as applicable to us in all circumstances we should endeavor to investigate the meaning of the more obscure passages by those that are plain and easy we should be directed in our enquiries by those other lights which god has given us we should distinguish between mere history and that which comes under the denomination of revelation and we should search them early and continually  i had no thoughts at first of extending the subject to so great a length but it is as copious as it is important and as we cannot well bestow too much pains upon it i should hope that some farther observations will be read with patience and candor  let us learn in the mean time to lay our minds open to all the sacred impressions of truth and let us pray for a dispassionate temper for pious heavenly affections and for an universal attention to the things that belong to our peace lest when it might be expected that we should be in the capacity of becoming teachers to others we ourselves shall be found ignorant of the first principles of the oracles of god  and may this supremely glorious being of his infinite mercy do for us abundantly above all that we are able to ask or think through jesus christ our lord  discourse ix john v    search the scriptures discourse the seventh on this subject in endeavoring to show in what manner we must search the scriptures to derive the greatest advantage from them i have already observed that we must lay aside all prejudice or preconceived opinions concerning them that we must not form our sentiments of them from the seeming tendency of particular detached sentences but study them as they stand connected together that we must not be influenced by the bias of our passions and that we must not search them as a matter of curiosity or for the sake of mere science but with a view to the growing improvement and felicity of our minds  i now proceed to observe in the next place that we must not search them as calculated for particular circumstances only but as adapted for our benefit in all circumstances  if we conceive of them as of use to those only who labor under depressed circumstances to soothe and feed them with better hopes but not necessary to those who are surrounded with the blessings of friendship ease affluence and power we shall find them but a dull book  we cannot be deeply interested in that which we persuade ourselves has no material relation to our own concerns nor can we therefore feel the force of any of those consolations which such an object is suited to raise  neither upon this supposition when it comes to be our turn to be those persons for whose benefit we think the scriptures are properly adapted can we derive from them that imagined relief and comfort with which we may have before absurdly flattered ourselves  the man who can reconcile himself to the study of the scriptures in the hour of adversity only will then find them load him with the most stinging reproaches for his past inattention to them and will then see if he seriously consider them that it has been owing to his neglect of them in his prosperity that his present distress is so great as it is for had he previously delighted in the divine testimonies and made them his counselors he would find the light of gods countenance shining upon him in the most overwhelming calamities therefore the psalmist said thy statutes have been my song in the days of my pilgrimage  besides it is a serious study of the scriptures which throws the greatest blessings into a scene of prosperity they lift the soul to god as the author of every good and perfect gift they impress us with the highest gratitude for all his blessings they teach us humility and moderation and so make us satisfied from ourselves they form us to an acquiescence in the divine good will and pleasure and thus prepare us for all the succeeding changes of our being  and for these reasons we see that they are necessary to us at all times with this view therefore we should apply to them continually that we may never apply to them in vain and that when we mostly need those animating refreshments which they afford we may find them flow upon us beyond our most enlarged expectations  thus shall we find them support us in the vale of adversity as well as on the summit of riches and in the dissolving struggles of death as well as in the perfection of health and strength and thus whilst we think most honorably of the scriptures shall we truly rejoice in those distinguishing privileges which they propose to all ranks and conditions of men and esteeming them our best treasure shall be rightly prepared for making that improvement of them which we ought to make  thus the poor will rejoice to find that the gospel is preached to them  thus the rich also will cheerfully submit to that humility to which they are called in hope of the glory which shall hereafter be revealed  thus the wise as well as the unlearned and the jew as well as the gentile and all people of all nations from the highest to the lowest will perceive the propriety and energy of that appellation which is given them by the apostle paul namely that they are the grace of god which has appeared bringing salvation unto all men teaching them that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts they should live soberly and piously in this present world looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and of our savior jesus christ  but whilst we injuriously consider them as a partial dispensation of god that was never intended for universal benefit or only designed to serve the interests of some individuals arbitrarily to save a certain determinate number of the human species and as arbitrarily to reprobate all the rest what joy can they then pour into their hearts what sacred veneration can we then entertain for them can we then indeed seriously esteem them the wisdom of god or if we can what debasing sentiments must we then form of his supreme majesty how infinitely must we dishonor and blaspheme his holy name we cannot in this case rejoice in him as the father of mercies we cannot rejoice in him as gracious accessible and disposed to extend his rich salvation to all his creatures we cannot look up to him with that grateful homage and with that adoring complacency as when we behold him calling all men every where to repent instructing the wise as well as giving understanding to the simple and revealing himself without any exception the infinite god of infinite love to every rational being under heaven  to search the scriptures then to any purpose or rightly to understand heartily to embrace seriously to apply and truly to admire and love those divine instructions which they contain we should consider them as indeed they are not calculated for particular circumstances only but for all circumstances and as offering the best comforts and the most invaluable treasures peace and reconciliation with god our father to all ranks and conditions of men and every time we refer to them for instruction admonition and spiritual meditations we should say to ourselves here is a jewel of great price our dearest companion in sickness and in health the great gift of heaven to guide us through all the travails of life and our only infallible light to glory and honor and immortality  i would observe in the next place and this demands our greatest attention that when we search the scriptures we should endeavor to investigate the meaning of the more difficult passages by those that are plain and easy  it would be truly astonishing if there were not some things hard to be understood in the scriptures  addresses which had a relation to peculiar prevailing customs and which came with a most awakening energy to persons acquainted with such customs must necessarily become abstruse when those customs are disused or forgotten  besides the variety of changes to which all languages are liable and the different ideas which are successively annexed to different words and to the same words in different ages without a constant divine inspiration must render many things obscure in all ancient writings whatever  but it is to be observed that the difficulties which occur in the scriptures are not without their use they serve to awaken our attention to rouse us to consideration and enquiry to exercise the genius of the most wise and learned and therefore lead us to a more frequent intercourse with the sacred contents of the scriptures than if the whole were so easy as to be perfectly understood by reading them over once or twice  but here it is again to be observed that the beauty and excellency of the scriptures consist in this that the way of salvation which is there proposed to us is perfectly intelligible to persons of the meanest capacity indeed to all persons whatever who are but a degree removed from a state of idiotism  when we either recapitulate the perfections of the great jehovah or describe those terms of pardon and reconciliation which he here offers to our acceptance every one must understand what sentiments are intended to be conveyed every one must know what is meant by the terms when we learn that there is only one true and living god that he is the creator and preserver of all things that he is the author of all our benefits and enjoyments that he is good to all that his tender mercies are over all his works and that he is gracious forbearing and longsuffering to the children of men and not willing that any should perish but that all should come unto him and be saved  again every one must know what is meant when we are informed that sin is displeasing to the holy majesty of heaven and that therefore as we have all sinned we should all forsake our sins or repent and be converted that our sins may be blotted out  every one also must clearly perceive what is meant by lying swearing covetousness extortion malice pride envy deceit contention drunkenness adultery murder and other works of darkness and what is meant when we are told that none who continue in the practice of these vices shall inherit the kingdom of heaven but shall be punished with eternal death  nor can any one be a stranger to what is understood by humility meekness compassion mercy prayer and praise to god the doing to all others as we would that they should do to us and the delighting in all the commandments of god  again when we learn that god will turn unto us if we turn unto him that he will never leave us nor forsake us if we sincerely endeavor to obey him that he will not suffer his servants to be tempted above what they are able and that if we love him and keep his commandments death will not put an end to our being but that he who raised up christ from the dead will likewise cause us to live beyond this world will make us to live for ever in the heavenly mansions i say when any of these declarations are proposed to us the dullest understanding must clearly comprehend the force and spirit of them  when this then is the case when the way of life is obvious to all and level to the very lowest capacity what reason have we to complain of any of those difficulties which so frequently occur in the scriptures  or if we wish to surmount any of those difficulties or to acquire any tolerable knowledge of them what other rational method can we propose to ourselves than to compare and explain them according to those passages which are unquestionably plain and obvious  but it is preposterously absurd to explain what is clear and what does not want explaining by what is doubtful and therefore uncertain or to explain or rather to explain away the simplest truths by understanding literally a highly figurative passage which being literally understood is a contradiction to our senses this would be as ridiculous and absurd as to explain a living language by a dead one or as to pervert the sense of a language which we do understand by interpreting it according to some random guesses of our own concerning a language of which we are perfectly ignorant  yet such is the strange method which those christians take who attempt to explain or to explain away all the most plain and incontestable doctrines of scripture by bringing them to the standard of an arbitrary sense which they have affixed to some of the obscurest passages in the apostle pauls epistles  this is the more to be wondered at as his brother peter has expressly guarded us against such erroneous practices having an eye at the same time to those very difficult passages of pauls epistles  peter had been recommending to his fellow christians the most holy conversation and godliness as the only stable foundation which they could lay of building themselves up into eternal life  this he likewise informs them was the constant doctrine of the apostle paul though some had perversely explained him as meaning the contrary  he therefore warns us whenever we meet with any difficulties in pauls epistles that these are never to be understood to give any encouragement to the sinner we says he according to gods promise look for a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that we look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction ye therefore beloved seeing that ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ  now here we may observe that whatever be the difficulties which occur in the apostle pauls writings there are none of them to be so explained as to lead us to believe that god is not willing that all should be saved nor are any of them to be so explained as to give countenance to those who continue in their sins but that we are to consider the whole of them when rightly understood as unitedly directing us to be without spot and blemish to be prepared for our lord at his coming  we may again observe that the unstable who put a perverse construction upon the doctrines of the apostle paul are united with the unlearned by the apostle peter to show us that when they are willing to return again to their beloved lusts it is not so much the fault of the understanding as the fault of the heart which leads them to represent paul as expressing a doctrine that is not according to godliness  besides the apostle james has also guarded us against an immoral interpretation of what his brother apostle says concerning our being saved by faith and shown us that in this he never intended that good works were to be excluded as having no connection with the faith of the gospel by observing in positive language that no faith whatever without good works can procure any man the favor of god  hence then we should learn that as holiness is the grand obvious and leading doctrine of the scriptures every part of them consistently understood must be in perfect harmony with this that we should therefore cultivate the greatest acquaintance with all those passages which most clearly and positively inculcate this and that whilst any passage seems to convey to us a contrary meaning we remain in the dark concerning the meaning of the passage and should either put a different construction upon it from what it at first view seems to bear or if we cannot thus render it intelligible should assure ourselves that it is a mistranslation or a corruption introduced by some ignorant transcriber  it is obvious as i have said to the most cursory observer that holiness is the grand leading doctrine of the scriptures and as this is that doctrine which is universally inculcated with the greatest solemnity and perspicuity this therefore is to be our constant key to the meaning of every part of scripture  thus we shall be persuaded that our being saved by faith can never imply that we can be saved according to the doctrines of the gospel without walking according to the laws of the gospel  thus we shall perceive that those passages which are most hard to be understood can never consistently with the whole warrant us to indulge in the least violation of the divine laws  thus we shall clearly see that to honor christ is to honor the father who sent him and that to love christ is to keep his commandments as the grateful dependents beneficiaries and redeemed children of our father and likewise that all that christ has done and suffered for us is so far from encouraging us to continue in sin that it is intended on the contrary to be the most powerful and effectual incentive to animate us by a patient continuance in well doing to lay hold on the crown of eternal life  i might particularly illustrate this point by a variety of instances which would lead us to the obvious sense of many noble passages of scripture  but leaving you to make an application of what has been said to these purposes i shall proceed in another discourse upon this subject to mention some remaining particulars which must necessarily engage our attention to prosecute with success the divine study which i have been recommending  in the mean time let us learn to explore the sense of the more difficult passages from those which are so plain that none but the wilfully blind can misunderstand or misapply them and as the great god has revealed himself that we may grow up into his likeness and be qualified for the joys of his heavenly kingdom let us principally apply ourselves to this grand object and labor by an holy conversation to obtain the divine favor and all those unspeakably glorious rewards which await every true and faithful servant  discourse x john v    search the scriptures discourse the eighth on this subject i first attempted from these words to point out our indispensable obligations to observe the direction which they contain these obligations then being once established we should hence be naturally disposed to attend to the proper methods to be pursued in searching the scriptures to our great advantage  and to this purpose i observed that we should first lay aside all prejudice or preconceived opinions concerning them secondly that we should not deduce our sentiments concerning them from the seeming tendency of particular detached passages or halfsentences but study them as they stand connected together thirdly that we should not search according to the bias of our passions but with an ingenuous disposition of mind being as willing to discover and relinquish our own failings as to receive fresh light and strength toward confirming ourselves in upright principles and practices fourthly that we should not search the scriptures as a matter of curiosity or for the sake of mere science fifthly that we should not search them as if they were calculated for particular circumstances only but for all circumstances and once more that we should endeavor to investigate the meaning of the more difficult passages by those that are plain and easy  these particulars having been already explained in as brief and intelligible a manner as i was able i now proceed to observe in the next place that we should also in searching the scriptures be directed by those other lights which god has given us  contradictions it is most evident can never proceed from the god of all wisdom and truth and light and knowledge as the same fountain cannot send forth sweet water and bitter much less can the only perfect being in the universe deny himself  but conscience we should remember is the gift of god  he therefore can have given us no other laws which oblige us to violate the express declarations of conscience  he can never command us by a different authority to put what we think darkness for light or what we think light for darkness or to worship him in a manner that is repugnant to the clear dictates of conscience  reason also is the gift of god it is that primary light of heaven which he has given to be the light of every man in the world  he therefore can never require us by any revelation to believe things which are diametrically opposite to reason he can never require us to believe that one being is another being that he who is greater than another is only equal to another that he who did nothing of himself did all things of himself that he who sent another being is that other being whom he sent or that there is no difference between three and one or between one and three nor can he ever require us to believe that bread is flesh or that wine is blood or that a living being held himself dead in his own hands and put himself dead into his own mouth nor that the same individual body is wholly taken by millions of persons at the same time and that each of these persons has a whole body to himself whilst there is but one body broken and entire for them all neither can he require us to believe that holiness is necessary to our salvation and at the same time of no importance to us but to be rather estimated as filthy rags forbidding and odious  the scriptures were never intended to hoodwink or silence our consciences but to awaken and enlighten them nor to oppose or render our reason useless but to direct and strengthen it  we should not endeavor therefore to stifle conscience and reason when we are searching the scriptures nor suppose that the language of the one is contrary to that of the other but should examine the scriptures by our reason and judge by our reason what they say thus the apostle paul says prove all things he means by reason that gift of god that is born with us and hold fast that which is good namely that which to our impartial reason appears to be so and it is only by following his advice that we can acquire any tolerable and consistent knowledge of the scriptures nay it is reason alone which can satisfy us that god is their author but the farther we advance in our researches into them by the assistance of this luminous guide the more shall we see and know that they are the wisdom of god and the power of god in our progress every doctrine will still more forcibly approve itself to our unprejudiced reason and we shall find no practice forbidden there which our reason does not also forbid nor any practice authorized there which our reason does not also authorize and applaud  the apostle therefore says the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit  reason and scripture therefore should always go hand in hand in our enquiries after truth that we may know the truth and that the truth may make us free  but if we once renounce our reason we give up ourselves an easy prey to all imposture and wickedness and may have our minds so darkened as even under the imaginary sanction of scripture to blaspheme the most obvious and important doctrine of scripture and to turn the whole into scorn and ridicule but without saying any more upon this head  i shall briefly observe in the next place that we should distinguish between the historical and genealogical parts of scripture and those which immediately relate to our conduct and which were graciously revealed for our benefit and salvation  all scripture that is given by inspiration is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness  but we need not suppose that the history of journies famines wars marriages and genealogies were given us by inspiration because the writers either from their own knowledge or from the narratives of others were sufficiently qualified to furnish such histories without any supernatural knowledge  besides as all scripture which is given by inspiration is profitable for doctrine for reproof etc it hence follows that those parts which convey no instruction of any kind in which neither virtue nor vice nor the supreme governor of the world nor a future state of rewards and punishments are mentioned such as the book of esther and the song of solomon can have no claim to inspiration besides also in the historical parts of scripture there are some practices related and allusions introduced which though inoffensive in former ages would be thought indelicate to be held up to view at present and as the whole ceremonial law of moses with respect to us is now abolished the study of it no farther concerns us than as a matter of speculation which can only indirectly edify us as a contrast to the perfection of the gospel  in short those parts of scripture which indispensably demand our earnest attention and enquiry are those which teach us the doctrines of the kingdom of heaven which display to us the divine perfections and our own obligations which describe the wretchedness of the sinner and the happiness of the righteous which point out to us the way of life which give us the victory over sin and death and lead us to glory and honor and immortality these we should search daily with all care and diligence that we may grow up into the divine likeness that we may obtain that peace which the world cannot give and have an entrance administered to us into the inheritance of the saints in light  i shall once more observe that there are many passages of the scriptures which are erroneously translated against which you have no immediate remedy without comparing one passage with another and concluding that if any passage be a contradiction to itself or to other plain passages that is likely to be a mistranslation it will be a high gratification to all the lovers of truth to learn that a new translation of the bible is now in great forwardness which from the approved learning and profound judgment of the gentlemen engaged in it promises to rectify almost every mistake in our present translation and to render the english scriptures much more edifying and delightful than we at present find them the generous services of such men are of more importance than thousands of volumes upon metaphysics and politics they are friends to our best interests their object is to unfold to us the pure truths of god as they lie before them in the original scriptures they are therefore entitled to our admiration and gratitude and should be affectionately esteemed for their labors of love  thus when we read in galatians him who called you to another gospel which is not another we may be sure that the passage is mistranslated for another and not another is a contradiction to itself again when we read in the first epistle of john we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ we may also perceive that the translation is erroneous because a different being from him that is true must have been intended by the son of him that is true the passage therefore should have been rendered we are in him that is true by his son jesus christ  but passing over a variety of passages of less consequence i shall just mention some words which are always improperly and sometimes absurdly translated the word charity in our language means nothing more than almsgiving and conveys a very different meaning from the import of the word which is rendered charity by our translators of the new testament we should always therefore instead of charity read love in like manner we should disuse the word grace which is a latin term and to which an unintelligible meaning is frequently affixed and instead of this should always read favor as the word ghost also conveys the idea of a phantom we shall do well if instead of the words holy ghost we were always to read holy spirit  but what i particularly wish to notice is the word which in the original always signifies demon or demons but which our translators have very absurdly though universally rendered devil or devils  by a demon the jews understood a departed spirit and as when any person was afflicted with madness or the epilepsy they always considered such a one as possessed of a demon to be possessed of a demon therefore always signified with them that the person thus said to be possessed was afflicted with madness or the epilepsy but the word which in the original signifies devil is very different from this and as that difference which subsisteth in the original should be also discoverable in the translation to enable us to distinguish all those passages in which the one from all those in which the other term occurs i shall now first enumerate every passage of the new testament in which the word devil is to be found in the new testament and in which alone therefore it ought to have any place in the translation  these are matt iv           xiii     xxv    luke iv             viii    john vi  0  viii     xiii   acts x     xiii  0 ephesians iv     vi      timothy iii          timothy ii     iii   tit ii   heb ii    james iv     pet v     john iii    0 jude   rev ii  0  xii       xx    0 then was jesus led to be tempted of the devil  the devil takes him into the holy city  then the devil takes him into an exceeding high mountain  then the devil leaves him  the enemy is the devil  the devil and his angels to be tempted of the devil  the devil said unto him  the devil takes him into an high mountain  the devil said unto him  when the devil had ended the temptation then comes the devil and takes away  one of you is a devil  ye are of your father the devil  the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot  healing all that were oppressed of the devil  thou child of the devil  neither give place to the devil  the wiles of the devil  the condemnation of the devil  the snare of the devil  slanderers in the original devils  the snare of the devil  not false accusers this also should have been not devils  him that had the power of death that is the devil  resist the devil  your adversary the devil  he that commits sin is of the devil  for the devil sins from the beginning  for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil  the children of the devil  contending with the devil  the devil shall cast some of you into prison  the old serpent called the devil  the devil is come down unto you  serpent the devil  the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire   on the other hand there are above sixty passages in the new testament in which the words demon and demons according to the original are in our english version rendered devil and devils these i shall set down below mat vii     ix        x    xi     xii           xvii     mark i        iii        vi     vii        0  ix     xvi       luke iv           vii     viii       0           ix          x     xi              0  xiii     john vii  0  viii           x  0       cor  0  0       timothy iv    james ii     rev ix  0 in all these passages we should read demon instead of devil and demons instead of devils we should also read matt viii    the demons besought him mark v    all the demons besought luke viii    he was driven of the demons into the wilderness rev xvi    the spirits of demons and xviii   the habitations of demons as the writers of the new testament seem to have used the words  and  as synonimous terms it would not be of any consequence to point out the difference between the one word and the other the first is used in above sixty passages and the second in only five passages of the new testament  in the following passages also we should read instead of possessed with devils or possessed with a devil possessed with demons or possessed with a demons mat iv     viii           ix     xii     xv     mark i     v           luke viii     john x     there is besides one passage james iii    which is rendered devilish which should be rendered demoniacal and there is even one passage acts xvii    which is rendered gods which ought to have been rendered demons in the original it is a setter forth of strange demons the rest of our translators would have been much discomposed if one of them had substituted god instead of demon it is very strange then that they could have translated strange gods instead of strange demons or that they should in one passage render the same words gods which in every other passage they very improperly rendered devils   i have now finished the view which i proposed to recommend to your notice concerning the best methods we can pursue in our search of the scriptures and have at the same time endeavored to be as brief as i could be consistently with perspicuity  the rules which i have laid down you see are obvious and easy and such as i cannot help supposing every rational person must allow to be absolutely necessary to our forming a right judgment of any writings whatever  your own reflections may furnish you with many additional observations  i shall beg leave however to remind you again of such as we have been considering and which are i think sufficient if not to lead us to the precise meaning of every particular passage of scripture to give us notwithstanding such a thorough knowledge of the whole as will enable us to walk at all times in the way that we should go  we should then as i have shown search the scriptures without prejudice or without forcing them to bend to any preconceived opinions of our own concerning them  we should form our sentiments of them not from any particular detached broken passages but study them as they stand connected together  we should not search them according to the bias of our passions but with an ingenuous disposition of mind being as willing to relinquish every failing as to receive fresh light and strength toward establishing ourselves in upright principles and practices  again we should not search them as a matter of curiosity or for the sake of mere science but with the view of applying them to the improvement of our hearts  nor should we search them as if they were calculated for particular circumstances only but as our best treasure and our greatest comfort in all circumstances  again we should endeavor to investigate the meaning of the more obscure and doubtful passages of scripture by those which are clear and certain  we should be directed in all our enquiries by those other lights of our minds which god has given us  we should distinguish between the genealogical and historical parts of scripture and those which immediately relate to our conduct and which were graciously revealed for our benefit and salvation  and we should so receive our english translation of the scriptures as to make one part consistent with another and embrace every opportunity in our power to attain the true original sense of all those passages which are erroneously translated  now that we may faithfully regard and universally practice these plain rules and that no discouragements whatever may interrupt our application and continual progress we have only to call to mind again the many important and indispensable obligations we are under to search the scriptures  we cannot otherwise we have seen pay any due honor and praise to god every discovery of whose will demands our most cordial reception our most serious consideration and our devoutest thanksgivings  we cannot otherwise show any solicitude to cultivate the mind our better part with the most excellent useful and satisfying knowledge  we cannot otherwise pursue the best methods of redeeming ourselves from the servitude of sin and of becoming perfect in our measure and degree as our heavenly father is perfect  we cannot otherwise make the best preparation for eternity nor worthily regard the goodness forbearance and longsuffering of god which would lead us to repentance and salvation  nor can we otherwise make choice of the most rational and dailyimproving pleasures pleasures which are never wearisome or disgusting but continually more and more refreshing strengthening and delightful to the soul  but we need only keep an eye to this one endearing truth namely that the scriptures are fully able to make us wise unto salvation to make us search them with all diligence in opposition to all the vexations and disquietudes of this transitory world  whilst we keep this point in view neither can all the flattering temptations hypocritical artifices and dismaying terrors of all the men upon earth nor could even the most studied sophistry of an angel from heaven dissuade us from searching the scriptures but expressing the highest and most unfeigned gratitude to god in reflecting that they contain so inestimable a treasure as the true way to eternal life we shall rejoice in our happiness in having the privilege of searching them and acknowledge that it is our greatest wisdom to search them early and continually  upon the whole considering the scriptures as containing the pure will of god concerning our salvation as revealing the wonders of his love in our redemption and calling us to the spotless realms of everlasting day we should be persuaded to give the earliest application of all the powers of our souls to the serious study of them  we surely cannot begin too early to lay the foundation of everlasting life  as we know not what a day or a night may bring forth or how soon or in what manner we may be warned out of this world we cannot begin too early to secure to ourselves a future glorious and unfading inheritance  we cannot begin too early to attain the purest knowledge the most refreshing wisdom and all the lovely graces of righteousness and truth  we cannot begin too early to know and adore our great creator to impress our hearts with the most mavelous displays of his wisdom and grace and to be drawn by a review of the most astonishing acts of his love to an imitation of his likeness and to that high glory which he is willing to bestow upon us  nor can any other exercises whatever in which we can possibly engage afford us such consolation and joy upon reflection so fully establish our minds at all times or make our satisfactions grow upon us with our years  the apostle therefore commends timothy because from a child he had known the scriptures which were able to make him wise unto salvation  these elevated him above all the world when its most soothing and delusive charms were prepared to lay hold of his affections  these showed him in the most striking point of view the folly and vanity the shame reproach and misery attendant upon every vice and pointed out to him the true glory and blessedness of a patient continuance in welldoing  these taught him how to live and how to die and to fear neither death nor the grave because of the joy that shall hereafter be revealed  and these taught him to be reconciled to all the unexpected events that could possibly happen to him in the present fluctuating and trying scene because they describe to us the eternal father and the righteous governor of the world as ever near to those that call upon him and as the sure refuge and exceeding great reward of all his faithful servants  as soon therefore as we know what happiness means and can form any relish for happiness and are capable of observing those directions which most infallibly assist us in our way to happiness we should begin to search the scriptures and whilst we maintain the highest reverence for all those sacred lessons which they contain we should use every possible caution to enter into the true sense and spirit of them and watch and pray that we fall not into temptation and a snare  but once more we should likewise be persuaded to search the scriptures continually  the bereans were applauded as more noble than those of thessalonica because they searched the scriptures to decide upon the truth of the doctrines of the apostles and as they are not only our sure guide to truth but as we are continually surrounded with dangers we should have constant recourse to these our best preservatives from all dangers  i do not mean that we should do nothing else for whilst we live in the world we must have a variety of employments to exercise and engage our attention  but amidst all other concerns this should have one principal place  amidst the hurry and multiplicity of all human affairs this one most salutary and important object should never be neglected  we should delight in the law of the lord and in his law should we meditate day and night  for if we be weary here we have rest  if we be troubled on every side here we have consolation and good hope  if we love life and would see good days here is the way and the truth and the life  here is wisdom for the wise strength for the weak comfort for those who mourn and a sovereign consolation for the brokenhearted  the psalmist therefore says thy testimonies o lord have i taken as an heritage for ever for they are the rejoicing of my heart  but his words are peculiarly applicable to those who enjoy all the invaluable blessings of the gospel  to them it may be especially said what more could be done in his vineyard that the lord has not done in it  truly he has done for us great things  he has filled the hungry with good  he has showed strength with his arm and exalted them of low degree  he has given light to those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death that he might guide our feet in the way of peace  and his mercy is on them who fear him from generation to generation  blessed be the lord god of israel for he has visited and redeemed his people and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david  come then let our souls magnify the lord let our spirits rejoice in god our savior  he has called us with an holy calling  let us not be disobedient to the heavenly voice  let us not receive his grace in vain  let us wash and be clean  let us therefore search the scriptures let us search them daily with that candor impartiality and strict attention to their leading doctrines and with that honesty and goodness of heart which will cause them to be as a well of living water springing up in us into eternal life  in short this is the book of wisdom let it not depart therefore out of thy mouth but do thou meditate therein day and night that thou may observe to do according to all that is written therein and turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success and thou shall have no reason to fear neither to be dismayed for the lord thy god shall be with thee wherever thou go  now to god only wise be glory through jesus christ for ever amen  finis proposals for printing by subscription a series of discourses illustrative of the evidences of the truth of the christian religion by the author of this volume the work will be comprised in two octavo volumes and will be elegantly printed on good paper  it will be printed in the course of the next year if previously a sufficient number of subscribers come forward to countenance it  no money will be expected until the work is completed and ready to be delivered from the press  the price to subscribers will not exceed ten shillings unbound  the author has often thought that such a work was greatly wanted and would if properly executed be an important service to the public infidelity is the source of all those destroying vices which take place amongst us the oppressor the extortioner the openly profane and all the wicked must be infidels at least at the time when they give way to their shameful excesses even those who are not now to be classed with the wicked but who have formerly transgressed some of the divine laws must be painfully sensible that all their past iniquities have originated in an evil heart of unbelief by which they then suffered themselves to be influenced on the other hand it seems impossible that any man can deliberately violate the laws of the gospel whilst he is fully persuaded that it has god for its author as the firm belief of the gospel then constantly impressed upon the mind must make all men progressively holy and prepare them for the possession of all its precious promises it is of infinite importance to have this belief established by unanswerable arguments  but how can this be better accomplished than by such a work as is here proposed if the rising generation were familiarized to the common objections to christianity and at the same time were furnished with a solid refutation of them infidelity could not be so common as it has been a plain representation of both sides of the argument in language that could not be misunderstood would secure the faith of all our ingenuous youth discourses to this purpose adapted to the use of families and read to them two or three times in the course of their advancement to years of maturity would prepare them for encountering an adversary without the risque of a defeat but when the rising generation is neglected in this respect taught an implicit faith never apprized of the common objections to christianity nor furnished with rational arguments in its defense the consequence is just what might be expected that low witticisms succeeded by a train of artful misrepresentations drive many of them into the gloomy regions of infidelity  the object therefore which is here held out to view is confessedly a good one  but it may be said that we have already many complete defenses of christianity this is acknowledged with pleasure and gratitude whilst it cannot be denied that the greatest part of those are either too bulky or too profound for the common class of readers  a defense contained in a regular series of sermons level to every capacity appears to the author to be particularly wanted and though he is willing to do his utmost he will rejoice in silence should any abler hand come forward and more perfectly effect the good he aims at  subscribers names may be sent to mr johnson bookseller st pauls church yard london the rev mr perrott cork the rev mr hutton dublin the rev dr
