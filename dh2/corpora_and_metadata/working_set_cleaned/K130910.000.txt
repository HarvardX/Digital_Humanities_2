milk or water only and skim the pan very well when the flower or stalks left above it feel tender it will be enough but it must be taken up before it oses its crispness for cauliflower is good for

plants sown in july and august and plenty of pears and apples  of clearstarching to wash muslins take your muslin aprons hoods or neckcloths fold them four double putting the two selvages together then the ends together and wash it the way the selvage goes to prevent their faying then take clear water let it not be too hot for that makes them yellow and strain the water through a cloth then take the best soap a small quantity as your wash is put it upon a clean stick beat up your lather let it not be with a whisk because it will make the water yellow and leaves splinters in the water which will tear the muslins  after the lather is beat put in your foulest muslins one by one till you have put all in let them stand to soak then wash them one by one to prevent tearing whilst the water is warm then squeeze them between both hands for fear of leaving the dirty suds in them as you wash them out shake them open into a dish then let your second lather be beat up as your first only let the water be hotter but not scalding hot wash them whilst they are warm and squeeze them as before then as to your third lather let your water be scalding hot but not boiling for that makes the water yellow then take a small quantity of powderblue put it in a cup and put water to it a little more than will wet it then shake the cup about afterward pour it into the scalding water and stir it about till it is blue enough then take soap and beat up your lather as before and put the yellowest muslins in first then let them be covered over with a clean cloth you may wash them out whilst warm or let them stand all night to clear them  when you wash them out take care and wash the blue out then lay them in clear pumpwater if you have not time to starch them all at once put no more in your starch than you can finish in one day for lying in the starch makes them look yellow and streaky let them be in water till you have time to finish them but do not excued two days  most starchers boil their muslins but they should not because it wears them out but the scalding and letting muslins lie in the suds do them more good than a boil likewise observe never to soap your muslins for washing out the soap will cause you to fray the muslins  to rince muslins before you starch them take pumpwater in a clean pan then take a small quantity of blue in a cup and put a little pumpwater to it shake it about in the cup and pour a little of it in the rinsingwater and stir it about put your whitest muslins in first one by one and in case any blue should settle rub them with your hand lightly in the water and it will come off and if any of your muslins be yellow you must make the rinsingwater a little bluer after you have rinsed them squeeze them one by one very hard because they will not take the starch if any water is left in them and pull them out with dry hands double them upon a clean dry cloth in order to starch them some people starch them dry but they ought not for it makes them yellow and stiff and is very apt to fray them  to make starch for the muslins take a pint of pump water to a quarter of a pound of starch put the water in a skillet and put it over a clear fire till it is lukewarm then put in your starch keep it stirring slowly one way till it boils one boil and no more then pour it into a pan cover it with a plate till it is cold when it is cold take some upon your hand and some blue in the other hand then mix them together but make it not too blue for the less blue the better you need not make any more at a time keep it not above a week for that will make your muslins look yellow take your muslins doubled as before one by one then spread the starch with your hand but not too thick first on one side and then on the other but not open it then blue the finest muslins first and then the thicker for the starch that comes out of the finest will starch the thick ones and the same starch that comes out of the muslins will starch aprons caps and handkerchiefs for thin starch is best for them because they must not be too stiff  when you have starched the muslins lay them in an earthen dish kneading them with your double fist till the starch sticks about your hands then squeezing them hard wipe them with a dry cloth after that open them and rub them slightly through your hands  when you have opened them and rubbed them take the two ends and so clap them between your hands pull them out very well to you and from you to prevent the fraying be sure your hands are dry  if any of the starch remains on your hands it will fray the muslin dry them well and as you pull them out hold them against the light to see if they are clapped enough  if any thing looks shining that is the starch you must rub it over gently when they are clapped enough you will observe them to fly asunder and not stick to your hands but observe to clap very thick and very hard for if you let them dry they will be limber so that when you see no shining they are clapped enough you must never clap them single for that frays and tears them neither clap by the fire except in frosty weather for that spoils the color  for the ironing of muslins pull them out double on the board as smooth and even as you can and so on till you finish about six one upon another then with your boxiron iron the under two first because that is the driest and should be pretty dry but not quite dry that you may iron them even and prevent fraying let fine plain muslin be ironed upon a soft woollen cloth but if you have any that is coarse or thick you must first iron them upon a damp cloth and then afterward upon your ironingcloth the wrong side  as for lawns in the washing and rinsing do them as you do muslins make a very thin starch but not water starch dip them in and squeeze them out hard wipe them with a dry cloth very hard and clap them carefully for they are very apt to slip then fold them up and put them into a dry pan when they are clapped enough if you touch them with any wet it will leave a sort of thick look and so will muslins you may iron them on a damp cloth like the muslins but not with too hot an iron and also iron them on the wrong side as you do the thick muslins  you must not starch with starch left from other things therefore make fresh as before and see that the same be a little matter bluer than before  as for nightcaps aprons etc you must starch them in very thin starch which comes from the muslins but it must be thicker than water starch a small matter of clapping serves them but observe that they are clear you must also pull them out toward the gathers to prevent the fraying them every way double them and lay them on the board as even as you can and let them lie till they are pretty near dry then put them even and iron them on the wrong sides  to do lace the best way you must sew tape to each side of the lace then wash it amongst other muslins or by itself in three lathers and if it looks not white put it into warm buttermilk and let it lie a day then hang it to dry and then wash it out in two or three lathers but the lathers must be blue after which take it out and pin it upon your board by the tapes very even then take muslins the length of the lace and dip it in water starch and so lay it upon the lace till it dries observe not to squeeze any of the starch out of the muslin  when the lace is dry take off the tapes after which pick the purls and the foot very tenderly  if you open the purls you must make a round hardish pillow and lay paper on it which will show the purls the plainer afterward lay the lace upon the paper and with a long slender needle with a bit of wax at the head you may easily open them if they are well picked out at first after you have opened them lay them upon a board with a muslin over them and iron them with an iron not too hot  various receipts to take iron moulds or stains of claret ink etc out of muslins table linen etc if your muslins be ironmoulded take a chaffingdish of clear coals set a plate over it with some sorrel in it then put some salt upon the plate afterward take some more sorrel in a bit of muslin and squeeze the juice upon it let it lie till it is very hot then take the stained place and squeeze it very hard then take fresh sorrel and salt and use it as before till the stain is gone out the minute you see the stain is out wash it in three or four lathers till it has done looking green  to get spots of ink out of linen take the linen and let that part of it that the ink has fallen upon lay all night in vinegar and salt the next day rub the spots well with it as if you were washing in water then put fresh vinegar and salt and let it lie another night and the next day rub it again and all the spots will disappear  how to get the stains of fruit out of linen rub all the stains very well with butter then put the linen into scalding hot milk let it lie and steep there till it is cold and rub the stained places in the milk till you see they are quite out  soap be careful in choosing the oldest soap you can for that which is newmade not only spoils the color of the linen but also does not go so far  how to wash silk stockings make a strong lather with soap and pretty hot then lay the stockings on a table take a piece of very coarse rough cloth roll it up and rub them with it as hard as you can turning them several times from one side to the other till they have passed through tree lathers then rinse them in three or four waters till not the least tincture of the soap remains and when you find them quite

orange flower brandy take a gallon of french brandy and put it in a bottle that will hold it then boil a pound of orangeflowers a little while and put them to the brandy save the water and with that make a syrup to sweeten it  of brewing strong october beer care in the first place must be taken that the malt be very clean and when it is ground it should stand four and twenty hours at least in the sacks  the quantity is five quarters of malt to three hogsheads of beer and eighteen pounds of hops unless the malt be pale dried then there must be added three or four pounds more  the choice of liquor for brewing is of considerable advantage the softest and cleanest water is the best  you are to boil your first liquor adding a handful or two of hops to it then before your strike it over to your malt cool it in as much liquor as will bring it to a temper not to scald the malt for it is a fault not to take the liquor as high as possible but not to scald  the next liquors do the same  and indeed all your liquors ought to be taken as high may be that is not to scald  when you let your wort from your malt into the underback put to it a handful or two of hops it will preserve it from that accident which brewers call blinking or foxing  in boiling your worts the first wort boil high or quick for the quicker the wort is boiled the better it is  the second boil more than the first and the third or last more than the second  in cooling lay your worts thin and let each be well cooled and care must be taken in letting them down into the tun that you do it leisurely to the end that as little of the foeces or sediment as possible may pass with it which causes the fermentation to be fierce or mild for  note there is in all fermented liquors salt and sulphur and to keep these two bodies in a due proportion that the salt does not exalt itself above the sulphur consists a great part of the art in brewing  when your wort is first let into your tun put but a little yeast to it and let it work by degrees quietly and if you find it works but moderate whip in the yeast two or three times or more till you find your drink well fermented for without a full opening of the body by fermentation it will not be perfectly fine nor will it drink clean or light  when you cleanse do it by a cock from your tun placed six inches from the bottom to the end that most of the sediment may be left behind which may be thrown on your malt to mend your smallbeer  when your drink is tunned fill your vessel full let it work at the bung hole and have a reserve in a small cask to fill it up and do not put any of the drink which will be under the yeast after it is worked over into your vessels but put it by itself into another cask for it will not be so good as your other in the cask  this done you must wait for the finishing the fermentation then stop it close and let it stand till the spring for brewing ought to be done in the month of october that it may have time to settle and digest all the winter season  in the spring you must unstop your venthole and thereby see whether your drink does ferment or not for as soon as the warm weather comes your drink will have another fermentation which when it is over let it be again well stopped and stand till september or longer and then peg it if you find it pretty fine the hop well rotted and of a good taste for drinking  another way to brew ale allow five bushels and a half of malt to half a hogshead of ale put into your mashingtub fortyfive gallons of liquor because onethird part of the liquor will be soaked up by the malt and a sixthpart will waste in boiling for the second wort put but a little more liquor than you intend to make drink and if you have a large quantity of malt you may make a third wort putting in liquor according to the quantity you would have  another way of brewing strong and small beer let the water boil before you put it into the mashingvat and let it stand till the steam is off about one hogshead of water then take your malt and strew it in with a handbowl another keeping it stirring till it grows thick then put in more water and malt as before till you have got your quantity reserve some malt to cover the top about one inch thick let it stand three hours then draw it off at the bottom and pour it in at the top till it runs fine put your hops to the fine liquor and keep them stirring till your liquor is ready to boil then put them into the copper  twenty bushels of malt will make two hogsheads of strong and four of small beer ten pounds of hops are sufficient or twenty bushels of malt will make four hogsheads of good ale and two of small beer but then you must put but eight pounds of hops to it and let it not boil above an hour and an half  of cleaning and sweetening casks if your cask is a butt then with cold water first rinse out the lees clean and have ready boiling or very hot water which put in and with a long stale and a little birch fastened to its end scrub the bottom as well as you can at the same time let there be provided another shorter broom of about a foot and a half long that which one hand may be so employed in the upper and other parts as to clean the cask well so in a hogshead or other smaller vessel the one handed short broom may be used with water or with water and sand or ashes and be effectually cleansed the outside of the cask about the bunghole should be well washed least the yeast as it works over carries some of its filth with it  but to sweeten a barrel kilderkin firkin or pin in the great brewhouses they put them over the copperhole for a night together that the steam of the boiling water or wort may penetrate into the wood this way is such a furious searcher that unless the cask is new hooped just before it will be apt to fall in pieces  another way we take a pottle or more of stone lime and put it into the cask on this pour some water and stop it up directly shaking it well about  another having got a long linen rag dip it in melted brimstone light it at the end and let it hang pendant with the upper part of the rag fastened to the wooden bung this is a most quick sure way and will not only sweeten but help to fine the drink  another or to make your cask more pleasant you may use the vintners way thus take four ounces of stone brimstone one ounce of burnt alum and two ounces of brandy melt all these in an earthen  it three pails of water bung it immediately with a wood or cork bung and shake it well about for a quarter of an hour and let it stand a day and night and it will bring off the red color and alter the taste of the cask very much  to fine relish and strengthen amber beer take one gallon of wheat flour six pounds of molossus four pounds of malaga raisins one gallon of malt spirits free of any burnt or other ill tang and two small handfuls of salt make all up into dumplings and put them into the bunghole of the cask or butt it will cause a fermentation therefore do not stop up too soon  to cure a butt of ropy beer mix two handfuls of beanflour with one handful of salt and it will answer the end very well  another way take some hops that have been well infused or stewed on purpose two hours mix these with the wort they were stewed in and some other strong wort and put into your beer  another way beat an ounce of alum very fine and mix it with two handfuls of horsebean flour and put it into your cask  to feed a butt of beer bake a rye loaf of twopence price with a pretty deal of nutmeg in it then cut it in pieces and put it in a bag of hops with some wheat and put them altogether into your cask  to cure musty drink run it through some hops that have been boiled in strong wort and afterward work it with twoparts new drink to one of the musty old this is called vamping and is a cure for musty foxd or stinking beer  to feed and give a fine flavor to a barrel of beer put six seabiscuits into a bag of hops and put it altogether into the cask  to fine drink in twentyfour hours put a piece of lime made from soft not hard chalk about as big again as a hens egg which will disturb the liquor and cause it afterward to be fine and draw off brisk at the last though flat before this quantity will do for a kilderkin  to recover a kilderkin of stale small beer put two ounces of good hops and one pound of mellow fat chalk broke into about six pieces into the bunghole and immediately stop it up close in three days you may tap it and it will prove sound and pleasant to the last  sherbet to make sherbet having pounded calves feet with part of a fillet of veal cleared from the fat put them into a pot with a proportionable quantity of water and white wind let them boil for a considerable time and take off the scum carefully when your meat comes to rags and there is only left a third part of the broth strain it through a cloth and skim off all the fat with two or three feathers afterward turn the whole mess into a pan with a stick of cinnamon two or three cloves a little lemon peel and as much sugar as will serve to make it a pleasant liquor let all boil together clarify it with the white of an egg whipped and pass it through the strainingbag  when this liquor is to be kept for a long time it is requisite to allow two pounds of sugar for every quart of broth or juice of meat observing for the rest the former directions but at last the liquor is to be boiled to its pearled degree and put into bottles  metheglin to make white metheglin you must take sweetmarjoram sweetbriar buds strawberryleaves and violets of each two handfuls double violets if they are to be had broad thyme borage and agrimony of each two handfuls six or eight tops of rosemary the seeds of carraways coriander and fennel of each four spoonfuls and six or eight large blades of mace boil all these ingredients in sixteen gallons of water for three quarters of an hour or better scum and strain the liquor and having stood till it is lukewarm put to it as much of the best honey as will make it bear an egg the breadth of a sixpence above the water then boil it again as long as any scum will rise and set it to cool when it is almost cold put in a pint of new ale yeast and when it has worked till you perceive the yeast to fall turn it up and suffer it to work in the cask till the yeast is done rising fill it up every day with some of the same liquor stopping it up put into it in a bag a couple of nutmegs sliced a few cloves mace and cinnamon all unbruised and a grain or two of musk  cider to make cider get apples so thoroughly ripe that they will easily fall by shaking the tree the apples proper are pippins pomewaters harveys or other apples of a watery juice either grind or pound them and squeeze them in a hairbag put the juice up into a seasoned cask  the cask is to be seasoned with a rag dipped in brimstone tied to the end of a stick and put it in burning into the bunghole of the cask and when the smoke is gone wash it with a little warm liquor that has run through a second straining of the murc or husk of the apples  put into the cask when the cider is in a bit of paste made of flour and tied up in a thin rag let it stand for a week and then draw it off from them the less into another seasoned cask  some advise to put three or four pounds of raisins into a hogshead and two pounds of sugar to make it work the better  to make royal cider when the cider is fine and past its fermentation but not stale put to each gallon of cider a pint and a half of brandy or spirits drawn off from cider and also half a pint of cider sweets to every gallon of cider more or less according to the tartness or harshness of the cider the spirits and sweets must be mixed together and mixed with an equal quantity of the cider and then they are to be put into the cask of cider and all stirred together with a stick at the bunghole for a quarter of an hour and the bunghole must be well stopped down and the cask rolled about ten or twelve times to mix them well together let it stand for three or four months and you may either draw it or bottle it off  to recover any cider that is decayed although it be quite sour from ahogshead of pale sour cider draw out as much as by boiling with six pounds of brown sugar candy will make a perfect syrup let the syrup stand till it is thoroughly cold pour it into the hogshead and stop it very close this will raise a fementation but not a violent one there must be room in the vessel for the cider to work and in a few days it will be fit to drink  to make cyderkin or water cider after paring half a bushel of apples core them and boil them in a barre of water till one third part is consumed strain it and put the liquor to a bushel or more of ground or stamped apples unboiled let them stand to digest for twentyfour hours press out the liquor and put it into casks let it serment then stop it up close but give it vent frequently that it may not burst the cask and when it has stood till it is fine you may either draw or bottle it  mum take sixtythree gallons of water that has been boiled to the consumption of a thirdpart brew it according to art with seven bushels of wheat malt of oatmeal

general rules in cookery i in all soups you must observe not to put in your thickening till your herbs are very tender ii when you boil any greens first soak them near two hours in water and salt or else boil them in water and salt in a copper by themselves with a great quantity of water boil no meat with them for that discolours them iii use no iron pans etc for they are not proper but let them be copper brass or silver iv when you fry any fish first dip them in yolks of eggs and fry them rather in a stew pan over the fire and that will make them of a light gold color v white sauces being now more generally used than brown these are chiefly to be made so with cream and adding a little champaign or french white wine and butter rolled up in flour vi parboil all your meats that you use for fricasees or else stewing them too long on the fire will make them hard vii in roasting or boiling a quarter of an hour to every pound of meat at a steady fire is the best rule that can be given to do it to perfection viii when you beat almonds always put in orange flowerwater or rose water to prevent their turning to oil which they are subject to ix when you dress mutton pigeons etc in blood always wring in some lemonjuice to keep it from changing x when you grill any thing let it be over a stove of charcoal rather than seacoal it makes it eat sweeter and shorter turn your meat very often
