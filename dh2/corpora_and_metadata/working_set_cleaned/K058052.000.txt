a sermon occasioned by the death of his late majesty preached on the ninth of november in the morning at queen street chapel and in the afternoon at st pauls covent garden  by the revd thomas francklin  published at the request of those who heard it  london printed for r francklin in russel street covent garden mdcclx price sixpence  to the reader the following sermon not originally designed for the press is published in compliance with the earnest request of a few partial hearers with whom the interesting nature of the subject supplied every deficiency in the performance the author meant it not as a proof of his abilities but as a testimony of his affection and as such submits it with all deference to the indulgence of the public  ii chron c xxxii v    and hezekiah slept with his fathers and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honor at his death hezekiah king of jerusalem was one of those few illustrious sovereigns recorded in holy writ to have done right in the sight of the lord one who by his example influenced and by his authority reformed a corrupt and sinful nation he wrought that says the sacred history which was good and right and truth before the lord his god and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the laws and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered  the consequence of such conduct and such success was what might naturally be expected from it his piety and goodness his justice and benevolence so gained upon the hearts and affections of a grateful people as to render him the object of universal esteem love and admiration insomuch that when he died every heart was depressed with sorrow and every eye was wet with tears the whole nation lamented their loss with unfeigned sincerity they wept for him as a father they mourned for him as a friend and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honor at his death  a testimony so full and ample of exalted merit on the one hand and extraordinary gratitude on the other reflects honor on the prince who deserved and on the people who bestowed it blessings no doubt which a nation receives a nation should pay and grief which is universally felt should be as universally expressed the circumstance before us is such as would at any time affect us but at this must demand our immediate application  the late sudden and dreadful calamity which has fallen on these kingdoms by the death of our everhonoured and beloved sovereign has spread universal sorrow over his afflicted people  when private individuals pay the debt of nature it affects and deeply perhaps a few unhappy dependants the grief that arises spreads only through the small circle of kindred and relations and the tears which are shed flow within the narrow channel of domestic friendship but when death selects a royal victim when he adorns his triumph with thrones and scepters when the kings and great ones of the earth sink into the grave when the mighty fall and are no more the blow is felt as it were on every side and thousands fall beneath it the influence of such planets is so wide and diffusive that the eclipse is felt by whole nations a people puts on sackcloth and a kingdom mourns  circumstances indeed will sometimes happen by the intervention of providence that may render the weight less heavy and the calamity less dreadful such is the happy and envied state of britain under her present affliction but god forbid that those things which should heighten our gratitude and enhance our affection to the best of kings should lessen and diminish them to the care and conduct to the paternal love and tenderness of our departed sovereign are we indebted in a great measure for our success and prosperity the greater reason therefore we have to be easy and happy with the greater regret should we lament him who made us so the grief which we feel at his loss is the only grief which he ever gave us and the tears which flow at his decease are the first which he has caused us to shed surely then all the little testimony which we can give of our unfeigned grief and all the honors which the inhabitants of our jerusalem can do him at his death are but a poor tribute to his memory in return for so many years of his gracious favor and protection  he is now removed by the divine will far above all the cares and all the pleasures of mortality above censure and above praise removed to a place where only his virtues can be truly known and thoroughly rewarded to a place where all the little honors which we can pay to his memory are but as dust in the balance compared with that divine favor which shall recompense him and that applause which he shall receive from the king of kings and yet if the souls of good men departed have knowledge of what passes here below his no doubt will look down with tender complacency on the unfeigned sorrows and grateful remembrances of his beloved people  things which we have been long attached to even though of an indifferent nature and from which neither pleasure nor advantage in any great degree can be expected we yet cannot part from without regret but when a sovereign and his people have been long and closely united by the strongest ties of mutual love and affection when every fear is banished and every jealousy removed when many years experience have convinced them that they are happy in that they were made for each other such a separation is generally a fatal always a melancholy circumstance  there are in human nature various qualities and perfections adapted to the various ranks circumstances stations and conditions of this life and that which would be useful and beneficial in one would only be destructive and pernicious in another that wit and vivacity which would recommend a private companion would only demean and disgrace a public character and that ambition which would immortalize a general or statesman would only make a sovereign miserable and involve a nation in ruin piety justice temperance and benevolence are the brightest jewels that adorn a crown and all these shone lately with distingaished luster in the british diadem  few kings we know deserve the love of their people and still fewer perhaps fully experience or enjoy it the most loyal subjects may not have opportunities to show their loyalty and the most affectionate may not meet with any to show their affection but we may all remember the time when the loyalty and affection of england were put to the test at that time with what zeal and unanimity did the people rise up as one man to vindicate with their own the rights of their injured sovereign that filial love which glowed in the breast of cullodens hero seemed to spread itself through the whole nation he had acted as a father to us and we as sons united to defend him from that hour to the last fatal one which tore him from us never did diffidence disgust or discord sully his auspicious reign mutual confidence established itself between prince and people obedience ripened into love and duty softened into affection every year added strength to the chains of harmony which nothing but death could ever have disunited shall we not then set apart a few minutes for the remembrance of him to whom we owe so many years of uninterrupted felicity  those who are confined within the humbler sphere of action and walk as it were in the lowly vale of life entertain very false and inadequate ideas of what passes above them we see the pomp and pageantry attendant on the great but are strangers to their cares and anxieties superior rank and title bring with them superior toils and labors and kings though the greatest are by no means therefore the happiest of mankind as he who lately filled the throne of these kingdoms did himself no doubt often and fully experience convinced that industry was necessary in the performance of every office and above all in the highest he was himself the noblest example of it he never thought that the eminency of his station exempted him from the duties of a man or that the splendour of a crown could diminish the weight of it he applied himself to the business of his exalted rank with unwearied diligence even in the decline of life pursued it with a vigor and activity which would have done honor to youth and gave as little time to amusement and relaxation as the meanest of his subjects  the welfare and happiness of england were indeed his chief and perpetual concern if his industry and assiduity were by any thing exceeded it was by his benevolence ever anxious for the good and happiness of his subjects he suffered no private cares and anxieties to interrupt the public business or to retard the public good that length of days which was so beneficial to us brought heavy calamities on himself and oppressed him with domestic sorrows which bore hard upon his declining age many of those whom he loved and esteemed were snatched away from him and many of his beloved children dropped into the grave before him but amidst all his cares and sorrows he was still attentive to the duties of a king the misfortunes of his country always affected and distressed him equally with his own his last wishes were for the happiness of his kingdoms and his last prayers for the peace of his jerusalem  never perhaps were justice and judgment more duly and conscientiously administered than in the late auspicious reign the power of life and death entrusted to the king as supreme magistrate could not have been lodged in a more equal hand unbiassed by private favor and uninfluenced by partial attachments he held the scales with unshaken firmness and dispensed rewards and punishments with the strictest regard to truth and equity whenever the laws of humanity as well as of his country were trampled on by the assassin and the murderer by crimes that deeply affected the community he permitted no intercession how powerful soever to avert the sword of justice and above all if at any time his injured people demanded a victim for the violation of public trust then would he not suffer any illexerted solicitation to screen the guilty delinquent mercy notwithstanding for the just are always the most humane was the constant inmate of his royal breast whenever crimes admitted of alleviation whenever circumstances softened the offense or merit pleaded for the offender he readily and cheerfully extended his pardon so great and so remarkable were his tenderness and humanity to the unfortunate that he always pitied even when he could not forgive and lamented the man whilst he punished the criminal  it would be highly injurious to his character not to observe on this occasion that the same love of justice which actuated his breast as a magistrate directed his conduct also as a king never during the course of his reign did he draw the sword but in her cause never did he think himself at liberty as too many of his predecessors have to exhaust the treasures and spill the blood of his subjects in fruitless and unnecessary wars to satisfy the cravings of avarice or to sooth the madness of ambition nobler were the purposes which he had to serve and higher the ambition which he desired to gratify to defend his own kingdoms to assert his own rights to repress the pride of the insolent and support the cause of the injured and oppressed in this cause he fought and in this he conquered the almighty was on his side and who could withstand him god went forth with his fleets and armies the most high did mightily defend him  a conduct thus noble and disinterested a behavior thus candid and upright sufficiently pointed out the spring which actuated every motion his manners spoke his religion his practice bore testimony to his faith and his actions proved themselves the genuine offspring of christianity such a tree alone could produce such fruit waters so pure and untainted could flow from no other fountain  amongst all the titles of an english monarch that of defender of the faith is doubtless one of the most illustrious a title which whilst it gives him the power to promote the honor and glory of god is at the same time the best support of his own authority and the best guardian of his own prerogative the interest of church and state in our excellent constitution are so intimately blended and united as to convince every wise and good king that they are truly and essentially the same and yet how often has the want of this conviction been fatal both to prince and people our late sovereign was too sincere a friend to the faith which he professed too worthy a follower of it is doctrines to neglect the sacred charge committed to his care to neglect a charge on the due performance of which he well knew the stability of his throne and the happiness of his kingdoms so immediately depended never did the church of england and the protestant establishment boast a warmer advocate or a more zealous defender vice dreaded his power virtue experienced his protection religion felt his influence if during his long and illustrious reign england was sometimes unfortunate and oftener guilty if evil counsels did at any time and where is it that they do not sometimes prevail the sober and dispassionate part of his subjects knew too well who were to blame to attribute it to their noble master who submitted but to evils which he could not prevent and suffered by measures which he could not approve  in a word to sum up his character without flattery and without exaggeration he was what one of the noblest of our poets calls the noblest work of god an honest man in him justice has lost an able defender truth an advocate religion a friend his servants lament a generous master his children the tenderest father his country the best of kings  god in reward of his merit on earth blessed him with length of days bestowed on him the dignity the authority and privileges of age without the weaknesses and infirmities of it the business of his life was to make england happy and successful and providence which is ever gracious to this unworthy nation would not interrupt him in so glorious a work the almighty knew the wish of his soul and blessed him with it  he lived to see corruption which unknown to and unlicenced by him had well nigh established itself debased and degraded to see those destructive principles which had long been undermining the constitution detected and destroyed he lived to see a spirit of freedom courage honesty and activity breathe throughout the whole nation to see britain emerge from a state of lethargy sloth and contempt to strength and manly vigor to see her shine once more in her native luster reassume her ancient dominion and give law to the nations around her he lived to see faction subdued to see all the hydra heads of party cut off and it is very name obliterated from amongst us to see that worst of monsters chained down by national union and buried we hope at last in eternal oblivion  the lord has indeed done great things for us how shall we recompense him for them we have paid our last melancholy duty and all judah and jerusalem have done him honor at his death let us then turn our eyes from the solemn mournful scene toward a fairer and a brighter prospect  the same gracious providence which continued a life so precious beyond it is common limits for our sakes has extended itself still farther by preserving another no less dear or less necessary to our happiness that of his illustrious successor there is not perhaps a nation on earth except our own whose sovereigns death would not be attended with most fatal consequences to the public weal whose measures new parties would not disconcert whose plans new ministers would not change whose unanimity discord and division would not loosen and dissolve but this we trust and believe will not be our misfortune the same sun which so lately set in glory seems to rise upon us with rays of added luster the best and noblest part of him whom we lament still surviveth that patriot soul which animated our councils inspired our armies and led us on to victory and prosperity is transmitted to the heir of his virtues and his throne who has already promised and sacred is his word to pursue the same measures to follow the same glorious designs to guide himself by the same wisdom and to tread in all the steps of his honored predecessor  if britons were to form a wish with regard to their future sovereign whose completion would satisfy all their desires what would it be doubtless it would be to have a king descended from him whom they so long loved and so sincerely lamented to have a king born in the land which he is to reign over acquainted with those laws by which he is to govern and that constitution which he is sworn to protect to have a king who to the active vigor of youth should join the sober serenity of temperate manhood who had imbibed from his earliest years the heartiest affection for his people and the warmest love for his native country with a mind attentive to the instructions of wisdom and flexible to the dictates of experience liberality diffusive as his power and benevolence extensive as his dominion an eye intently fixed on the interests of britain and an ear open to the cries of the injured the wants of merit the complaints of justice and never shut but against the voice of flattery and dissimulation if to this could be added also a refined taste and knowledge of those arts and sciences which sue for his influence and demand his protection what might we not hope for in the world of literature when a monarch should unite such abilities to distinguish merit and such power to reward it what might we not expect in the seats of wisdom and in the great councils of the nation when such a prince should preside over them  such a king would begin his reign with doing honors to the excellent sovereign who reigned before him and whilst he lamented see his majestys declaration his own loss and that of the nation would graciously declare his own sincere attachment to his native country whose honor interest and happiness are most dear to him he would begin his reign by the encouragement of piety and virtue seriously and religiously considering that it is his indispensible duty to be careful above all other things to preserve and advance the honor and service of almighty god see the beginning of the proclamation how aweful is virtue when she dictates from a throne how amiable is goodness when clothed in the robes of royalty such a king would by his first appearance and behavior to all ranks and degrees of men conciliate the affections of his subjects raise their drooping spirits wipe the tear from every eye and dispel the anguish from every heart  if we know such a king we know the greatest happiness that a nation can enjoy let us put up our earnest prayers to heaven for the continuance of it  let thy wisdom o god be his guide and thine arm strengthen him let justice truth and holiness flourish in his days direct o lord his councils and prosper his endeavors for the glory and welfare of this nation and that we may always rejoice in thy bounties may these blessings be continued to after ages let there never be one wanting in his house to succeed him in the government of these kingdoms that our posterity may see his childrens children and peace upon israel now to god the father etc  finis
