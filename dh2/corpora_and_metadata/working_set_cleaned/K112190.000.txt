raise the dead man and the signs of his coming   that the dead man is the lyons whelp which the eagle had drove away from the old lion before   the business that the dead man is sent about by the white king  i the dead mans governor and what he does with his charge  ii the signs when the dead man and the white king shall be destroyed after which peace shall be established for ever more  by isaac bickerstaffe esquire  london printed for j morphew near stationers hall  the famous prophecy of the white king and the dead man etc it will be necessary to inform the reader that this prophecy was writ seven hundred years ago in latin and found about a hundred years since at the pulling down of an old monastry all e parts of this prophecy are already come to pass t this last which you will find by the sequel is w at hand the first thing that was foretold by  was the union of the two crowns under one morch after the death of the maiden queen the ext thing was the troubles of england and the eath of king charles the martyr the third thing as the exile and the fourth the restoration of ing charles the second after that this prophecy mes to the late revolution and describes it by  eagle coming out of the east landing in the south nd coming to the west where at an old castle that ands by the river side that washes the walls of briain s metropolis the great and mighty men of the ingdom shall come to receive him and offer him their ervice to catch the old lion s whelp the last prohesie that shall come to pass is just succeeding the time at england and scotland shall lose their former names and be swallowed up in that of great britai and then shall be explained this of the white king a the dead man  the white king and his character he is the great red dragon who is gorged and ready to burst wit the blood of all nations he is known by the mightiness of his power and the absoluteness of his dominion the best of his subjects are the greatest of his slaves and his most applauded acts of devotion consist in th multitude of victims be has sacrificed to the false god that he worshippeth his honor is lodged in the numberless number of his troops his religion in th breast of his confessor and his riches in the purs of his subjects which like the unjust steward h uses at his own will and pleasure  this white king you may plainly see by th description is meant for the french king who ha been so long foretold to be a tyrant over his people and a scourge to the neighboring nations as th prophets of old delivered in dark mysteries they prophesies concerning the coming of cyrus the downfall of the persian monarchy under darius and the rise of the western under alexander and afterward that of the caesars can any thing point plainer at him than to say he is gorged with the blood of all nations when there is scarce one in europe whom the french king has not imbrued his hands in their blood the next is as plain which points at power and the arbitrariness of his government and wherein he has made the best of his subjects which are the protestants without whose assistance he had scarce been able to have kept his crown now slaves by sending several to the galleys and forcing others to quit his dominions the rest of the prophecy is as true in every particular and therefore needless to repeat  the time when the white king shall raise the dead man and the signs of his coming the time when this shall come to pass shall be the time after england and scotland shall lose the distinction of their former names and be swallowed up in their original name of great britain and the sign that shall be given shall be that when false prophets arise and shall pretend to raise the dead man but this shall not be the dead man which the white king shall raise for he is not a dead man but to the hopes and expectations of the people he is dead only but shall rise again  this is directly hit at the union of the two kingdoms and cannot be interpreted to mean any ther thing but what the dead man is would look  little doubtful but the next paragraph explains it which if it did not the present times would show that it has brought him to life which every body thought was dead to us at least but that which is very particular and wonderfully remarkable in deed is the sign given us of those times that is when false prophets shall arise and pretend to aise the dead man before ever the other dead man hat was meant was ever thought to make such a resurrection this is worth a serious reflection to hink that just at a time when these false prophets pretend to raise emes one of their pretended probets which is their dead man the white king in he prophecy is pretending to raise to us the people of the union another dead man contrary to all our thoughts our apprehensions or expectations and who this dead man is the next paragraph of the prophecy shows  and the dead man is the lyons whelp which the eagle had drove away from the old lion before  this part of the prophecy is explained by that which foretold the revolution by the coming of an eagle out of the east which was the then prince of orange afterward our glorious restorer king william who came to catch the old lyons whelp which may be plainly understood of the then pretended prince of wales who is afterward all along called the dead man which very emphatically shows us he is a person dead and lost to all reasonable expectation but this is the dead man which the eagle had drove away from the old lion as this pretender was driven from k james before he abdicated the crown of england and therefore he is a dead man indeed that is excluded all hopes of reigning by the crown of great britains being settled on the house of hannover and in a protestant succession for ever so that he is actually dead to the law therefore we shall proceed to examine in the next place  the business that the dead man is sent about by the white king and the white king having war with all the nations round about him setting up one king and pulling down another at last raises up the dead man which was the old lyons whelp and furnishes him with wooden horses to carry him to his native country there to assault it and destroy the people for the hardness of their hearts and their infidelity in not beliening that the dead man should come again whom they spued out from amongst them long before this is the design the dead man is sent about y the white king but his governor has disappoind all his projects  this paragraph needs but little explaining at his time of day when we find the white king is etting up the dead man against us and sending im to execute his own designs the wooden hors he is preparing for him to visit the land of his nativity are the white kings shipping wherewith he threatens to invade us and force the subjects of a free state and who live under the happiest government in the world to bow their necks down to a foreign yoke of slavery under pretense of a person and title that is absolutely dead to us and all the world beside this white king this scourge of the nations which as the prophecy says is for setting up one king and pulling down another but n the last place this dead man shall bring a governor along with him now who this governor is will be worth while to enquire because this governor shall break the neck of all his designs in a manner that shall be acceptable to all the world as the prophecy further illustrates when it comes to the destruction of the white king and the dead man and this governor seems to be directly levelled at the duke of berwick who shall discover all the underhand projects of the white king to make a property of the dead man and so shall deliver up the dead man that he may be no more a disturber of the people or a handle for the white king to work all his dark designs withal  and the dead mans governor shall bring over his charge and then the white king shall leave the dead man to the charge of his governor and there sha consternation and confusion and amazement but the b of the people shall not be spilt nor shall desolation or desction come near their houses for the governor of the d man shall deliver up his charge to the hands of them that quire it of him and he shall be crowned with honor for wonderfulness of that work and the signs of it coming to p shall be when the false prophes that pretended to raise up the dead man shall be confounded and dispersed abroad so t their names shall be no more heard of in our strets and the the white king shall be destroyed from off the face of the eart the dead man shall never rise again bu peace shall be estblishd for evermore  the reader may observe that this paragraph brings the prophecy down to a general peace if not to the last day which none knows how near its approach may be however we fin by this plainy that the dead man and his project shall com to nothing but he be made a prey and sacrifice to the ambition and tyranny of the white king who shall be disappointe in the trust of this great governor whoever he shall be for he seems resolved by the prophecy to prevent the effusion o blood by readily delivering up his charge which must immediately put an end to all the white kings designs nay the prophecy seems to point plainly at his own destruction at home while he is so busied in forming foreign projects and that the time is very shortly at hand for it says the sign of its coming to pss shall be soon after this atempt in may next of pretending to raie emes the false prophets dead man and when we find them disappointed in their designs as we have no reason to doubt but they will then may we expect the fulfilling of these things that all foreign attempts against us will be enirely baffled the white king our great enemy utterly destroyed the dead man in the prophecy shall never rise again that is we shall be freed from all fears or disturbances from him and then there shall be peace to the end of the world  finis
