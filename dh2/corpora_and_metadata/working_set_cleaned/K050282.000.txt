the danger of the protestant religion considered from the present prospect of a religious war in europe  london printed in the year   0   to the king sir it is not the meanest of your trophies and of which mankind speaks in your praise that both your majesty and your ancestors have always been the champions of liberty and the great defenders and protectors of the protestant religion  as such this whole nation made their addresses to you when they stood in need of a deliverer from the encroachments of popish powers and councils  as such they received your majesty in the room of those who chose rather to desert them than to see them a free protestant people and as such they committed to your majestys government and protection the safety of their religion and liberties which by your assistance they had recovered from the invasions of popery and as such the author of these sheets humbly addresses them to your majesty  the protestant religion seems to stretch forth her hands to your majesty as to her constant protector you may view her in a posture of trembling at the formidable prospect of her increasing enemies and pointing to the confederacies that are making against her  providence and the crown you wear claims your majestys concern for the defense of religion  the peace of europe the preservation of trade the leagues and alliances made by reasons of state and for interests of government are things of consequence to kings and nations and your majesty is justly concerned about them  the liberties of this nation the property of the subject the increase of manufactures and the maintenance of the poor are things worthy of debates in the great council of the nation the parliament  but these are all antecedent to the great relative religion these are all but circumstances to the great essential circles drawn about the great center religion  religion is or ought to be the great concern of kings and nations it is for this kings reign and parliaments assemble laws are enacted trade is carried on manufactures are improved men born and the world made  your majesty is a proper judge whether the danger of religion in europe represented in these sheets be real or not and the author freely appeals to your majesty for the truth of it  if it be real god and the protestant religion calls aloud on your majesty and the whole nation that laying aside the debates of other meaner affairs the whole strength and soul of the kingdom should be applied to and concerned about the care and preservation of that inestimable treasure  nor may the trifles of property or prerogative or any thing else of how great consequence soever have so much as room in the solemn consultations of the nation till this great affair is settled and so secured that the power of popery and superstition may be incapable to hurt it  we know that the almighty power from whom all human strength is derived is able to preserve the protestant religion and that without even your majesty or your parliaments assistance  but as he always works by means and instruments and has always owned your majesty as an instrument in his hands for this glorious work so your majesty is desired to reflect that it would be a singular mark of heavens displeasure if for want of a continued regard to the security of that religion which god has entrusted your majesty and this nation with the protection of he should be obliged to re assume the special and immediate care of it himself and take the work out of our hands  the danger of the protestant religion from the present prospect of a religious war in europe upon the present strange circumstances of affairs in europe occasioned by the succession of a prince of france to the crown of spain people are mightily concerned as their several thoughts and interests guide them  some and reason good apprehend england especially will come under many disadvantages with respect to trade both in the straights and in america where the french will always have assistance from the spanish power to encroach upon our trade have the preference in their ports and markets and several other things which i could enlarge on as well as another  some apprehend the growth of the french power at sea his dangerous neighborhood and his encroaching humor which they give melancholy instances of in all the late wars particularly in      which it is needless here to repeat  but i do not yet find any concern expressed or any danger feared for the protestant religion methinks it is too certain a token the care of it does not lie next our hearts  we are alarmed at every step made by our powerful neighbors to the detriment of our politic interest we can see dangers to our trade and shipping at the distance of an age or two form leagues whether right or wrong commence treaties settle alliances and join in confederacies and guarranties for the preservation of the balance of power and trade  but since answering of questions is become the subject and some are pleased to answer them before they are asked give a poor pamphleteer or scribler or any thing what you please to call him leave to ask one question  where is the league or alliance in europe made or proposed to be made for the preservation and defense of the protestant religion the concern of religion is not the meanest article in the peace of europe  i am not going to preach a lecture of divinity to show the value of religion and how near the thoughts of it ought to lie upon our minds i would have so much charity as to believe every english protestant has a just concern for the prosperity as well as the security of his religion  but possibly every man that does value his religion may not be sensible of the danger it is in and therefore it may not be amiss to examine the state of the protestant religion as it now stands in europe with respect to its own power and the power of its enemies  in order to which scrutiny it is necessary to go back a little to the original of the present settlement on which we stand  the protestant religion has been professed in almost all the dominions of europe spain and italy excepted and in most of those countries where it has obtained on the inhabitants it has been established by leagues and treaties which establishments have generally been the effect of bloody wars the liberty the protestants enjoy has next to gods goodness been the purchase of the sword at the price of the blood and treasure of the people  for the better understanding the present condition of the protestants in europe i shall divide them into several heads of nations and discourse of them apart bringing their short history down to the present time  first the princes of germany i place them first because they were the first that stood up for the defense of religion the chief of these are the kings of sweden and denmark the dukes of brandenburgh saxony and lunenburgh hanover hess cassel zell with a multitude of smaller princes states and cities  these maintained a long and bloody war with the emperor charles the fifth who reduced them to low circumstances but by the assistance of henry the second king of france their religion received the first security by treaty at the peace of passau in the year      and was afterward established at the diet at augsburgh anno      but in the year      the war was renewed again by the emperor ferdinand the second who by the hand of his old general tilly brought the whole protestant interest in germany to the brink of ruin  the bohemians were ruined at the battle of prague the palatinate given to the duke of bavaria the circle of the lower saxony overrun by tilly and the king of denmark who headed the protestants overthrown at the battle of kingslutter the dukes of mecklenburgh pomeren bishoprics of bremen and halberstadt the countries of slesia lusatia and innumerable others seized and in the emperors possession and the victorious tilly trampled down religion with the fury of a true son of rome  the protestants in this distress as we did lately here in a like case fly to a neighboring prince for protection gustavus adolphus king of sweden a king who perhaps never had a parallel till now came to their assistance with only twelve thousand men he landed at straelsundt took all the dutchies of pomeren and mecklenburgh secured the duke of brandenburghs country and enters saxony just as tilly had resolved to ruin it tilly meets him with an army of fortyfour thousand old soldiers is overthrown and his troops entirely ruined at the battle of leipsick  god whose instrument this gallant king more particularly was carried him on with such a prodigious course of victory that in two years he overrun two third parts of the empire settled all the protestant princes free and uninterrupted in the possession of their liberties and religion  and though he lost his life at the famous battle of lutzen though his party was afterward basely forsaken by the duke of saxony who had been twice saved from ruin by them though the swedes were routed at the battle of nordlingen yet they carried the war on with success till they reduced the emperor to demand a peace in which the liberty and religion of germany was entirely settled on the foot whereon it now stands this is that famous treaty of westphalia made in the year      and which the protestants of the palatinate now complain is broken by this peace care was taken as it should be in all leagues of religion first and of property afterward the liberty of the protestant religion in germany has its being here and the king of france and sweden are guarrantees of the treaty  the next general clause of protestants in my account shall be the hugonots of france these had long struggled with faithless kings had vigorously supported themselves in eight civil wars under the conduct of gaspar coligni admiral of france two princes of conde and the king of navar  the little honor the papists showed them in their treaties and the many surprises and massacres they met with when under the protection of the public faith kept the sword always in their hand till at last a breach between hen the iii and the house of guise forced that prince though he had used them very ill before to throw himself into their hands for protection but being stabbed by james clement a jacobine friar he fell a sacrifice to the fury of the guises and the crown devolved to the king of navar henry the iv the head of the protestants which king though he changed his religion to secure the crown yet so far he took care of the protestant interest as to secure them in the free exercise of their religion by the famous edict of nants which how it has been observed you shall hear presently  the dutch are the next in course these being subjects of the king of spain but having embraced the protestant religion were most cruelly treated by the several governors sent from the court of madrid and as oppression is the first motive to complaint they made their frequent application to the king of spain for redress of their grievances who answered them as rehoboam did the israelites and to make his words good sent them ferdinand de toledo duke d alva for their governor who boasted that he had executed eighteen thousand of them by the hand of the hangman which bloody proceeding together with the approach of the spanish inquisition which he was resolved to introduce drove the people to the last extremity viz to use force in the defense of their natural rights lives and religion a doctrine which however it may be cried down by our modern politicians has obtained upon the whole world and been more or less practiced by all nations at one time or other  this war begun by the prince of orange the famous predecessor of our present king was carried on with various success and the union of the seven provinces which we now call the states of holland was formed headed and protected by him till he was murdered by balthazar gerrard at the procurement of the spaniards being shot with two bullets through the body as he was going from dinner into a withdrawing room in his palace at delft  his successor prince maurice carried on the war with better success for almost forty years and at last reduced the spanish power so low that they rather sued for peace than granted it which peace was the known treaty of munster at which the spaniard renounced the sovereignty of the united provinces and declared them a free state as they are this day  england scotland and ireland is another class the reformation obtained here with less difficulty and has continued from the beginning of queen elizabeth without such opposition and interruption as it met with abroad  let us now consider these four classes under one general head of confederacy as they were engaged in the late war and we shall presently put the whole in the general balance by which the meanest understanding may make a judgment what is like to be the condition of the protestant interest in europe  almost all the protestants of europe the two northern crowns who stood newter excepted were unanimously confederated in the last war against the power of france and though the emperor and spaniard guided by reasons of state joined with them it is plain to all the world what difficulty the confederates had what blood what treasure was expended to reduce the french to the terms of an honorable peace  if we re examine the present state of europe we shall find it as to the interest of religion in worse circumstances on several accounts than it ever yet was since the treaties of munster and westphalia  first the saxon one of the most considerable princes of germany and formerly the great barrier of the protestant religion on that side is to be counted lost their duke turned papist to get a crown hardly worth keeping a close confederate with the emperor and dependant upon him for his support in his new gotten kingdom  the electorate though it remains protestant is beggared and exhausted to maintain their prince in his new throne their forces absent and which is worse already employed in an unjust and dishonorable war with a protestant prince in defiance of leagues unbroken and begun on frivolous pitiful pretenses and like to be carried on to the ruin of its author  the palatinate another protestant electorate by the succession of the house of newburgh is fallen into the hands of the papists and now in the power of a prince who in confidence of a support from the emperor his brother in law is making the first open infractions into the treaty of westphalia and persecutes his protestant subjects with all the rigor and cruelty of a bigoted prince who thinks he thereby does god good service and expects to be well paid for it  the protestants of bohemia and hungary are both remote and both absolutely crushed under the weight of the imperial rigor  the protestants of france who i ranked in the second class and were once a powerful branch are quite lost sunk and gone either suppressed and driven to popery at home in defiance of the edict of nants or like the ten tribes of israel scattered abroad into so many unknown countries that they have lost themselves and in one age more will be quite sunk out of name and memory  england was at the brink of ruin and the foundation of the protestant religion stood absolutely undermined the devil like guy fauks in the gunpowderpolt standing with the dark lanthorn and match in his hand till the people took such a fright as put the nation into fits of which they could never be cured till they had spewed out that generation of vipers that would have betrayed their religion to the pope and their country to the french  god and the prince of orange the one as author the other as instrument helped us out and i say without flattery no man can have a sense of the goodness of the first and have no gratitude for the good will of the last and it is a just cause of wonder to consider what sort of protestants they are who have forgot the condition the protestant religion was in at the first coming over of our present king and i would be glad to hear a jacobite protestant if such a heterogeneous thing can be answer me this question  how any english protestant without mortgaging his senses and religion can so much as wish either that king james should have continued king or should return to be king in the same temper power and other circumstances as he was in when his present majesty was invited over  thus we see several considerable branches of the protestant power quite lost  the swede who is one of the most potent princes in europe in the part of the world where he is particularly useful we find his hands full with two faithless neighbors and the flame of a war broke out which if he be not timely assisted may burn him out of germany  he is a young king though by what appears likely to come behind none of his most glorious ancestors and we have seen one snare laid for him already which if the english and dutch had not untied would have entangld him sufficiently however as he is there can but small help be obtained from him for the general safety of the protestant religion who is now suing at the courts of his allies for aid against the pole and the muscovite  it were to be wished the protestants of england would agree to give such speedy and powerful assistance to the swede in this juncture as may effectually free him from both his assailants and put him into a posture to enter into a general alliance for the defense of religion if there should be occasion  there are some other circumstances which weaken the protestant interest and that is the temper of the danes whose king seems disobliged in the highest manner against the english dutch and swedes and some have said how true i do not determine not very zealous for the protestant religion  at least no great matters are to be relied on from him in case such a war should break out unless you will suppose him to be first thoroughly reconciled to those three forementioned powers  whether the business of making the elector of brandenburgh king of prussia and the duke of hannover elector of brunswick may not cool the zeal of those princes in favor of the emperor i shall not determine  upon the whole it appears that the whole strength of the protestant power in europe lies now upon the english and dutch and the german princes in the circles of suabia and the lower saxony  i shall next examine the growth and power of popery which placed in a just balance with the rest will need but a short inference to show any rational man the disproportion of power that lies between them  the popish powers of europe are as follow  the french a whole and entire monarchy undivided at home and free from the encumbrance of protestants among them who had several times in former wars either byasd their power in favor of the protestants as in the reign of henry the ii or diverted their designs by civil wars at home as in the days of lewis the xiii but the present king of france having not broken the edict of nants only but abolished it has entirely broke the body of the hugonot party and rooted the very name of it out of his kingdom so that the french power being altogether popish and united under the greatest king france ever saw may justly stand foremost as the first champion of popery in europe  i shall not enlarge here on the formidable power of france how he has shown himself a match for the greatest part of europe nor upon the zeal and fiery rage of the french king against the protestant religion they are things so known in europe that it is needless to add any thing to our apprehensions that way let the french protestants who are scattered over the face of all christendom be a daily memorandum to us on that head  the emperor though he be the first prince in europe i place next to the french because i think him something inferior in power to france at this time especially in the circumstances we now are treating of disjointed from the protestant part of the empire  by the emperor here we are to understand the emperor and the popish part of the empire which may thus be enumerated  the emperor the king of hungary and bohemia the elector duke of bavaria a warlike and powerful prince and always a champion of popery the elector palatine the electors of ments trier and cologn with the bishop of munster and some smaller popish princes of the empire  the third head of power on the popish side is the spaniard under which name i comprehend all the princes and powers of italy with the pope the grand image of antichrist the duke of savoy the king of portugal and the provinces of flanders  i have purposely omitted here the swiss and grisons because being some popish some protestant and lying out of the way they can neither add nor diminish in the case in hand but will be hired on both sides as the parties find occasion for them or can spare money to pay for them  it might seem needless to make any remarks here on the powers on one side and the other those who are acquainted but in a tolerable measure with the present state of europe must be convinced of this just consequence that there is no manner of comparison to be made  but since our savior directs those who go out to war to consider whatever they are able with their ten thousand to encounter the twenty thousands of their enemies let us recollect the debate and consider the case if it were now coming to a war  i will allow that the protestants on every side were firmly leagued together by their own interest for their general preservation and that all private divisions petty disputes and quarrels among themselves were at least laid aside for the present till the common danger was over which if it be not true i wish it were  i must suppose also that which i think there is too much reason to fear that the popish powers before mentioned whether allied or no should join in a common design to suppress their protestant neighbors and whether jointly or separately it matters not much should fall upon those which lay next them  having ranged the powers of either party it is necessary to declare the posture of such a war in case it should ever come to pass  if ever the popish powers of europe should enter into a confederacy to attack the protestants it would be thus  the dutch would be fallen upon by the french on one side and the spanish netherlands being in the hands of the papists the barrier of flanders is lost by which means the war is brought home to their own doors and the first shock must fall on their frontiers where they must defend themselves against the spaniards on the side of sluice bergen op zoom breda and the bosch against the french on the maes and the rhine from maestricht to nimeguen and against the munsterians on the frontiers of groninghen to the side of embden and the sea  nor would their fleet stand them in any stead the war would be all by land they must maintain three royal armies at least to keep the field or their enemies will break into their country and make them maintain both armies in a place  the dutch are not insensible of the truth of this as may be plainly proved by the care and vast expense they have been at to protect flanders in all the last war from which all the benefit they have proposed to themselves has been the maintaining a good barrier between them and france and thereby keeping the war from their own country  the german war will in all probability be on the banks of the elb the oder and the main the protestant countries lie from the oder to the rhine and contain the whole circles of the upper and the lower saxony and a small part of the circles of westphalia franconia and suabia  but the weight of the war on the protestants must lie on the elb and the main on the elb the imperialists will have their main forces to attack the dukes of brandenburgh and the princes of the house of lunenburg and on the main the hessian with the princes of the lower saxony will be attackt by the duke of bavaria the prince palatine and the electors of treves mentz and cologn backed still by the emperor the french and the spaniards  the swedes and brandenburghers will again have the emperor on their backs upon the oder with the poles to assist him  here if ever such a time shall happen the war will be very bloody and were not the french to join on the banks of the main perhaps the emperor might have his hands full but a french army to fall in among the princes of the circles of franconia and westphalia is an article not to be considered without giving up the cause nothing but the angel of god in the army of senacherib can prevent their total destruction  i foresee i shall be attackt by a sort of men who are carrying on designs of their own and think every man aims at them with arguments like these    this is discovering the weakness of the protestants and leading their enemies by the hand to destroy them betraying our friends or exposing them or   this is frighting the world with chimeras of our own brain which perhaps may never come to pass dangers as likely as that the turks may overrun christendom and extirpate the whole christian religion things to come to pass when the sky shall fall   this is another shift to bring england to a necessity of a standingarmy which some people mightily want to subject her liberty to the arbitrary designs of her enemies for the first i answer it is no discovery at all and they that will make such an objection must suppose the popish princes of europe very dull if they do not know it as well as we  but to make my answer as short as the question they who please to inform themselves will find that in the several audiences of the french ambassadors at rome his holiness gave the most christian king several exhortations to restore peace to the church which we find explained at paris in the speeches made to the king of france by the popes nuncio where he exhorts him again to peace with the spaniards that their united arms might be employed in the extirpation of heresy  if i should need arguments to convince men that the french know as well as we the power of the protestant princes i could refer them to a late french pamphlet printed at paris and re printed at rome entitled la crusade which laments the catholic princes tearing out the bowels of their mother the church and exhorts them very passionately to employ their victorious arms to the extirpation of heresy and the destruction of the enemies of god and the blessed virgin    as to the improbability of the matter and its being a chimera etc  first gentlemen it is no such improbable thing neither for what has been may be charles the fifth undertook it singlehanded against all the protestants in his time and though the french opposed him he went a great way with the work for he reduced them to such low terms that had not the treaty at passau been obtained by the power of france the protestant religion had been totally suppressed in germany  secondly the french have absolutely effected it upon one of the most considerable branches of protestants and thereby shown us a test of their good will to the whole and given an instance of the possibility of the practice  thirdly the protestant power was never in weaker circumstances nor the popish in stronger if they should but unite so that i must own if they do not attempt it they slip a manifest opportunity and must be counted fools too which by the way we never found them to be    as to england standingarmies liberty arbitrary power and the like i must crave leave to say a little i have no mind to meddle with the disputes of politicians nor know nothing of those who have designs either way  they that would enslave our liberty by standingarmies and they that would leave us naked to our enemies or put us out of a posture to help our friends are equally enemies to the protestant religion  they that would make our kings out of love with their protestant subjects or our people jealous of a protestant king are beautefeus of their native country and want to see her again involved in blood that she may not be able to protect or defend the protestant religion  they who would advance the prerogative of kings to the ruin of the subjects properties and they who would subdue the english monarchy and the just power of the king to the will and pleasure of a party equally drive at the destruction of our constitution and in that of the protestant religion  it is not arbitrary power which is the present case nor standingarmies nor liberty nor property but the protestant religion let england have a care she does not take so much care of her liberties as to forget her religion but let us so see the one done as not to leave the other undone  in reading some late pamphlets pro and con about the danger of trade and the power of our enemies i observe some are for maintaining confederacies with foreign states and alliances with neighbors and some are against it  truly gentlemen in the case i am treating i rank all the powers of europe into two classes only papist and protestant and we are supposing the popish powers should link themselves together in a confederacy for the extirpation of protestants whom they call heretics let any rational man make the consequence what should protestants do can any human methods preserve them but a strict union among themselves to join in their mutual defense  i know better than to reflect on parliaments but if a parliament of protestants forgets the safety of the protestant religion they neglect the chief work they assemble about  trade liberty property right and wrong justice and equity are things the convocated assemblies of the people are called together about and they are in the right but these are but the subservient preliminaries to preserve a state or country in peace that they may with their joint force resolve and be able to defend and secure their religion  the protestant religion is the fundamental of the english constitution and i hardly ever remember the assembling a parliament in england but they had their grand committee for religion what those committees have done of late toward the propagating or securing religion is best known to them who can search the journals of the house nor is it proper for me to examine  i am not for prescribing methods how the protestant religion is to be defended but i crave leave to give some hints from the present circumstances of affairs to awaken protestants that they may see their religion is aimed at by the popish powers of europe a weak politician may foresee that if ever a union should happen between the french spaniards and germans all the protestants of europe except us are lost and undone unless some wonderful revolution which a wiser head than mine cannot foretell should happen  wherefore i desire only of parliaments of protestants and kings that they would condescend so far as to take the poor distressed protestant religion into their care let it be by such ways and means as to their honor in their great wisdom shall seem meet if it may be done without standingarmies or confederacies abroad with all our hearts if the walls of jericho will fall down at the sounding of ramshorns never let us raise batteries or plant cannon against them  here is no room to talk of pretenses and shooinghorns for standingarmies god and the protestant religion calls upon all the professors of it in europe to look to themselves and to stand up for the city of our god and if the enemies of the church of christ say a confederacy they are to give the curse of god on all those who shall refuse to help the lord against the mighty  in this case a war of religion will require us to lay aside all our illnatured animosities here is no foreigners no refugees no dutch men it is a protestant is the general term as in two armies that are to engage where one party wears a white and the other a green signal in their hats they do not enquire what nation any man is of but if any of the white party meets a soldier with the green in his hat down with him if they see another with the white in his hat in distress relieve him is the word  in this cause of religion gentlemen if the swede or the dane or the most remote nation be attackt we are only to examine if the protestant religion be his signal if so we ought to help and relieve them let them be what nation or people soever and let natural and political aversions be never so great if our enemys house be on fire well endeavor to put it out if it be for nothing else but for fear it should burn our own when the protestants in any part of europe are attackt proximus ardet let us consider if ever the fire of popery consumes the protestant powers of europe the flame will certainly catch hold of us in england  some gentlemen have said lately that confederacies and alliances never are of any advantage to england because we live by our selves in an island and have a good fleet  i shall not examine whether what they say will hold in matters of policy and government but gentlemen let me tell you if the english nation should see the rest of the protestants of europe destroyed without helping them even with all her forces upon this principle that we are safe having a good fleet should we not expect besides all the other fatal ill consequences our savior should rank us among those who when he was an hungry gave him no meat or when he was in distress gave him no help which is all one  but because i would a little prescribe in the case too and come to answering questions as well as other people i shall enquire what england ought to do  i answer principiis obsta prevent the conjunction of popish powers crush the leagues and confederacies of popish princes in the beginnings of them and by all possible methods keep them from such a union as is here supposed to be aimed at  this is the way to take away the cause that the effect may vanish this takes away all shadow of designing a standingarmy there will be no occasion to fight divide but the interests of the popish powers of europe if you can do so you certainly divide their forces  the late war is a certain demonstration that they will never unite against religion if they cannot unite their interests whoever gives themselves leave to examine will plainly see it is interest not religion governs princes i refer for it to the answer the emperor gave to king james when he demanded assistance of him against king william when having told king james that if he had rather hearkened to his friendly remonstrances made him by the imperial ambassador the count de kaunitz than the deceitful insinuations of the french and if he had put a stop by force to the many breaches made by the french in the treaty at nimeguen of which he was guarrantee and had entered into consultations with the imperial court and their confederates he might have quieted the minds of his people and then enumerating the cruelties of the french chiefly in the catholic countries exceeding the turks themselves the emperor concludes that the interest and safety of the empire is a sufficient argument to justify his not assisting him on account of the popish religion against the protestants having a papist to encounter with who on account of interest and public safety ought in the first place to be opposed and that for mutual preservation and defense he must be justified in taking measures with all those meaning the protestants who are concerned in the same design  thus we see when joint interest and preservation is the case even the popish princes themselves think it justifiable to join in confederacies even with heretics to suppress an unjust invasion of an encroaching neighbor though a catholic  from whence i draw this short consequence  that if you keep the popish powers of europe from uniting their interests you in effect keep them from uniting their forces and thereby from invading the protestant religion  by preventing the union of the popish powers possibly some may suppose i mean that england should engage in a new war with france to support the title of the archduke charles to the crown of spain and there comes in the old story a standingarmy again by head and shoulders  why truly gentlemen if ever we pretend to have a war whether it be with france or any body else we must certainly have an army of our own or some bodies else or we shall make but sorry work on it  whether those gentlemen would not choose to see the protestant religion in europe sunk and lost rather than see an army raised in england i cannot conclude but this i am bold to affirm that they who had rather run the risque of the protestant religion than of their liberties value their freedom above their religion and may very well be suspected to have no religion at all  now the risque is not equal neither for we have had armies in england and have lost our liberties and we have had armies in england and have not lost our liberties the difference lies here that we had armies raised to enslave us and they did it but the last were raised to defend us and when that was done submitted the military to the civil power and left our liberties entire i would say also but that i shall offend some folks that the grand difference lay in the kings we had  some of our kings designed our ruin and in a great measure completed it by standingarmies but a king that protects the laws by a principle of honor and justice can make armies that are so fatal to liberty be the protection of liberty so that really it has been our kings of pious memory who have been agents of the peoples ruin and the late war has shown the world that armies may be raised and laid down again if kings who command them please but to say the word without ruining a nations liberties  on the other hand if religion be attackt it must be defended or twill be lost  thus far i have ventured to touch the nice article of an army in england i hope every englishman will agree with me in this that i had rather see an army in england and run the hazard of our liberties than see the protestant religion in europe trodden down for want of our helping to defend it  but these are general points only  there are a great many methods to be prescribed how the protestant religion may be defended and yet no standing forces raised or maintained in england and so our liberties may not be in danger and the first is touched at already prevent the union of popish powers and interest and you will need no fighting  whether this may be done by giving powerful assistances to the emperor to carry on the pretensions of the house of austria or by appearing in the mediterranean with a good fleet to confirm the italian princes in the interests of the emperor or by sending over what forces we have in england and ireland to make a diversion in conjunction with the dutch on the rhine or in flanders or by what other ways or means it may be done with or without an army it is all one so it be but done that the protestant religion may be protected and the papists prevented from overturning us with a general destruction  but that no man may have any shadow to suspect me guilty of a design to argue for a standingarmy which is the great bugbear of the times or at least made the watchword of a party that would be thought to be more zealous for our liberty than any body else i will put it on another point our neighbors may be so assisted by our money as never to want our men and so gentlemen you will be tried whether it is your liberty or your money that so much stir has been made about and if we shall let our protestant neighbors sink rather than part with our money to support them then the truth will come out that it is our money which was at the bottom of the matter for really religion and liberty are so much in the same interest that it is very seldom they clash and he that shall refuse to defend his religion for fear of his liberty deserves to lose both  thus we are got over the point that our neighbors may be supported the protestant religion defended and the union of the popish powers of europe prevented by the protestants at this time falling in to support the emperor in his just pretensions on the spanish dominions and all this without a standingarmy in england  our pamphleteers need not dispute about the consistency or inconsistency of an army with the english constitution nor whether they that are for or against it are the best subjects i am sure he that has the greatest concern for the protestant religion is most likely to be the best christian they need not entertain us with their discourses of the danger of our liberties and properties from a standingarmy with their little reflections on the king by way of exclamations against the sad consequences which may happen or may not happen they need not enter into the histories of standingarmies nor tell us the wonderful power of our most formidable militia but the case will be altered when your protestant brethren call for assistance if you are afraid to trust arms in the hands of your own countrymen as truly englishmen are dangerous fellows when in arms very surly and loath to be disbanded without their pay if therefore we do not think it safe to trust our own people never let us desert the protestant cause for germany and swisserland are inexhaustible storehouses of men if you will but assist the protestants with money twill be the same thing or if we assist the emperor at this time it may be the same thing for prevention is all one as execution or rather the better of the two  and this leads us to consider what with submission to better judgments seems to me to be the only possible means to prevent the union between the popish powers of europe and therein the ruin of the protestants  i have said already our way is to crush the confederacies of the papists and if i do say that the only way to do so is to prevent the crown of spain descending by will to a prince of the house of bourbon and that prince marrying a daughter of the house of austria i shall believe i am in the right till i can hear a better method proposed  this union is much easier prevented than it will be dissolved treaties and alliances may disappoint it now whereas armies and fleets will hardly defeat it afterward if the house of bourbon and austria unite and conform the interests of their dominions they can have no body to bend their arms against but the protestants or the mahometans  i see no war can be raised in europe but what will of course run into a war of religion for if the popish princes agree in interests they can have nothing to quarrel about and to confirm this i appeal to a review of the general history of europe in which i offer to make it appear that setting aside the quarrels between the french and the spaniards and between the english and the dutch almost all the wars of europe have been wars of religion  and that i may not be thought to speak withoutbook i refer the reader to examine    the wars in germany which with some few intermissions lasted from the year   0  to      being   0 years and begun on pretense of recovering the lands of the church sequestered by the duke of saxony and ended by the conquests of king gustavus and his generals at the treaty of westphalia in which war that great conquering king lost his life and confirmed what i am saying in his last words which some histories tell us were thus being wounded with a carabinshot and asked by a german trooper who he was answered i am the king of sweden who do seal the religion and liberty of the german nation with my blood    the wars in the low countries begun with the spanish inquisition being introduced into the netherlands and continued to the peace of munster with the intermission of twelve years truce only and ended in the liberty of the protestant states being declared free by the king of spain which war philip the second of spain declared a little before his death had cost him     millions of ducats and the expedition to invade england    millions    the civil wars of france which began in the reign of henry the second and eight several times engaged the whole kingdom and after that was carried on by henry the fourth against the guises and the league backed by the whole power of spain on account of religion and never had any long cessation till the edict of nants and the peace of vervins  i forbear to instance any more being unwilling to enter into the miseries of our native country but i think the matter admits of no dispute that if the union we speak of should ever come to pass there hardly can commence any war in europe but what must be upon the account of religion europe has really nothing else to quarrel about or nothing but what neighbors and guarrantees can oblige one another to decide without a rupture as lately it was in the case of the dane and the duke of holstein  religion is the only dispute left what bloody battles have been fought how has europe been filled with slaughter between those powerful princes charles the fifth and francis the first for the kingdom of naples for the duchy of savoy and millan and for the frontiers of burgundy and flanders  what incredible expenses and how many heaps of slaughtered carcasses has the quarrels between the french and the imperialists cost on the banks of the rhine and the moselle and between the french and the spaniards in our age in catalonia and flanders these have been the capital wars of europe and if the union between france and spain be completed the cause is removed and the effects cease of course there can be no war in this part of the world but what must engage the protestants unless the protestants should fall out among themselves which would be worse still hitherto the wars between the popish powers has been the safety of the protestants if one potent prince has attackt them the jealousy of another has defended them the protestants have from the very beginning been sheltered and protected only by the animosities and jealousies maintained between the french and the house of austria  i cannot liken the protestants of europe to any thing more aptly than to the city of hamburgh between the danes and the dukes of brandenburgh and lunenburgh or to the duke of savoys dominions between the spaniards french and italians  if the city of hamburgh had had but one of those neighbors it had either been no city at all or their city long ago but the jealousy and misunderstanding of those princes is the security of the hamburghers  either the french or the spaniards had long ago annexed the duchy of savoy to their estates had the one been but willing to sit still and let the other enjoy it  charles the fifth had certainly subdued all the protestants in the empire if henry the second of france had not upheld them and that not from any kindness he had to them but that he was not easy to see the emperor be so great afterward the emperor himself encouraged the protestants of france and suffered men to be levied in the empire for the king of navarr lest he being quite suppressed the french should be at leisure to quarrel with him thus the jealousies between the powers of france and germany have been the security of the protestant religion in europe  since that in our memory the emperor and king of spain both papists declared war against france and formed the tripple alliance only to save the protestant states of holland from falling into the hands of the french anno      when our protestant king charles the  d of pious memory did his utmost to overthrow them and subject them to an absolute french conquest  if any man shall be so weak as to reply in the language of some late pamphlets what is all this to us what does the union of spain and germany or of any body else signify to us i crave leave to answer such a question by saying as our savior to the pharisees and i also will ask you a question  what signifies the protestant religion to us and if they will undertake to answer the last i will promise to answer the first  i might go on here to give instances how near the protestant religion has been to be suppressed in england and what a just concern other nations have always had for its preservation  but setting that aside for we do not love to hear of it i desire only to remind the reader that the parliaments of england together with our protestant kings and queens have always expressed deep resentments at the danger of the protestant religion and of our protestant neighbors and have always thought it became them by treaties and intercessions to procure their repose or by money and forces to assist them to defend themselves  and after giving some instances i shall examine the reasons of it and see if the same reasons do not now call on us for the same proceedings  queen elizabeth after she had provided for the safety of religion at home her next care was to assist her protestant neighbors what vast sums of money did she give and lend what number of troops did she raise to support the hugonots in france and prince maurice in the netherlands even before she had any actual war with the spaniard the histories of those times reckon up above  0000 english soldiers including volunteers that fought during that long war in the quarrel of the protestant religion in the low countries where they behaved themselves so well and gained such reputation that  0 years afterward when our civil wars broke out in england an old low country soldier was always counted a man of value  queen elizabeth sent at several times  0000 men to the assistance of the french hugonots under hen the  th  after the death of queen elezabeth king james the first though he had not courage enough to break with spain in the just quarrel of the palsgrave king of bohemia yet we find the english nation and parliament all along resenting not so much the injury of that family as the ruin of the protestants of the palatinate and several bodies of men were sent over to count mansfield to defend it though by the craft of the spaniard the scottish king was cajoled into an easy deserting the cause both of the protestant religion and his own family  in the reign of k charles the first what vast sums of money were given by the parliament to assist the protestants of rochelle which though by the mis application of the court and the duke of buckingham did them little service yet it is plain by it that the parliament knew the protection of our protestant neighbors was a work the whole nation had a just concern in both on civil as well as religious accounts  after this you have  000 men at a time twice raised besides recruits and sent by sea as far as pomerania to assist the king of sweden in the quarrel of the protestants in germany  in the year      the parliament of england addressed k charles the  d to enter into such leagues and alliances with our protestant neighbors as might effectually preserve flanders from falling into the hands of the french and i refer to the words of that address where you have the whole people of england remonstrating of what consequence the preservation of flanders was to the english nation and which stands as an invincible argument against our modern politicians who are for no leagues nor confederacies nor neghbours and think england a match for all the world  these seem to be instances enough and it is matter of wonder to me what sort of amphibious neutral creatures those protestants are which shall ask what signifies the protestants abroad to england supposing there was no real danger of our selves in the case  let us examine in the next place the reasons which have all along induced the english nation to assist their protestant neighbors and they are of two sorts  reasons of religion and reasons of state and i will be very short with them both because they are touched at already  reasons of religion are such as charity which obliges the strong to protect and defend the weak when they are oppressed and injured and unable to defend themselves the several commands of our savior for the relief of such as are in distress illustrated by the story of the good samaritan the declaration which our savior has made that whatsoever is done to the least of his is done unto himself and shall be rewarded accordingly and the like  reasons of state are principally the great doctrine of selfpreservation which branches it self in such methods as these keeping danger at a distance keeping a good barrier between our selves and powerful neighbors that you may not be forced to a defensive war preventing the union of neighbors of different interests from our selves     dly preserving public peace which is best done by strong alliances and guarrantees by keeping an equality of parties or a general balance of power and by being always in such a posture of defense as to make it dangerous for a neighbor to break with you   these with many others are the reasons why our princes and our parliaments too have always thought it both their duty and their interest to protect and defend the protestant religion abroad and have always been very tender of the injuries done them by their popish adversaries and resented them accordingly  i shall give one instance more i hope the reason of state will not be liked the worse for the statesman and that was oliver cromwell who being solicited by the protestant vaudois in savoy used all his interest to mediate with the duke their prince for a relaxation of their miseries and in his letters both to the duke and the french king after a great deal of fruitless intercession threatens to turn all the roman catholics out of england and ireland and seize their effects if some speedy regard be not had to the afflictions of the distressed protestants i refer the reader for the particulars to the latin copies of the letters wrote on that subject by his secretary of foreign dispatches the learned milton in which there are reasons given why the english nation should think themselves obliged to concern themselves in the sufferings of the protestants  but methinks it should be needless to go any farther than the journals of our own parliaments since the restoration where it will evidently appear that english parliaments have always had a deep resentment at the growth of popery and the danger of the protestant religion and there is no doubt but an english parliament will ever maintain the same sentiments  the growth of popery is certainly dangerous to the protestant religion they are the two buckets in the well the two scales on the beam of power if one comes up the other must go down if you add to the weight of one it will lift the other out of its place  let all those who would stand neuter in this cause of religion remember that god almighty has declared against such as are lukewarm christians there is no neuter gender in religion in the cause of religion they who are not for him are against him the defense of the protestant religion calls upon all men who have any value for it to appear in the time of its danger defend religion and politic interests will be easily secured a jove principium god and your country but first god and then your country  in short though i am no prophet nor the son of a prophet i think a man with but a small talent of forcast may be able to foretell that if we are wanting to god in the due and vigorous defense of his church and worship which is in english the protestant religion his providence has so wisely disposed the matter and made our liberty so dependant on and relative to our religion that it is morally impossible liberty in england can be any longer lived than religion popery and slavery are like sin and death direct consequences of one another and whenever we think fit to admit the first any body may promise us the last  the conclusion i cannot conclude this matter without remembering two exceptions that lie against any bodys pleading the cause of religion  first that in all the ill practices of the world the revolutions of states rebellions of subjects and tyranny of princes religion is the mask to hide the deformity of the monster concealed  secondly that god is omnipotent and the protestant religion is under his immediate protection that he is able to defend it without means and against probability  to the first i make answer in the words of the prince of denmark in the letter he wrote to the late k james on his joining with the prince of orange our present king at his coming in to england  that were not religion the most justifiable cause it would not be made the most specious pretense  and to this quotation i shall add you may as well argue against the christian church administering the eucharist because hen vii emperor of germany was poisoned by a consecrated host  as to the second argument it is true god governs the world and in his governmen of the world he has ordered that we should govern our selves by reason god has subjected even the ways of his providence to rational methods and outward means agree to it the great chain of causes and effects is not interrupted even by god himself if it be it is on extraordinary occasions which we call miracles  now according to the nature of causes and consequences the argument for our care of religion must be good as to those people who look for miracles i have nothing to say to them
