father was a considerable merchant and who himself was engaged in business a moneyscrlvener  though not to the pecuniary advantage of his family for being of a shy and indolent temper he suffered those opportunities of improving his fortune to escape him which others would have eagerly embraced his son thomas was born dec   th      in cornhill london and sent early to eton school under the tuition of mr antrobus his maternal uncle this gentleman being both a good scholar and a man of taste was assiduous in directing the attention of his nephew to those sources of improvement which he afterward applied to with so much success during the time of mr grays continuance in this abode of the muses he contracted the strictest intimacy with two of their votaries whose dispositions in many respects were congenial with his own one of these was the honorable horace walpole who has been so long conspicuous for his skill in the fine arts and his love of letters the other richard west esquire son to a late lord chancellor of ireland and grandson by his mother to the celebrated bishop burnet as the accident of his uncles being an assistant at eton was the cause of his going thither for his classical learning so to this gentlemans being fellow of peterhouse in cambridge it was owing that he was sent to the same university and admitted in the year      a pensioner of the same college  the relish mr gray had contracted for polite literature before his removal to cambridge rendered the abstruse studies which then almost wholly engrossed and at present too much occupy the attention of young men altogether tasteless and irkfome still song was his favorite and first pursuit and though his thoughts were directed toward the law as a profession for life yet like garrick in the picture between tragedy and comedy he hung back with fond reluctance on the muse nor was this bias of his inclination a little influenced by the constant exhortations of his two friends particularly mr west who was now removed to christs church oxford and whose propensity to poetry and dislike to the law appear to have even exceeded his own after having passed four years in college mr gray returned to his father in town where he remained till the following spring at which time mr walpole being about to travel invited his friend to go along with him the invitation was accepted and they accordingly set out for italy together but some disagreement arising between them occasioned as mr walpole ingenuously confesses less by his companions conduct than his own they parted at rheggio from whence after having made a short stay at venice mr gray returned the time however devoted to this excursion was by no means lost nothing that our poet saw was suffered to escape him from no relation though purposely designed for the public eye can so much information be drawn as from his casual letters during this interval of his friends absence mr west finding that his aversion to the profession for which he had destined himself and with a view to which he had resided some time in the temple became almost insuperable wrote to mr gray on the subject expressing in the strongest manner the ennui that almost overwhelmed him to this letter an answer was returned which presents the finest picture of the writers mind and abounds with a justness of thinking far beyond his years gray was now at florence where he had spent in all eleven months amusing himself at intervals with poetical compositions it was here that he conceived the design and produced the first book of a didactick poem in latin entitled de principiis cogitandi and addressed to mr west a work which he unfortunately never completed from florence proceeding to venice he returned to england deviating but little from the route he had gone but particularly taking once more in his way the grand chartreuse where in this visit he wrote on the album of that monastery the following alcaick ode oh tu severi religio loci quocunque gaudes nomine non leve nativa nam certe fluenta numen habet veteresque sylvas praesentiorem et conspicimus deum per invias rupes fera per juga clivosque praeruptos sonantes inter aquas nemorumque noctem quam si repostus sub trabe citrea fulgeret auro et phidiaca manu salve vocanti rite fesso et da placidam juveni quietem quod si invidendis sedibus et frui fortuna sacra lege silentii vetat volentem me resorbens in medios violenta fluctus saltem remoto des pater angulo horas senectae ducere liberas tutumque vulgari tumultu surripias hominumque curis   on the  st of september      he arrived in london where he had not been much more than two months before his father was carried off by the gout a malady from which he had long and severely suffered as the inactivity and ill health of the elder mr gray had prevented him from accumulating the fortune he might have acquired with ease so his imprudence had induced him to squander no inconsiderable part of what he possessed the son therefore finding his patrimony inadequate to the profession he had intended to follow without diminishing the income of his mother and his aunt resolved for this reason to relinquish it yet to silence their importunities on the subject he proposed only to change the line of it and accordingly went to cambridge in the year      to take his bachelors degree but the inconveniences incident to a scanty fortune were not the only evils he had now to combat poor west the friend of his heart was overborne by a consumption and family distresses and these alas were burdens which friendship could not remove after languishing a considerable time under their united oppression this amiable youth fell a victim to both on the  st of june      at popes and was interred in the chancel of hatfield church beneath a stone bearing the epitaph below here lies the body of richard west esquire only son to the right hon richard west esquire late lord chancellor of ireland who died the  st of june      in the   th year of his age   from the time of mr grays return out of italy to the date of this melancholy event he seems to have employed himself chiefly in writing for in this interval he communicated to mr west the fragment of his tragedy and several other pieces the shock however of so severe a stroke disarranged his plans and broke off his designs the only addition he afterward made to his didactick poem is the apostrophe to the friend he had lost hactenus haud segnis naturae arcana retexi musarum interpres primusque britanna per arva romano liquidum deduxi flumine rivum cum tu opere in medio spes tanti et causa laborls linquis et aeternam fati te condis in umbram vidi egomet duro graviter concussa dolor pectora in alterius non unquam lenta dolorem et languere oculos vidi et pallescere amantem vultum quo nunquam pietas nisi rara fidesque altus amor very et purum spirabat honestum visa tamen tardi demum inclementia morbi cessare est reducemque iterum roseo ore salutem speravi atque una tecum dilecte favoni credulus heu longos ut quondam fallere soles heu spes nequicquam dulces atque irrita vota heu maestos soles sine te quos ducere flendo per desideria et questus jam cogor inanes at tu sancta anima et nostri non indiga luctus stellanti templo sincerique aetheris igne unde orta es fruere atque o si secura nec ultra mortalis notos olim miserata labores respects tenuesque vacet cognoscere curas humanam si forte alta de sede procellam contemplere metus stimulosque cupidinis acres gaudiaque et gemitus parvoque in cord tumultum irarum ingentem et saevos sub pectore fluctus respice et has lacrymas memori quas ictus amore fundo quod possum juxta lugere sepulchrum dum juvat et mutae vana haec jactare favillae   and nothing can more pathetically display the feelings of a heart wounded by such a loss than that apostrophe and the sonnet in which he gave them vent  in vain to me the smiling mornings shine and reddning phoebus lifts his golden fire the birds in vain their amorous descant join or cheerful fields resume their green attire these ears alas for other notes repine a different object do these eyes require my lonely anguish melts no heart but mine and in my breast the imperfect joys expire yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer and newborn pleasure brings to happier men the fields to all their wonted tribute bear to warm their little loves the birds complain i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear and weep the more because i weep in vain the ode to spring was written early in june at stoke whither he had gone to visit his mother and sent to mr west before mr gray had heard of his death how he employed his pen when this ode was returned to him with the melancholy news we have already seen impressions of grief on the generality of mankind like characters marked on the sand of the sea are speedily effaced by the influx of business or pleasure but the traces of them on the heart of gray were too deeply inscribed to be soon obliterated we shall not therefore wonder at the subjects he has chosen nor at the solemnity with which he has treated them his ode on the prospect of eton college as well as the hymn to adversity were both written in the following august and it is highly probable that the elegy in the country church yard was begun also about this time  having made a visit of some length at stoke to his mother and aunt our poet returned to cambridge which from this period became his principal home the conveniences resulting from that situation to a person of circumscribed fortune and a studious temper were in his estimation more than a counterbalance for the dislike which on several accounts he bore to the place less pleased with exerting his own powers than in contemplating the exertions of others he almost wholly devoted himself to the best writers of greece and so assiduously did he apply to the study of their works as in the course of six years to have read with critical exactness almost every author of note in that language during this interval however he was not so entirely occupied with his stated employment as to have no time for expressing his aversion to the ignorance and dullness which appeared to surround him but of what he intended on this subject a short fragment only remains  in the year      he appears to have given up entirely his didactick poem and to have relinquished for sometime at least any further solicitations of the muse mr walpole notwithstanding being desirous to preserve what he had already written and to perpetuate the merit of their deceased friend importuned mr gray to publish his own poems together with those of mr west but this mr gray declined from the apprehension that the joint stock of both would hardly fill a small volume a favorite cat belonging to mr walpole happening about this time      to be drowned mr gray amused himself with writing on the occasion an elegant little ode in which he has happily united both humor and instruction but the following year was distinguished by a far more important effort of his muse the fragment on education and government which is superior to every thing in the same style of writing that our own language can boast of and perhaps any other  essay i    theoc as sickly plants betray a niggard earth whose barren bosom starves her generous birth nor genial warmth nor genial juice retains their roots to feed and fill their verdant veins and as in climes where winter holds his reign the soil though fertile will not teem in vain forbids her gems to swell her shades to rise nor trusts her blossoms to the churlish skies so draw mankind in vain the vital airs unformed unfriended by those kindly cares that health and vigor to the soul impart spread the young thought and warm the opening heart so fond instruction on the growing powers of nature idly lavishes her stores if equal justice with unclouded face smile not indulgent on the rising race and scatter with a free though frugal hand light golden showers of plenty over the land but tyranny has fixed her empire there to check their tender hopes with chilling fear and blast the blooming promise of the year this spacious animated scene survey from where the rolling orb that gives the day his sable sons with nearer course surrounds to either pole and lifes remotest bounds how rude soever the exterior form we find however opinion tinge the varied mind alike to all the kind impartial heaven the sparks of truth and happiness has given with sense to feel with memory to retain they follow pleasure and they fly from pain their judgment mends the plan their fancy draws the event presages and explores the cause the soft returns of gratitude they know by fraud clude by force repel the foe while mutual wishes mutual woes endear the social smile and sympathetick tear say then through ages by what fate confined to different climes seem different souls assigned here measured laws and philosophic ease fix and improve the polished arts of peace there industry and gain their vigils keep command the winds and tame the unwilling deep here force and hardy deeds of blood prevail there languid pleasure sighs in every gale often over the trembling nations from afar has scythia breathed the living cloud of war and where the deluge burst with sweepy sway their arms their kings their gods were rolled away as often have issued host impelling host the blueeyd myriads from the baltic coast the prostrate south to the destroyer yields her boasted titles and her golden fields with grim delight the brood of winter view a brighter day and heavens of azure hue scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose and quaff the pendent vintage as it grows proud of the yoke and pliant to the rod why yet does asia dread a monarchs nod while european freedom still withstands the encroaching tide that drowns her lessening lands and sees far off with an indignant groan her native plains and empires once her own can opner skies and suns of fiercer flame oerpowr the fire that animates our frame as lamps that shed at eve a cheerful ray fade and expire beneath the eye of day need we the influence of the northern star to string our nerves and steel our hearts to war and where the face of nature laughs around must sickening virtue fly the tainted ground unmanly thought what seasons can control what fancied zone can circumscribe the soul who conscious of the source from whence the springs by reasons light on resolutions wings spite of her frail companion dauntless goes over lybias deserts and through zemblas snows she bids each slumbering energy awake another touch another temper take suspends the inferior laws that rule our clay the stubborn elements confess her sway their little wants their low desires refine and raise the mortal to a height divine not but the human fabric from the birth imbibes a flavor of its parent earth as various tracks enforce a various toil the manners speak the idiom of their soil an iron race the mountaincliffs maintain foes to the gentler genius of the plain for where unwearied sinews must be found with sidelong plough to quell the flinty ground to turn the torrents swiftdescending flood to brave the savage rushing from the wood what wonder if to patient valor trained they guard with spirit what by strength they gained and while their rocky ramparts round they see the rough abode of want and liberty as lawless force from confidence will grow insult the plenty of the vales below what wonder in the sultry climes that spread where nile redundant over his summerbed from his broad bosom life and verdure flings and broods over egypt with his watery wings if with adventurous oar and ready sail the dusky people drive before the gale or on frail floats to neighboring cities ride that rise and glitter over the ambient tide how much it is to be wished that gray instead of compiling chronological tables had completed what he thus admirably begun in the year    0 he put his last hand to the elegy in the country churchyard which when finished was communicated first to mr walpole and by him to several persons of distinction i his brought mr gray acquainted with lady cobham and furnished an occasion for his long story a composition in which the different colors of wit and humor are peculiarly and not less intimately blended than the shifting hues on the faces of a diamond the elegy having been for some time privately transmitted from onehand to another at length found its way into public through the magazine of magazines this disgraceful mode of appearance subjected the author to the necessity of exhibiting it under a less disadvantageous form and mr bentley soon after wishing to supply every ornament that his pencil could contribute drew not only for it but also for the rest of mr grays productions the headpiece to the long story exhibiting a view of stokepogeis church and mansion was copied from a sketch by mr gray the churchyard was the subject of his elegy  a set of designs which were handsomely repaid by some very beautiful stanzas of which unfortunately no perfect copy remains in the march of      mr gray sustained a loss which he long severely felt his mother to whom his conduct was exemplary for the discharge of every filial duty and who merited all the tenderness and attention she received was taken from him by death the lines in which mr pope has expressed his piety beautiful as they are and much as they deserve to be praised appear notwithstanding to excite less of sympathy than a single stroke in the epitaph on mrs gray here sleep the remains of dorothy gray    or a passage in a letter to mr mason written the following december on the deaths of his father and friend i have seen the scene you describe and know how dreadful it is i know too i am the better for it we are all idle and thoughtless things and have no sense no use in the world any longer than that sad impression lasts the deeper it is engraved the better  mr gray as is evident by a letter to dr wharton had finished his ode on the progress of poetry early in      his bard also was begun about this time and in the year following the beautiful fragment on the pleasures of vicissitude from the loose hints in his commonplacebook he appears to have planned a fourth ode on the connection between genius and grandeur but it cannot now be ascertained if any part of it was actually written a vacancy in the office of poetlaureate was occasioned in      by the death of colley cibber the duke of devonshire being at that time chamberlain made a polite offer of it to mr gray through the hands of lord john cavendish his brother but the disgrace brought upon that office by the profligacy and inability of some who had filled it probably induced mr gray to decline the appointment this part of our poets life was chiefly devoted to literary pursuits and the cultivation of friendship it is obvious from the testimony of his letters that he was indefatigable in the former and that he was always ready to perform kind offices in the latter sir william williams an accomplished and gallant young officer having been killed at bellisle his friend mr fred montagu proposed to erect a monument over him and with this view requested mr gray to furnish the epitaph his slight acquaintance with sir william would have been a sufficient reason for declining the task but the friendliness of mr montagus disposition and the sincerity of affliction with which he was affected wrought so powerfully upon mr gray that he could not refuse him though he was by no means able to satisfy himself with the verses he wrote the professorship of modern languages and history in the university of cambridge becoming vacant in      through the death of mr turner mr gray was spirited up by some of his friends to ask of lord bute the succession his application however failed the office having been promised to lady lowther for the tutor of sir james from a motive which reflected more honor on her ladyship than on the gentleman who succeeded in      mr gray ever attached to the beauties of nature as well as to the love of antiquities undertook a journey to scotland for the purpose of gratifying his curiosity and taste during his stay in this country dr beattie though not the first of philosophers yet a poet inferior to none since the death of his friend and whom he in many respects resembled found the means of engaging his notice and friendship through the intervention of this gentleman the marisehal college of aberdeen had requested to know if the degree of doctor of laws would be acceptable to gray but this mark of their attention he civilly declined in december      dr beattie still desirous that his country should afford some testimony of its regard to the merit of our poet solicited his permission to print at the university press of glasgow an elegant edition of his works dodsley had before asked the like favor and mr gray unwilling to refuse gratified both with a copy containing a few notes and the imitations of the old norwegian poetry intended to supplant the long story which was printed at first only to illustrate mr bentleys designs the death of mr brocket in the july following left another opening to the professorship which he had before unsuccessfully sought lord bute however was not in office and the duke of grafton to preclude a request within two days of the vacancy appointed mr gray cambridge before had been his residence from choice it now became so from obligation and the greater part of his time there was filled up by his old engagements or diverted to new ones it has been suggested that he once embraced the project of republishing strabo and there are reasons to believe that he meant it as the many geographical disquisitions he left behind him appear to have been too minute for the gratification of general inquiry the like observation may be transferred to plato and the greek anthologia as he had taken uncommon pains with both and has left a ms of the latter fit for the press his design of favoring the public with the history of english poetry may be spoken of with more certainty as in this he had not only engaged with mr mason as a colleague but actually paraphrased the norse and welsh poems inserted in his works for specimens of the wild spirit which animated the bards of ancient days the extensive compass however of the subject and the knowledge that it was also in the hands of mr warton induced him to relinquish what he had thus successfully begun nor did his love for the antiquities of his country confine his researches to its poetry alone the structures of our ancestors and their various improvements particularly engaged his attention hitherto there has nothing so authentic and accurate on the subject of gothic architecture appeared as the observations upon it drawn up by mr gray and inserted by mr bentham in his hist of ely of heraldry its correlative science he possessed the entire knowledge but of the various pursuits which employed his studies for the last ten years of his life none were so acceptable as those which explained the economy of nature for botany he acquired a taste of his uncle when young and the exercise which for the sake of improvement in this branch of the science he induced himself to take contributed not a little to the preservation of his health how considerable his improvements in it were those only can tell who have seen his additions to hudson and his notes on linnaeus while confined to zoology he successfully applied his discoveries to illustrate aristotle and others of the ancients from engagements of this kind mr grays attention was neither often nor long diverted excepting the time he gave up to experiments on flowers for the purpose of investigating the process of vegetation which can scarcely be called a relaxation from his stated occupations his only amusement was music nor was his acquaintance with this art less than with others of much more importance his skill was acquired from the productions of the best composers out of whose works when in italy he had made a selection vocal music he chiefly preferred the harpsichord was his favorite instrument but though far from remarkable for a finished execution yet he accommodated his voice so judiciously to his playing as to give an auditor considerable pleasure his judgment in statuary and painting was exquisite and formed from an almost instinctive perception of those graces beyond the reach of art in which the divine works of the great masters abound as it was through the unsolicited favor of the duke of grafton that mr gray was enabled to follow the bent of his own inclination in the choice of his studies we shall not be surprised to find from a letter to dr beattie that gratitude prompted him to offer his firstling o meliboee deus nobis haec otia fecit nanque erit ille mihi semper deus illius aram saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus ille meas errare boves ut cernis et ipsum ludere quae vellem calamo permisit agresti accordingly on his graces being elected chancellor of the university mr gray unasked took upon him to write those verses which are usually set to music on this occasion and whatever the sarcastick junius notwithstanding his handsome compliment to the poet might pretend this was the offering of no venal muse the ode in its structure is dramatick and it contains nothing of the complimentary kind which is not entirely suited to the characters employed not long after the bustle of the installation was over mr gray made an excursion to the sequestered lakes of westmoreland and cumberland the impressions he there received from the wonderful scenery that every where surrounded him he transmitted to his friend dr wharton in epistolary journals with all the wildness of salvator and the softness of claude writing in may      to the same friend he complains of a violent cough which had troubled him for three months and which he called incurable adding that till this year he never knew what mechancial low spirits were one circumstance that without doubt contributed to the latter complaint was the anxiety he felt from holding as a sinecure an office the duties of which he thought himself bound to perform the object of his professorship being twofold and the patent allowing him to effect one of its designs by deputy it is understood that he liberally rewarded for that purpose the teachers in the university of italian and french the other part he himself prepared to execute but though the professorship was instituted in      none of his predecessors had furnished a plan embarassed by this and other difficulties and retarded by ill health the undertaking at length became so irksome that he seriously proposed to relinquish the chair toward the close of may he removed from cambridge to town after having suffered from flying attacks of an hereditary gout to which he had long been subject and from which a life of singular temperance could not protect him in london his indisposition having increased the physician advised him to change his lodgings in jermynstreet for others at kensington this change was of so much benefit that he was soon enabled to return to cambridge from whence he meditated a journey to his friend dr wharton which he hoped might reestablish his health but his intentions and hopes were delusive on the   th of july      a violent sickness came on him while at dinner in the collegehall the gout had fixed on his stomach and resisted all the powers of medicine on the   th he was seized by a strong convulsion which the next day returned with additional force and the evening after he expired at the first seizure he was aware of his danger and though sensible at intervals almost to the last he betrayed no dread of the terrors of death  to delineate his portrait in this place would be needless the reader will acquire the best idea of his character if after perusing his life and his writings he will use his own memory a sa cylindrick mirror and collect into one assemblage the scattered features of mr grays religious opinions but little is known there are however sufficient traces left to show him a believer to lord bolingbrokes atheism he has written an answer his sentiments of lord saftesbury cannot be mistaken and both voltaire and hume he censures with freedom in private life he was most respected by those who best knew him his heart was benevolent and his hand liberal  on his poems it will be needless to bestow praises or to repel the attacks of envy and rancour if mr gray was not a poet of the first order there is no poetry existing and if his bold expressions be nonsense so are the best passages of shakespeare and milton and the sublimest figures of divine inspiration  the last will and testament of mr thomas

learnings hallowed fane majestic rises on the astonished sight where often the muse has led the favorite swain and warmed his soul with heavens inspiring light beneath the covert of the sylvan shade where deadly cypress mixed with mournful yew far over the vale a gloomy stillness spread celestial genius burst upon the view the bloom of youth the majesty of years the softened aspect innocent and kind the sigh of sorrow and the streaming tears resistless all their various power combined in her fair hand a silver harp she bore whose magic notes soft warbling from the string give tranquil joys the breast never knew before or raise the soul on raptures airy wing by grief impelled i heard her heave a sigh while thus the rapid strain resounded through the sky haste ye sister powers of song hasten from the shady grove where the river rolls along sweetly to the voice of love where indulging mirthful pleasures light you press the flowery green and from floras blooming treasures cull the wreath for fancys queen where your gentlyflowing numbers floating on the fragrant breeze sink the soul in pleasing slumbers on the downy bed of ease for graver strains prepare the plaintive lyre that wakes the softest feelings of the soul let lonely grief the melting verse inspire let deepning sorrows solemn accents roll racked by the hand of rude disease behold our favorite poet lies while every object formed to please far from his couch ungrateful flies the blissful muse whose favoring smile so lately warmed his peaceful breast diffusing heavenly joys the while in transports radiant garments dressed with darksome grandeur and enfeebled blaze sinks in the shades of night and shuns his eager gaze the gaudy train who wait on spring ode on spring  tinged with the pomp of vernal pride the youth who mount on pleasures wing ode on the prospect of eton college  and idly sport on thames side with cool regard their various arts employ nor rouse the drooping mind nor give the pause of joy ha what forms with port sublime bard an ode  glide along in sullen mood scorning all the threats of time high above misfortunes flood they seize their harps they strike the lyre with rapid hand with freedoms fire obedient nature hears the lofty sound and snowdons airy cliffs the heavenly strains resound in pomp of state behold they wait with arms outstretchd and aspects kind to snatch on high to yonder sky the child of fancy left behind forgot the woes of cambrias fatal day by raptures blaze impelled they swell the artless lay but ah in vain they strive to sooth with gentle arts the torturing hours adversity ode to adversity with rankling tooth her baleful gifts profusely pours behold she comes the fiend forlorn arrayed in horrours settled gloom she strews the brier and prickly thorn and

story advertisement mr grays flegy previous to its publication was handed about in ms and had amongst other admirers the lady cobham who resided in the mansion house at stokepogeis the performance inducing her to wish for the authors acquaintance lady schaub and miss speed then at her house undertook to introduce her to it these two ladies waited upon the author at his aunts solitary habitation where he at that time resided and not finding him at home they left a card behind them mr gray surprised at such a compliment returned the visit and as the beginning of this intercourse bore some appearance of romance he gave the humorous and lively account of it which the long story contains  in britains isle no matter where an ancient pile of building stands the mansion house at stokepogeis then in the possession of viscountess cobham the style of building which we now call queen elizabeths is here admirably described both with regard to its beauties and defects and the third and fourth stanzas delineate the fantastic manners of her time with equal truth and humor the house formerly belonged to the earls of huntingdon and the family of hatton  the huntingdons and hattons there employed the power of fairy hands to raise the ceilings fretted height each panel in achievements clothing rich windows that exclude the light and passages that lead to nothing full often within the spacious walls when he had fifty winters over him my grave lord keeper sir christopher hatton promoted by queen elizabeth for his graceful person and fine dancing  brawls were a sort of figuredance

that this gentleman a neighbor and acquaintance of mr grays in the country was much displeased at the liberty here taken with his name yet surely without any great reason  by this time all the parish know it had told that thereabouts there lurked a wicked imp they call a poet who prowld the country far and near bewitched the children of the peasants dried up the cows and lamed the deer and sucked the eggs and killed the pheasants my lady heard their joint petition swore by her coronet and ermine she would issue out her high commission to rid the manor of such vermin the heroines undertook the task through lanes unknown over styles they ventured rappd at the door nor stayed to ask but bounce into the parlour entered the trembling family they daunt they flirt they sing they laugh they tattle rummage his mother pinch his aunt and up stairs in a whirlwind rattle each hole and cupboard they explore each creek and cranny of his chamber run hurryskurry round the floor and over the bed and

his pardon conveyed him underneath their hoops to a small closet in the garden so rumor says who will believe but that they left the door ajar where safe and laughing in his sleeve he heard the distant din of war short was his joy he little knew the power of magic was no fable out of the window wisk they flew but left a spell upon the table the words too eager to unriddle the poet felt a strange disorder transparent birdlime formed the middle and chains invisible the border so cunning was the apparatus the powerful pothooks did so move him that will he nill he to the great house he went as if the devil drove him yet on his way no sign of grace for folks in fear are apt to pray to phoebus he preferred his case and begged his aid that dreadful day the godhead would have backed his quarrel but with a blush on recollection owned that his quiver and his laurel against four such eyes were no protection the court was sat the culprit there forth from their gloomy mansions creeping

save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivymantled tower the moping owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower modest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy call of incensebreathing morn the swallow twittring from the strawbuilt shed the cocks shrill clarion or the echoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy housewife ply her evningcare no children run to lisp their sires return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share often did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow often the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor the boast of heraldry the pomp of power and all that beauty all that wealth ever gave await alike the inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory over their tomb no trophies raise where through the longdrawn aisle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honors voice provoke the silent dust or flattery sooth the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have swayed or waked to ecstasy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did never unroll chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some villagehampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood the applause of listening senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty over a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muses flame far from the madding crowds ignoble strife this part of the elegy differs from the first copy the following stanza was excluded with the other alterations  hark how the sacred calm that breathes around bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease in still small accents whispering from the ground a grateful earnest of eternal peace   their sober wishes never learned to stray along the cool sequestered vale of life they kept the noiseless tenor of their way yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked implores the passing tribute of a sigh their name their years spelt by the unlettered muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that
