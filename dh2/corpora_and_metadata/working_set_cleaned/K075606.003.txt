historical  the third volume  london printed by and for j nichols red lion passage fleet street mdcclxxx  a select collection of miscellany poems the eagle and the robin the political moral of this little apologue is too evident to need any other comment than barely mentioning that the lady was queen anne desiring the reader to recollect the change which she made in her ministry in   0  the year in which this poem was written and referring to dr kings rufinus or the favorite in the english poets vol xx      n  an apologue translated from the original of aesop written two thousand years since and now rendered in familiar verse by h g l mag good precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity and here i present my good reader with one delivered by the first founder of mythology aesop himself maximus planudes takes notice of it as a very excellent part of his production and phaedrus camerarius and others seem to agree that his eagle and five others not yet translated are equal to any of his that are handed down to us though mr ogleby and sir roger lestrange had the unhappiness to be unacquainted with them yet i had the good fortune to discover them by the removal of my old library which has made me amends for the trouble of getting to where i now teach they were written or dictated at least by aesop in the fiftyfourth olympiad and though i designed them chiefly for the use of my school this being translated by a youth designed for a greek professor yet no man is so wise as not to need instruction aye and by the way of fable too since the holy scriptures themselves the best instructors teach us by way of parable symbol image and figure and david was more moved with nathans thou art the man than all the most rigid lectures in the world would have done whoever will be at the trouble of comparing this version with the original let them begin at the tenth line and they will find it metaphrastically done verbum verbo as the best way of justice to the author those that are mere adorers of  will not be angry that it is in this sort of meter for which i gave leave the lad having a turn to this sort of measure which is pleasant and agreeable though not lofty for my own part i concur with my master aristotle that  are very far from being unnecessary or unpleasant may this be of use to thee and it will please thine in all good wishes  horat gram  the eagle and the robin by dr king to the works of this excellent humourist which were first collected in      i prefixed some memoirs of his life which have since been so elegantly epitomized that it would be superfluous to enlarge on this article some extracts from his last biographer shall therefore supply the place william king was born in london in      the son of ezekiel king a gentleman he was allied to the family of clarendon from westminsterschool where he was a scholar on the foundation under the care of dr busby he was at eighteen elected to christchurch in      in      he was made master of arts and engaging in the study of the civil law became doctor in      and was admitted advocate at doctors commons  though he was a regular advocate in the courts of civil and canon law he did not love his profession nor indeed any kind of business which interrupted his voluptuary dreams or forced him to rouse from that indulgence in which only he could find delight his reputation as a civilian was yet maintained by his judgments in the courts of delegates and raised very high by the address and knowledge which he discovered in   00 when he defended the earl of anglesea against his lady afterward duchess of buckinghamshire who sued for a divorce and obtained it the expense of his pleasures and neglect of business had now lessened his revenues and he was willing to accept of a settlement in ireland where about   0  he was made judge of the admiralty commissioner of the prizes keeper of the records in birminghams tower and vicar general to dr marsh the primate but it is vain to put wealth within the reach of him who will not stretch out his hand to take it king soon found a friend as idle and thoughtless as himself in upton one of the judges who had a pleasant house called mountown near dublin to which king frequently retired delighting to neglect his interest forget his cares and desert his duty here he wrote mully of mountown a poem by which though fanciful readers in the pride of sagacity have given it a political interpretation was meant originally no more than it expressed as it was dictated only by the authors delight in the quiet of mountown in   0  when lord wharton was sent to govern ireland king returned to london with his poverty his idleness and his wit in      competence if not plenty was again put into his power he was without the trouble of attendance or the mortification of a request made gazetteer he was now again laced in a profitable employment and again threw the benefit away an act of insolvency made his business at that time particularly troublesome and he would not wait till hurry should be at an end but impatiently resigned it and returned to his wonted indigence and amusements one of his amusements at lambeth where he resided was to mortify dr tennison the archbishop by a public festivity on the surrender of dunkirk to hill an event with which tennisons political bigotry did not suffer him to be delighted king was resolved to counteract his sullenness and at the expense of a few barrels of ale filled the neighborhood with honest merriment in the autumn of      his health declined he grew weaker by degrees and died on christmas day though his life had not been without irregularity his principles were pure and orthodox and his death was pious after this relation it will be naturally supposed that his poems were rather the amusements of idleness than efforts of study that he endeavored rather to divert than astonish that his thoughts seldom aspired to sublimity and that if his verse was easy and his images familiar he attained what he desired his purpose is to be merry though perhaps to enjoy his mirth it may be sometimes necessary to think well of his opinions i need not repeat that this is quoted from dr johnson  the poems which are now presented to the reader are none of them in the late collection of the english poets n    of the commons not printed in his works a lady lived in former days that well deserved the utmost praise for greatness birth and justice famed and every virtue could be named which made her course of life so even that she is a saint if dead in heaven this lady had a little seat just like a palace twas so neat from aught but goodness her retreat one morning in her giving way as was her custom every day to cheer the poor the sick and cold or with apparel food or gold there came a gazing stranger by on whom she quickly cast an eye the man admiring made a stand he had a bird upon his hand  what is that says she that hangs its head sinking and faint it is almost dead  madam a redbreast that i found by this wet season almost drowned  oh bring him in and keep him warm robins do never any harm they soon obeyed and chopped him meat gave him whatever he would eat the lady care herself did take and made a nest for robins sake but he perkt up into her chair in which he plenteously did fare assuming quite another air the neighbors thought when this they spied the world well mended on his side with welltuned throat he whistled long and every body liked his song  at last said they this little thing will kill itself so long to sing we ll closet him among the rest of those my lady loves the best they little thought that saw him come that robins were so quarrelsome the door they opened in he pops and to the highest perch he hops the partycolored birds he chose the goldfinches and such as those with them he would peck and bill and feed and very well at times agreed canarybirds were his delight with them he would teteatete all night but the brown linnets went to pot he killed them all upon the spot the servants were employed each day instead of work to part some fray and wished the awkward fellow cursed that brought him to my lady first at last they all resolved upon t some way to tell my lady on t meanwhile he d had a noble swing and ruled just like the gallic king having killed or wounded all unless the eagle in the hall with whom he durst but only jar he being the very soul of war but hated him for his desert and bore him malice at his heart this eagle was my ladys pride the guardian safety of her side he often brought home foreign prey which humbly at her feet he lay for color pinions and stature the fairest workmanship of nature twould do one good to see him move so full of grandeur grace and love he was indeed a bird for jove he soared aloft in brucums field and thousand kites and vultures killed which made him dear to all that flew unless to robin and his crew one day poor bob puffed up with pride thinking the combat to abide a goosequill on for weapon tied knowing by use that now and then a sword less hurt does than a pen as for example  what at home you ve well contrived to do at rome a pen blows up  before you come you are supposed to undermine the foe  in some immense design a pen can bite you with a line there is forty ways to give a sign well  all on fire away he stalked till come to  where the eagle walked bob did not shilli shalli go nor said one word of friend or foe but flirting at him made a blow as gamecocks with their gauntlets do at which the eagle gracefully cast a disdaining sparkling eye as who should say  what s this a fly but no revenge at all did take he spared him for their ladys sake who pondered these things in her mind and took the conduct of the eagle kind upon reflection now  to show what harm the least of things may do mad robin with his cursed flirt one of the eagles  amongst the greeks signifies honor as tender as the eye king eyes had hurt inflamed it made it red and sore but the affront inslamd it more oh how the family did tear to fire the house could scarce forbear with scorn not pain the eagle fired murmured disdain and so retired robin to offer some relief in words like these would heal their grief  should the eagle die which heaven forbid we ought some other to provide i do not say that any now are fit but in a year or two and should this mighty warrior fall they should not want a general as men have long observed that one misfortune seldom comes alone just in the moment this was done ten thousand foes in sight were come vultures and kites and birds of prey in flocks so thick  they darkened day a longconcerted force and strong vermin of all kinds made the throng foxes were in the faction joined who waited their approach to ground by every hand from common fame the frightful face of danger came one cries what help now  who can tell i am glad the eagle s here and well another out of breath with fear says thousands more near sea appear they will swop our chicken from the door we never were so set before we are glad the eagle will forget and the invaders kill or beat reserved and great his noble mind above all petty things inclined abhorred the thoughts of any thing but what his ladys peace could bring who blessed him first and bade him do as he was wont and beat the foe burning and restless as the sun until this willing work was done he whets his talons stretched his wings his lightning darts and terror flings towers with a flight into the sky these million monsters to descry prepared to conquer or to die the party that so far was come thought not the eagle was at home to fame and danger used in field they knew he would quickly make them yield but on assurance he was near encumbered faint and dead with fear they made with hurry toward the lakes and he his pinions over them shakes they had not with such horror filled the courage to let one be killed they fled and left no foe behind unless it were the fleeting wind only  a man by water took two fine young merlins and a rook the family had now repose but with the sun the eagle rose the imperial bird pursued the foe more toil than rest inured to know he winged his way to latian land where first was hatched this murdering band he darted death wherever he came some of them dying at his name their mighty foe  a fatal pledge their bowels tore through every hedge they flutter shriek and caw and hiss their strength decays and fears increase but most the chevaliers the geese so many slaughtered fowl there was their carcases blockdup the ways the rest he drove half spent pellmell quite to the walls of pontifell robin at home though mad to hear he should so conquer every where expostulated thus with fear  ungrateful i that so have stirred against this generous noble bird wast thou not first by him preferred let us leave him in his gall to burn and back to pontifell return there some to chimneytops aspire to turrets some that could fly higher some bove a hundred miles were gone to roost them at byzantium alas in vain was their pretense he broke through all their strong defense down went their fences wires and all perches and birds together fall none hoped his power to withstand but gave the nest to his command they told him of ten thousand more in flocks along the ganges shore safe in their furrows free from trouble like partridges among the stubble he spreads himself and cuts the air and steady flight soon brought him there lord how deceived and vexed he was to find they were but mere jackdaws a hundred thousand all in light they all could chatter not one fight  i will deal by them as is their due  shough cried the eagle off they flew his flashing eyes their hearts confounds though by their flight secure from wounds which was a signal fatal baulk to a late swift italian hawk the eagle would no rest afford till he had sent my lady word who when she heard the dear surprise wonder and joy stood in her eyes  my faithful eagle have thou then my moral foes destroyed again return return and on me wait be thou the guardian of my gate thee and thy friends are worth my care thy foes if any such there are shall my avenging anger share so  lest new ills should intervene she turned the robin out again the samians now in vast delight bless their good lady day and night wish that her life might never be done but everlasting as the sun the eagle high again did soar the lady was disturbed no more but all things flourished as before robin red breast with the beasts an old cats prophecy taken out of an old copy of verses supposed to be writ by john lidgate a monk of bury by dr king not printed in his works one that had in her infant state while playing at her fathers gate seen and was most hugely smitten with young dog and dirty kitten had took them up and lugd them in and made the servants wash them clean the political drift of this pretended prophecy is still more evident than that of the preceding poem the satire being abundantly more personal n  when she to a fit age was grown to be sole mistress of her own then to her favor and strange trust she raised these two in rank the first the dog who with gilt collar graced strutted about the cat was placed over all the house to domineer and kept each wight of her in fear while he over all the plains had power that savage wolves might not devour her flocks she gave him charge great care to take but beasts uncertain are now see by these what troubles rise to those who in their choice unwise put trust in such for he soon joined with beast of prey the dog combined who killed the sheep and tore the hind while he would stand and grin and bark concealing thus his dealings dark a wolf or so sometimes he would take and then o what a noise he would make but with wild beasts oerrun yet are the plains some die for want of fare or torn or killed the shepherds find each day are lost of every kind thy silly sheep lament in vain of their hard fate not him complain the shepherds and the servants all against the traitor loudly bawl but there was none that dared to tell their lady what to them besel for puss a fox of wondrous art broughtin to help and take their part by whose assistance to deceive she made her every lie believe one lucky day when she was walking in her woods with servants talking and stopped to hear how very well a redbreast sung then him to dwell with her she called he came and took his place next to a favorite rook where robin soon began to sing such songs as made the house to ring he sung the loss and death of sheep in notes that made the lady weep how for his charge the dog unfit took part with foes and shepherds bit even from his birth he did him trace and show him cur of shabby race the first by wandering beggars fed his sire advanced turned spit for bread himself each trust had still abused to steal what he should guard was used from puppy known wherever he came both vile and base and void of shame the cat he sung that none could match for venomed spite or cruel scratch that from a witch transformed she came who kittend three of equal fame this first one dead of tabby fur the third survives much noise of her had been a cat well known with ease on errands dark over land and seas she would journies take to cub of bear from these intriguing beasts who swear they will bring him to defend the wrong that they have done again he sung how tabby once in moonlight night trotted with letter fox did write in which he sends his best respects to the shebear and thus directs  madam said he your cub safe send  none shall his worship soon offend  it s all i can at present do  to serve him as his friends well know at this the beasts grew in such rage that none their fury could assuage nay puss her lady would have scratched and tore her eyes but she was watched for she d set up her back and mew and thrice even in her face she flew the dog like an ungrateful spark at her would dare to snarl and bark her tenants wondering stood to hear that she their insolence would bear and offered their assistance to soon make them better manners know but she to avoid all farther rout her window opening turned bob out hoping that then her beasts would live in peace and no disturbance give yet nothing she can do avails their rage against her still prevails though puss was warned to fear their fate in lines by old prophetic cat writ before her transformation when she was in the witchs station foretelling thus when beasts are grown  to certain heights before unknown  of human race some shall aloud  inflame and arm a dreadful crowd  who in vast numbers shall advance  and to new tunes shall make them dance  when this begins no longer hope  for all remains is ax and rope but not deterred by this they dared with some who of their plunder shared to affront their lady and conspire to many with her money hire contemning her to pay undue regards unto this bestial crew though these resembled human shapes they were indeed no more than apes who some in house and some in wood and others in high boxes stood that chattering made such noise and stir how all was due to fox and cur till by their false deluding way she found her flocks begin to stray still robin does for her his care and zeal express on whom yet are his thoughts all fixed on her he dreams each night her praises are his themes in songs all day now perched on tree finding himself secure and free he pertly shakes his little wings sets up his throat again he sings  that she had left no other way to save her flocks and end this fray but soon to her assistance take one who could make these monsters shake a wellknown huntsman who has skill the fiercest beasts to tame or kill at her command he would come and he would make her great and set them free that should these beasts some evil day bring cub into her grounds she may depend that not herself they will spare since to insult her now they dare all she at best can hope for then is to be safe shut up in de since by sure signs all these ingrate are known to bear her deadly hate he ends his song and prays to heaven that she may have the wisdom given before it be too late to take such resolutions as may make her safe and that these beasts no more to ravage in the plains have power bibliotheca a poem occasioned by the sight of a modern library with some very useful episodes and digressions probably by the same this is ascribed to dr king upon conjecture only it was published in      the winter before he died by his bookseller inscribed to his patron and is very much in his manner his name is accordingly affixed to the authors notes the poem is on many accounts worth preserving and if it is not dr kings it is at least not by an inferior writer n   ridiculum acri  fortius et melius magnas plerunque secat res   utile dulci hor to the most noble prince henry duke of beaufort marquis and earl of worcester earl of glamorgan baron herbert lord of chepstow ragland and gower

servant bibliotheca though the interests of virtue and religion are best secured by the severest reason and argument yet i hope a less solemn recommendation of them to the world may not be esteemed a prejudice to either how often has a stubborn folly been successfully arraigned by a candid and easy rebuke which had long maintained itself against a more powerful though a less familiar conviction if we can smile away the follies of an adversary sport with his vanities and laugh him into a sense of his errors why should we forfeit that exquisite pleasure of complacency and good humor which a malicious conflict with a rival would most certainly deprive us of if we miscarry in an attempt of this nature our defeat would be the less dishonorable because we seemed only to play and trifle with the mistakes of an author but should we under the mask of a little raillery wit and good humor obtain our end it would double our satisfaction as well as the glory of our conquest two important debates of the utmost consequence in religion eachards contempt of the clergy and philautus and timothy have with wonderful applause lately appeared in the world the beauties of their authors style the purity of their diction the elegant turn of thought and above all a torrent of severe but goodnatured wit drew a thousand readers to peruse an hypothesis they little imagined ever to espouse but they were insensibly deluded into good principles and betrayed into a conviction of those very truths they came on purpose to deride and ridicule where they expected to gratify a fancy only they found a more real advantage in the reformation of their judgment and from admirers of the authors wit and beauties became at last proselytes to their opinions if in two or three instances i have transgressed my own rules the fool or the knave must be imagined very notorious and that those tender and merciful lashes that were judged sufficient for little offenders would hardly have reached the vanities of the one or the villainies of the other and if i am thought to have injured any person in his character or to have said as much as i am able i must beg leave to assure the world that it was owing to abundance of humanity and goodnature i did not say a great deal more and would rather advise them to sit easy and quiet under the innocent rebukes of a satire than provoke others to prepare

thy history thou art no slave to rule or precedent where others imitate thou do invent it is we grant all thy invention the language too entirely is thy own thou leave as trash below thy great

twas envy robbed you of your praise before men see their faults and envy now no more it is but your merit nor can justly such which gave too little once now give too much your princes do all poetry surpass as much as penmainmaur exceeds parnass it is so great a prodigy of wit that art and nature both fall short of it for leaving art and left of nature too your poem has no other muse than you on the same as when a bully draws his sword though no man gives him a cross word and all persuasions are in vain to make him put it up again each man draws too and falls upon him even so dear ned thy desperate pen no less disturbs all witty men and makes them wonder what a devil provokes thee to be so uncivil when thou and all thy friends must know em thou yet wilt dare to print thy poem that poor curs fate and thine are one who has his tail peggd in abone about he runs nobody ll own him men boys and dogs are all upon him and first the greater wits were at thee now every little fool will pat thee fellows that never were heard or read of if thou writst on will write thy head off thus mastiffs only have a knack to cast the bear upon his back but when the unwieldy beast is thrown mungrils

wellsaid an audience could invite without the hope of such a gaudy sight what with your fathers took would take with you if wit had still the charm of being new had not enjoyment dulled your appetite she in her homely dress would yet delight such stately theaters we need not raise our old house would put off our dullest plays you gallants know a fresh wench of sixteen may drive the trade in honest bombazine and never want good custom should she lie in a back room two or three stories high but such a beauty as has long been known though not decayed but to perfection grown must if she think to thrive in this lewd town wear points laced petticoats and a rich gown her lodgings too must with her dress agree be hung with damask or with tapestry have china cabinets and a great glass to strike respect into an amorous ass without the help of stratagems and arts an old acquaintance cannot touch your hearts methinks it is hard our authors should submit so tamely to their predecessors wit since i am sure among you there are few would grant your grandfathers had more than you but hold i in this business may proceed too far and raise a storm against our theater and then what would the wise adventurers say who are in a much greater fright today than ever poet was about his play our apprehensions none can justly blame money is dearer much to us than fame this thought on let our poets justify the reputation of their poetry we are resolved we will not have to do with what is between those gentlemen and you be kind and let our house have but your praise youre welcome every day to damn their plays song as he lay in the plain his arm under his head and his flocks feeding by the fond celadon said if loves a sweet passion why does it torment if a bitter said he whence are lovers content since i suffer with pleasure why should i complain or grieve at my fate when i know it is in vain yet so pleasing the pain is so soft is the dart that at once it both wounds me and tickles my heart to myself i sigh often without knowing why and when absent from phyllis methinks i could die but oh what a pleasure still follows my pain when kind fortune does help me to see her again in her eyes the bright stars that foretell what is to come by soft stealth now and then i examine my doom i press her hand gently look languishing down and by passionate silence i make my love known but oh how i am blessed when so kind she does prove by some willing mistake to discover her love when in striving to hide she reveals all her flame and our eyes tell each other what neither dare name the prisoner in the tower to the lady m c whilst europe is alarmed with wars and rome foments the christian jars whilst guilty britain fears her fate and would repent her crime too late here safe in my confined retreat i see the waves about me beat and envy none that dare be great a quiet conscience and a friend help me my happy hours to spend let celia to my cell resort she turns my prison to a court instead of guards by day and night let celia still be in my sight and then they need not fear my flight could sense of servile fear prevail or could my native honor fail her sight would all my doubts control and give her back my peaceful soul such charming truths her words contain or if her angel voice refrain her eyes can never plead in vain love but one see these two little brooks that slowly creep in snaky writhings through the plains i knew them once one river swift and deep blessing and blessed by poets strains then touched with awe we thought some god did pour those floods out of his sacred jarr transforming every weed into a flower and every flower into a star but since it broke itself and double glides the naked banks no dress have worn and you dry barren mountain now derides these valleys which lost glories mourn such chloris is thy love which while it ran confined within a single stream fired every tuneful son of mighty pan and thou were mine and all mens theme but when imparted to one lover more it in two streams did faintly creep the shepherds common muse grew low and poor and mine as lean as these my sheep alas that honor chloris thou have lost which we to thy full flood did pay while now that swain that swears he loves thee most slakes but his thirst and goes away song on a lady indisposed by mr bevil higgons an account of this poet has been already printed in vol i p     to which the following anecdote may be added king charles ii sold dunkirk to louis xiv and gave him english oak enough to build the very fleet that afterward attacked and defeated one of ours in bantry bay on the coast of ireland this puts me in mind of the foresight of a gentleman who had been some time envoy from the king to the princes and states of italy and who in his return home made the coast of france his road in order to be as useful to his country as possible and to his sovereign too as he thought in his audience of the king he told his majesty that the french were hard at work building men of war in several of their ports and that such a hasty increase of the naval power of france could not but threaten englands sovereignty of the seas and consequently portend destruction to her trade the gentleman was in the right for our trade and the sovereignty of the seas are dependent on each other they must live or die together but what a recompense do you think he met with for his fidelity really such a one as i would hardly have believed had i been told it by any person but his own son the late mr bevil higgons whose works both in prose and verse have made him known to all the men of letters in britain and whose attachment to the family of stuart even to his dying day puts his veracity in this point out of dispute the recompense was a severe reprimand from the king as the forerunner to the laying him aside for talking of things which his majesty told him it was not his business to meddle with i forget from which of the political writers between    0 and    0 this anecdote was transcribed most probably the craftsman n  flavias eyes like fires suppressed more fiercely flame again nor can her beauty be decreased nor altered by her pain those various charms which round her play and do her face adorn still as they ripen fall away fresh beauties still are born so does it with the lovers fare who do the dame adore one fit of love killed by despair another rages more to sir godfrey kneller drawing lady hydes picture by mr higgons the cyprian queen drawn by apelles hand of perfect beauty did the pattern stand but then bright nymphs from every part of greece did all contribute to adorn the piece from each a several charm the painter took for no one mortal so divine could look but happier kneller fate presents to you in one that finished beauty which he drew but oh take heed for vast is the design and madness twere for any hand but thine for mocking thunder bold salmoneus dies and it is as rash to imitate her eyes to a lady who raffling for the king of frances picture flung the highest chances on the dice by the same fortune exerts her utmost power for you nor could she more for her own louis do she thought some mighty kingdom was the stake and did his throw for the great monarch make but as all princes at far distance woo first send their image where their heart is due so now thrice happy nymph would you resort where fate invites you to the gallic court that lucky genius which the picture gave would make the great original your slave he like the piece can only be your prize who never yields but to the brightest eyes on lady sandwichs elizabeth countess of edward the third earl n being stayed in town by the immoderate rain by mr higgons the charming sandwich would from cities fly while at her feet adoring princes lie and all her nobler conquests would forego less glorious slaves and peasants to subdue thus conquering monarchs who have kingdoms won and all their neighboring states with arms oerrun for want of work their armies to employ remote and savage provinces destroy but heaven in pity weeps while we complain or else our tears exhaled drop down in rain the darkened sun does scarce through clouds appear and tempests rage to keep our wishes here the floods free passage to her scorn deny and nature disobeys her cruelty but could the waves rise equal to our flame wed drown the world to stop the flying dame to mr pope by the same thy wit in vain the feeble critic gnaws while the hard metal breaks the serpents jaws grieve not my friend that spite and brutal rage

deserves the utmost that thy rage can do thy humor be thy law thy lust thy guide nor subject be to any thing beside but obstinacy vanity and pride in truths like these the hardy britons train thus subjects wise their liberties maintain and thus rebellion will securely reign subjects like these their trembling rulers awe thus kings receive the people give the law if any saucy monarch dare oppose

published a collection of his poems under the title of the ramble an antiheroick poem together with some terrestrial hymns and carnal ejaculations by alexander radcliffe of grays inn esquire       vo inscribed to james lord annesley he had published in    0 ovid travestie a burlesque upon ovids epistles with a satirical introduction occasioned by the preface to a latebook called the wits paraphrased mr tonson printed a third edition of this travestie in      the dedication to robert fairbeard of grays inn esquire is no bad specimen of the authors humor having committed these epistles to the press i was horribly put to it for a patron i thought of some great lord or some angelic lady but then again considered i should never be able to adorn my dedication with benign beams corruscant rays and the devil and all of influence at last i heard my good friend mr fairbeard was come to town  nay then  all is well enough to you therefore i offer this english ovid to whom you may not be unaptly compared in several parcels of your life and conversation only with this exception that you have nothing of his tristibus it is you who burlesque all the foppery and conceited gravity of the age i remember you once told a grave and affected advocate that he burlesqued gods image for god had made him after his own likeness but he made himself look like an ass upon the whole matter i am very well satisfied in my choice of you for a judge if you speak well of the book it is all i desire and the bookseller will have reason to rejoice though by your approbation you may draw upon yourself a grand inconvenience for perhaps you may too often have songs sonnets madrigals and an innumerable army of stanzas obtruded upon you by sir your humble servant alex radcliffe  amongst his

composition supersedes what otherwise might have been said yaldens hymn to darkness is his best performance being for the most part imagined with great vigor and expressed with great propriety of his other poems it is sufficient to say that they deserve perusal though they are not always exactly polished i the rather cite this testimony of the great biographer as the publishers of the english poets have been censured for admitting yalden into their collection a censure which if deserved i must take upon myself however it happened that this writers poems had never been before collected i am persuaded that there are few who have actually read them but must have sound much to admire in the english poets i inserted as many of them as could then be met with farther researches have discovered what are here printed but there are still four poems which are known to be dr yaldens two of which are particularly noticed in dr johnsons life of him which have eluded my inquiries the conquest of namur      folio the temple of fame to the memory of the duke of gloucester   0 folio aesop at court and a poem on the late queens accession i suppose queen anne which by the title of it seems not to

of his education he was admitted a scholar of exeter college oxford and afterward removed to all souls where he applied to the study of physic which he afterward practiced with good reputation at exeter on the death of dr leopolwilliam finch warden of all souls college he was invited in   0  to succeed to that headship but contracted such an indisposition by the journey as occasioned his death in a few days he was buried in the outward chapel belonging to that society jacob says he was a wellbred genteel man most agreeable in conversation very polite in his compositions and peculiarly happy in the expressiion of his thoughts the westcountry gentlemen mention him with very great esteem and his name and character are very much respected in the university n  it is no hard matter to divine how i who love a wench and wine and all the studied luxuries that lamb author of a famous book of cookery or locket the master of a celebrated eatinghouse or tavern see kings art of cookery ver     n can devise should have the gout and penance do with foot on chair in velvet shoe but how a man predicamental ly sober and near transcendental that never was known to be a glutton beyond a penny chop of mutton and cannot tell what sixth sense or whore is and goody is his only chloris how such a one should have intestine saline and acid so infesting is strange to me and as obscure a riddle almost as the cure the learned sydenham does not doubt but profound thought will bring the gout and that with bum on couch we lie because our reason s soared too high as cannons when they mount vast pitches

sadness the best cure for t is the oil of gladness epistle from dr waldren to dr chetwood on his refusing to take the oaths most profound since at a tavern i cannot meet you in paper embassy i greet you to advise you not to be so wary touching king william and queen mary that spite of fellowship and pupils you ll weigh your conscience out in scruples if as ye queensmen must believe two negs make

unprejudicate nay the argument i will assure you to some appears a fortiori hoc dato et concesso thus i in baralypton blunderbuss ye he that to two kings takes an oath is by the last absolved from

be true in one who loves daily to act it anew for if whilst you re fair you resolve to be coy you may hourly repent and hourly destroy yet none will believe you protest what you will that you grieve for the dead if the living you kill where then are our hopes when we zealously woo if you vow to abhor what you constantly do then celia be kinder and tell me my fate for the worst i can suffer s to

essay upon death by dr waldren tell me some kind spirit tell how came death so terrible thou who rt already fled in triumph say why the embodied soul is so in love with clay by what strange magnetism wooed she so adheres to flesh and blood that fate must force her from her dark abode or she would grovelling lie the eternal tenant of mortality the wretch whom a malignant fever fires who at each pore in liquid flames expires cold deaths refreshing hands to shun does to the unkinder doctor run for juleps blisters and phlebotomy the fevers vanquished and the man is free yet all this torment only gains the privilege of being racked again with these or the severer pains of some more merciless disease had not the patient better sought a silent tomb the assistance which distempers give but where they never come old age which one would guess should with a kind of lust lie down and sleep in dust does yet the grand fatigue of life caress and gapes for its last dregs with inextinguishable thirst when the gay fire of the dull eye is lost like cooling metals fixed by winters frost when the bald head depopulate and bare looks smooth as a white globe of ice deprived of its onceflourishing spring the hair all that remains will not suffice the mighty sum to count to which the numerous years that have gone over amount yet even this feeble piece now but the monument of what he was does with his cordials and elixirs treat to make his weary pulses beat with momentary heat still he abhors the dismal thought of death still on his guard he stands would fain defend his faultering breath against the conquerors stroke with crutches in his hands strange riddle of a mystical desire that man should wish his vital fire might vestal prove and never expire that he should hope that his eclipsed beams like arethusa under ground might stray and never disembogue their shining streams into the glorious ocean of inexhausted day is this the cause we so much boast our reason as a sure unerring guide no less our safety than our pride and would it have us in a tempest ride in which we are for ever lost when one kind shipwreck would convey us safe back to our native coast a coast where we may pleasures taste high with the gust of perils past where a perpetual spring of bliss blooming in all the rich luxuriances of neverfading ecstasies satiates but does not cloy the ravished mind where no tears fall but those of joy which niluslike when they oerflow are kind but though with all this pomp of words we prate and paint our happy future state yet sure we think them pageantries of a distempered head which fancys pencil did delineate the broken visions of the living when they dream they re dead that we re so loath to die proceeds from infidelity for whatsoever the sturdy men of sense those sculls of axiom and philosophy by reasons telescope pretend to evince beyond this world there can no other be worse than this life when it appears in all its hurricanes of hopes and fears so some balked gamester that has only one poor stake and knows not when he shall get more to keep in play does his last chance with trembling take and would the fatal throw delay the box once cast to him for ever s cast away or if we re truly satisfied the soul is to divinity allied that its impenetrable hypostasis is of a lasting and substantial make which deaths arrest can never shake but sprinkled ashes shall arise kindled with an exalted energy if this our firm persuasion be doubtless it is guilt which makes us groan when fate sends forth the black decree of dissolution as a debauched gallant who s just embarking for a foreign land amidst a rout of creditors does trembling stand who for quick payment with wild fury rant the unhappy wretch cannot find a bail and thus his journey s finished in a gaol so conscience ralliesup of crimes the worst of debts ten thousand bills embitters with new poison deaths ungrateful cup and the departing soul with horror fills thus

of k james ii to the throne by mr william ayloffe which is tolerably harmonious but too fulsomely flattering to deserve preservation n  from the dark stygian lake i come to acquaint poor england with her doom which by the infernal sisters late i copied from the book of fate and though the sense may seem disguised it is in these following lines comprised  when england shall forsake the broom and take the thistle in the room a wanton fiddler shall be led by fate to shame his masters bed from whence a spurious race shall grow designed for britains overthrow these whilst they do possess her throne shall serve all interests but their own and shall be both in peace and war scourges unto themselves and her a brace of exiled youths whose fates shall pull down vengeance on those states that harbored them abroad must come well skilled in foreign vices home and shall their dark designs to hide with two contesting churches side till with cross persecuting zeal they have destroyed the commonweal then incest murder perjury shall fashionable virtues be and villainies infest this isle shall make the son of claudius smile no oaths or sacraments hold good but what are sealed with lust and blood lust which cold exile could not tame nor plague nor fire at home reclaim for this she shall in ashes mourn from europes envy turn her scorn and curse the day that ever gave birth to cecil or to monk on earth but as i onwards strove to look the angry sister shut the book and said no more that fickle state shall know no further of her fate her future fortunes must be hid till her known ills

sacheverell the history of this man affords a very striking example of the folly and madness of party which could exalt an obscure individual possessed of but moderate talents to an height of popularity that the present times behold with wonder and astonishment he was the son of joshua sacheverell of marlborough clerk who died minister of st peters church in marlborough leaving a numerous family in very low circumstances henry was put to school at marlborough at the charge of mr edward hearst an apothecary who being his godfather adopted him as his son hearsts widow put him afterward to magdalen college oxford where he became demi in      at the age of    young sacheverell soon distinguished himself by a regular observation of the duties of the house by his compositions goodmanners and genteel behavior qualifications which recommended him to that society of which he was fellow and as public tutor had the care of the education of most of the young gentlemen of quality and fortune that were admitted of the college in this station he bred a great many persons eminent for their learning and abilities and among others was tutor to mr holdsworth whose muscipula and dissertations on virgil have been so deservedly esteemed he was contemporaty and chamberfellow with mr addison and one of his chief intimates till the time of his famous trial mr addisons account of the greatest english poets dated april        in a farewellpoem to the muses on his intending to enter into holy orders was inscribed to mr henry sacheverell his then dearest friend and colleague much has been said by sacheverells enemies of his ingratitude to his relations and of his turbulent behavior at oxford but these appear to have been groundless calumnies circulated only by the spirit of party in his younger years he wrote some excellent latin poems besides several in the second and third volumes of the musae anglicanae ascribed to his pupils there is a good one of some length in the second volume under his own name transcribed from the oxford collection on q marys death      he took the degree of ma may         bd feb     0  dd july     0  his first preferment was cannock in the county of stafford he was appointed preacher of st saviors southwark in   0  and while in this station preached his famous sermons at derby aug      0  and at st pauls nov   in the same year and in one of them was supposed to point at lord godolphin under the name of volpone it has been suggested that to this circumstance as much as to the doctrines contained in his sermons he was indebted for his prosecution and eventually for his preferment being impeached by the house of commons his trial began feb      0  0 and continued until the   d of march when he was sentenced to a suspension from preaching for three years and his two sermons ordered to be burnt this ridiculous prosecution overthrew the ministry and laid the foundation of his fortune to sir simon harcourt who was counsel for him he presented a silver basin gilt with an elegant inscription he very soon after was collated to a living near shrewsbury and in the same month that his suspension ended had the valuable rectory of st andrew holborn given him by the queen at that time his reputation was so high that he was enabled to sell the first sermon preached after his sentence expired for the sum of  00l and upwards of  0000 copies it is said were soon fold we find by swifts journal to stella jan           that he had also interest enough with the ministry to provide very amply for one of his brothers yet as the dean had said before aug         they hated and affected to despise him in      he prefixed a dedication to fifteen discourses occasionally delivered before the university of oxford by w adams ma late student of christ church and rector of staunton upon wye in oxfordshire after this publication we hear little of him except by quarrels with his parishioners although he was much suspected to be concerned in atterburys plot a considerable estate at callow in derbyshire was left to him by his kinsman geo sacheverell esquire he died june        and by his will bequeathed to bishop atterbury then in exile who was supposed to have penned his defense for him the sum of  00l by a letter to him from his uncle      it appears that he had a brother named thomas and a sister susannah  the duchess of marlborough describes him as an ignorant impudent incendiary a man who was the scorn even of those who made use of him as a tool account etc p      and bp burnet says he was a bold insolent man with a very small measure of religion virtue learning or good sense but he resolved to force himself into popularity and preferment by the most petulant railings at dissenters and lowchurch men in

ills her waning orb puts on a various form to give the sign of an impending storm when southwinds rise the herdsmen justly fear and seek a shelter when the tempest s near first from a gentle blast the winds arise whose infant voice in whispering murmurs flies then with loud clamours fills the troubled skies by small degrees advanced it stronger grows till every point each other does oppose then through the jarring zones it frets and roars and lifts the swelling billows to the shores vast watery mountains roll upon the sand and angry surges beat the trembling land a harsh shrill noise the echoing caverns fills and strikes the ear from the resounding hills whose reverend tops with aged pinetrees crowned rock with the wind and tremble with the sound the threatening surges hardly can forbear the tattered vessel while the seamen fear each rolling billow should their last appear the frightened native of the troubled waves his longaccustomd habitation leaves now born aloft a winged army soar to seck for safety on a calmer shore the moorhen conscious of the tempest near plays on the sand and so prevents her fear the hern forsakes his ancient marshy bed and towers to heaven while clouds bedew his head sometimes he s met by a descending star which warns the tempest rushing from afar the headlong planet glides in fiery streams and shoots through darkness with its radiant beams it cuts the shadows with a train of light and makes a medley of the day and night a sportive whirlwind lifts the moving sand in mystic circles dancing on the land now wanton feathers whiten all the flood and sapless leaves fly over the shaken wood at distance blackening in a dusky cloud but when a newfledgd storm comes blustering forth and quits the thundering regions of the north when east and west in distant poles conspire uniting rage to swell the deluge higher with rapid streams the fullchargd channels flow collecting forces as they farther go the unruly tide no sturdy banks control over

of this witty but profligate nobleman were very judiciously pruned by dr johnson before their admission into the tenth volume of the english poets the song here preserved however is sufficiently exempt from the censure too many of this writers poems have deserved in the supplement to swift i have had occasion to observe from mr granger that rochester had natural modesty the fact is he wrote but little of the ribaldry which passes under his name but having obtained the character of a lewd writer every thing in that strain was fathered upon him in all his works dr johnson says there is sprightliness and vigor and every where may be found tokens of a mind which study might have carried to excellence n  too late alas i must confess you need not arts to move me such charms by nature you possess twere madness not to love ye then spare a heart you may surprise and give my tongue the glory to boast though my unfaithful eyes betray a kinder story the passing bell come honest sexton take thy spade and let my grave be quickly made thou still art ready for the dead like a kind host to make my bed i now am come to be thy guest let me in some dark lodging rest for i am weary full of pain and of my pilgrimage complain on heavens decree i waiting lie and all my wishes are to die hark i hear my passing bell farewell my loving friends farewell make my cold bed good sexton deep that my poor bones may safely sleep until that sad and joyful day when from above a voice shall say  wake all ye dead lift up your eyes  the great creator bids you rise then do i hope among the just to

the spaniards in peru expressed by instrumental and vocal music and by art of perspective in scenes etc represented daily at the cockpit in drury lane at three afternoon punctually      this opera may safely be ascribed to sir william davenant it was first acted at the time and place and in the manner before described and afterward introduced by the author into the playhouse to be let see a list of his dramatic writings in the new edition of dodsleys old plays vol viii n       now heaven preserve our realm and him that sits at the helm i will tell you of a new story of sir william and his apes with full many merry japes much after the rate of john dorie this sight is to be seen near the street that is called the queen and the people have called it the opera but the devil take my wife if all the days in my life i did ever see such a foppery where first one begins with a trip and a cringe and a face set in starch to accost em i used by shakspeare and other ancient writers for aye n  and with a speech to boot that had neither head nor foot might have served for a charterhouse rostrum oh he looked so like a jew would have made a man spew when he told them here was this here was that just like him that shows the tombs for when the sum total comes it is two hours of i know not what neither must i here forget the music how it was set dise two ayers and a half and a jove to explain this the music should be seen and heard n  all the rest was such a gig like the squeaking of a pig or cats when they re making their love the next thing was the scene and that as it was lain but no man knows where in peru with a story for the nonce of raw head and bloody bones but the devil a word that was true there might you have seen an ape with his fellow for to gape now dancing and turning over and over what cannot poets do they can find out in peru things no man ever saw before then presently the spaniard struts with his winyard now heaven of thy mercy how grim whod have thought that christian men would have eat up children had he not seen them do it limb by limb oh greater cruelty yet like a pig upon a spit here lies one there another boiled to a jelly just so the people stare at an ox in the fair roasted whole with a pudding in s belly i durst have laid my head that the king there had been dead when i saw how they basted and carved him had he not come up again upon the stage there to complain how scurvily the rogues had served him a little further in hung a third by the chin and a fourth cut out all in quarters oh that fox had now been living they had been sure of heaven or at the least been some of his martyrs but which was strange again the indians that they had slain came dancing all in a troop but oh give me the last for as often as he passed he still tumbled like a dog in a hoop and now my signior strugge perhaps the baboon introduced in this opera r  in good faith you may go jogge for sir william will have something to brag on oh the english boys are come with their fife and their drum and still the knight must conquer the dragon and so now my story is done and i will end as i begun with a word and i care not who know it heaven keep us great and small and bless us some and all from every such pitiful poet the hypocrite by mr caryll of whom see vol ii p   n  on the lord shaftesbury      thou rt more inconstant than the wind or sea or that still veering sex outdone by thee reeling from vice to vice thou have run through legions of sins more than the casuists know of whom thy friends were wont to say poor devil at least he was not constant to his evil dealing so long in sins of pomp and glory who would have thought to make up guzmans story hypocrisy at last should enter in and fix this floating mercury of sin all his old sins like misses out of date turn pensioners to this new miss of state his actions look and garb take a new frame and wear the livery of this sullen dame plain band and hair and clothes disguise the man all but his dealing and his heart is plain not ovids stories nor the wife of lot can boast a change beyond our statebigot all on the sudden in one fatal morn our courtier did to a stark quaker turn some think he

poperys growth he sounds in every ear at which the dirty rout run grunting in as when the old wifes kettle rings the swine so the courtdame who in her youthful pride no pleasure to her craving sense denied but unreservd with every fresh delight did prodigally feast her appetite age drawing on when through her youths decay her servants with her beauty drop away for winter quarters she religion takes and of necessity a virtue makes and when the wrinkles of her face no cure will longer from the help of art endure covering the wornout sinner with the saint as once her face she now her soul does paint since churches are not must religion be of guilty persons still the sanctuary when great men fall or popular men would rise both from religion borrow their disguise then like achilles in his fateproof arms they boldly march guided with holy charms and browbeat caesar and defy his laws who dare resist the champion of gods cause but when the place or pension is your own when the opposing party is run down religion and gods cause aside are cast like actors habit when the play is past this dame hypocrisy with sour face does fit supply old mother moselys place she for his body

sovereignty in ulcers that this does abound in sin lazar without and lucifer within the silverpipe an allusion to a chirurgical instrument n is no sufficient drain for the corruption of this little man who though he ulcers have in every part is no where so corrupt as in his heart on seeing a bank of primroses in january covered with snow by mr thomas foxton author of the metamorphosis of mr pope into a stingingnettle at the end of the female dunciad      and translator of burnets archaeologia philosophica and his tract de futura judaeorum restauratione n  these forward roses spread an infant bloom lavish at once of beauty and perfume their yellow leaves with fragrant pride display and smile all lovely on the rising day ambitious seem to deck some virgins breast and there for ever lay their fading sweets to rest but cruel chance keen eastern gales arise and drive the winter through the hazy skies these pretty flowers can now no longer glow pierced with the frost and buried under snow if still relentless storms persist to beat and chilling vapors damp the genial heat there s no relief these gaudy sweets must die and all their pregnant charms in long oblivion lie but should the sun in majesty serene adorn the grove and paint the burnished green each drooping rose its mournful head would rear bright as the heavens and like the morning fair while purple honors crown the welldistinguishd year on the castle of dublin by dr parnell thomas parnell dd descended from an ancient family of congleton in cheshire was born in dublin in the year      and was admitted a member of dublin college at the early age of thirteen he took his degree of ma july     00 and in the same year was ordained a deacon by dr william king then bishop of derry having a dispensation from the primate as being under twentythree years of age he was admitted into priests orders about three years after by dr king then archbishop of dublin and was collated by dr st george ash bishop of clogher to the archdeaconry of clogher feb     0  about that time also he married miss anne minchin a young lady of great merit and beauty by whom he had two sons who died young and a daughter living in    0 swift in his journal to stella august         say i am heartily for poor mrs parnells death she seemed to be an excellent goodnatured young woman and i believe the poor lad is much afflicted they appeared to live perfectly well together this event is supposed to have made an indelible impression on his spirits he was warmly recommended by the dean to archbishop king who gave him a prebend in      and the vicarage of finglas worth about  00 l a year may         his gratitude is beautifully expressed in a poem on the deans birthday      he died at chester in july      on his way to ireland and was buried in trinity church in that town without any monument to mark the place of his interment as he left no male issue his estate devolved to his only nephew sir sir john parnell baronet whose father was younger brother to the archdeacon and one of the justices of the kings bench in ireland the character of dr parnell is admirably pourtrayed by dr goldsmith in the life prefixed to a volume of his poems originally published by mr pope in      a posthumous volume was printed at dublin in      and both these volumes united with several additional poems which i had formerly collected are printed in the fortyfourth volume of the english poets n       this house and inhabitants both well agree and resemble each other as near as can be one half is decayed and in want of a prop the other newbuilt but not finished at top on the death of mr viner by dr parnell is viner dead and shall each muse become silent as death and as his music dumb shall he depart without a poets praise who often to harmony has tuned their lays shall he who knew the elegance of sound find no one voice to sing him to the ground music and poetry are sisterarts show a like genius and consenting hearts my soul with his is secretly allied and i am forced to speak since viner died oh that my muse as once his notes could swell that i might all his praises fully tell that i might say with how much skill he played how nimbly four extended strings surveyed how bow and fingers with a noble strife did raise the vocal fiddle into life how various sounds in various order ranged by unobserved degrees minutely changed through a vast space could in divisions run be all distinct yet all agree in one and how the fleeter notes could swiftly pass and skip alternately from place to place the strings could with a sudden impulse bound speak every touch and tremble into sound the liquid harmony a tuneful tide now seemed to rage anon would gently glide by turns would ebb and flow would rise and fall be loudly daring or be softly small while all was blended in one common name wave pushed on wave and all composed a stream the different tones melodiously combined tempered with art in sweet confusion joined the soft the strong the clear the shrill the deep would sometimes soar aloft and sometimes creep while every soul upon his motions hung as though it were in tuneful concert strung his touch did strike the fibers of the heart and a like trembling secretly impart where various passions did by turns succeed he made it cheerful and he made it bleed could wind it up into a glowing fire then shift the scene and teach it to expire often have i seen him on a public stage alone the gaping multitude engage the eyes and ears of each spectator draw command their thoughts and give their passions law while other music in oblivion drowned seemed a dead pulse or a neglected sound alas he s gone our great apollo s dead and all that is sweet and tuneful with him fled hibernia with one universal cry laments the loss and speaks his elegy farewell thou author of refined delight too little known too soon removed from sight those fingers which such pleasure did convey must now become to stupid worms a prey thy grateful fiddle will for ever stand a silent mourner for its masters hand thy art is only to be matched above where music reigns and in that music love where thou will in the happy chorus join and quickly thy melodious soul refine to the exalted pitch of harmony divine epigram by dr parnell  haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat  res angusta domi    the greatest gifts that nature does bestow cannot unassisted to perfection grow a scanty fortune clips the wings of fame and checks the progress of a rising name each dastard virtue drags a captives chain and moves but slowly for it moves with pain domestic cares sit hard upon the mind and cramp those thoughts which should be unconfined the cries of poverty alarm the soul abate its vigor its designs control the stings of want inflict the wounds of death and motion always ceases with the breath the love of friends is found a languid fire that glares but faintly and will soon expire weak is its force nor can its warmth be great a feeble light begets a feeble heat wealth is the fuel that must feed the flame it dies in rags and scarce deserves a name love in disguise by dr parnell to stifle passion is no easy thing a heart in love is always on the wing the bold betrayer flutters still and fans the breath prepared to tell it melts the tongue and tunes the throat and moves the lips to form the note and when the speech is lost it then sends out its ghost a little sigh to say we die it is strange the air that cools a flame should prove but wonder not it is the air of love yet chloris i can make my love look well and cover bleeding wounds i cannot conceal my words such artful accents break you think i rather act than speak my sighs enlivened through a smile your unsuspecting thoughts beguile my eyes are varied so you cannot their wishes know and i am so gay you think i play happy contrivance such as cannot be prized to live in love and yet to live disguised chloris appearing in a lookingglass by dr parnell often have i seen a piece of art of light and shade the mixture fine speak all the passions of the heart and show true life in every line but what is this before my eyes with every feature every grace that strikes with love and with surprise and gives me all the vital face it is not chloris for behold the shifting phantom comes and goes and when it is here it is pale and cold nor any female softness knows but it is her image for i feel the very pains that chloris gives her charms are there i know them well i see what in my bosom lives oh could i but the picture save it is drawn by her own matchless skill nature the lively colors gave and she need only look to kill ah fairone will it not suffice that i should once your victim lie unless you multiply your eyes and strive to make me doubly die on a lady with foul breath by dr parnell art thou alive it cannot be there s so much rottenness in thee corruption only is in death and what s more putrid than thy breath think not you live because you speak for graves such hollow sounds can make and respiration cannot suffice for vapors do from caverns rise from thee such noisome stenches come thy mouth betrays thy breast a tomb thy body is a corpse that goes by magic raised from its repose a pestilence that walks by day but falls at night to worms and clay but i will to my chloris run who will not let me be undone the sweets her virginbreath contains are fitted to remove my pains there will i healing nectar sip and to be saved approach her lip though if i touch the matchless dame i m sure to burn with inward flame thus when i would one danger shun i m straight upon another thrown i seek a cure one sore to ease yet in that cure s a new disease but love though fatal still can bless and greater dangers hide the less i ll go where passion bids me fly and choose my death since i must die as doves pursued by birds of prey venture with milder man to stay on the number three by dr parnell beauty rests not in one fixed place but seems to reign in every face it is nothing sure but fancy then in various forms bewitching men or is its shape and color framed proportion just and woman named if fancy only ruled in love why should it then so strongly move or why should all that look agree to own its mighty power in three in three it shows a different face each shining with peculiar grace kindred a native likeness gives which pleases as in all it lives and where the features disagree we praise the dear variety then beauty surely never was yet so much unlike itself and so complete essay on the different styles of poetry this and the preceding poems by dr parnell as has been already said of dr yalden were omitted in the former collection only because they could not then be met with i cannot but take this opportunity of correcting a mistake which i was led into by dr birch in the note on the english poets vol xliv p     what is there said on the poem on queen annes peace more probably belongs to this essay the peace was not signed till march  0      by swifts journal to stella dec            jan         and feb           it appears that this poem received several corrections in consequence of hints from dr swift who introduced parnell both to oxford and bolingbroke n  to henry lord viscount bolingbroke by dr parnell allegory is in itself so retired a way of writing that it was thought proper to say something beforehand concerning this piece which is entirely framed upon it the design therefore is to show the several styles which have been made use of by those who have endeavored to write in verse the scheme by which it is carried on supposes an old grecian poet couching his observations or instructions within an allegory which allegory is wrought out upon the single word flight as in the figurative way it signifies a thought above the common level here wit is made to be pegasus and the poet his rider who flies by several countries where he must not touch by which are meant so many vicious styles and arrives at last at the sublime this way of writing is not only very engaging to the fancy whenever it is well performed but it has been thought also one of the first that the poets made use of hence arose many of those stories concerning the heathen gods which at first were invented to insinuate truth and morality more pleasingly and which afterward made poetry itself more solemn when they happened to be received into the heathen divinity and indeed there seems to be no likelier way by which a poetical genius may yet appear as an original than that he should proceed with a full compass of thought and knowledge either to design his plan or to beautify the parts of it in an allegorical manner we are much beholden to antiquity for those excellent compositions by which writers at present form their minds but it is not so much required of us to adhere merely to their fables as to observe their manner for if we preclude our own invention poetry will consist only in expression or simile or the application of old stories and the utmost character to which a genius can arrive will depend on imitation or a borrowing from others which we must agree together not to call stealing because we take only from the ancients there have been poets amongst ourselves such as spenser and milton who have successfully ventured further these instances may let us see that invention is not bounded by what has been done before they may open our imaginations and be one method of preserving us from writing without schemes as for what relates any further particularly to this poem the reader will observe that its aim is instruction perhaps a representation of several mistakes and difficulties which happen to many who write poetry may deter some from attempting what they have not been made for and perhaps the description of several beauties belonging to it may afford hints toward forming a genius for delighting and improving mankind if either of these happen the poem is useful and upon that account its faults may be more easily excused parnell    vatibus addere calcar  ut studio majore petant helicona virentem hor ep ii   i hate the vulgar with untuneful mind hearts uninspird and senses unrefind hence ye profane i raise the sounding string and bolingbroke defcends to hear me sing when greece could truth in mystie fable shroud and with delight instruct the listening crowd an ancient poet time has lost his name delivered strains on verse to future fame still as he sung he touched the trembling lyre and felt the notes a rising warmth inspire ye sweetening graces in the music throng assist my genius and retrieve the song from dark oblivion see my genius goes to call it forth twas thus the poem rose  wit is the muses horse and bears on high the daring rider to the muses sky who while his strength to mount aloft he tries by regions varying in their nature flies at first he rises over a land of toil a barren hard and undeserving soil where only weeds from heavy labor grow which yet the nation prune and keep for show where couplets jingling on their accent run whose point of epigram is sunk to pun where these and the like conceits of putting poems into seveshapes by the different lengths of lines are frequent in old poets of most languages parnell wings by fancy never feathered fly where lines by measure formed in hatchets lie where altars stand erected porches gape and sense is cramped while words are pared to shape where mean acrosticks labored in a frame on scattered letters raise a painful scheme and by confinement in their work control the great enlargings of the boundless soul where if a warriors elevated fire would all the brightest strokes of verse require then straight in anagram a wretched crew will pay their undeserving praises too while on the rack his poor disjointed name must tell its masters character to fame and if my fire and fears aright presage the laboring writers of a future age shall clear new ground and grots and caves repair to civilize the babbling echoes there then while a lover treads a lonely walk his voice shall with its own reflection talk the closing sounds of all the vain device select by trouble frivolously nice resound through verse and with a false pretense support the dialogue and pass for sense can things like these to lasting praise pretend can any muse the worthless toil befriend ye sacred virgins in my thoughts adored ah be for ever in my lines deplored if tricks on words acquire an endless name and trifles merit in the court of fame at this the poet stood concerned a while and viewed his objects with a scornful smile then other images of different kind with different workings entered on his mind at whose approach he felt the former gone and shivered in conceit and thus went on  by a cold region next the rider goes where all lies covered in eternal snows where no bright genius drives the chariot high to glitter on the ground and gild the sky bleak level realm where frigid styles abound where never yet a daring thought was found but counted feet is poetry defined and starved conceits that chill the readers mind a little sense in many words imply and drag in loitering numbers slowly by here dry sententious speeches half asleep prolonged in lines over many pages creep nor ever show the passions well expressed nor raise like passions in anothers breast here flat narrations fair exploits debase in measures void of every shining grace which never arm their hero for the field nor with prophetic story paint the shield nor six the crest nor make the feathers wave nor with their characters reward the brave undeckd they stand and unadorned with praise and fail to profit while they fail to please here forced description is so strangely wrought it never stamps its image on the thought the lifeless trees may stand for ever bare and rivers stop for aught the readers care they see no branches trembling in the woods nor hear the murmurs of increasing floods which near the roots of ruffled waters flow and shake the shadows of the boughs below ah sacred verse replete with heavenly flame such cold endeavors would invade thy name the writer fondly would in these survive which wanting spirit never seemed alive but if applause or fame attend his pen let breathless statues pass for breathing men here seemed the singer touched at what he sung and grief a while delayed his hand and tongue but soon he checked his fingers chose a strain and flourished shrill and thus arose again  pass the next region which appears to show it is very open unimprovd and low no noble flights of elevated thought no nervous strength of sense maturely wrought possess this realm but common turns are there which idly sportive move with childish air on callow wings and like a plague of flies the little fancies in a poem rise the jaded reader every where to strike and move his passions every where alike there all the graceful nymphs are forced to play where any water bubbles in the way there shaggy satyrs are obliged to rove in all the fields and over all the grove there every star is summoned from its sphere to dress one face and make clorinda fair there cupids fling their darts in every song while nature stands neglected all along till the teased hearer vexed at last to find one constant object still assault the mind admires no more at what is no longer new and hastes to shun the persecuting view there bright surprises of poetic rage whose strength and beauty more confirmed in age for having lasted last the longer still by weak attempts are imitated ill or carried on beyond their proper light or with refinement flourished out of sight there metaphors on metaphors abound and sense by differing images confound strange injudicious management of thought not born to rage nor into method brought ah sacred muse from such a realm retreat nor idly waste the influence of thy heat on shallow soils where quick productions rise and wither as the warmth that raised them dies here over his breast a sort of pity rolled which something laboring in the mind controlled and made him touch the loud resounding strings while thus with musics stronger tones he sings  mount higher still still keep thy faithful seat mind the firm reins and curb thy coursers heat nor let him touch the realms that next appear whose hanging turrets seem a fall to fear and strangely stand along the tracts of air where thunder rolls and bearded comets glare the thoughts that most extravagantly soar the words that sound as if they meant to roar for rant and noise are offered here to choice and stand elected by the public voice all schemes are slighted which attempt to shine at once with strange and probable design it is here a mean conceit a vulgar view that bears the least respect to seeming true while every trifling turn of things is seen to move by gods descending in machine here swelling lines with stalking strut proceed and in the clouds terrific rumblings breed here single heroes deal grim deaths around and armies perish in tremendous sound here fearful monsters are preserved to die in such a tumult as affrights the sky for which the golden sun shall hide with dread and neptune lift his sedgymatted head admire the roar and dive with dire dismay and seek his deepest chambers in the sea to raise their subject thus the lines devise and false extravagance would fain surprise yet still ye gods ye live untouched by fear and undisturbed at bellowing monsters here but with compassion guard the brain of men if thus they bellow through the poets pen so will the readers eyes discern aright the rashest sally from the noblest flight and find that only boast and sound agree to seem the life and voice of majesty when writers rampant on apollo call and bid him enter and possess them all and make his flames afford a wild pretense to keep them unrestrained by common sense ah sacred verse lest reason quit thy seat give none to such or give a gentler heat twas here the singer felt his temper wrought by fairer prospects which arose to thought and in himself a while collected sat and much admired at this and much at that till all the beauteous forms in order ran and then he took their track and thus began  above the beauties far above the show in which weak nature dresses here below stands the great palace of the bright and fine where fair ideas in full glory shine eternal models of exalted parts the pride of minds and conquerors of hearts upon the first arrival here are seen ranged walks of bay the muses evergreen each sweetly springing from some sacred bough whose circling shade adorned a poets brow while through the leaves in unmolested skies the gentle breathing of applauses flies and flattering sounds are heard within the breze and pleasing murmur runs among the trees and falls of water join the flattering sounds and murmur softening from the shore rebounds the warbled melody the lovely sights the calms of solitude inspire delights the dazzled eyes the ravished ears are caught the panting heart unites to purer thought and grateful shiverings wander over the skin and wondrous ecstasies arise within whence admiration overflows the mind and leaves the pleasure felt but undefind stay daring rider now no longer rove now pass to find the palace through the grove whatever you see whatever you feel display the realm you sought for daring rider stay here various fancy spreads a varied scene and judgment likes the sight and looks serene and can be pleased itself and helps to please and joins the work and regulates the lays thus on a plan designed by double care the building rises in the glitterring air with just agreement framed in every part and smoothly polished with the nicest art here laurelboughs which ancient heroes wore now not so fading as they proved before wreath round the pillars which the poets rear and slope their points to make a foliage there here chaplets pulled in gentlybreathing wind and wrought by lovers innocently kind hung over the porch their fragrant odours give and fresh in lasting song for ever live the shades for whom with such indulgent care fame wreaths the boughs or hangs the chaplets there to deathless honors thus preserved above for ages conquer or for ages love here bold description paints the walls within her pencil touches and the world is seen the fields look beauteous in their flowery pride the mountains rear aloft the vales subside the cities rise the rivers seem to play and hanging rocks repel the foaming sea the foaming seas their angry billows show curled white above and darkly rolled below or cease their rage and as they calmly lie return the pleasing pictures of the sky the skies extended in an open view appear a lofty distant arch of blue in which description stains the painted bow or thickens clouds and feathersout the snow or mingles blushes in the morning ray or gilds the noon or turns an evening gray here on the pedestals of war and peace in different rows and with a different grace fine statues proudly ride or nobly stand to which narration with a pointing hand directs the sight and makes examples please by boldly venturing to dilate in praise while chosen beauties lengthen out the song yet make her hearers never think it long or if with closer art with sprightly mien scarce like herself and more like action seen she bids their facts in images arise and seem to pass before the readers eyes the words like charms enchanted motion give and all the statues of the palace live then hosts embattled stretch their lines afar their leaders speeches animate the war the trumpets sound the feathered arrows fly the sword is drawn the lance is tossed on high the brave presson the fainter forces yield and death in different shapes deforms the field or should the shepherds be disposed to play amintors jolly pipe beguiles the day and jocund echos dally with the sound and nymphs in measures trip along the ground and ere the dews have wet the grass below turn homewards singing all the way they go here as on circumstance narrations dwell and tell what moves and hardly seem to tell the toil of heroes on the dusty plains or on the green the merriment of swains reflection speaks then all the forms that rose in lifes enchanted scene themselves compose whilst the grave voice controling all the spells with solemn utterance thus the moral tells  so public worth its enemies destroys or private innocence itself enjoys here all the passions for their greater sway in all the power of words themselves array and hence the soft pathetic gently charms and hence the bolder fills the breast with arms sweet love in numbers finds a world of darts and with desirings wounds the tender hearts fair hope displays its pinions to the wind and flutters in the lines and lifts the mind brisk joy with transport fills the rising strain breaks in the notes and bounds in every vein stern courage glittering in the sparks of ire inflames those lays that set the breast on fire aversion learns to fly with swifter will in numbers taught to represent an ill by frightful accents fear produces fears by sad expression sorrow melts to tears and dire amazement and despair are brought by words of horror through the wilds of thought it is thus tumultuous passions learn to roll thus armed with poetry they win the soul pass further through the dome another view would now the pleasures of thy mind renew where often description for the colors goes which raise and animate its native shows where often narration seeks a florid grace to keep from sinking ere it is time to cease where easy turns reflection looks to find when morals aim at dress to please the mind where lively figures are for use arrayed and these an action those a passion aid there modest metaphors in order sit with unaffected undisguising wit that leave their own and seek anothers place not forced but changing with an easy pace to deck a notion faintly seen before and truth preserves her shape and shines the more by these the beauteous similes reside in look more open in design allied who fond of likeness from anothers face bring every features corresponding grace with near approaches in expression flow and take the turn their pattern loves to show as in a glass the shadows meet the fair and dress and practice with resembling air thus truth by pleasure does her aim pursue looks bright and fixes on the doubled view there repetitions one another meet expressly strong or languishingly sweet and raise the sort of sentiment they please and urge the sort of sentiment they raise there close in order are the questions placed which march with art concealed in shows of haste and work the reader till his mind be brought to make its answers in the writers thought for thus the moving passions seem to throng and with their quickness force the soul along and thus the soul grows fond they should prevail when every question seems a fair appeal and if by just degrees of strength they soar in steps as equal each affects the more there strange commotion naturally shown speaks on regardless that she speaks alone nor minds if they to whom she talks be near nor cares if that to which she talks can hear the warmth of anger dares an absent foe the words of pity speak to tears of woe the love that hopes on errands sends the breeze and love despairing moans to naked trees there stand the new creations of the muse poetic persons whom the writers use whenever a cause magnificently great would fix attention with peculiar weight it is hence that humble provinces are seen transformed to matrons with neglected mien who call their warriors in a mournful sound and show their crowns of turrets on the ground while over urns reclining rivers moan they should enrich a nation not their own it is hence the virtues are no more confined to be but rules of reason in the mind the heavenly forms start forth appear to breathe and in bright shapes converse with men beneath and as a god in combat valor leads in council prudence as a goddess aids there exclamations all the voice employ in sudden flushes of concern or joy then seem the sluices which the passions bound to burst asunder with a speechless sound and then with tumult and surprise they roll and show the case important in the soul there rising sentences attempt to speak which wonder sorrow shame or anger break but so the part directs to find the rest that what remains behind is more than guessed thus filled with ease yet left unfinished too the sense looks large within the readers view he freely gathers all the passion means and artful silence more than words explains methinks a thousand graces more i see and i could dwell  but when would thought be free engaging method ranges all the band and smooth transition joins them hand in hand around the music of my lays they throng ah too deserving objects of my song live wondrous palace live secure of time to senses harmony to souls sublime and just proportion all and great design and lively colors and an air divine it is here that guided by the muses fire and filled with sacred thought her friends retire unbent to care and unconcerned with noise to taste repose and elevated joys which in a deep untroubled leisure meet serenely ravishing politely sweet from hence the charms that most engage they choose and as they please the glittering objects use while to their genius more than art they trust yet art acknowledges their labors just from hence they look from this exalted show to choose their subject in the world below and where an hero well deserves a name they consecrate his acts in song to fame or if a science unadorned they find they smooth its look to please and teach the mind and where a friendship s generously strong they celebrate the knot of souls in song or if the verses must inflame desire the thoughts are melted and the words on fire but when the temples decked with glory stand and hymns of gratitude the gods demand their bosoms kindle with celestial love and then alone they cast their eyes above hail sacred verse ye sacred muses hail could i your pleasures with your fire reveal the world might then be taught to know you right and court your rage and envy my delight but whilst i follow where your pointed beams my course directing shoot in golden streams the bright appearance dazzles fancys eyes and wearydout the fixed attention lies enough my verses have you worked my breast i will seek the sacred grove and sink to rest no longer now the ravished poet sung his voice in easy cadence left the tongue nor over the music did his fingers fly the sounds ran tingling and they seemed to die o bolingbroke o favorite of the skies o born to gifts by which the noblest rise improved in arts by which the brightest please intent to business and polite for ease sublime in eloquence where loud applause has styled thee patron of a nations cause twas there the world perceived and owned thee great thence anna called thee to the reins of state  go said the greatest queen with oxford go and still the tumults of the world below exert thy powers and prosper he that knows to move with oxford never should repose she spoke the patriot overspread thy mind and all thy days to public good resigned else might thy soul so wonderfully wrought for every depth and turn of curious thought to this the poets sweet recess that his lordship occasionally cultivated the muses may be seen in the fourth volume of this miscellany n retreat and thence report the pleasures of the seat describe the raptures which a writer knows when in his breast a vein of fancy glows describe his business while he works the mine describe his temper when he sees it shine or say when readers easy verse insnares how much the writers mind can act on theirs whence images in charming numbers set a sort of likeness in the soul beget and what fair visions often we fancy nigh by fond delusions of the swimming eye or further pierce through natures maze to find how passions drawn give passions to the mind oh what a sweet confusion what surprise how quick the shifting views of pleasure rise while lightly skimming with a transient wing i touch the beauties which i wish to sing is verse a sovereign regent of the soul and fitted all its motions to control or are they sisters tuned at once above and shake like unisons if either move for when the numbers sing an eager sight i have heard a soldiers voice express delight i have seen his eyes with crowding spirits shine and round his hilt his hand unthinking twine when from the shore the fickle trojan flies and in sweet measures poor eliza dies i have seen the book forsake the virgins hand and in her eyes the tears but hardly stand i have known her blush at soft corinnas name and in red characters confess a flame or wish success had more adorned his arms who gave the world for cleopatras charms ye sons of glory be my first appeal if here the power of lines these lines reveal when some great youth has with impetuous thought read over achievements which another wrought and seen his courage and his honor go through crowding nations in triumphant show his soul enchanted by the words he reads shines all impregnated with sparkling seeds and courage here and honor there appears in brave design that soars beyond his years and this a spear and that a chariot lends and war and triumph he by turns attends thus gallant pleasures are his waking dream till some fair cause have called him forth to fame then formed to life on what the poet made and breathing slaughter and in arms arrayed he marches forward on the daring foe and emulation acts in every blow great hectors shade in fancy stalks along from rank to rank amongst the martial throng while from his acts he learns a noble rage and shines like hector in the present age thus verse will raise him to the victors bays and verse that raised him shall resound his praise ye tender beauties be my witness too if song can charm and if my song be true with sweet experience often a fair may find her passions moved by passions well designed and then she longs to meet a gentle swain and longs to love and to be loved again and if by chance an amorous youth appears with pants and blushes she the courtship hears and finds a tale that must with theirs agree and he is septimius and his acme  with such a husband such a wife  with acme and septimius life is the conclusion of cowleys beautiful imitation of catullus in the english poets vol i p     on these lines an excellent prelate has observed that to the honor of cowleys morals and good taste by a small deviation from his original he has converted a loose lovepoem into a sober epithalamium we have all the grace and what is more all the warmth of catullus without his indecency n she thus lost in thought her melted heart she gives and the raised lover by the poet lives the counterscuffle these poems are preserved on account of the many droll anecdotes they contain the chimneys scuffle      a very indifferent poem seems to have given rise to this and many other of similar titles among others to fragmenta carceris or the kings bench scuffle with the humors of the commonside the kings bench litany and the legend of duke humphrey by samuel speed a member of that royal society      n     0 whereunto is added the counterrat written by r s these initials are possibly intended for sir roger lestrange who among other vicissitudes of fortune spent near six years in gaols and almost four under a sentence of death in newgate  richard steer the only contemporary poet i can find with these initials was author of some wellmeaning but indifferent verses on a religious subject called the history of the babylonish cabal or the intrigues progression opposition defeat and destruction of the danielcatchers      n  let that majestic pen that writes of brave king arthur and his knights and of their noble feats and fights and those who tell of mice and frogs and of the skirmishes of hogs and of fierce bears and mastiff dogs be silent and now let each one listen well while i the famous battle tell in woodstreetcounter that befell in high lent in which great scuffle only twain without much hurt or being slain immortal honor did obtain by merit one was a captain in degree a strong and lusty man was he to other a tradesman bold and free of spirit and though he was no man of force he had a stomach like a horse and in his rage had no remorse or pity full nimbly could he cuss and clout and was accounted without doubt one of the prettiest sparks about the city and at his weapon any way he could perform a single fay even from the long pike to the taylors bodkin he reckt not for his flesh a jot he feared not englishman nor scot for man or monster cared he not a dodkin for fighting was his recreation and like a man in desperation for law edict or proclamation he cared not and in his anger cause being given to lift his hand against good sir steeven or any justice under heaven he feared not he durst his enemy withstand or at tergoos or calissand and bravely there with sword in hand would greet him and noble ellis was his name who amongst his foes to purchase fame not cared though the devil came to meet him and this brave goldsmith was the man who first this worthy brawl began which after ended in a can of mild beer but had you seen him when he fought how eagerly for blood he sought there is no man but would have him thought a wild bear imagine now you see a score of madcap gentlemen or more boys that did use to roist and roar and swagger among the which were three or four that ruled themselves by wisdoms lore whose very grandfires scarcely wore a dagger a priest and lawyer men well read in wiping spoons and chipping bread and falling to short grace being said full oundly whose hungry maws no sallads need good appetites therein to breed their stomachs without sauce could feed profoundly twas ill that men of sober diet who loved to fill their guts in quiet were placed with ruffians that to riot were given and o great grief even from their food their stomachs too being strong and good and that sweet place whereon it stood be driven but here it is sitting i repeat what food our dainty prisoners eat but if in placing of the meat and dishes from curious order i do swerve it is that themselves did none observe for which nor flesh they did deserve nor fishes but some perhaps will say that lent affords them not what here is meant so much so good and that they went without it it is like but if i add a dish or twain or three of flesh or fish they either had or did it wish never doubt it then wipe your mouths while i declare the goodness of this lenten fare which is in prison very rare i tell ye furmity sweet as any nut as good as ever swilld a gut and butter sweet as ever was put in belly eggs by the dozen new and good which in white salt uprightly stood and meats which heat and stir the blood to action as buttered crabs and lobsters red which send the married pair to bed and in loose bloods have often bred a faction fish buttered to the platters brim and parsnips did in butter swim strewn over with pepper neat and trim salt salmon smelts cried come eat me do not stay freshcod and maids full neatly lay and next to these a lusty ba con gammon stuck thick with cloves upon the back well stuffed with sage and for the smack daintily strewn with pepper black sousd gurnet pickrell sturgeon tench and trout meat far too good for such a rout to tumble toss and throw about and spurn it the next a neatstongue neatly dried mustard and sugar by his side roaches buttered flounders fried hot custard eels boiled and broiled and next they bring hertings that is the fishes king and then a courtly poul of ling and mustard but stay i had almost forgot the flesh which still stands piping hot some from the spit some from the pot new taken a shoulder and a leg of mutton as good as ever knife was put on which never were by a true glutton forsaken a loin of veal that would have dared one of the hungriest of the guard and they sometimes will feed full hard like tall men and such as love the lusty chine but when that i shall sup or dine god grant they be no guests of mine of all men thus the descriptions are complete which i have made of men and meat mars aid me now while i repeat the battle where pots and stools were used as gins to break each others heads and shins where blows did make bones in their skins to rattle where men to madness never ceased till each one furious as a beast had spoiled the fashion of a feast full dainty whereon had they not been accursed they might have fed till bellies burst but ellis showed himself the worst of twenty for he began this monstrous brawl which afterward incensed them all to throw the meat about the hall that even and now give ear unto the jar that fell between these men of war wherein so many a harmless scar was given the board thus finished each man sat some fell to feeding some to prate among whom a jarring question strait was risen for they grew hotly in dispute what calling was of most repute twas well their wits were so acute in prison the parson while they discoursed the parson blithe fed as he meant to have the tithe of every dish being sharp as scythe in feeding but haste had almost made him choke or else perhaps he would have spoke in praise of his long threadbare cloak and breeding the lawyer but after a deliberate pause the lawyer spoke as he had cause in commendation of the laws profession  the law quoth he by a just doom does censure all that to it come and still defends the innocent from oppression it favors truth it curbs the hope of vice it gives allegiance scope provides a gallows and a rope for treason this does the law and this is it which makes us here in prison sit which grounded is on holy writ and reason to which all men must subject be as we by daily proof do see from highest to the lowst degree the scholar noble and rich it does subdue the soldier and his swaggering crew   but at that word the captain grew in choler the soldier he looked full grim and at first word rapt out an oath that shook the board and struck his fist that the sound roared like thunder it made all skip that stood him near the frighted custard quaked for fear and those that heard it stricken were with wonder naught did he now but frown and puff and having stard and swore enough thus he began in language rough  thou cogging base foysting lawyer that do set thy mind on nothing but to get thy living by thy damned pet tifogging a slave that shall for half a crown with buckram bag and daggled gown wait like a dog about the town and follow a business on the devils part for fees though not with law nor art but head as empty as thy heart is hollow you stay at home and pocket fees while we abroad our bloods do leese and then with such base terms as these you wrong us but lawyer it is safer far for thee to prattle at a bar than once to show thy face in the war among us where to defend such thankless hinds the soldier little quiet finds but is exposed to stormy winds and weathers and often in blood he wades full deep your throats from foreign swords to keep and wakes when you securely sleep in feathers what could your laws and statutes do against invasions of a foe did not the valiant soldier go to quell them and to prevent your further harms with ensign fife and loud alarms of warlike drum by force of arms repel them your trespass action will not stand for setting foot upon your land when they in scorn of your command come hither no remedy in courts of pauls the ecclesiastical court n  in common pleas or in the rolls for jouling of your jobbernouls together were t not for us thou swad quoth he where would thou fog to get a fee but to defend such things as thee it is pity for such as thou esteem us least whoever have been ready pressed to guard you and the cuckows nest your city the citizen that very word made ellis start and all his blood ran to his heart he shook and quaked in every part with anger he looked as if naught might assuage the heat of his enflamed rage his very countenance did presage some danger  a cuckows nest quoth he and so he hummd and held his head full low as if distracted thoughts did o verpress him at length quoth he my mother said at bristol she was broughttobed and there was ellis born and bred god bless him of londoncity i am free and there i first my wife did see and for that very cause quoth he i love it and he that calls it cuckows nest except he says he speaks in jest he is a villain and a beast i ll prove it this i ll maintain nor do i care though captain potgun stamp and stare and swagger swear and tear his hair in fury and with the hazard of my blood i ll fight up to the knees in mud but i will make my quarrel good assure ye for though i am a man of trade and free of londoncity made yet can i use gun bill and blade in battle and citizens if need require themselves can force the foe retire whatever this low country squire do prattle for we have soldiers of our own able enough to guard the town and captains of most fair renown about it if any foe should fight amain and set on us with all his train we ll make him to retire again never doubt it we have fought well in dangers past and will do while our lives do last without the help of any cast commanders that hither come compelled by want with rusty swords and suits provant from utrecht nimeguen or ghent in flanders the captain could no longer hold but looking fiercely plainly told the citizen he was too bold and called him proud boy and for his saucy speech did vow shortly to whip his breech then ellis snatched the pot with which he mauled him the scuffle he threw the jug and therewithal did give the captain such a maul as made him thump against the wall his crupper with that the captain took a dish that stood brimfull of buttered fish as good as any heart could wish to supper and as he threw his foot did slide which turned his arm and dish aside and all bebutterfishifide nick ballat and he good man did none disease but sitting quiet and at his ease with buttered rochets thought to please his palate but when he felt the wrong he had he raged and swore and grew starkmad some in the room been better had without him for he took hold of any thing and first he caught the poul of ling which he courageously did fling about him out of his hand it flew apace and hit the lawyer in the face who at the board in highest place was seated and as the lawyer thought to rise the salt was thrown into his eyes which him of sight in woeful wise defeated all things near hand nick ballat threw at length his buttered rochets flew and hit by chance among the crew the parson the sauce his coat did all bewet the priest began to fume and fret the seat was buttered which he set his     on he knew not what to do or say it was in vain to preach or pray or cry you are all gone astray good people he might as well go strive to teach divinty beyond his reach or when the bells ring out go preach in the steeple at this mischance the silly man out of the room would fain have ran and very angerly began to mutter ill luck had he for after that one threw the parsnips full of fat which stuck like broaches in his hat with butter out of the place he soon repairs and ran half headlong down the stairs and made complaint to master aires with crying then up ran he to know the matter and found how they the things did scatter here a trencher there a platter were lying i dare not say he stunk for woe nor will unless i did it know but some there be that dare say so that smelt him nor could you blame him if he did for they threw dishes at his head and did with eggs and loaves of bread bepelt him he thrust himself into the throng and used the virtue of his tongue but what could one mans words among so many the candles were all shuffled out the victuals flew afresh about was never such a combat fought by any now in the dark was all the coil some were bloody in the broil and some were steeped in salladoil and mustard the sight would make a man afeard another had a buttered beard anothers face was was all besmeared with custard others were daubed up to the knee with buttered fish and furmity and some the men could scarcely see that beat them under the boar lluellin will lluellin a prisoner there some time the keeper r s lay being sore affrighted with the fray and as the weapons flew that way he eat them the bread stuck in the windows all like bullets in a castlewall which furious foes did seek to scale in battle shoulders of mutton and loins of veal appointed for to serve the meal about their ears full many a peal did rattle the which when owen blany one of the underkeepers r s spied  oh take away their arms he cried lest some great hurt do them betide prevent it and then the knave away did steal of food that fell no little deal and in his house at many a meal he spent it the captain ran the rest among as eager to revenge the wrong done by the pot which ellis flung so stoutly and angry ellis sought about to find the furious captain out at length they met and then they fought devoutly now being met they never lin till with their loud robustious din the room and all that was therein did rumble instead of weapons made of steel the captain took a salted eel and at each blow made ellis reel and tumble ellis a pippinpie had got a sorer weapon than the pot for lo the apples being hot did scald him the captain laid about him still as if he would poor ellis kill and with his eel with a good will he mauled him at length quoth he ellis thou art a fellow of courageous heart yield now and i will take thy part hereafter quoth ellis much i scorn to hear thy words of threat being free from fear with which he hardly could forbear from laughter together then afresh they fly the eel against the pippinpie but blany stood there purposely to watch them the weapons wherewithal they fought were those for which he chiefly sought and with an eager stomach thought to catch them but scapd not now so well away as at the veal and mutton fray he thought to have with such a prey his jaws fed but all his hope did turn aside he looked for that which luck denied for ellis all bepippinpyd his calves head woe was the case he now was in the apples hot did scald his skin his skull as it had rotten been did quoddle with that one fool among the rout made outcry all the house about that blanys brains were beaten out his noddle which lockwood a turnkey a sat fellow r s hearing needs would see what all this coil and stir might be and up the stairs his guts and he went waddling but when he came the chamber near behind the door he stood to hear for in he durst not come for fear of swaddling there stood he in a frightful case and as by chance he stirred his face full in the mouth a buttered plaice did hit him away he sneaked and with his tongue he licked and swallowdup the wrong and as he went the room along be     him for help now does poor lockwood cry  oh bring a surgeon or i die my guts out of my belly fly come quickly blany with open mouth likewise for present help of surgeon cries  pity a man quoth he that lies so sickly phillips the skilful surgeon then was called and called and called again if he had skill to cure these men to show it at length he comes and first he puts his hands to feel for lockwoods guts which came not forth so sweet as nuts all know it he cries for water in the mean one calls up madge the kitchinquean to take and make the baby clean and clout it fast by the nose she took the squall and led him softly through the hall lest the perfume through knees should fall about it she turned his hose beneath the knee nor could she choose but laugh to see that yellow which was wont to be a white breech she took a dishclout off the shelf and with it wiped the sh elf which had not wit to help itself poor breech thus leaving lockwood all bewrayed unto the mercy of the maid who well deserved to be paid for taking such homely pains now let us cast our thought back on the stir that is past and them whose bones could not in haste leave aching and like the candles shall my pen show you these gallants once again which now like furies not like men appeared fresh lights being brought to appease the brawl show twenty madmen in the hall with blood and sauce their faces all besmeared their clothes all rent and soucd in drink oil mustard butter and the stink which lockwood left would make one think in sadness that these so monstrous creatures dwell either in bedlam or in hell or that no tongue or pen can tell their madness they were indeed disfigured so friend knew not friend nor foeman foe for each man scarce himself did know but after a frantic staring round about they suddenly did quit their doubt and loudly all at once brake out in laughter the heat of all is now allayed the keepers gently do persuade and as before all friends are made full kindly ellis the captain does embrace the captain does return the grace and so do all men in the place as friendly  by jove i love thee ellis cried the captain soon as much replied  thou art quoth he a man well tried and vulcan with mars at odds again shall be ere any jars twixt thee and me and thereupon i drink to thee a full can and then he kneeled upon the ground  drink t off quoth ellis for this round for ever shall be held renowned and never may any quarrel twixt us twain arise or this renew again but may we loving friends remain for ever  amen cried the captain so did all and so the health went round the hall and thus the famous counterbrawl was ended but hunger now did vex them more than all their anger did before they searched in the room how far their store extended they want the meat which blany stole one finds a herring in a hole with dirt and dust black as a coal and trodden all under feet the next in post snaps up and feeds on what was lost and looks not whether it were roast or sodden a third finds in another place a piece of ling in dirty case and mustard in his fellows face another espies and finds a loaf of bread a dish of butter all bespread and stuck upon anothers head in the pother thus what they found contented some at length the keeper brings a broom meaning therewith to cleanse the room with sweeping but under table on the ground looking to sweep by chance he found lluellin faining to be sound ly sleeping he pulled him out so swift by the heels as if his bum had run on wheels and found his pocket stuffed with eels his  did plenty of provision bring somewhat it held of every thing smelts flounders rochets and of ling a broad piece at this discovery each man round took equal share of what was found which afterward they freely drowned in good drink for of good beer there was good store till all were glad to give it over for each man had enough and more that would drink and when they thus had drunk and fed as if no quarrel had been bred they all shook hands and all to bed did shuffle ellis the glory of the town with that brave captain of renown and thus i end this famous coun terscuffle to the reader this bacchanalian nightprize of the counterscuffle being thus finished has ever since frighted both prisoners and gaolers from coming into any room for fear of a second uproar so that the counter for want of sweet garnishing and cleanly looking to is grown so nasly that no man by his good will will thrust his nose in at any of the grates nay will rather go a mile about than come near it though to keep it sweet a great deal of mace is stuck upon every sergeant as if he were a capon in white broth upon this slovenliness it is woefully haunted with rats not such rats as run up and down in brewhouses sucking the new wort of strong beer so long and in such abundance that half the city is compelled to drink beer as small as water nor those rats which are not mealymouthed in bakehouses where they gnaw so many batches of bread that a penny loaf wants sometimes three or four ounces in weight and then the honest baker is blamed and cursed and perhaps innocently set in the pillory neither are they those rats which greaze their throats in fallowchandlers shops where they nibble so much upon candles that not one pound in an hundred is ever full weight no these are no rats with four legs but only two and though they have nests in a thousand places of london yet for the most part they run but into two rattraps that is to say the counters of woodstreet and the poultry and for that cause are called counterrats  how caught how mouzd and what they are this picture lively does declare r s  the counterrat of knights and squires of low degree of roaring boys that stick and snee of battoon dammees that cry bree i sing now at men and women bawds and whores at pimps and pandars that keep doors i mean no playdoors those are too honest r s  at all that outface vintners scores i fling now what fling i nothing but light rhymes not tuned as are st pulchers chimes no steeples height my muse now climbs but flies close to the ground as swallows do when rainy weather must ensue she flies and sings and if not true she lies lay

fare o pity but it is good sport to see them dressed to garnish out a mornings feast each bit being salted with a jest scarce witty these are not rats that nibble cheese or challenge moldy crusts for fees and rather will their long tails leese than bacon no these are they whose guts being crammed as cannons hard with powder rammd and bagpipe cheeks with wines inflamed are taken by constables and billmen eke who speak not latin french nor greek but are nightsconces out to seek nightsneakers who late in taverns up do sit whiffing smoke money time and wit pouring in bowls till out they spit full beakers these then being to the counter led each prisoner shakes his shaggy head and leaning half out of his bed a laughing falls and cries out  a rat  a rat  oh roars another is he fat if not fley off his cloak or hat thus scoffing till morn they lie the poor rat gets into some hole beside his wits to hear such caterwauling fits so fright him but day being risen all up do rise and call for beer to clear his eyes  a garnish then the whole room cries they bite him ask any how such news i tell of woodstreets hole or poultrys hell know i did amongst those gypsies dwell that cozen there i mean

bedlam fits but some being rid like jades with bits ran wildly first about twelve the countergates thundered with thumpings  doors and grates reeled at the peal  when our prison mates up starting saw in the yard a frantic swarm crying o my head neck sides leg arm sore had the fight been but small harm at parting it was a watch swearing we bleed but twas their noses dropped indeed  masters quoth

snores and then afresh windfly the doors an usurer hedgdin with mad whores came wallowing as does a great ship on the seas set on by galleys for all these were fishwives who had wine at ease been swallowing and blown him up with pennypots of sack which fall to him by lots paid him at weeks end by the old trots for shillings each monday lent them to buy skate crabs plaice and sprats at billingsgate thus then they met and hold thus late their drillings he rests in peace but is not dead yet is worms meat in lousy bed and lies like one wrapped up in lead none stirred him but all his oystermouths gaped wide wine in their guts was at still tide the devil did so their rumps bestride and spurred them they flung and wincd and kicked down stairs themselves and stamped like flanders mares hell is broke loose no keeper dares approach them for at that dog besaucd in sack they grind their teeth and curse him black crying out it is he does break their back and broach them so fast that all their gains boil out deep red to dye his filthy snout but that which flung these brands about so hotly gan now to quench them sleep does sound retreat dead drunk they all lie drowned in castup wine and on the ground the shot lie a black rat scarce was this hellish din allayed but drenched in mire with drink bewrayed new curried was brought in a jade all mettle an ostrich that iron bars could eat and strongbeer out of seacoals beat his fifty cuffs did the watch fret and nettle this second smug who had the staggers this vulcanist whose nails were daggers this smith so armed in ale he swaggers at snoring though locktup yet set up his trade bolts hinges bars and grates he made fly which being heard the jaylors paid his roaring they furnished him with iron enough neck hands and legs had armor tough and stronger but more cold than buff to guard him how did they this none durst come near him like tom of bedlam did they fear him all bringing cans to pledge them swear him so snared him yet for all this he danced in s shackles and cried the other pot i want more tackles and thus till break of day it cackles laid having the addleegg of his turned brains in his iron nest of rusty chains which made him lose both sense of pains and raving a longtailed rat the next that in our littleease a place of confinement for tuibulent apprentices n  came to be bit with lice and fleas was a spruce knave like none of these but sober as the strand may pole where the newchurch now stands  swift says  i went in vain to look for eupolis  down in the strand just where the new pole is n

brains for lawtricks how to sting them and up to all the bars to bring them he sat hardtwisting cords to wring them till morning no more of this light skipping verse a dreary tale i now rehearse long this brown study did no last but in at countergates as fast thronged all the watch again a noise of scraping men and squeaking boys straight filled the house the twopenny ward leapt up and fell adancing hard out at the hole all thrust their heads the knightsward left their sevengroa beds the mastersside hearing the din swore that the devil was sure brought in but when they heard they fiddlers were some cursed the noise some lent an ear none cursed but what went drunk to bed being then for want of drink half dead locked were the fiddlers in a room all cried strike up play rogues fumfum the minikin tinkled roar did the base then bawdy songs all sleep must chase the men played heavily boys did whine not seeing meat money beer nor wine up such a laugh the prisoners took that the beds danced and chambers shook nay the strange hubbub did so please at prisonbace ran both lice and fleas the rosin rubbed off and catguts weary we asked how they who made men merry grew sad themselves and why like sprites fiddlers being strung to walk anights were they locked up  one then in the eye putting his finger told us why quoth he being met by a mad crew in these poor cases up they drew our fiddles and like tinkers swore we should play them to the blue boar kept by mad ralph this mad landlords house is now unknown n at islington whose hum and mum being poured upon our guts so burnt them we desired to part being out of the house even fired as our hands played our heads were plied and though the night was cold we fried for such hot waters sod our brain like daws in june we gaped for rain strong were our coxcombs our legs weak we nor our fiddles had wit to speak the company then being fast asleep and we paid foundly out did creep into the highway o sweet moon we but for thee had been undone yet though thy torch to us was lighted we all might well have been indicted for breaking into others ground three in one ditch being almost drowned yet out we scrambled and along the playhouse the redbull playhouse mentioned in vol i p     was situate in st johnsstreet the fortune playhouse which occurs in p     was near whitecrossstreet and was rebuilt by the celebrated edward alleyn see dodsleys old plays vol ix p     n came where seeing no throng we swore twas sure some scurvy play that all the people so sneaked away and so the players descended were to the stars nagshead or christopher to all those taverns it is an obvious remark that whatever may be the fashionable vices of the present age drunkenness has received a severe check amongst all ranks and particularly in higher life not one of the abovementioned taverns now exists and every man must remember an amazing number in london more than there are at present n  we cried let s go at which one fell and then swore  no the bars at smithfield well we passed for all the watch had run in haste armed with chalked bills waked by a cry of whoredrops taken by the enemy from cowcross stood those stoves not far in which were entered men of war low country soldiers late come over each one goingin to press a whore leaving them pressing on we trot through the horsefair till we had got into the middle of longlane where up the devil does brokers train there down we fell and then t fell out our leathern cases flew about we fenced and foind and fought so long that all our fiddles lay half unstrung their backs were broke and we of the ground swooning for grief they did not sound our noise brought up from aldersgate the rugged watch who before sat nodding at the mermaids door who with a guard of half a score seized us and cried at going away  sad lachrymae you there shall play this told the prisoners laughed outright and though the whole ward had no light yet from their beds all skip and cry  scraper strike up we the watch defy the moon so bold was to look in and saw some only in their skin naked as cuckoos when june s past some had long shirts down to their waist some wanted backparts some an arm none wore a shirt could keep him warm a french boy that sweeps chimnies wears his patchdup frock as white as theirs some on their heads no nightcaps wore some lappd their brows in hose all tore they hobble out they frisk they sing so long that cracked was every string by their rude horseplay altogether flinging their legs they cared not whither such horrid noise such stinking smell cannot be heard nor felt in hell yet over they gave not till the sun arose then all to bed did run good morrow the rats into the trap that fell this night were few the constable belike did wink and would not see for when the winds rise his watch and he toss all that venture on their waves the rocks being brownbills clubs and staves on which they split them these and they when morning comes are fetched away those rats over night whose shapes did leese being soon turned men by paying but fees yet some lose tail some are scratched bare whilst constables and counters share the

poem containing a true history and showing the folly foppery luxury laziness pride ambition and contention of the romish clergy by john crown a dramatic writer whose performances both in comedy and tragedy were acted with applause though comedy seems to have been more peculiarly his talent seventeen of his plays are enumerated by jacob he was bred under his father an independent minister in nova scotia being a man of some genius and impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country he resolved upon coming to england to try if he could not make his fortune by his wits when he first arrived here his necessities were extremely urgent and he was obliged to become a gentleman usher to an old independent lady but he soon grew as weary of that precise office as he was of the discipline of nova scotia he set himself therefore to writing and presently made himself so known to the court and town that he was nominated by charles ii to write the masque of calypso this nomination was procured him by the earl of rochester it must not however be ascribed entirely to his merit but to some little spite in this lord who designed by that preference to mortify mr dryden upon the breakingout of the two parties after the pretended discovery of the popish plot the favor crown was in at court induced him to embrace the tory party about which time he wrote a comedy called the city politics in order to satirize and expose the whigs this comedy was by many intrigues of the partymen hindered from appearing upon the stage till the king himself laid his absolute commands on the lord chamberlain to have it acted immediately about the latter end of this reign crown tired out with writing and desirous to shelter himself from the resentment of many enemies he had made by his city politics ventured to address the king himself for an establishment in some office that might be a security to him for life the king answered he should be provided for but added that he would first see another comedy mr crown endeavored to excuse himself by telling the king that he plotted slowly and aukwardly his majesty replied that he would help him to a plot and so put into his hand the spanish comedy called non pued esser out of which mr crown took the comedy of sir courtly nice the play was just ready to appear to the world and mr crown extremely delighted to think that he was going to be made happy the remaining part of his life by the performance of the kings promise but upon the last day of the rehearsal he met underhill the player coming from the house as he was going to it upon which reprimanding him for neglecting so considerable a part as he had in the comedy and upon the last day too lord sir says underhill we are all undone  how says crown is the playhouse on fire the whole nation replies the player will quickly be so for the king is dead the kings death ruined crown who had now nothing but his wits to live on for the remaining part of his life it is not certain when he died but it is supposed to be somewhere about the year   0  see denniss letters      vol i p    and the biographical dictionary  vo mr crown was author of two other poems called pandion and amphiginia and daeneids n  to john earl of mulgrave etc my lord i have long been ashamed to see so many of my writings march into the world and yet not one of them honored by your lordships patronage it is an easy matter for a troop to force themselves on ladies and neutral gentlemen or nobility who will not arm but they must be men of some merit and gallantry who compel regard from a general your lordship is as much above us in our own ways as you are in other respects and i give this manifest proof of it your fortune and most men believe your inclination fixes you on the top of ease and pleasure therefore you would never have written one line if it had cost you any pains yet have you performed masteries which we who make poetry the whole business of our lives could never equal in your essay on poetry there appears to me a commanding genius standing on a rise overlooking the age you live in seeing all the writers in it marching below you and too often disorderly and you give us those orders which plainly show poetry attends on you you may do what you please with it but we compared with your lordship are but poor drudges to it that have oftener the will than the power to do well your lordship has not only a perfect understanding of what is fit to pass in the world but you are of a severe temper which will not give your pass to any false sense the absence therefore of your name from my writings seems a silent charge against me of want of merit to remove that reproach i take this occasion to tell the world your lordship has approved of some of my writings and i have longed to make my brags of it but have been hindered either by the unkindness of fortune which has given me some blow and made me unfit to appear before you or by the kindness of some generous persons by which my writings have been in a manner mortgaged though the law of the land does not reckon favor freely bestowed among debts the law of gratitude does whenever a man is obliged a judgment is entered against him in the late reign when your lordship graced the lord chamberlains office you were pleased to show me those regards which made me vain and i was very desirous to make it known to the world but the cloudiness of those times got i think into my head i did not write so well as i have done formerly now i venture before your lordship because i bring an acquaintance of yours i am sure you value mr boileau and a piece of his all men of sense have esteemed because it exposes to contempt men who are the antipodes to good sense priests who advance nonsense above reason make trifles of the most solemn matters and solemn things of trifles are idle in the great affairs of their calling and busy in impertinence by the few we have had amongst us of such kind of churchmen we may guess the misery of the people who live in the roman church where there are scarce any other where the whole mass of priesthood is a heap of proud flesh and all the strength and nutriment of a nation goes to feed ecclesiastical corruption thanks be to god we are in a condition to make sport with them if ever they come amongst us they will spoil the jest and past dispute it is very fit to render men contemptible who endeavor to make religion so we have had too many in our church who have busied themselves and embroiled others about things which the french have had the understanding to know were only fit for a droll but now we have greater affairs on our hand we have not time to contend for modes in religion when the being of the protestant religion and indeed the english nation lies at stake in a calm at sea men may have leisure to wrangle at chess but if a storm arises the quarrel is at an end and the bishops knights rooks and pawns that bred it are left to shift for themselves i am well assured the lutrin pleases your lordship but i may doubt of my management of it for i treat it as an english privateer would do a french prize great part of it i sling away and i dash brew and disguise the rest as i think good i shall not value how the world censures me if i have the goodfortune to be approved of by your lordship and thought worthy of the title of my lord  your lordships most humble and obliged servant  john crown  canto i i sing of angels  not the heavenly choir whom peace and truth and harmony inspire hoarse brazen trumpetlike is my rough voice jarring churchangels therefore are my choice in mighty paris two great spirits reigned where one with ease could not be well contained they strove and from them dreadful thunders broke which made great notredame both shake and smoke and ere the almost falling church could fix strange janglings made among churchcandlesticks of all the priests that wealthy dome supplied with laziness with luxury and pride none deeper sunk or firmlier remained in peace and fat than he who over it reigned the dean a solid priest in flesh and bone he like a sleepy roller trundled on along all times and gathered as he rolled a heavy heap of fat and clammy mold he never knew when changes went or came all times faiths oaths appeared to him the same he had no palate but for meats and wine in those he was a learned profound divine and to those studies kept so close and hard to his cathedral he paid small regard meanwhile a haughty melancholy sour old busy snarling chanter steeped in power chief of the chanters there he was by right but not contented with that noble height usurped the deans supremacy and more took high prerogatives unknown before as scorning power only at secondhand and he was terrible in his command he made the singers shake more than in song this fierce usurper ruled in quiet long obeyed feared honored church affairs went on in a profound still current crossed by none at length the dean from his long slumbers woke burst through his cloud and church repose he broke he saw his reverence and state were gone and gallantly resolved to seize his own nay his prelatic legal pomp advance on the intruding chanters arrogance the great sould chanter having proudly reigned submission scorned and usurped state maintained by his devotion to pomp power and pride he won the zealous canons to his side who skilled in causes of that mighty weight lent him their aid by many a loud debate so of old pagan prelates madly strove the moons eclipse by noises to remove pagans beat dishes pans and platters hard our priests no chattering in quotations spared what devil envious of church repose these fireballs into holy bosoms throws and turns the church to a disordered out how can such fury enter souls devout stand off atheistic wits and scoffers vain do not my grave and solemn song profane great notredame the high and stately scene of our ensuing story long had been adorned and blessed with many a deep divine not deep in arts but in downbeds and wine their great devotion doubly they expressed in church by pomp at home by heavenly rest it graced their masters service to maintain in ease themselves his favorite gentlemen on their soft beds the morn they dosd away and left the choir the drudgery to pray and to rich lofty cushions to supply there rooms in church and raise gods honor high god was well served though priests were never there bright residentiaries the cushions were the holy men eat drank and slept with zeal all for heavens honor and the churchs weal kept from themselves all sacrilegious toil true to their fat they were as rhemes to oil to anoint gallic kings an angel brought much unctuous fat god sent his holy lot our pious canons which to keep from waste careful they were not to preach pray or fast or only fast to give themselves a whet so when they charged the rout was dreadful great sometimes soullulling sermons from them streamed but ah so gently when they preached they seemed like halcyons brooding over a slumbering wave to the cathedral peaceful calms they gave no croaking preacher spoiled with tedious din good sunday dinners or sweet weekly sin no noise was there but of harmonious sound division there only in song was found when horrid discord reared her snaky head to see who entertained a calm so dead so loathed by her her empire she surveyed and found her will by millions was obeyed gladly she saw in each wellgoverned state the law with formal pomp support debate but churches highly pleased her ear and eye she saw all churches set her honor high yet our cathedral only in music loud lodged peace in scorn of discord and her crowd discord in rage perched on the lofty dome and from her mouth she rained a poisonous foam which cracked the glass martyred the apostles there then with a sigh which made trees shed their hair fould the churchplate that all its splendors died like men in damps she vented thus her pride  how dare thou proud cathedral friendship show to peace said she my known and vanquished foe which round the world i ve spurned where has she rest in one fair realm sheas scarce one single breast how often there in the same person fight whig tory williamite and jacobite who have by turns the better of the fray as french or irish get or lose the day or as the hands of their good moses rise well to reward or sharply to chastise i ve made myself a barricado strong of stiff nonswearers a most stubborn throng who by no art to yield can be compelled and grow more hard like trees by being felled nay even some swearers to advance my reign the crown secured by law unfix again carve power by conquest which is carved by law some swearers against these keen weapons draw between them peace and truth lead wretched lives these fighters wound them with their carvingknives me above church and state all nations set and dares one church neglect a power so great woes for thee this provoking crime provides straight her enormous figure discord hides with a square cap a surplice hood and gown nor from an old sour canon could be known most true to discord he waged endless war with peace in presses pulpits at the bar all bars of civil and of canon laws to law he went with or without a cause with suits at law all his tithecorn he ground aye and himself and all his neighbors round he would not spare his purse brain flesh or bone to stir the clack of lawyers and his own discord and wrangling better to promote he railed he sued he studied and he wrote toiled unlike god from light he darkness spun worlds by this antimaker were undone he preached for malice in the pulpit boiled till dinners and devotions were both spoiled when his thin flock by winter winds were flayed to gaul the sore he would a long service read then far above his hour in pulpit rail then tack an altarservice to the tail till all their meat was burnt and noses raw some to provoke to give him food for law dissent assent his dues detain or pay though not to heaven to court s the certain way by this good guide all they were sure to find who not conformed in all things to his mind if pious reverence they forgot to show to altars and his person by a bow and did not service so exactly mark to start at all responses with the clerk to pour their voices in the muttering throng and help to push the murmuring stream along if they nicked not their times to kneel and rise and on these faults his spectacles were spies but woe to hugonots remote or nigh from his hot busy zeal and watchful eye proctors and paritours had wealthy spoil and constables an everlasting toil baptismal water sacramental wine cast away much of the reformers coin basins and bowls not blessed with legal forms were sure to meet with most confounding storms discord had chose this canon for her own and therefore markd his brow with many a frown his lean cheeks wrangled all the wrinkles clashd whenever they met and deep his visage slashed therefore his figure discord wisely wore for none could fit her better please her more canto ii to the deans palace stormy discord steered and finds the bulkly prelate sepulcherd in an alcove and down in hopes at last of joyful resurrection to repast in his fair spreading cheeks the churchs charge had raised a garden beautiful and large and in two stories built his goodly chin to let these run to ruin were a sin the holy man did no expenses spare to keep them faithfully in good repair and every part about him fat and sound for they were church demesnes and holy ground rich curtains gave his slumbers strong defense against das sacrilegious violence soft pillows had his cheeks and let no air approach to harm the lively roses there for youths springflowers in his dull autumn grew those checks possessing which were ages due all things in order were for dinner laid when the great goddess her proud entry made such exact order highly pleased her eye she knew the church by scrupulous decency in all the joys of silence ease and pride and with a breakfast strongly fortified the dean attending dinner slumbering lay when thus the goddess drove his rest away  wake quickly dean she said or wake no more a chanter haughtily usurps thy power shines in the choir with thy prelatic grace and awes it with the same commanding face all bows of singers are to him addressed all congregations by his mouth are blessed he graces all the saints high solemn days when to oblige them he in person prays shortly he will youth confirm and priests ordain and scarce to thee thy rochet shall remain renounce thy prelacy or thy repose thy fortune dooms thee one of them to lose this said she breathes into him through his ear the spirit of a common barretter he wakes and yawns and with halfopend eyes gives the dire fiend his blessing as he flies then like a raging bull with hornet stung around the chamber his fat body flung chid maids and lacqueys why he did not know and before dinner to the choir will go but his wise steward much allayed his rage by counsels seasonable calm and sage  what furys this said he has seized your mind and hurries you to church before you have dined often have you left the work of saving fouls to sport some hours at tables chess or bowls but for the church never dinner left till now the dresserboard is ready for the blow your cook now foams and so does your pottage with your judicious palate to engage and if your roastmeats you compel to stay sir they will weep their gravy all away your hautgousts now most vigorous and strong will sicken if in cold they tarry long and never be revived by second heat sir if you go you will murder all your meat it is not lent say twere it seems a waste of holiness in holy men to fast your tongues and pens support church rites and laws what need y engage your bowels in the cause sure twas the churchs motherly intent lent should keep prelates and not prelates lent religiously support your high degree do not by toil debase your dignity this said he wisely covered all the cloth with crowds of dishes and a flood of broth much on the pious dean this vision wrought his cloth a while st peters sheet he thought a treat let down from heaven in a dream till his pleased nostrils felt the inviting steam then fiercely he applied himself to eat and found it more than visionary meat fast over the tongue he turned his morsels all like morningcollects t a festival himself he almost choked but not his wroth he champd his words and meat confusedly both he skipt from dish to dish he knew not why no order minded nor sweet decency the steward thought his masters end was near he knew not creatures which he loved so dear and in great sorrow was about to run to summon friends but fame that work had done they scattering came like troops of daunted cranes when the proud pigmy a recruit obtains the visit raised the prelate from despair chased from his visage the late furious air so pleased he was with the respect they showed that he vouchsafed to rise nay more he bowed commanded the westphaliaham again filled wine himself to honor the good men drank first and largely the example pleased and strait a flaggon of its load was eased he kindly moved them then to take a part of what remained and of a fair desert the table clear out burst his inward pain  dear friends said he by whose support i reign myself your charitable work i own which the proud chanter thinks to tumble down at least by interposing in my rights to make me useless and blind up my lights to him do all church officers repair at his command the sexton rings to prayer chapters are held at his usurping call what need of deans if chanters can do all but then tears stopped the current of his talk his loving steward empowered his tongue to walk with cheerful wine when bovrude bending low with heavy age with trembling steps and slow entered the room the church had used his pains in four successive deans voluptuous reigns none in churchcustoms was so skilled as he he was a living true church history his knowledge raised him from a sexton poor to the high trust of all churchgarniture great office robes are often half the dean this rules those robes ordains them to be clean one in this office half a dean ordains over half a dean as dean he proudly reigns he has in part an archprelatic power he s of one college parcelvisitour at first approach the reverend sage espies the deans demolished pride and grovelling eyes guessing the cause he smiling toward him moved and fatherlike his childish grief reproved  for shame said he let the poor chanter weep your rights and empire study you to keep hark to the counsel heaven does now inspire where the proud chanter overlooks the choir with frowning arrogance some ages past the church was shaded with an engine vast desk throne or pulpit call it what you please at once it served devotion pomp and ease there throned in glory i have known a dean in vestments rich on velvet cushions lean prayerbooks embost with gold before him shone which drew all eyes upon them but his own a worm stolen from a grave the chanter seemed just visible enough to be contemned time fate or fiends malicious men or all for they re all foes to good conspired its fall malicious men we think by secret art gave it a sickness in some noble part that never visited nor minded well one morn it yawnd and down to ruin fell and to its worth the ungrateful choir unjust laid it in dark forgetfulness and dust what honored once the choir has now forlorn lain thirty winters languishing in scorn three of us fit for such a great affair will perriwigd in nights disheveled hair steal to the pulpit in its mournful room and gloriously reward its martyrdom if once to murmur the proud chanter dare the wretch with forty biting actions tear since not in learning be in law renowned show a churchspirit the whole church confound ere quit a tittle of your sacred right let laymen pray prelates are known by might your dazzling right divine dart at your foe then to the church in all churchsplendor go and there browbeat the usurper to the ground then to outbrave him disperse blessings round to blast his pride and show yourself supreme bless all the congregation nay bless him the counsel seemed to admiration wise the dean in ravishments with lifted eyes heavens inspiration most devoutly blessed but strait a new reflection struck his breast  i now have in the choir a seat said he clothed with rich cushions crowned with canopy on what pretense can i erect this throne boyrude replied a most religious one sermons to hear the assembly trembled all with horror at the sound fanatical the prelate hotly fired profanely swore and almost called for an inquisitor  dare thou said he name sermons in my ear i ll be no dean ere buy the place so dear i ll rather combat with wild beasts like paul or like isaiah be sawed once for all than weakly be with torturing sermons sawed postpone my meals and be with fasting gnawed nay more myself into the toil they ll fetch and i myself shall be obliged to preach  make potent prelates preach the sage replies pray by what rule you are not tongues but eyes our eyes guide all our limbs yet keep their ease labor becomes not highest dignities sectaries like jews with wanderings are perplexed doomed all their lives to rove from text to text die in that wilderness and never possess romes blessed holy land of laziness a land that flows with honey milk and gains at heavens sole cost and not the owners pains of this you ve more than a dim pisgah sight and ease is your inviolable right make canons preach and while the work is done let your austere grave presence lash them on by their dull saws no doubt you would be pained but you ll with sweet revenge be entertained they ve uncanonical rebellious tongues and from them you ve received a thousand wrongs like jades in waterworks sir make them sweat till from them penetential drops you get then you ll soon have revenge and reverence both soon at your feet they ll fall to compass sloth into a loud applause the assembly broke and thought man never with more wisdom spoke all start of fame to have the greatest share but the wise dean reduced them as they were  all things in church by order must be done said he that rears and fixes every throne none shall approach this work but those whom fate shall by a lot ordain and consecrate thirty selected names are writ with haste and in the bottom of a bonnet cast fairly to draw the billets they employ rosycheekd will that pretty singingboy his head new polld his face and linen clean though no saintsday for much he pleased the dean the prelate all partiality disclaims having thrice blessed as often shakes the names will draws and trole is the first name that comes birds promised good which freely peckd their crumbs sure no ill augury could now be read this redbeakd bird from liquor never fled a pleasing murmur in the throng was raised and fortunes choice by every one was praised will to his office does again repair and draws a name most fatal to the fair of a young singingman whose charms it is said had been the death of many a chambermaid nay his keen mounting darts reached lofty game threatened high ranks with loss of life or fame whatever beauty ogled him was lost and soon became a strumpet or a ghost yet to the dangerous snare they ventured all his silver pipe was a true ladycall which both churchpews and playhouse boxes crammed enticed the fair both to be saved and damned but oh that lady gained the height of bliss whom he in private taught to sing and kiss long the soft sex did for the youth contend some took their eyes some money for their friend some had him all and some had modest shares some cleared their tones some gave a crack to theirs to him his fortune gave a second choice and now they go to ask fates last advice their names and panting hearts are tossed again each fearing fate his person should disdain honest old verger what sincere delight shook thy dry corpse when thy name rose in sight thy yellow cheeks turned red and with a shout thou backwards gavst a spring in spite of gout now loyal true church hearts who for church weal had an unquenchable religious zeal much praised fates choice of men for church affairs and wished all realms as able ministers all kings as deep in sight as fate had shown in choosing men to serve the church and throne on the design now all prepare to go and in a murmuring stream away they flow to the deans cellar where they rent the arch with drunken songs and sounded often a march the prelate calmed resumed his lost repose and now till supper laid him down to dose canto iii now night was in the middle of her reign great was her pomp and spacious was her train from her large throne of jet she saw the proud high towers of paris scorn an humble cloud ravens and all the prophets of the air nightly to dormitories near repair amongst the rest for twenty winters foul in a dark cave a sibyl called an owl secured herself from days oppressing light and fled abroad to prophesy at night of great disasters she has early sense is an impartial true intelligence all sects believe her though she joins with none the schismatic flies all communion night for her healing touch nature enthrones she often cures both crazy minds and bones kings fallen with care below even common men she reanoints and makes them kings again day wears but night repairs nay makes mankind the only labor to her reign assigned therefore this ethiop with day divides the rule of time half through her empire slides angry to see her reign profaned with toil she posted to suppress the noisy broil and the bold authors for the great affair she chose this owl her premier minister and called her out her black queens voice she knew to her retinue joyfully she flew both swiftly through the august cathedral past and found the prison of the engine vast it lay neglected in a desert room night placed her bird deep in its dusty womb now trole and minnum two great chiefs elect left the deans vault and the slow verger checked he was as vigorous as they in mind but age and gout detained him far behind besides the old tortoise carried on his back of necessary tools a boisterous pack as hammer chissels mallet saw and nails under whose weight his wasted vigor fails the warriors force through nights affrightful shade then valiantly the high proud dome invade first they ascend to the magnific porch which stored the valued learning of the church the verger stopped the troop whilst with the dint of steel he cut the veins of stubborn flint and forced from thence a spark the infant bright as soon as born begot another light which proves to them a kind of midnight sun by whose direction boldly they go on the unfolding gates upon the troop let loose detested shades like floods through opening sluice like a bold caravan the stream they stem the horrors and the solitude contemn so on in wilds where never was a road and reach at length the pulpits dark abode their wonders on the fallen machine they feast like birds upon the carcass of a beast  how now said minnum come we here to gaze and then ambitious to engross the praise with a stiff threatening arm and bending back he singly made a desperate attack ere half his force the engine had received astonishing and scarce to be believed a horrid voice out of the pulpit flew the old verger from his back his burden threw the fire from troles flaming visage strayed only in his nose as in a socket played pale minnum like a lily hung his head with his lost mistress wished himself in bed but fearing shame he put false courage on seemed bolder now more danger might be won the frightful dangerous engine shook once more with greater resolution than before the angry owl once more deprived of ease rushes abroad with greater menaces scattering a storm of wind and dust about which put their candle and their courage out their trembling knees could not their bodies bear their nerves were weaker than their staring hair in wild confusion they slunk all away like truants by their whipster caught at play discord raged at their foil and in despite of their base fear will force them to the fight in boyrudes withered figure she appears aged but worn with wrangling more than years wrinkled but malice half the ciphers made and claim to half his wasted visage laid her bending trunk she with a staff supports and hastes to find her warriors dark resorts with broken voice and hoarse with frequent brawl she cries where are you fled ye cowards all think you because your odious heads ye hide your infamy more odious is not spied come out and show the reason of your fear stung with reproof with boldness they appear proud of the encounter and prepared to boast for all of them believed the owl a ghost minnum was fixed in the opinion strong his charms had killed a sempstress fair and young her heart was crushed between his voice and face the kingdom had not such a dangerous place his voice had fixed her in the fatal snare she often came to gaze on him at prayer and when his eye was from the book released he glances shot which pierced her tender breast at length alas she perished in the fray her ruin therefore heavy on him lay what shape could more exactly fit her soul than that of an unlovely bashful owl whom the winged chanters drive out of their sight and make her live in melancholy night with these conceits they swelling came and crammed minnum for the owl a doleful speech had framed he said we saw a ghost or goblin foul replied the goddess goblin a poor owl drives you from glory by base childish fears this owl has been my neighbor thirty years near my own house she every evening makes and sends abroad her nightly almanacks fear you a foolish timorous owls grimace how durst y encounter then a judges face board lawyers without sees as i have done and to myself immortal glory won judges from me could not protect the bar where spite of them my deeds recorded are oh sirs the church produced brave spirits then a sexton was as surly as a dean bore wrongs as proudly and forgave as few the least of us would a whole chapter sue but the old world grows barren by degrees and breeds no more such gallant souls as these however imitate their virtues great let not an owl compel you to retreat think what dishonor on yourselves you throw how insolent you will make the chanter grow from texts he cannot borrow such control as from the shameful story of the owl the thought of the owl will ride you night and day dispirit you though ye be never so gay untune your voices when you would sing your best russle your plumes when you are neatly dressed your surplices wips cravats set with care even women will regard you less than prayer the pews will be neglected by degrees and the old verger lose his sunday fees i hear a murmur say your spirits rise and i see churchlike fury in your eyes away to honor gather laurels fast with present bravery hide dishonor past this said the warlike goddess took her flight and mounting streaked the air with tracks of light which fired our champions hearts the howlard fled a generous contempt succeeded dread the affront received from the vile saucy foe on the engine was revenged by many a blow in mournful tones the pitying organ moand and the whole sympathizing temple groaned ah when this spacious wooden horse was reared if thou oh chanter had the treason heard thou in defense of ecclesiastic pride like a true church apostle would have died rather great martyr been than chanter small and in red letters shine or not at all but sleep thou feedst does with thy foes combine and hug thee whilst they compass their design for now a lofty ecclesiastic throne buries thy bench where thou so long have shone canto iv now do the cocks begin their morning brawl and drowsy chanters to their mattins call their chief was troubled with a frightful dream which made him sweat and waken with a scream his trembling valets on his second cries forsake their warm enticing down and rise but wakeful gerot reached his master first an humble valet but a verger cursed he kept the choir on the sinister side he crouchd at home but there he showed his pride mean were his common customers for pews so in their humble bows he took his dues said he what humor drives your rest away will you to church when it is scarcely day sleep on your business is to take your ease let vulgar chanters earn their salaries  friend said the chanter trembling faint and pale your mirth would die if you knew what i ail insult not over me but prepare to hear the amazing cause of my surprising fear when sleep had twice upon my eyes bestowed of drowsy poppies a freshgatherd load i dreamt i filled my lofty seat in prayer triumphing over the minor chanters there absolving chanting taking humble bows giving the blessing all with frowning brows when a great dragon with jaws dreadful wide souzd on my bench and swallowed all my pride then rage tonguetyd him gerot laughing loud said dreams were fumes from illconcocted food cooks with ill sauce could every night bestow on childish fancies such a puppetshow the sour old man could never with mirth agree but now abhorred his illtimed raillery forbad him speaking and from bed he flings gerot to calm him his rich habit brings which very little could his mind sustain for if his desk be hid all those were vain but yet their offered grace he will not slight he rushed into his gown and surplice white but above all he will not leave behind his spacious scarlet hood with tabby lined his haughty heart would break if he should lack that proof of learning to adorn his back with his best bonnet then he graced his brow sole mark of learning his white head could show his purple gloves he never failed to wear when he would honor much himself and prayer and marching now in battle to engage omitted no illustrious equipage then much beyond the weakness of his years pushed on and earliest in the choir appears but oh what spite and fury fired his blood when on his bench he saw the pulpit stood  oh gerot see said he the dragon see which broke my sleep and now will swallow me oh faithful dream thou too much truth have shown the dean is an ingenious tyrant grown by this machine does wittily contrive to send me to infernal shades alive nothing but god will ever see me here dark shadows will expunge my character ere such a horrible affront i will bear i will quit my office and the church forswear i will give my vain superfluous chantings over and tire the ears of god and man no more i will never toil that deans may glory win nor see that choir where i shall never be seen it is time enough to go to shades when dead i will now have light then his old arms he spread with fury strong and shook the wondrous frame when the organist and the clockmender came his faithful friends the vision struck them wan with trembling hands they held the old venturous man said they the works too weighty for us all by a full chapter let the monster fall in open day twill your great party show strengthen yourself and terrify the foe  right said the chanter go by noise or force the sleeping canons from their beds divorce the champions trembled when beyond their thought their counsel on themselves such danger brought  oh moderate your anger sir said they awaken rich fat canons before day men doubly buried both in flesh and down the attempt is rare the deed was never known starved monks a larum in their bosoms keep hunger a watchful enemy to sleep their thinworn wheels are soon in motion set but who can stir a canon mird in fat  deceitful cowards the old testy man replied you fain your terror of the dean would hide a hundred times i have seen you crouching stand with servile necks beneath his blessing hand the work good gerot shall by us be done our friends for once shall shame the loitering sun cunning old gerot knew the canons well spared his worn lungs rung the great masterbell which like the heavy dean but served for state and almost broke the church with needless weight the unchristned bell with sacrilegious roar from his strong camp the god of slumbers tore broke open all the holy canons eyes and made the devil of noise and tumult rise some believed thunder broke into the room others half feared it was the day of doom some priests less scared thought twas a dying knell some keenly hungry hoped twas pancakebell the sound with different sense filled every head like a dark text wondrous confusion bred so when to batter down a hundred walls the thundering lewis leaves the fair versailles to the young spring not valuing her delights and with spread banners all the world affrights danow to the euxine hastes his march to shun swift rhine in great commotion hurrieson brussels for bursting bombs looks every hour and sodomlike to feel a fiery shower rich skirted tagus creeps far under ground and hides much treasure there in vaults profound amphibious holland plunges deep in waves buries itself alive in watery graves so under blankets the priests duckd their heads sought a warm easy burial in their beds vexatious gerot knew their temper well with potent words he seconded the bell  ho breakfast waits the cunning verger cries at that angelic summons all arise in expectations of divine delights all look their clothes but none their appetites for they were ready ere their gowns were on headlong undrest to the great hall they run but stead of breakfast met a mournful tale told by the chanter with great fury pale who as a pestilence were in his breath struck mighty hunger with a sudden death everard a painful abstinence abhorred and bad the verger cover strait the board to that once savoury motion no man spoke at length learned allen the deep silence broke he only of all the priests our church obeyed had not his latin smothered and oerlaid others by wealth to dullness did advance and with the churchs coin brought ignorance but he had wandered from that practiced rule and was as learned as when he came from school his roman tongue there gave him mighty power there he was almost roman emperor none in his presence durst lay claim to parts for if they did his latin stabbed their hearts this tyrant yet was their defense and grace latin was such a terror to the place all other canons fled at first alarms of men approaching with such dreadful arms but noble allen scorned his head to hide and sturdy shocks of latin durst abide most learnedly equipped the accomplished man having first coughd his wise harangue began  some huguenots our cursed eternal foes planted this here to batter our repose in some church history they ve read i fear canons once preached and deans sat here to hear i range in volumes not to poach for art but to meet latin which delights my heart let us all study with what speed we may and show ourselves as deeply learned as they about this pulpit then let s quickly found all learned men in these great things profound the unlookdfor counsel all the assembly scared but made an earthquake in fat everard who shaking with astonishment and rage  how i said he turn schoolboy in my age do thou look pale and wither over a book i never so much as on the bible look i only study when our rents are due when leases fall and tenants should renew books i abhor they fill the church with schisms much mischief we have had from syllogisms if to religion you would converts make burn books and men say i and use a stake i will not vex my head my arm alone shall without latin throw this pulpit down i care not what heretic rascals say what troubles me i ll throw out of my way so let us prepare for the renowned design and when accomplished plentifully dine no sooner the word dinner passed their ears than up their stomachs rose down fell their fears but then the chanter none more bold and great exclaimed this tub too long has made us sweat do deans fear dust must they be cased like clocks would they like sentries awe us from a box in our churchpillar is some rottenness spread to hide himself he would be wainscoted my vengeance on this soppery i will throw and an hours fasting on the work bestow this done at once we ll break our fast and dine and two fair meals with both their portions join by this inspired the haughty champions go with an audacious zeal to charge the foe the walls vain aid to the poor engine lent the nails in vain their iron fingers bent the champions vanquished all resistance round the battered engine fell with many a wound antichrist never had such dreadful blows from mighty priests who were his bitter foes for as this pulpit was he s wondrous high a great
