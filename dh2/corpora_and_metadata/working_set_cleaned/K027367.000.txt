the mourning bride a tragedy  the mourning bride a tragedy as it is acted at the theater in lincolnsinnfields by his majestys servants  written by mr congreve   neque enim lex aequior ulla quam necis artifices art perire sua ovid de art am the third edition  london printed for jacob tonson and sold by r wellington g strahan and b lintott   0   to her royal highness the princess madam that high station which by your birth you hold above the people exacts from every one as a duty whatever honors they are capable of paying to your royal highness but that more exalted place to which your virtues have raised you above the rest of princes makes the tribute of our admiration and praise rather a choice more immediately preventing that duty  the public gratitude is ever founded on a public benefit and what is universally blessed is always an universal blessing thus from your self we derive the offerings which we bring and that incense which arises to your name only returns to its original and but naturally requires the parent of its being  from hence it is that this poem constituted on a moral whose end is to recommend and to encourage virtue of consequence has recourse to your royal highnesss patronage aspiring to cast it self beneath your feet and declining approbation till you shall condescend to own it and vouchsafe to shine upon it as on a creature of your influence  it is from the example of princes that virtue becomes a fashion in the people for even they who are averse to instruction will yet be fond of imitation  but there are multitudes who never can have means nor opportunities of so near an access as to partake of the benefit of such examples and to these tragedy which distinguishes it self from the vulgar poetry by the dignity of its characters may be of use and information for they who are at that distance from original greatness as to be deprived of the happiness of contemplating the perfections and real excellencies of your royal highness person in your court may yet behold some small sketches and imagings of the virtues of your mind abstracted and represented in the theater  thus poets are instructed and instruct not alone by precepts which persuade but also by examples which illustrate thus is delight interwoven with instruction when not only virtue is prescribed but also represented  but if we are delighted with the liveliness of a feigned representation of great and good persons and their actions how must we be charmed with beholding the persons themselves if one or two excelling qualities barely touched in the single action and small compass of a play can warm an audience with a concern and regard even for the seeming success and prosperity of the actor with what zeal must the hearts of all be filled for the continued and increasing happiness of those who are the true and living instances of elevated and persisting virtue even the vicious themselves must have a secret veneration for those peculiar graces and endowments which are daily so eminently conspicuous in your royal highness and though repining feel a pleasure which in spite of envy they perforce approve  if in this piece humbly offered to your royal highness there shall appear the resemblance of any one of those many excellencies which you so promiscuously possess to be drawn so as to merit your least approbation it has the end and accomplishment of its design and however imperfect it may be in the whole through the inexperience or incapacity of the author yet if there is so much as to convince your royal highness that a play may be with industry so disposed in spite of the licentious practice of the modern theater as to become sometimes an innocent and not unprofitable entertainment it will abundantly gratify the ambition and recompense the endeavors of  your royal highnesss most obedient and most humbly devoted servant william congreve  prologue spoken by mr betterton the time has been when plays were not so plenty and a less number new would well content ye new plays did then like almanacks appear and one was thought sufficient for a year though they are more like almanacks of late for in one year i think they are out of date nor were they without reason joined together for just as one prognosticates the weather how plentiful the crop or scarce the grain what peals of thunder and what showers of rain so the other can foretell by certain rules what crops of coxcombs or what floods of fools in such like prophecies were poets skilled which now they find in their own tribe fulfilled the dearth of wit they did so long presage is fallen on us and almost starves the stage were you not grieved as often as you saw poor actors thresh such empty sheafs of straw toiling and laboring at their lungs expense to start a jest or force a little sense hard fate for us still harder in the event our authors sin but we alone repent still they proceed and at our charge write worse twere some amends if they could reimburse but there is the devil though their cause is lost there is no recovering damages or cost good wits forgive this liberty we take since custom gives the losers leave to speak but if provoked your dreadful wrath remains take your revenge upon the coming scenes for that damned poets spared who damns a brother as one thief escapes that executes another thus far alone does to the wits relate but from the rest we hope a better fate to please and move has been our poets theme art may direct but nature is his aim and nature missed in vain he boasts his art for only nature can affect the heart then freely judge the scenes that shall ensue but as with freedom judge with candor too he would not lose through prejudice his cause nor would obtain precariously applause impartial censure he

bride act i scene i a room of state the curtain rising slowly to soft music discovers almeria in mourning leonora waiting in mourning after the music almeria rises from her chair and comes forward alm music has charms to sooth a savage breast to soften rocks or bend a knotted oak i have read that things inanimate have moved and as with living souls have been informed by magic numbers and persuasive sound what then am i am i more senseless grown than trees or flint o force of constant woe it is not in harmony to calm my griefs anselmo sleeps and is at peace last night the silent tomb received the good old king he and his sorrows now are safely lodged within its cold but hospitable bosom why am not i at peace  leon for heavens sake dear madam moderate your griefs there is no cause   alm peace  no cause yes there is eternal cause and misery eternal will succeed thou can not tell  thou have indeed no cause  leo believe me madam i lament anselmo and always did compassionate his fortune have often wept to see how cruelly your father kept in chains his fellowking and often at night when all have been retired have stolen from bed and to his prison crept where while his jailer slept i through the grate have softly whispered and inquired his health sent in my sighs and prayers for his deliverance for sighs and prayers were all that i could offer  alm indeed thou have a soft and gentle nature that thus could melt to see a strangers wrongs o leonora had thou known anselmo how would thy heart have bled to see his sufferings thou had no cause but general compassion  leo my love of you my royal mistress gave me cause my love of you begot my grief for him for i had heard that when the chance of war had blessed anselmos arms with victory and the rich spoil of all the field and you the glory of the whole were made the prey of his success that then in spite of hate revenge and that hereditary feud entailed between valentias and granadas kings he did endear himself to your affection by all the worthy and indulgent ways his most industrious goodness could invent proposing by a match between alphonso his son the brave valentia prince and you to end the long dissension and unite the jarring crowns  alm o alphonso alphonso thou art too at peace father and son are now no more  then why am i o when shall i have rest why do i live to say you are no more why are all these things thus  is there necessity i must be miserable is it of moment to the peace of heaven that i should be afflicted thus  if not why is it thus contrived why are all things laid by some unseen hand so as of consequence they must to me bring curses grief of heart the last distress of life and sure despair  leo alas you search too far and think too deeply  alm why was i carried to anselmos court or when there why was i used so tenderly why did he not use me like an enemy for so my father would have used his child o alphonso alphonso devouring seas have washed thee from my sight but there is no time shall raze thee from my memory no i will live to be thy monument the cruel ocean would deprive thee of a tomb but in my heart thou art interred there there thy dear resemblance is for ever fixed my love my lord my husband still though lost  leo husband o heavens  alm what have i said my grief has hurried me beyond all thought i would have kept that secret though i know thy love and faith to me deserve all confidence but it is the wretches comfort still to have some small reserve of near and inward woe some unsuspected hoard of darling grief which they unseen may wail and weep and mourn and gluttonlike alone devour  leo indeed i knew not this  alm o no thou know not half  thou know nothing   if thou did  if i should tell thee would thou pity me tell me i know thou would thou art compassionate  leo witness these tears   alm i thank thee  indeed i do  i thank thee that thou wilt pity thy sad mistress for it is the poor prerogative of greatness to be wretched and unpitied  but i did promise i would tell thee  what my griefs thou do already know em and when i said thou did know nothing it was because thou did not know alphonso for to have known my loss thou must have known his worth his truth and tenderness of love  leo the memory of that brave prince stands fair in all report  and i have heard imperfectly his loss but fearful to renew your troubles past i never did presume to ask the story  alm if for my swelling heart i can i will tell thee i was a welcome captive in valentia even on the day when manuel my father led on his conquering troops high as the gates of king anselmos palace which in rage and heat of war and dire revenge he fired whilst the good king to shun approaching flames started amidst his foes and made captivity his refuge would i had perished in those flames  but twas not so decreed alphonso who foresaw my fathers cruelty had born the queen and me on board a ship ready to sail and when this news was brought we put to sea but being betrayed by some who knew our flight we closely were pursued and almost taken when a sudden storm drove us and those that followed on the coast of africa there our vessel struck the shore and bulging against a rock was dashed in pieces but heaven spared me for yet more affliction conducting them who followed us to shun the shoal and save me floating on the waves while the good queen and my alphonso perished  leo alas were you then wedded to alphonso  alm that day that fatal day our hands were joined for when my lord beheld the ship pursuing and saw her rate so far exceeding ours he came to me and begged me by my love i would consent the priest might make us one that whether death or victory ensued i might be his beyond the power of future fate the queen too did assist his suit  i granted and in one day was wedded and a widow  leo indeed twas mournful   alm twas that for which i mourn and will for ever mourn nor will i change these black and dismal robes or ever dry these swoln and watery eyes or ever taste content or peace of heart while i have life or memory of my alphonso  leo look down good heaven with pity on her sorrows and grant that time may bring her some relief  alm o no time gives increase to my afflictions the circling hours that gather all the woes which are diffused through the revolving year come heavyladen with the oppressing weight to me with me successively they leave the sighs the tears the groans the restless cares and all the damps of grief that did retard their flight they shake their downy wings and scatter all the dire collected dews on my poor head then fly with joy and swiftness from me  leo hark the distant shouts proclaim your fathers triumph shouts at a distance o cease for heavens sake assuage a little this torrent of your grief for much i fear it will incense him thus to see you drowned in tears when joy appears in every other face  alm and joy he brings to every other heart but double double weight of woe to mine for with him garcia comes  garcia to whom i must be sacrificed and all the faith and vows i gave my de alphonso basely violated  no it shall never be for i will die first die ten thousand deaths  look down look down kneels alphonso hear the sacred vow i make leave for a moment to behold eternal bliss and bend thy glorious eyes to earth and me and thou anselmo if yet thou art arrived through all impediments of purging fire to that bright heaven where my alphonso reigns behold thou also and attend my vow if ever i do yield or give consent by any action word or thought to wed another lord may then just heaven shower down unheard of curses on me greater far if such there be in angry heavens vengeance than any i have yet endured  and now rising methinks my heart has some relief having discharged this debt incumbent on my love yet one thing more i would engage from thee  leo my heart my life and will are only yours  alm i thank thee it is but this anon when all are busied in the general joy that thou will privately with me steal forth and visit good anselmos tomb  leo alas i fear some fatal resolution  alm no on my life my faith i mean no violence i feel i am more at large since i have made this vow perhaps i would repeat it there more solemnly it is that or some such melancholy thought upon my word no more  leo i will attend you  enter alonzo alon the lord gonsalez comes to tell your highness of the kings approach  alm conduct him in exit alon that is his pretense i know his errand is to fill my ears with garcias valiant deeds and with his artful tongue to gild and magnify his sons exploits but i am armed with ice around my heart not to be warmed with words nor idle eloquence  enter gonsalez bowing very humbly gons be every day of your long life like this the sun bright conquest and your brighter eyes have all conspired to blaze promiscuous light and bless this day with most unequal luster your royal father my victorious lord laden with spoils and everliving laurel is entering now in martial pomp the palace five hundred mules precede his solemn march which groan beneath the weight of moorish wealth chariots of war adorned with glittering gems succeed and next a hundred neighing steeds white as the fleecy rain on alpine hills that bound and foam and champ the golden bit as they disdained the victory they grace prisoners of war in shining fetters follow and captains of the noblest blood of africa sweat by his chariot wheel and lick and grind with gnashing teeth the dust his triumphs raise the swarming populace spread every wall and cling as if with claws they did enforce their hold through clifted stones stretching and staring as if they were all of eyes and every limb would feed his faculty of admiration while you alone retire and shun this sight this sight which is indeed not seen though twice the multitude should gaze in absence of your eyes  alm my lord my eyes ungratefully behold the gilded trophics of exterior honors nor will my ears be charmed with sounding words or pompous phrase the pageantry of souls but that my father is returned in safety i bend to heaven with thanks and humble praise  gons excellent princess but it is a task unfit for my weak age with dying words to offer at your praise garcia my son your beautys lowest slave has better done in proving with his sword upon your foes the force and influence of your matchless charms  alm i doubt not of the worth of garcias deeds which had been brave though i had never been born  leo madam the king flourish alm my women i would meet him attendants to almeria enter in mourning symphony of warlike music enter the king attended by garcia and several officers files of prisoners in chains and guards who are ranged in order round the stage

 gons but tears of joy to see you thus has filled my eyes with more delight than they can hold  king by heaven thou love me and i am pleased thou do take it for thanks old man that i rejoice to see thee weep on this occasion  but some here are who seem to mourn at our success how is it almeria that you meet our eyes upon this solemn day in these sad weeds you and yours are all in opposition to my brightness like daughters of affliction  alm forgive me sir if i offend the year which i have vowed to pay to heaven in mourning and strict life for my deliverance from death and wreck of the tempestuoussea wants yet to be expired  king your zeal to heaven is great so is your debt yet something too is due to me who gave that life which heaven preserved a day bestowed in filial duty had attond and given a dispensation to your vow  no more twas weak and wilful  and a womans error yet  upon thought it doubly wounds my sight to see that sable worn upon the day succeeding that in which our deadliest foe hated anselmo was interred  by heaven it looks as thou did mourn for him just as thy senseless vow appeared to bear its date not from that hour wherein thou were preserved but that wherein the cursed alphonso perished ha what thou do not weep to think of that  gons have patience royal sir the princess weeps to have offended you if fate decreed one pointed hour should be alphonsos loss and her deliverance is she to blame  king i tell thee she is to blame not to have feasted when my first foe was laid in earth such enmity such detestation bears my blood to his my daughter should have revelld at his death she should have made these palace walis to shake and all this high and ample roof to ring with her rejoicings what to mourn and weep then then to weep and pray and grieve by heaven there is not a slave a shackled slave of mine but should have smiled that hour through all his care and shook his chains in transport and rude harmony  gons what she has done was in excess of goodness betrayed by too much piety to seem as if she had offended  king to seem is to commit at this conjuncture i wonot have the seeming of a sorrow seen to day  retire divest your self with speed of that offensive black on me be all the violation of your vow you stand excused that i command it  gar kneeling your pardon sir if i presume so far as to remind you of your gracious promise  king rise garcia  i forgot yet stay almeria  alm o my boding heart  what is your pleasure sir  king draw near and give your hand and garcia yours receive this lord as one whom i have found worthy to be your husband and my son  gar thus let me kneel to take  o not to take but to devote and yield my self for ever the slave and creature of my royal mistress  gons o let me prostrate pay my worthless thanks for this high honor  king no more my promise long since passed thy loyalty and garcias welltryd valor all oblige me this day we triumph but to morrows sun shall shine on garcias

request attend on zara  king he is your prisoner as you please dispose him  gar i would oblige him but he shuns my kindness and with a haughty mien and stern civility humbly declines all offers if he speak it is scarce above a word as he were born alone to do and did disdain to talk at least to talk where he must not command  king such sullenness and in a man so brave must have some other cause than his captivity did zara then request he might attend her  gar my lord she did  king that joined with his behavior begets a doubt i would have em watched perhaps her chains hang heavier on him than his own  flourish and enter zara and osmyn bound conducted by perez and a guard and attended by selim and several mutes and eunuchs in a train king what welcome and what honors beauteous zara a king and conqueror can give are yours a conqueror indeed where you are won who with such luster strike admiring eyes that had our pomp been with your presence graced the expecting crowd had been deceived and seen their monarch enter not triumphant but in triumph led your beautys slave  zara if i on any terms could condescend to like captivity or think those honors which conquerors in courtesy bestow of equal value with unborrowd rule and native right to arbitrary sway i might be pleased when i behold this train with usual homage wait but when i feel these bonds i look with loathing on my self and scorn vile slavery though doubly hid beneath mockpraises and dissembled state  king those bonds twas my command you should be free how durst you perez disobey me  perez great sir your order was she should not wait your triumph but at some distance follow thus attended  king it is false twas more i bad she should be free if not in words i bad it by my eyes her eyes did more than bid  free her and hers with speed  yet stay  my hands alone can make fit restitution here  thus i release you and by releasing you enslave my self  zara favors conferred though when unsought deserve acknowledgment from noble minds such thanks as one hating to be obliged  yet hating more ingratitude can pay i offer  king born to excel and to command as by transcendent beauty to attract all eyes so by preeminence of soul to rule all hearts garcia what is he who with contracted brow beholding osmyn as they unbind him and sullen port glooms downward with his eyes at once regardless of his chains or liberty  gar that sir is osmyn  king he answers well the character you gave him whence comes it valiant osmyn that a man so great in arms as thou art said to be so ill can brook captivity the common chance of war  osm because captivity has robbed me of a just revenge  king i understand not that  osm i would not have you  zara that gallant moor in battle lost a friend whom more than life he loved and the regret of not revenging on his foes that loss has caused this melancholy and despair  king she does excuse him it is as i suspected to gons gons that friend may be her self show no resentment of his arrogance yet she looks concerned  king i will have enquiry made his friend may be a prisoner his name  zara heli  king garcia be it your care to make that search it shall be mine to pay devotion here at this fair shrine to lay my laurels down and raise loves altar on the spoils of war conquest and triumph now are mine no more nor will i victory in camps adore for lingering there in long suspense she stands shifting the prize in unresolving hands unused to wait i broke through her delay fixed her by force and snatched the doubtful day but late i find that war is but her sport in love the

lord let me entreat you to forbear leave me alone to find and cure the cause i know his melancholy and such starts are usual to his temper it might raise him to act some violence upon himself so to be

been since discovered in roderigos house who fled with him which seem to intimate as if alphonso still alive were arming in valentia which wears indeed this color of a truth they who are fled have that way bent their course of the same nature diverse notes have been dispersed tamuze the people whereupon some ready of belief have raised this rumor that being saved upon the coast of africa he there disclosed himself to albucacim and by a secret compact made with him opened the way to this invasion while he himself returning to valentia in private undertook to raise this tumult  zara ha hearst thou that is osmyn then alphonso o heaven a thousand things occur to my remembrance now that make it plain o certain death for him as sure despair for me if it be known  if not what hope have i

courage suffers you to see while osmyn lives you are not safe  king his doom is passed if you revoke it not he dies  zara it is well by what i heard upon your entrance i find i can unfold what yet concerns you more one that did call himself alphonso was cast upon my coast as is reported and often had private conference with the king to what effect i knew not then but that alphonso privately departed just about the time our arms embarked for spain what i know more is that a tripple league of strictest friendship was professed between alphonso heli and the traitor osmyn  king public report is ratified in this  zara and osmyns death required of strong necessity  king give order strait that all the prisoners die we will our self behold the execution  zara forbear a moment somewhat more i

osmyn at the place of death  king is treason then so near us as our guards  zara most certain though my knowledge is not yet so ripe to point at the particular men  king what is to be done  zara that too i will advise i have remaining in my train some mutes a present once from the sultana queen in the grand signiors court these from their infancy are practiced in the trade of death and shall as there the custom is in private strangle osmyn  gons my lord the queen advises well  king what offering or what recompense remains in me that can be worthy of so great services to cast beneath your feet the crown you have saved though on the head that wears it were too little  zara of that hereafter but mean time it is fit you order none may have admittance to the prisoner but such messengers as i shall send  king who waits there  enter perez on your life take heed that only zaras mutes or such who bring her warrant have admittance to the moor  zara they and no other not the princess self  perez your majesty shall be obeyed  king retire ex perez gons that interdiction so particular pronounced with vehemence against the princess should have more meaning than appears barefaced the king is

much indebted to this fair one  gons i am a little slow of credit sir in the sincerity of womens actions methinks this ladys hatred to the moor disquiets her too much which makes it seem as if she would rather that she did not hate him i wish her mutes are meant to be employed as she pretends  i doubt it now  your guards corrupted how by whom who told her so in the evening osmyn was to die at midnight she begged the royal signet to release him in the morning he must die again ever noon her mutes alone must strangle him or he will escape this put together suits not well  king yet that there is truth in what she has discovered is manifest from every circumstance this tumult and the lords who fled with heli are confirmation  that alphonso lives agrees expressly too with her report  gons i grant it sir and doubt not but in rage of jealousy she has discovered what she now repents it may be i am deceived but why that needless caution of the princess what if she had seen osmyn though twere strange but if she had what was it to her unless she feared her stronger charms might cause the moors affection to revolt  king i thank thee friend there is reason in thy doubt and i am warned but think thou that my daughter saw this moor  gons if osmyn be as zara has related alphonsos friend it is not impossible but she might wish on his account to see him  king say thou by heaven thou have arouzd a thought that like a sudden earthquake shakes my frame confusion then my daughters an accomplice and plots in private with this hellish moor  gons that were too hard a thought  but see she

sands to whose rich cargo they may make pretense and fatten on the spoils of providence so critics throng to see a new play split and thrive and prosper on the wrecks of wit small hope our poet from these prospects draws and therefore to the fair commends his cause your tender hearts to mercy are inclined with whom he hopes this play will favor find which was an offering to the sex designed finis
