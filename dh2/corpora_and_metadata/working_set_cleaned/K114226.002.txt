liberal opinions upon animals man and providence  in which are introduced anecdotes of a gentleman  addressed to the right hon lady chth  from gay to grave from lively to severe pope by courtney melmoth  vol ii  london printed for g robinson and j bew in paternosterrow and sold by j walter charing cross  mdcclxxv  liberal opinions etc chap xxxii the ardour of your sentiments sir becomes your age and i am pleased with your compliment because i perceive it is the effervesence of a sincere heart  i was going to say that if  but we will proceed to our more familiar illustrations  imagine that when these children were five weeks old the mother of the poorest reduced to extreme necessity puts her infant in a basket and lays it at the door of a person equally celebrated for wealth and benevolence  the gentleman takes it into his house clothes feeds and educates it as his own  that very infant which with the parent would be the lout i have described would with its protector be as different a creature as could exist his pains passions pleasures and ideas totally reversed  imagine likewise that some gypsey steals or kidnaps as it is called the rich child from the cradle and strolls with it up and down the country it will have its education in the open air its lodging in a barn and its dirty diet under a hedge probably it will imbibe the craft and subtlety of the gypsey and limit its utmost ambition to trick the traveller out of sixpence cross the palm with silver and tell the events which have happened or are still to be brought forward by the line of life thus in every other instance with a few peculiar exceptions that have nothing to do with general rules habit and education form the mind and color the human character   but how does this influence what we call virtue and vice said i  virtue and vice rejoined the gentleman are as dependent upon external as internal circumstances they are properties not more hereditary than adventitious and artificial nor do they issue more from the heart than from habit  you astonish me i replied  you are now cried he at the period of human life when curiosity is often caught in surprises experience will teach you to hear what now seems strange without emotion i have said nothing but what will too soon be intelligible   pray go on sir  pray go on   chap xxxiii  there are doubtless  resumed the gentleman  some constitutions so adapted by nature to virtue that no troubles situations or temptations can subdue or extirpate their amiable propensities  but ninetynine times out of a hundred a character takes its bias and bearing from mere tuition and the line it is either led or thrown into in the first stage of the human journey if there are no innate ideas sir it follows that the mind of every newborn babe is equally pure  if there are those infantine seeds of the understanding and little embrios of intellect  they are easily turned into what channel the parent thinks proper  so that i cannot but think the father of a family one of the most aweful charges upon earth    our parents hand writes on our hearts the first faint characters which time retracing deepens into strength   after which nothing can efface them but death or heaven yet we behold said i many children unlike their parents both good and bad it is admitted said mr greaves yet you will at the same time observe where the notions of parents and children are dissimilar the dissimilitude arises rather from difference of ages or improper culture than any thing else in general children are not liker in features than habits and i do assure you family minds are as often transmitted as family faces there is a tractability in youth which receives like snow every impression  and it is almost as difficult to erase the impression of one as the other nothing but heaven can effect it  if a son is trained up early to decency of manners and has the example of dignity living and moving before his eyes unless his temper is particularly untoward he will turn out an elegant character  if he is trained up in different principles he will act accordingly  the hoyden and the prude amongst the other sex take not their tint of character one time in ten from nature but from a neglect early to give them a proper idea of deportment but yet said i very sedate women have romping runaway daughters and very prudent fathers have very perverse sons  i mean replied mr greaves to say no more than this that generally speaking men and women act and think as they are taught whilst they are only able to lisp out their meaning  that education will have some influence on the most abandoned and that upon the whole virtue and vice depend very essentially on our primary sentiments and examples which whether good or ill will externally attend us in some measure through all possible transitions from the time we leave our cradles to the time we shall be deposited in our coffins  if i have not wearied you we will now see how far habit influences our judgments in the great and important article of reputation  chap xxxiv i listen to you sir said i with joy and only lament that i am contributing to your fatigue at the time that i am receiving such a fund of entertainment    habit my young friend said the gentleman operates with equal energy upon man and beast i could easily produce evidences of the fact by casting an eye upon the very horses now engaged in the dutiful drudgery of dragging us along and upon the herds and flocks which are grazing or sporting beside us but we will confine ourselves to our own species which are certainly the most interesting objects of speculation i was about to observe that custom has much to do with our moral characters there are certain actions so naturally and palpably good or evil that neither sophistry nor slander nor address can either injure mend or mar them to question the light at noon day or the dark in the zenith of the night would argue a malady beyond madness so in like manner to dispute whether downright wickedness is wickedness and evident excellence is excellence would be a lunacy in ethics so absurd that the poetical frenzy of poor lee would be cool argument to it  on the other hand my good sir if you live and mix long with mankind you will find many of your fellow creatures pining away existence under the lashes  the bleeding lashes of reproach merely because it is the custom to call one thing right and another wrong without tracing either to the bottom it is a maxim that the vox populi is the vox dei  that as you know it is translated what every body says must be true i know nothing so deserving refutation as a collection of those old saws and proverbs which acquiring force from antiquity and estimation from rust  for there are virtuosos in letters as well as in coins  are at length considered as utterly incontestible now certain i am that upon an examination into those very maxims we put so much credit in some will turn out futile some disputable and many unfaithful  for minute scrutinies we have not time it will be sufficient to look into that i have just mentioned and there is none more implicitly believed what every body says must be true  i have myself seen many instances to disprove this but i shall beg your acceptance of one which is now uppermost in my memory  a young gentleman of my particular acquaintance has for some time been deserted by his old companions and branded as a man of unsteady principles whose heart i know to abound with all those sensibilities which have hurried him as it were into the vortex of liberality till he is become an object of liberality himself he has those glowing feelings and sentiments which do at once honor and service to humannature notwithstanding which like poor mr blewitt whose history was recited by the grocer embarrassments have beset him and the world sets him down an undone man the world gets hold of a prejudice and then it is called vox dei the vox populi is given as the sentiment of everybody and thus many reputations are mistaken and misrepresented which deserve a better fate there are various persons likewise now particularly reprobated for a few indelicate concessions to which necessity may in violence of their better judgments have constrained them to yield who had they possessed happier circumstances would have made a much more respectable figure than those which now mark them with insamy many an unfortunate female too at this time wandering up and down the streets  many an insulted and deserving character  but i am rambling too miscellaneously  i feel myself a little weary  heigho   here the gentleman stoped abruptly  his countenance became suddenly clouded  his lip quivered  his eye remained fixed and clasping his hands forcibly together he at length burst into tears  after he a little recovered himself  he caught me hold by the arm and exclaimed  oh sir  my daughter my daughter  my almeria  chap xxxv i am now composed my young friend  the idea of a domestic misfortune obtruded itself upon me and i could not help feeling the stroke of humanity  of nature and a father  heaven cried i  you distract me i was about to take notice replied mr greaves  of one cruelty in the vox populi which is certainly against every notion of the vox dei it is the custom sir to abandon the weakest part of our species for that ruin which the artifices of our sex have perpetrated nor can any future repentence remove the sense of their error or restore them to the bosoms of more fortunate women they set like stars to rise no more  i had a wife sir with whom i have mourned many years  though i buried her but six weeks ago  she died of a broken heart and there was i assure you  a woe in the family big enough to break it  about eleven years ago sir an only child was taken from me  i was robbed of her by a man whom i held the nearest to my heart  and for five years it has been my incessant business to recover my darling but in vain my wife fell into a deep and rapid consumption and i was obliged to reside with her in the country  she grew worse and weaker every hour  but two days before she resigned her last breath  we received by a special messenger a packet  how shall i speak it  from  from my beloved  misguided  repenting wanderer  the poor thing had the better to persuade thrown the pathetic parts of her story into poetry  but that which delighted me more  far more  than all the rest  and which would have more magic for a parents heart than the poetry of a milton  was an attested account from a man of reputation that my child was actually at last under the protection of that noble institution which offers an asylum to insulted penitence  in the first transport i could not conceal the news from my wife but she had only power to press the paper trembling to her bosom and feebly lifted up her eyes to heaven  the rest  you must spare me sir upon the tender subject  she is dead  she is in heaven   the poor gentleman covered his face in his hankerchief and i have no words to describe my own feelings   chap xxxvi  when mr greaves could again lift up his head  he told me that having trusted to the ground the remains of his wife he was now going to visit his longlost daughter who was in  he stopped  and i was unwilling to enlarge upon the subject though i desired most ardently to see the poetry he spoke of  but for the present we dropped the matter and a profound silence ensued till we again changed horses at last however mr greaves perceiving my anxiety and guessing the cause put his hand into his pocket and produced a small bundle of papers fastened by a piece of red tape  from these he took a manuscript of which he thus declared his intentions as he held it in his hand  here it is  here is that unhappy girl  my poor almerias petition  read it young gentleman  read it and pity the daughter  and the father  if it should particularly strike you take a copy and if you continue long in london perhaps you may see it in print  if you should not and you should chance to survive me as it is most probable you will  publish it  and at the same time publish with it this letter of gratitude  there are reasons why  i would not choose being but too much interested in the contents to appear in the business  take it therefore and give it to the world at your best leisure  there sir  it were improper to suppress it  perhaps it may fall into the hands of the young and dissipated  perhaps it may find its way into the closets of the chaste and beautiful  the libertine may snatch it up in the intervals of his gay career and the parent afflicted by the loss of his child may be induced to read it from affection and curiosity  in all or in any of these cases it will afford some salutary reflections and the heart the conscience and the understanding will point them out immediately  he put the paper into my hand  i reminded him of the pleasing prospect of seeing his restored daughter  he did not seem insensible of my wishes to dissipate his melancholy but said nothing  as i knew it must be some time before he could collect himself and perceiving he began to close his eyes as if he desired silence i left him to his reflecions which it would have been impertinent to interrupt after the hint he had given me and began to open my papers which melted me so many times into tears during the perusal that i was heartily glad the poor gentleman affected slumber  as i have now had the performance so long by me i shall set it down in my journal in this place where though it somewhat interferes with my further connection with mr greaves it properly belongs because i would not disjoint the subject from the sentiments which introduced it to my knowledge  so that if ever my history is found the history of this unhappy lady will be found with it and in so publishing an age they can fall into few hands which will not send them to the press  chap xxxvii the letter of gratitude directly follows and was i believe designed as a short dedication to the work it was written by the father  to the reverend          sir to whom should the penitent daughter address the sentiments of reformation but to him who has had the greatest share in promoting it  to whom should the father who hence derives the felicity of his last moments pay the tribute of gratitude but to that fountain from whence he traces his blessings to their source  the restored almeria sir attributes to the force of your arguments and to the tenderness of your admonitions much of that abhorrence for vice and dignity of amendment that now inspire her there are hundreds of daughters no doubt under the same obligation and hundreds of fathers whose prayers and tears repay you for it for this  i had almost said  heavenly eloquence may you long be distinguished and may you bestow thereby upon many other parents now mourning for their children the serenity and the hope which has been conferred upon  the father of almeria   chap xxxviii almeria or the penitent being a genuine epistle from an unfortunate daughter in  to her family in the country withdrawn from all temptations that entice the frauds of fashion and the snares of vice from all that can inspire unchaste delight to my dearbleeding family i write but oh my pen the tender task denies and all the daughter rushes to my eyes often as the paper to my hand i brought my hand still trembled at the shock of thought sighs interrupt the story of my woe my blushes burn me and my tears overflow but nature now insists upon her claim strikes the fine nerve and gives me up to shame no more the anxious wish can i restrain silent no longer can your child remain write write i must each hope each fear declare and try once more to win a fathers care scorn not ah scorn not then the mournful verse revive my blessing and recall my curse give to a daughters wrongs one parentsigh nor let a mother my last prayer deny yet where oh where shall i the tale begin and where conclude the narrative of sin how each dire circumstance of guilt disclose unload my breast and open all its woes how to an injured parent shall i tell the arts by which i strayed by which i fell no common language can the scenes express where every line should mark extreme distress mere human words unequal all we find to paint the feelings of a wounded mind it is not the scribblers vein the songsters art nor the wild genius of a vacant heart it is not the lines that musically flow to mark the poets well  imagined woe nor all the frolicks of the tuneful tribe can such a mighty grief as mine describe full often has scorpion fancy to my view imagd each anguish that a parent knew at midnights still and searching hour she came glard round my bed and chilled my soul with shame crowded each black idea in my sight and gloomd a chaos on the balmy night behold  she said  on the damp bed of earth behold the unhappy man who gave thee birth in dust he rolls his sorrowsilverdhair and on each muscle sits intense despair see how the passions vary in his face tear his old frame and testify disgrace retired from home in silence to complain to the pale moon the veteran tells his pain now sinks oppressed now sudden starts away abhors the night yet sickens at the day and see thou guilty daughter see and mourn the whelming grief that waits the fires return beneath some blackning yews sepulchral gloom where pensive sorrow seems to court the tomb where tenfold shades repel the light of day and ghostly footsteps seem to press the way bent to the ground by misery and by years there view thy bleeding mother bathed in tears her look disordered and her air all wild she beats the breast that fed a worthless child and oh she cries  oh had the fostering milk to poison turned some ague shivered or some fever burned had death befriended on the fatal morn in which these eyes beheld a daughter born or had the eternal sealed its eyes in night ere it the barrier knew twixt wrong and right then had these curses never assailed my head  why spring such torments from a lawful bed  now melted softened gentler she complains rage ebbs away the tide of love remains then how the affecting tears each other trace down the dear furrows of her matron face but still the anxious mother brings to light scenes of past joy and innocent delight calls to remembrance each infantine bliss the cradles rapture and the babys kiss each throbbing hope that caught the embrace sincere with every joy that rose in every tear the beauteous prospect brightning every day the fathers sondling and the mothers play yet soon she finds again the sad reverse till harrassd nature sinks beneath its curse again more fierce  more mad she rends her frame and loudly brands almeria with her shame here paused and shrunk the vision from my view but conscience colored as the shade withdrew pierced to the heart in agony i lay and all confusion rose with rising day but ah what hope could morning bring to me what but the mournful privilege to see to view the pleasures which i could not share and waste the day in solitude and care more clearly shone the sun on my disgrace and marked more plain the blushes on my face then all enraged i cursed the abandoned hour when honor yielded to the traitors power when rash i scorned the angel voice of truth in all the mad simplicity of youth when from a fathers arms forlorn i strayed and left a mothers tenderness unpaid while nature duty precept all combined to fix obedience on the plastic mind stung at the thought each vengeance i designed and wearied heaven to desecrate mankind from room to room distractedly i ran the scorn of woman and the dupe of man alcanor cursed alcanor first i sought and as i past a fatal dagger caught the smiling villain soon my fury found struck at his heart and triumphed in the wound a rained woman  gives  i cried the stroke  he reeled he sell he fainted as i spoke but soon as human blood began to flow soon as it gushed obedient to the blow soon as the ruddy stream his cheek forsook and death sat struggling in the dying look love and the woman all at once returned i felt his anguish and my rashness mourned over his pale form i heaved the bursting sigh and watched the changes of his fading eye to stop the crimson tide my hair i tore kissed the deep gash and washed with tears the gore twas love  twas pity  call it what you will where the heart feels  we all are women still but low i bend my knees to pitying heaven for his recovery to my prayers was given he lived  to all the rest i was refignd and murder racked no more my tortured mind he lived  but soon with mean perfidious stealth forsook his prey and rioted in wealth yet think not now arrived the days of joy alcanor flattered only to destroy alike to blast my body and my mind he robbed me first then left me to mankind soon from his janus face the mask he tore the charm was broke and magic was no more the dreadful cheat awhile to hide he strove by poor pretenses of a partial love awhile disguised the surfeits of his heart and topd full well the warm admirers part till tired at last with laboring to conceal and feigning transports which he did not feel he turned at once so civilly polite whatever i said indifference made so right such coldness marked his manners and his mien my guilt  my ruin  at a glance was seen in vain i now assumed a chaster part in vain i struggled with a broken heart in vain i tried to purify my stain correct my life and rise reformed again pleased at the hope from savage man i flew and sought protection from each friend i knew each friend at my approach shrunk back with dread and bade me hide my pestilential head even for the meanest servitude i sought but nice suspicion at my figure caught my dress too flaunting or my air too free and deep reserve betokning mystery some frailty raised a doubt wherever i came and every question flushed my cheeks with shame conscious of guilt overshadowd by pretense twas hard to act the farce of innocence often as i begged the servants lowest place the treacherous color shifted in my face the fatal secret glowed in every look trembling i stood and stammering i spoke next came the views of home into my mind with each dear comfort i had left behind pardon and pleasure started to my thought while hope inspired forgiveness of my fault but soon too soon the sweet ideas sled and left me  begging at each door for bread yet poor indeed was this support to me ah had i starved on common charity far other woes and insults were in store my fame was lost and i could rise no more driven to the dreadful precipice of sin my brain swam round the gulf and hurled me in and now no pen could picture my distress twas more much more than simple wretchedness famine and guilt and conscience tore my heart and urged me to pursue the wantons part take then the truth and learn at once my shame such my hard fate  i welcomed all that came but oh no transport mingled in my stains no guilty pleasure ever soothed my pains no vicious hope indelicately gay nor warmer passions lulled my cares away the flattering compliment fatigued my ear while halfafraid i halfconceald a tear whole nights i passed insensible of bliss lost to the loathed embrace and odious kiss nor wine nor mirth the aching heart could fire nor could the sprightly music ought inspire alive to each reflection that oppressed the more i gained the more i was distressed even in the moment of unblest desire often would the wretch complain i wanted fire cold as a statue in his arms i lay wept though the night and blushed along the day  ah think what terrors ever could equal mine ah think and pity  for i once was thine the sweet society of friends was over for happier women dare invite no more and they at noon would meet me with alarms who stole at midnight to my venal arms my own companions no sweet comfort brought a shameful set incapable of thought their wanton passions never could touch my heart for all was looseness infamy and art no modest maxims suited to improve no soft sensations of a chaster love no generous prospects of a soul refined no worthy lessons of a noble mind ever touched their bosoms hardened to their state charmed at their arts and glorying in their fate some stroke of frolic was their constant theme the dreadful oath and blasphemy extreme the affected laugh the ruderetorted lie the indecent question and the bold reply even in their dress their business i could trace and broad was stamped the harlot on each face over every part the shameful trade we spy the step audacious and the rolling eye the smile insidious the look obscene the air enticing and the mincing mein with these alas a sacrifice i lived with these the wages of disgrace received but heaven at length its vengeance to complete drove me  distempered  to the public street for on a time when lightning fired the air and laid the sable breast of midnight bare when rain and wind assailed the unshelterd head that sought in vain  the blessing of a bed distressed  diseased  i crawled to every door and begged with tears a shelter for the poor my knees at length unable to sustain the force of hunger and the weight of rain fainting i fell then staggring rose again and wept and sighed and hoped and raved in vain then nor tell then overwhelmed by sore distress to my own hand i looked for full redress all things were apt  no flatterer to beguile twas night  twas dark  occasion seemed to smile  wherever i turned destruction rose to view and on reflection rising frenzy grew  from foolish love the knife concealed i wore that in my rage alcanors bosom tore thought pressed on thought  the unsettled senses flew as from my breast the fatal blade i drew still the stained point with crimson spots was died cried and this is well  it is blood for blood i then did i poise the instrument in air bent to the stroke and laid my bosom bare but ah my crimes that instant rose to view disarmed my purpose  my resolves oerthrew fear shook my hand i flung the weapon by unfit to live  i was not fit to die  ah wretchd woman she who strays for bread and sells the sacred pleasures of the bed condemned to shifts her reason must despise the scorn and pity of the good and wise condemned each call of passion to obey and in despite of nature to be gay to force a simper with a throbbing heart and call to aid the feeble helps of art obliged to suffer each impure caress the slave of fancy and the drudge of dress compelled to suit her temper to each taste scorned if too wanton hated if too chaste forced with the public whimsy to comply as veers the gale of modern luxury and often the afflicted creature must sustain strokes more severe yet tremble to complain the felon bawd a dreadful beast of prey rules over her subjects with despotic sway trucks for the human form with fatal power and bargains for her beauties by the hour but should some female in her dangerous train attend the altar of her shame with pain dispute at length the monsters base control and dare assert the scruples of her soul should she reluctant yield to the disgrace and show the signs of sorrow in her face the imperious abbess frowns her into vice and hates the sinner that grows overnice but hear yet hear your hapless daughters plea some little pity still is due to me if to have felt each agony of mind to bear the stings which conscience leaves behind if at each morn to shudder at the light dread the fair day and fear the coming night if like the thief of every eye afraid anxious i sought the blushconcealing shade if my sad bosom bursting with its weight bled and bewailed the hardships of my fate if to have known no joys and known all pains can aught avail to purge my former stains judge not your child  your suppliant  too severe but veil her frailties and bestow a tear  yet has almeria now a juster claim to seal her pardon and to close her shame each early tresspass nobler to remove and hope again the sanction of your love these holy mansions sacred to our woes to screen from scorn and hide us from our foes gradual the fallen woman

view their magdalens far chaster state then would they fondly close her fading eye bless her last breath and bid her peaceful die deep in her wards most venerable gloom late was a contrite sister from her room where long the blushing pious votress lay and sought a shelter from the shame of day in words halfsmotherd by the heaving sigh and voice that spoke despair  thus heard to cry  oh injured

charms oh my smote bosom whence these new alarms why spring the conscious drops into my eye why feels my heart the loveimpassiond sigh i dare not speak my promised happiness  yet edward could thou

how deeply i bewail how thick enshrowd me in the friendly veil how in the sacred solitude of night the care of heaven unceasing i invite breathe the warm wish and pour the fervent prayer now dare to hope and now expect despair could thou but see these changes of my grief surely thy pity would bestow relief my edwards virtue for i know his heart the balms of soft compassion would impart his breast would mitigate each stern decree and judgment yield to mercys milder plea but he is lost  fond wretch thy plaint give over  the dear the injured edward is no more or if he lives  he recollects thy shame scorns thy false vows and hates the unworthy flame  scarce had the pensive child of sorrow spoke when from a neighboring ward these accents broke it is she  it is she  the unfortunate is found my pulse beats quick  ah save me from the ground support me  help me  some assistance lend and my faint footsteps to the mourner bend she lives  she lives  the unhappy woman heard shook in each nerve and trembled at each word then swooning sunk at length upon the floor just as the afflicted stranger reached the door tottering he entered  caught the afflicted fair and raised her fluttering frame with tenderest care ah drooping lily rise to life and me and in this faded form thy edward see recall the luster in thy sparkling eye and bid for ever all thy sorrows fly long have i sought thee with a lovers zeal for thee alone i weep for thee i feel come then fair penitent forget each woe and every pleasure every transport know lost be the memory of thy former stain thy powerful prayers have washed thee white again buried be every anguish in this kiss wake then oh wake to virtue and to bliss  this said he pressed her in a soft embrace and the warm blood came flushing to her face now pale retired now ran a deeper red till cheered at last the sweet disorder fled a thousand tender questions now succeed they smile alternate and alternate bleed edward the chaplains long tried friend had been and hence arose the late propitious scene the sacred chaplain gave her to his care joined their kind fates and left them with a prayer chap xxxix before i proceed to set down other matters which fell out to chequer the adventures of my journey i cannot but observe that about two years after this period i met mr greaves in the park with a beautiful young creature under his arm and some time afterward i paid him a visit when he took me cordially by the hand and spoke to me as follows  my dear benignus where have you been buried since our last interview when i told you upon the road the occasion of that melancholy you detected through my efforts to conceal it you may remember i told you the motive of my journey upon my arrival in london and taking leave of you i called an hackney coach and drove directly to   in one word  i found my daughter  i felt the fainting penitent in my arms i received of her with an anxiety of joy  a tremor transport  oh benignus think for me  color the scene in the paint of youthful ardour  do justice to nature and imagine the delicacies which were never spoken you have seen my daughter  i never walk without her  and yet sir all this joy is dashed with an ingredient of sorrow the prudes untouched by the pathos of her penitence carry an air of ceremonious civility toward my child  the faded virgins who have never passed the fiery trial of temptation and a set of haughty matrons who have every other vice that disgraces the sex but that of which even nature predetermined they should never be guilty  treat my almeria with a coy and insulting reserve which goes too near her heart  an heart benignus generous and gentle as   here our discourse was interrupted by almeria herself who came to inform us the chocolate waited for us in the little saloon  grace was in all her steps in every action dignity and love her own epistle has so pathetically described the misery of her situation that she has not left room for any thing but pity  and yet who that considers such a creature has been as it were public property  that reflects how many are at this very moment chained down to a necessity equally sore many of them exposed to the want of that daily bread which even nightly impurity cannot supply  some of them beating through the streets by the barbarity of their betrayer  some hunted from one hiding place to another by the vigilance of the bailiff and all of them liable to contempt indignity and distemper  who i say that collects together these facts in his mind can be content with expressing barren compassion  who can forbear mixing relief with their tears and blessing the benevolence which first suggested and still continues their asylum   i have a little violated chronology by placing these transactions somewhat out of the order of time but as my history is written at a venture and may never visit the world i have been less cautious of observing critical rules however as i by no means design to make a book of digressions i shall now turn back to mr greaves who having sat with his eyes closed was when he opened them again much more fitted for society there are in truth certain moments when the music of the spheres would be discordant and when the condolence of our dearest acquaintances is an unwelcome interruption the human soul settles on her darling subject descends into herself and indulges in a luxury which be like extracts honey from the poison of calamity in one of these dispositions was mr greaves when he counterfeited repose he had now reconciled himself to the events he had contemplated for he was both a philosopher and a christian and with an affability peculiar to wellbred people begged my pardon for his reveries  chap xl we were now just stepping into our last stage but one and though the glories of the sun were over his departing beams were extremely agreeable mr greaves resumed a look of complacency and i being willing to keep as clear of the only subject that could perhaps again discompose it asked what sort of sensations were created in his mind by the story of mr blewitt though his history was related answered my companion in unpolished language it contains a folio of valuable facts but what a pity it is repeated i that such mercenary hearts as are lodged in the bosoms of the quaker and grocer should be in general more undisturbed through life than such as guided the feelings of the generous mr blewitt alas returned the gentleman you are yet an infant in terrestial events i dare swear you have an excellent heart and i am sure a good understanding yet you know but little of life  you profess to be traveling in pursuit of happiness and to dedicate your fortune to the service of society from hence i should conclude that you are flying from misery i related my adventures at the village he said if i could not find contentment in the shade it was doubtful whether i should meet her in the city but i fear continued he you expect from the world more than it can bestow you have perhaps placed the standard of felicity too high or your ideas of it are probably a little romantic  all i want upon earth replied i is comprised in three things friendship fidelity and gratitude  at your age resumed mr greaves smiling i entered the world animated by the same hopes and fascinated by the same notions my head  my hands and my heart were busy to derive a reflected blessing to myself by having promoted the blessedness of others to this end i continued in the world till that agonizing accident i have already related   at this crisis our chaise having just ascended a hill arrived at a very beautiful spot indeed it was an eminence that topt an extensive prospect and commanded the scene below which was composed of intermingled towers and spires woods and waters the verdure of fields and the variegation of valleys  i could not help ejaculating with some energy  is it not strange that a world like this so fitted for the reception and happiness of every being which inhabits it with such noble capacities of pleasure adapted to each should nevertheless be the seat of general torment and fretfulness disaster and distress  is it not strange that  that   the gentleman took hold of my wrist and fixing his eyes very seriously upon me spoke in a tone of unusual dignity  chap xli never allow amazement to hurry you into expressions unbecoming the character of a christian nor let either the insults or miseries you see or feel in the world make you charge heaven with the shadow of injustice take my word for it god is not nor ever was in fault  you see before you this moment enough to convince you that he has done every thing on his part  the sun warms us  the moon in his absence sets off the face of the earth in a sort of shady majesty  the rain descends to bless us  the ground feeds and entertains us and the ample intentions of universal nature are universally kind and beneficent man has perverted the system  the invention of coins the passion for negotiation and the love of barter have extended an ambition of the lowest kind amongst all classes of people the motive of commerce is no longer rational and business which was originally designed to promote health and circulate interchanged conveniences is now for the most part avariciously carried on to swell the coffers of the individual by impoverishing the species nay the mercenary spirit of the times extends to nations and climates divided by the remotest part of the ocean but if you please we will trace this evil ab origin the almighty created a world then peopled it and afterward found that it was good the management of it was put into the hands of man  not however to be too minute let us take notice that every thing was once indiscriminately enjoyed the earth was a common property and it was fertile without labor  the error of our first parents considerably changed the system and tillage and druggery became necessary to subdue a soil that no longer produced plenty spontaneously no absolute right however or proprietorship was yet ascertained and every one fixed on and cultivated the spot he chose this miscellaneous participation soon created disorder for as the bad passions were now let loose upon the world indolence seized upon the comforts which had been acquired by industry and hence sprang domestic contest and civil dispute and half mankind were at war those that obtained the victory held the conquered as his slave and from hence originated those distinctions which obtained by rapacity and kept by force were after sanctified by political institutions for upon this finding men were to be restrained from violence and invasion only by compulsion terror and authority the laws came in to the assistance of the stronger party the difference betwixt meum and tuum was soon understood and every individual maintained himself upon that which was now secured to him by certain compacts to violate which was henceforth to be considered as a punishable crime by this time an idea of property became sacred and general and by these means the civilized part of the earth was said to belong not as formerly to all alike but to a third part of its inhabitants subordination therefore of necessity took place the pride of power gained ground every day and one human creature usurped dominion over another because the distinction was now known betwixt master and servant from master and servant rose notions of great privileges and poverty dropped submissive at the knee of riches pastorals and arcadia were no more instead of every man dressing the glebe and turning up the soil in common such as had now dominion over the acres insisted upon having the essential drudgery they required performed by those whose fathers might probably possess the spot upon which they were to toil   chap xlii  affairs once settled on these partial principles resisted every effort of revocation  for who that could eat his bread without sweating his brow would give up the advantages he had gained centuries are now behind us since things were thus regulated and every year has given force and venerableness to the establishment every man has given up the point and makes the most of his situation the clown rises early to the task of cultivation and the master looks indolently on and receives the profit luxury was introduced under these auspices  the beverage of the field  the sallad of the brook and the water of the spring  with the homely apparel that decently veiled and warmed the body were rejected and voluptuousness turned simplicity blushing away the moment in which man became possessed of more than was necessary to the wholesome purposes of life the moment in which his industry became nerveless and his love of labor to slacken pride soon taught leisure to misuse abundance and the passions to wanton with authority  hence some revelled in the riots of dissipation others found a pleasure in accumulation and some better spirits had a bliss in distribution at length through the natural chain of consequences we are arrived at the crisis we are polished populated and resined in the extreme distinctions are so minute property so tenacious splendour so superior and trade so jealous that no distresses you observe should surprise you money has acquired a universal ascendency property has subdued all things under her feet and luxury sickens in despair because novelty is wanting to give an edge to the blunted appetites had the use of a metalcurrency been restricted by any reasonable rule of moderation it might have settled the system upon a noble principle for it is equally convenient to the great purposes of benevolence and business but the lucky and fortunate have run into two extremes so egregiously absurd that the one opens upon us a fountain of poisoned pleasures and the other a source of sordid maxims the passion for wasting on the one hand and of hoarding on the other have not only involved the world in confusion and thrown the passions into an uproar but have actually left almost one half of the human species naked and starved to cloth and accommodate the other  chap xliii you have discovered to me mr greaves said i a train of observations of which i had no idea  but you are preparing to speak  and i would not interrupt you for the universe   the observations i have made continued mr greaves have been no doubt made and much more sagaciously by many others for contemplation philosophy and science have now gone very far our discoveries in letters and in lands may perhaps have been pretty equal there may be yet unknown tracks in speculation the intellect may still abound with new reserves of wisdom there is still it is presumed a terra incognita there may be still an undug mine of knowledge  to explore this must be the labor of some literary columbus  i pretend not to such skill and indeed can only assure you that i offer you frankly on this subject the unadorned facts which i have collected from early readings and practical observations  you run your eye hastily over the world and then complain that it abounds with misery after what has been said should you not be surprised to find a great deal of happiness and yet distributed up and down the various parts of it there really is a very considerable share that the infelicity grows out of all proportion still more considerable cannot easily be determined  for though the fate of thousands can only be made supportable by the cheerful expectation of a better and though the human heart is in general blinded by temporal prejudices yet coarse as the mass of gratifications are that endear life to the multitude they are nevertheless gratifications and receive attachment from custom the joys of more delicate minds are indeed less extended and lie in a small compass being confined to the little circle of the few whose feelings are softened by nature and refined by art but were the agonies of existence still greater and acuter than they are the deity is not the author of it  he made the world  survey it sir even through the shadings of the evening and tell me if it is not worthy of a divine artificer he made man to inhabit it  has he not bestowed amiable and ample faculties upon him  fitted him equally to enjoy society and solitude  given him a power to derive a pleasure from the freshness of the gale or from the convivial glass  has not he bestowed upon him eyes to see missortune an heart to feel it and arms to remove it has he not implanted in the mind a sympathy between the sexes so attractive that by a kind of magnetic power we are irresistibly drawn to each other that life may be perpetuated while love is unpolluted has he not given us early ideas of more disinterested attachments and inspired us with dispositions to philanthropy and friendship has he not seated in the bosom a monitor to compliment us for every thing that is becoming and accommodated the taste with endless variety  is not the ear enchanted by the harmonies of nature  and the smell gratified with perfume and to crown the whole has he not placed certain intimations in the soul which assure it that however agreeable the deity may have rendered the present slate it is but a passage and upon the easy terms of our acting properly to him and each other will lead us gently along till it terminates in eternity  chap xliv  this my young friend is a saint sketch of the works and intentions of the deity  that those works and intentions are abused can never be imputed to their allkind author but to man  if the beauties and benefits of nature are perverted if the faculties of the mind and body are obstinately bent to actions evidently contradictory to the purposes for which they were given if love and friendship are overborne by their opposite passions and if  as has been before hinted interest carries away the palm from earth and heaven  who but man is chargeable with the consequences of this general inversion of blessings   the fact is indisputable sir said i  i tremble and i adore but as mr blewitt seemed always to perform the purposes for which he was born a man how is it that he and others like him should not pass smoothly through the sea of life because said the gentleman  to carry on the metaphor  when the storm is violent and the hurricane extreme it is certain the good and bad sailors will be wrecked alike is not that strange said i  shall gravitation stop as you go by replied mr greaves  no sir the chain of causes and consequences is irrefragable  that innocence should suffer in a world of guilt is morally inevitable but depend upon it the suffering will not be ultimately in vain  as to mr blewitt i compassionate and admire him but he is one of those characters whose amiable weaknesses expose him to almost certain poverty the poor man was kind to a fault  the world would call him a goodnatured fool  indeed he was wrong sir to indulge the tenderness of his feeling in the extreme though this cannot be owned without its implying at the same time a very cutting satire against the depravity of human nature  a depravity i have all along taken notice of as the source of so much disaster and calamity   mr blewitt did not reflect that  as money is the property by which every passion is gratified man will naturally idolize it as the golden calf and that to adopt a few saving maxims in relation to keeping a part of such property always at command would be favorable even to his generosity because it must needs be a deep misfortune to find the hand accustomed to liberallity compelled to contract when it can give no more  in a country where appearances of wealth can claim veneration where money acquires the chymic quality of turning every thing it approximates into gold and where that gold is moreover able to array insamy in the robe of integrity and lead the judgments of the wisest blindfold as it pleases  in such a country every apparent want of this property will be liable to neglect and ill treatment  and every degree of indigence will meet desertion for this plain reason because indigence has nothing either to procure or excite the idea of authority nor to observe those rules which externally distinguish the master from the servant you will say perhaps all this sort of distinction is ridiculous no doubt of it but as more than fifty out of sixty have adopted such distinctions  as they are actually the general standards of conduct  as they are also more than two thousand years old  it is in vain to dispute their propriety  one might as well dispute the customs of a country  tell the indian it is indecent to go naked or that a toledo dangling by the side of the spanish peasant must be extremely inconvenient economy therefore is now almost the only security from contempt and though it were too narrow a line to tread in the track of the grocer as no real joy could arise from such a rigid policy neither to lend sixpence nor borrow sixpence yet i and i think my heart not an unfeeling one  have always found it sound prudence to keep a friend in my pocket and on no terms to lie at the mercy and compassion of another   chap xlv  it was now night and we were in the middle of finchley common  the driver bid us secure part of our money if we had any great quantity about us for that he saw a fellow lurking by the side of the road at a little distance  in five seconds we were up with the man who was groaning piteously upon a grassy hillock mr greaves who knew the arts of his own species suspected this to be an imposition and opposed my desire to have him lifted into the chaise  but these ideas were presently removed for the stranger got up and coming to the window presented not a pistol but  a purse the chaise stopped   half an hour ago gentlemen  said the man  a horseman came by me and i was tempted to supply the wants of a large family to demand his money  he put into my hand this purse  i conjure you gentlemen if by any stroke of happy chance he should be any part of your company  take it and return it to him just as i received it  it is my first violation of the laws either of hospitality or my country  i might possibly return home undiscovered but i feel that i cannot bear it my conscience is victorious even over my necessities if you should not know the traveller i have plundered  it is still in your power to do my bleeding soul some service  upon your arrival in london advertise the circumstances of the robbery  take the property and redeliver it upon the first application  this i cannot do for myself without throwing myself into the arms of justice and the situation of a wife whom i dote on with the fate of my poor little ones forbid my desertion  so saying  he threw the purse into the chaise and was going to retire   there was something so very unusual in this new mode of attacking that it was some time before mr greaves could speak  for my own part i was in a state of mind betwixt trembling and crying  at length mr greaves who could no longer doubt of the offenders sincerity invited him to accompany us in the chaise if he was going to town pledging himself at the same time as a man of honor not to betray him  the poor man after the deliberation of a minute  sighed and ascended  though the postilion muttered that we might be transported for harboring robbers and might repent it before we got over the common yet   our conversation on the way was such as might have touched the hardest heart  as soon as we were upon the pavement the gentleman got out but not before we had obtained the secret of his address  the driver seeing him escape  said  he had a great mind to cry stop thief for that he was sure twas hanging matter  and he was not certain whether he should not come to the gallows for it himself seeing as how he was aiding and abutting in this conjecture he was perfectly prophetic for upon my traveling the same road in my way to the village about six months after i understood that this very identical niceminded driver had actually mounted some little time before for being detected in confederating with a gang of highwaymen to whom he gave intelligence what company had made appointments to pass by his masters house in their return to town  the poor man insisted upon leaving the purse but we did our best to alleviate his miserable condition by an equal present of five guineas  i was going to give ten but mr greaves geatly plucked me by the button observing to me afterward that five at another opportunity would very likely double their utility  chap xlvi as soon as the man was gone  there said mr greaves is another reason why money should be cautiously parted with  what a noble soul must that gentleman possess and yet to what deplorable shifts is he reduced  he is a man of education  but it is a custom to shun decayed gentlemen or at best to assist them in a way that must pierce them to the quick  a beggar who has served a long apprenticeship to the business of whimpering and wailing  who lies down at the door in despite of denial and who is in short a master of his calling feels slightly the neglect and abuse of his fellow creature and if the footman hunts him from one haunt he hobbles on toward another but an unfortunate man of breeding  a poor creature whose education shines through his rags and dirt feels the acumen of every insult that is cast upon him  by the random sons of success  in its utmost bitterness and cannot help reflecting severely on the inhumanity of mankind  take care therefore my dear sir what you do  you are now i suppose for the first time in london  a place of various danger to all men but more especially to those of your complexion  pleasure and business seem to lie upon the surface  and at the first glance neither misery or imposture will be discovered  when you rise in the morning every object will be gay and curiosity will pay the debt to surrounding splendour but you will be soon convinced that the fronti nulle fides was never more proverbially applicable than to this great city proceed therefore with diidence and step with caution  your simplicity and kindness of heart have made me take an interest  almost paternal  in your welfare and i could rejoice to pass some time with you  but you already know the irresistible  pathetic cause which draws me to town  when that is over i shall be at your service  in the mean time  taking my hand with a soft pressure which brought the water into my eyes  once again let me conjure you to be circumspect beware that your bounty like fire does not burn itself out by its own force  husband the blaze and be sure some sparks remain to warm yourself  i give a great deal to a great many  but as i have happily a great deal yet to bestow i pass the muster of my friends whose severest censure is a prophecy that i shall not die rich but certain it is if i were to divest myself of every thing and give the last penny to a starving creature i should be the jest of men the tittletattle of women and the pity of mankind  mr greaves gave me his direction  steptd into an hackney coach and bade me farewell  some time after this i paid a visit to the highwayman who at my departure gave me the following manuscript which contains some reflections he made upon the transaction at finchley common  but before i introduce this into my legend i think proper to take notice that i had an opportunity to return the purse to the person from whom it was taken and that person forms no inconsiderable character in the remaining part of these memoirs  chap xlvii a fragment containing soliloquies of a highwayman ah family forlorn the sport of fortune famine and mankind compose thy griefs louisa  stop those tears cry not so pitcous  spare oh spare thy sire nor quite distract thy mother  hapless babes what shall i do  which ever way i turn scenes of incessant horror strike my eye bare barren walls gloom formidably round and not a ray of hope is left to cheer sorrowing and sick the partner of my sat lies on her bed of straw  beside her sad my children dear cling to her breast and weep or pressed by hunger hunt each nook for food and quite exhausted climb these knees  in vain how every asking eye appeals at once ah looks too eloquent  too plainly marked ye ask for bread  i have no bread to give the wants of nature frugal as she is the little calls and comforts which support from day to day the feeble life of man no more alas thy father can supply  to me the hand of heavenborn charity hard as the season gripes  the neighborhood busied or pleased oerlook a strangers woe scarce knows the tenant of thadjoining house what thin partitions shield him from the room where poverty has fixed her dread abode oh fatal force of illtimed delicacy which bade we still conceal the want extreme while yet the decent dress remained in store to visit my eugenius like myself now shame confusion memory unite to drive me from his door   ah cruel man too barbarous eugenius  this from thee have i not screend thee from a parents wrath shared in thy transports in thy sorrows shared were not our friendships in the cradle formed gained they not strength and firmness as we grew and do thou shift with fortunes veering gale do thou survey me with the critics eye and shun thy friend because  oh blush to truth oh stain to human sensibility because his tattered garments to the wind and every passenger more deep betray the extremity severe  then fare thee well quick let me seek my homely shed again fly from the wretch who triumphs over my rags on my louisas faithful bosom fall hug to my heart my famished fondlings round together suffer  and together die   what piles of wealth what loads of riches glitter through each street how thick the toys of fashion crowd the eye the lap of luxury can hold no more fortune so rapid rolls the partial shower that every passion sickens with excess and nauseates the banquet meant to charm  yet what are all these golden scenes to me these splendid modish superfluities what are these bright temptations to the poor sooner alas will pride new gild her coach than bid the warming faggot blaze around the hearth where chill necessity resides  but must louisa then  our tender babes  must they untimely sink into the grave must all be victims to a fate so fore the world will nothing give but barren frowns what then remains  there stands the wretched hut i dare not enter  heaven befriend them all what then remains  the night steals on apace the sick moon labors through the mixing clouds yes  that were well  o dire necessity  it must be so  despair do what thou will  i faint with fear with terror and fatigue  this forest gloom made gloomier by the deepning shades of night suits well the sad disorders of my soul the passing owl shrieks horrible her wail and conscience broods over her prophetic note light springs the hare upon the withered leaf the rabbit frolicks  and the guilty mind starts at the sound as at a giants tread  ah me  i hear the horse along the road  forgive me providence  forgive me man i tremble through the heart  the clattring hoof reechoes through the wood  the moon appears and lights me to my prey   stop traveller  behold a being born like thee to live and yet endowed with fortitude to die were his alone the pang of poverty but a dear wife now starving far from hence seven hapless hungry children at her side a frowning world and an ungrateful frien urge him to actions which his heart abhors assist us  save us  pity my despair oerlook my fault and view me as a man a fellowmortal sues to thee for bread invites thy charity  invites thy heart perhaps thou art an husband and a father think if thy babes like mine dejected lay and held their little hands to thee for food what would thou have me do were thou like me driven to distress like mine  oh then befriend make our sad cause your own  i ask no more nor will i force what bounty cannot spare let me not take assassinlike the boon which humbly bending at thy foot i beg never till this night   god speed thee on thy way may plenty ever fit within thy house if thou have children angels guard their steps health scatter roses round each little cheek and heaven at last reward thy soul with bliss he is gone  and left his purse within my hand thou muchdesird thou often sought in vain sought while the tears were swimming in my eye sought but not found  at length i hold thee fast swift let me fly upon the wings of love and bear the blessing to my fainting babes then gently take louisa in my arms and whisper to the mourner happier tidings  hark what noise was that twas the dull bittern booming over my head the raven follows her  the dusky air thickens each form upon the cheated fight ha something shot across the way methinks it is but the shadow of this stripling tree that throws its babyarms as blows the gale each object terrifies guilts anxious heart the robber trembles at   what have i said robber  well may i start  o heaven what have i done  shall then louisa live on spoil shall my poor children eat the bread of theft and have i at the peaceful hour of night like some maligant thing that prowls the wood have i  a very felon  sought relief by means like these and yet the traveller gave what i asked as if in charity perhaps his heart compassionately kind gave from an impulse it could not resist perhaps  twas fear  left murder might ensue alas i bore no arms  no blood i sought how knew he that  yet sure he might perceive the hardened villain spoke not in my air trembling and cold my hand was joined with his my knees shook hard my seeble accents failed the fathers  husbands  tears bedewed my face and virtue almost triumphed over despair yet strikes the thought severely on my heart the deed was foul  soft  let me pause awhile again the moonbeam breaks upon the eye  guilt bears me to the ground  i faint  i fall the means of food should still be honest means else were it well to starve    cetera desunt  at this place madam we must stop  after benignus reached london he met with a great variety of adventures all of which were strongly calculated to fix the assertions and hypothesis in the   th and   th chapters beyond any sort of doubt  those adventures are of the most interesting nature  some of them are pathetic  all are full of that agonizing knowledge which is usually purchased at the price of a broken heart  the manuscript in my possession is not large but it is in so small and close a character that it would yet furnish out at least six windowfeat fashionable volumes  as i have already got beyond the limits of a letter unless it had been written upon one of those leaves which travelers assure us will cover an acre of ground i must reserve the remainder of his legend till another opportunity  at present i can only spare my unfortunate hermit a few more pages for an extract or two from the record  the legend continued from the    th chapter i was now in the   th year of my age  as emaciated  unhappy  desolute a creature as ever reluctantly crawled on the bosom of the earth  the greatest part of my fortune was gone  the remainder was in bad hands  my reputation was ruined  my wife was dead  and my health was totally destroyed the friend whom i most loved and most trusted deceived me and yet it was the constant aim and center of all my views to derive happiness from goodness one solitary  0l bank note which was paid me in full for a debt of  00l was all i have left  prisons crosses aspersions and cruelties had driven me to the point of death  society became dreadful to me and indeed my consumption had taken such hold of me that i became dreadful to society i bought a sorry mule  twelve sacks of common biscuit  wrapped up my exhausted limbs in a horsemans coat  left the detested town and took the road to this forest  the ideas of a despairing mind are generally wild and violent mine were the direct contrary  i was not desperate but i was dying and i was unwilling to lay my bones where my body and my mind had been equally lacerated  at the edge of the wood i stopped  every part was almost inacessible and appeared the more so as the moonbeam threw a shade deeper on it  i knew not at what part to enter   here madam we must make a second gap in the history and continue it from  chap dcclxx being the last of the legend  i have now been an inhabitant of the forest only five weeks  i have got a few birds  my old dog so frequently mentioned in the latter part of my history  a cat that strolled one day into my cottage which is nothing better than a collection of sticks closely compacted sodded at the top and carpetted with sacks at the bottom  i am at the extremity  god has permitted me to finish my adventures wherein every thing that happened to me in the world or in the wood is accounted for  i find i am no longer able to hold the pen  farewell then that which has been my chief amusement  farewell writing  the hand of death is upon me  i will now hang my label on the door      i have been at the point of death three days  i am too weak to rise  my store box is empty  my poor brutes are falling famished around me  the pen which i laid by the head of my sack is held so faintly that i can scarcely mark the fate of my last moments  i make random efforts on the paper  and i die  a fatal example  that no sorrows  no disappointment  no barbarities  should at any time have power to drive a man totally from his species  the silver chord that tied the soul to the body is broken  i am            this history madam together with other adventures in the world with which at some future period that world may be made acquainted  have led me to a seclusion almost as retired from the bustle and intrigue of life as the unhappy author of the legend i intend my memoirs shall serve as the counterpart of his and both will indisputedly prove and validate the peculiar truth of these singular sentiments  that nine times out of ten a life of benevolence is a life of insult and pain  that an unwearied attention to the pleasure and comfort of others is generally repaid by ingratitude from the world  and that in a terrestrial sense  tracing the fact through all classes of life from the nobleman in his villa to the beggar in his shed  goodness is not often in this world rewarded by such returns from our fellow creatures as constitute those sensations which are included in our ideas of happiness  the result of the whole madam will be  first to be good would to all intents and purposes be to be happy had not man degenerated in the extreme and had not his worldly interest prevailed over the prospects and promises of futurity  secondly that the world is permitted to exist for the same reasons it was spared in years which are far behind when the omnipotent declared with his own facred voice that  if ten or even five just people could be found the city over which the almighty arm of vengeance was raised in suspension should be spared  thirdly that the perversion of money and the abuse of riches has contributed more to the corruption of human nature over every part of the habitable globe than any other thing since the invention of a commerce with it  fourthly that this world and more particularly the polished and voluptuous parts of it would be intolerable to a truly good mind and of all possible places of torment the most severe to men engaged in society but unengaged in its general aims were it not for two reasons which will not only be fully given in the promised histories  but may be briefly seen in the conclusive parts of these volumes  but before we pursue subjects of so grave a nature i shall beg your ladyships leave to offer some lighter amusement  i fear i have made you gloomy  let us then instantly return to our fancypieces  amongst these i must number a little piece of poetry wrote a year after leaving school i shall present your ladyship with this with all the marks of juvenility about it  poor benignus thought much of robbing an orchard his idea might be right but i must confess to you that for my part though i had a pretty early knowledge of meum and tuum i was not quite so scrupulous as to this particular benignus was likewise frequently insulted for this benevolence  now i avoided insult by the only way to escape it either in a school or in the world  for i was one of their own sort  did as they did and was as thoughtless and as trickful as the best or rather  the worst of them  the evils of life did not seize me so soon as they seized benignus  when your ladyship at a future day shall read my memoirs you will perceive too many reasons for an alteration in sentiment  ode to a schoolfellow hail to the harmless seats of happy youth to the smooth hours of genuine pleasure hail hail to transport  hail to truth when jocund health blew fresh in every gale and reckless pastime spread the frolic sail  backwards dear youth  a little cast thine eye let pregnant fancy paint each early scene and pencil fair our boyish days the lively hope that crowned the revel reign our thousand pleasures  thousand plays  if these thou have forgot  forbear to sigh but if thou callst to mind  bestow thy sympathy recall the hour that set us free from gerunds pronouns prosody recall the bliss that throbbd the heart when the glad summons bade us freely start twas heaven and holiday  and every little soul was in its may it is true we dealt in trifles then but trifles catch more mighty men cheap were the babytoys we chose blithe as the ruddy morn we rose and slept at night with  all a boys repose we knew not mans amusements wild our wishes were the wishes of a child what though for we are heirs of pain even from cradle sore we sigh and as the hill of life we gain more rugged is the road  more sharp the misery what though some vexing troubles chose our sports to discompose what though the lightning of the masters eye the threatening tone the brow austere bespoke disaster near and pedagogal tyranny though knotty points of learned lore distressed puzzled the head and throbbd the breast though the keen scourge  of dreadful size acutely whipped to make us wise the fleeting anguish never reached the heart but the faint cries were transient as the smart soon as the sense of pain was over suspended happiness returned the passing tear was seen no more the birchen scepter lost its power for mirth resumed the vacant hour and the gay stripling laughs at what he mourned the soldier thus in heat of wars sunk by the sudden blow to ground still covered over with various scars ever well the anguish leaves the wound soon as he gains the strand that girds his native land with triumph he recounts the hardy fray shows the deep mark where many a bare bone lay and smiles at all the bloodshed of the day can thou my friend recall these joys yet cease to wish we still were boys think on the deep complottings of our crew scheme upon scheme some arch exploir in view the merry moonshinepranks we played the little thefts at evenings fall the truant rambles we adventurous made when bold we scaled the orchard wall where as we reach the ruddy bough on which the fair temptations grow one plucks the fruit  and one receives below ah miniature exact of man natures fulllength is still on childhoods plan but brighter colors deck the youth rapture and health vivacity and truth soft too are then the shades of care and art wants time to paint the figures of despair your ladyship will now perhaps pay a visit with me to my animals  poor creatures they have been a long time neglected  to this end we must return to my cottage  there it is madam  very properly situated for a page of description  a fancypiece of itself  there is so much poetry to edge the borders of prose in this little subject that for the soul of me i cannot enter the doors without indulging the vanity of drawing  a picture of the premises did ever your ladyship behold the slope of any wood more beautiful than that which rises by soft gradations from the spot which my cottage occupies to the warm boundary of hills which form a vegetable screen for the valley  every bush is blooming with perfume and every tree is pendent with blossoms  the hand of nature has woven me a carpet so diversified in colors and so fantastically figured that the utmost pride of turkey droops even to dullness on the comparison  and hark madam  the note of pleasure affords for the ear as fair a banquet as the prospects of summer afford for the eye murmuring along the brake intercepted in its passage by the pebbles a small rill of water winds its way along the grove and at last is heard bubbling into the brook at the bottom  the river rolls majestically slow at a little distance and a stately swan the empress of the tide sails selfimportant on its bosom on the left hand is a flock at feed while some of the lambkins are slumbering in the sun and some frisking round the bushes  on the right the musicians of the season are warbling in the concert and the pauses of harmony are supplied by the sonorous splash of the neighboring watermill the green sod embellishes the seat round my hut  the woodbine comes nodding into my casement and vegetation goes smiling even to my door  such is the outside of my little place   and now i submit the matter to your ladyship  could i with any fort of justice to myself or it have passed into the sweet hut without pulling you one moment by the ruffle to show you how prettily i stood and that neither i nor my society left the town without being decently provided for in the country    upon reading over the description of my cottage a second time i cannot help thinking it would make a smart morsel for the magazines or for the next poetical nosegay mr dodsley shall think fit to gather from the fugitive flowers of this literary land  but as i was fearful of detaining your ladyship i have spoken of the matter hastily and yet i do not think a single thing wanting to complete  when turned into verse  a pastoral poem  nay i am farther satisfied that what with the title the advertisement  the preface the dedication the argument and the introduction it would be quite large enough for a halfcrown pamphlet  especially when your ladyship takes two points into consideration  first that four lines of prose will at any time make fourteen of poetry and secondly that the present taste of printing is so extremely white and delicate that a very few lines will go a great way insomuch that upon a pretty nice calculation it would be found that sixpennyworth of sense and twelve pennyworth of paper allowing for fashionable margins will when properly manufactured produce half a dozen pocket volumes at the moderate price of three shillings per volume we will now madam step into  the hut oh force of animal gratitude how the creatures crowd around us we have left them but a few hours and they are ready to devour us with their fondness  even the superanuated pointer bestirs himself on this occasion  poor fellow he is the son of an unhappy sire whose story goes i verily think as near to the heart as any that was ever recorded  and yet i am afraid i shall hurry your ladyship too quickly back into the region of gloomy sentiments should i relate it  but there is a pleasure even in the anxieties of sympathy and as the story is now fresh in my memory and my letter drawing to the end twere a pity to suppress it  passages of a true story  oh romeo  romeo what a creature were thou  how courteous  how sagacious  how well tempered   he was descended madam from a glorious line  the son of a noble stock  venerable from his pedigree  royal in his extraction and to crown his character he was the favorite companion of a dear friend of mine who is now  no more   in one of the sharpest days and yet one of the fairest that winter could produce the youthful flavian prepared with his gun and his romeo to take the diversions of the field  happiest of men  happiest of dogs  they were particularly lucky and it was a day of eminent success  this pointed the game  that brought it to the ground  the net was soon crowded with the spoil  but as flavian was returning   notwithstanding the elevation of your rank your ladyship must have had frequent occasion to deplore the capricious uncertainty of sublunary enjoyments  must have seen the eye that in the present moment sparkled with hope in the next rolling with despair  and tears usurp the features which an hour before were dimpled by joy  this is indeed so hackneyed and universal a fact that i should beg your pardon for digressing into a parenthesis about it  as flavian was returning to his house and romeo was ranging the skirts of acopse rather in the way of wantonness than industry  knowing perhaps that the business of the day was already done  just as the winding of the thicket meanderd into an elbow that jutted into the field  romeo broke short his step and stood fixed in an attitude which put flavian on his guard in the next instant an hare started from the bushes and ran trembling to the opposite hedgerow on the other side of which was a shaded lane that led to flavians villa  there is an enthusiasm which seizes the sportman at the sight of sudden game with that sort of inspiration was flavian now seized who levelling his gun to the mark with an aim too fatally erring deposited the charge into the bosom of       mighty god  i want fortitude to go on   flavian madam had  a wife  unhappily for him she was tempted by the brightness of the morning and the report of his fowling piece at no great distance to strole from her house and  as was sometimes her tender custom  intended to hasten his return not only to enjoy his society but to put an end to the depredations of the day  the sound of the gun had scarcely died upon the air when a sound of a different kind saluted the ear flavian dashed through the hedge and saw his maria extended along the pathway which was overhung by the bushes and her bosom was bathed in that blood which she now found had been shed by her husband in pursuing the game romeo first discovered his mistress and with his fourfeet upon her lap was mourning over her wounds the agony was so legible in his countenance that if he had the power of speech  it would have been impossible to describe it  the husband  ah madam in these cases as i have just remarked  the brute and the man are alike since both must deliver over to the dumb sensations of the heart a language neither science nor instinct can teach them to articulate  all that can be said or done is dull painting  he struck his breast  cast an eye of astonishment at heaven and fell speechless by her side  the poor woman saw his agony  madean effort to embrace him but sunk exhausted on his breast  a servant of flavians who had been on a message now appeared upon the road in the lane  romeo ran to him  leaped round his horse  looked up to the man  and led the way to the scene of death  the servant rode away on the spur to alarm the family at the mansion house  in the mean time the last endearments were faintly interchanged betwixt flavian and maria  to the latter articulation was soon denied  but she by some means got her husband in her arms and in that situation expired  the distress of flavian affected not even yet his tongue  the dear body mangled as it was could not be torn from him and both he and the unhappy lady were carried to that apartment from which they had parted a few hours before in the highest gaiety of wedded hearts and in the warmest ardours of youthful expectation and now comes on the business of poor romeo  flavian fell sick  romeo was the very sentinel of his door and the nurse of his chamber  a fever followed which at length touched flavian on the brain and in the violence of the delirium he struck his poor attendant romeo who so far from resenting the blow licked lovingly the hand that gave it  madness shifted into melancholy  romeo was still by the side of the bed fearful to step even on the carpet  after this  the fever returned and burning its way to the heart in a few days desied physic and united his ashes to those of his beloved maria  from the room in which he died no force or contrivance could seduce romeo till the moment in which he was put into the coffin and the people concerned in his funeral began to deem it necessary to destroy the dog which resisted all their measures but especially their carrying him away at length he suffered it  but followed them close and was perhaps the most sincere mourner  as soon as flavian was committed to the earth his faithful romeo took dominion of the spot and was the sentry of his grave  grief and hunger had exhausted every thing  but his attachment  yet he never was heard to whine  but after laying till nature could do no more he was at length found dead at the foot of the tomb  thus the master expired and the servant found it impossible to survive him    methinks i see your ladyship shed a tear to the complicated misfortunes of this family  i congratulate you upon it  fie upon the heart that is ashamed to feel  and withered be the cheek that in defiance of the impulses of nature is kept dry by the maxims of fashion  but neither the above story madam nor any other in the present volumes were introduced merely to excite sensibility  it finds a place amongst these pages as a suitable vehicle for some  moral opinions in the few anecdotes of benignus were briefly shown that nine times out of ten  to be good in this world was not the way  to be happy  that is  not to be happy if our behavior and its consequences were to take their rewards from the returns of our fellow creatures in general  the reason assigned for this is the only true reason that can be assigned  the degenerate state of maxims and manners   all the evils therefore which are of a malignant nature  all such as arise from the perversion of money  or turbulence of passions are totally to be imputed to human sources  but there are other evils and some extremely sore that fall out to make goodness no security for worldly happiness  these  i mean such as absolutely are placed beyond the reach or prevention of man are certainly the acts of the deity  we call them under the vague name of accidents  they light equally on man and beast and every thing that has an existence and for ought we can tell they may possibly affect vegetation and carry the distress beyond the scale that is animated as great proportions of that misery which cloggs the path of life therefore is caused by the bad propensities of men  so it must of necessity be admitted that the road which leads from this world to the next is made additionally wearisome and heavy by the permission of some power superior to theirs it is peculiar to the most rational animal as he is called to perceive this though he cannot adequately account for it  to account for it indeed has been the labor of the most shining understandings  divines  moralists  theologists  philosophers  metaphysicians and poets have exerted every nerve in every age upon the subject the most pions and industrious of these all concur in their sentiments and conclude with the same ideas  they say  that though to be good may not be rewarded in general with the gratitude of our fellow creatures and that virtuous characters are commonly insulted by the multitude who are creatures of ignorance and interest yet a man is sufficiently rewarded for his rectitude even in this world by the endearing society of men like himself  besides which  the comforts of conscience are more than a counterbalance for the severest sufferings  to which are added the cheerful prospects of futurity   that with respect to all those numberless disasters which fall out in despite of human sagacity  the answer always has been and still continues to be this  they are trials  etc  etc   there is indisputably a great deal of consolitary truth in both these conclusions some part of the argument however is liable to objection  zeal will very often run away with the powers of reflection the system of men of religious moderation is comprised in the short passages above more intemperate people who call themselves free thinkers have under that title assumed a privilege to argue very boldly on the other side of the question some have contended that if vice is natural to the heart of man it must be an effort as ridiculous as impossible to resist it  the shocking inference is that god is the sole origin of evil and that he certainly would not punish his creatures for yielding to a necessity in their nature  others madam of our own nation the very soil of freethinking say it would be an act of benevolence to withdraw evil from every part of the globe  another asserts that vices and miseries of all kinds are peculiar benefits and that to a trading nation especially they are the very mainspring in the political machine there have also been and still are a set of loose pens which skilled in the trick of sophistry exculpate every wickedness in man at the blasphemous risque of lodging the cause and fault of the whole upon the deity and a celebrated frenchman whose genius is the pride of that polite nation has written a book in the seventieth year of his age to prove that of all possible systems the system under which we are governed is the worst these deserve and meet the indignation of every honest man a much anmired countryman of our own madam has in a composition that contains the most poetical philosophy in our language advanced seriously an opposite sentiment and terminates the whole by declaring whatever is is right  my own opinions on this important subject are i dare say like those of your ladyship  i think every work of god vindicable but i do not think some of them reconcilable to reason by the beaten mode of defending them there are at this instant thousands of our amiable fellow creatures in the world bad as it is  struggling with the storms of fate without finding relief in the society of men like themselves for it will be easy to prove that even the tenderest and worthiest connexions of a man fly off in the hour of necessity nor will it be more difficult to show  if it could possibly need an instance beyond the reach of any ones experience  that poverty in the extreme is often accompanied with the loss of reputation those are yet babies in the world who suppose half the bad reports they hear of men are the consequences of their ill conduct for the fact is that there are a pretty equal number of wretches deserted by their friends because their unworthiness unsitted them for what is called virtuous society and of wretches deserted because their illluck in life drove them too often against the purses of their acquaintance  for i must once again repeat that the abuse of riches has made avarice the ruling vice  and there is sometimes the highest degree of avarice even in dissipation  self still settles at the bottom nor are even the comforts of conscience always sufficient to bear a man up against the insults of mankind for many of our species are so pelted by the tempests of life that the purest integrity and the sweetest reflections resulting from that integrity are obliged to give way to the misfortunes which crowd incessantly upon them sorrow treads fast upon sorrow calamity strikes upon calamity and accident comes stumbling so rapidly upon accident that the whole business of the soul is to shift for the necessities of the body or to try the force of its religion to accommodate itself with proper patience to bear its allotment without plunging into the errors of despair instances of this kind are extremely numerous men indeed who are plumped by prosperity and indolently loiter out an unserviceable existence in the easy chair of voluptuousness and women who are tied down to a peculiar set of amusements ideas and pursuits may see this matter in the light which their contracted teachers have taught them to see it but the sons and daughters of luck and luxury are the worst judges of the sons and daughters of misfortune the grand amulet  the only effectual remedy of sorrow remains behind and that is a universal one  ample enough for the cure of misery even though misery was universal  the prospects of futurity  when friends forsake us  foes oppress us  and conscience is cowed by constant adversity  those madam and those only prevent despair and point to felicity  with regard to the evils of accident nothing but those can reconcile them with the line of our most natural notions of eternal goodness and those do reconcile them to the sublimest idea that ever was conceived of it  but let us turn aside from argument and look upon life for exemplary  proof of this matter among other accidents that could only be reconciled by the prospects of futurity is the story and fate of flavian and his family  how agrees it  might we argue   but for those prospects with the beneficence of the creator to asslict so much morality and goodness without any apparent cause in short madam the human soul ebbs and flows like the ocean though not with the same regularity there is no purity nor any devotion but sometimes wavers for a moment believe me there are periods when the most apostolic faith staggers  aye and that upon principle for the better the mind the greater is its occasional agitation divines tells us it is sinful i insist it is unavoidable and i will in this case be so bold to enter a caveat against all the cassocks in the kingdom there is an intricacy in the events of the world which will on the first view constantly appear mysterious they frequently put the human intellect upon the puzzle we want not books or arguments to teach us ambiguities for every rational sense about us presses the whys and wherefores spontaneously and irresistibly upon us it is not madam the vanity of penetration it is merely the curiosity and inquiring propensity of nature  it was with a propriety peculiar to the classic genius of mr addison that he called these labyrinths of providence that so frequently cross the lines of life  a regular consusion let us examine that celebrated expression and it may perhaps lead us into a train of thought which may throw new light on our present subjects both with relation to man and brute the eye of god and possibly the eyes of his angels may see the regularity unintangled in the confusion but what proves this more than that finite can by no means measure with infinite to mans imperfect vision many events already hinted at in this letter and many more which might be brought into the catalogue of instances are not only repugnant to every moral natural or conscientious law were we to decide of them by the narrow line of human justice but are utterly opposite to our own ideas of common compassion still farther i beg leave to advance the matter much farther it is a fact attested by the tears and agonies of a mournful multitude that the horrid variety of miseries which attack the attention on all sides would tempt the soberest head and the devoutest heart in the world to suspect that the affairs of that world were totally eclipsed in confusion without a single ray of apparent regularity judging as was observed above and faintly guided through the dark only by the twilight glimmerings of natural reason and natural equity  to prove this there arise at once so many instances that choice is perplexed in variety let us quit the fireside madam for half an hour and turning our eyes on the active world walk leisurely along to survey the great scenes that are slecting before us if it is agreeable to your jadyship we will make  a moral and sentimental excursion and london shall be the boundary of our ramble that stupendous mass of building contains every thing for our purpose perhaps there never was more happiness and misery crowded together upon the same space of ground since the foundations of the world in the first place for your ladyship must suppose yourself endowed with a power of stepping into whatever places you think proper during this tour  we will pay a visit to that wretched looking house and though i am taking you into those sad retreats which are very uncustomary to people of fashion yet we will walk up the broken stairs and open the door of that chamber pray survey it with a critical eye the spectre famine has usurped the seat of plenty there are seven small children without any symptoms of the health and rosy hilarity which usually attends the most untroubled period of life  the pale young woman whose arm is round one of the youngest with one still smaller which she is dandling on her knce is their mother and that tottering phantom of a man whom age has rendered fecbler than the feeblest of the children is the father of that mother  i beg pardon i have overlooked a personage of no small consequence at the side of the broken lattice you behold one of the kings officers he has a paper in his hand a pen in his mouth and his eyes are running up and down the room in the most eager dispatch for once we will dispense with fashionable ceremonies and peep over his left shoulder this method has enabled us to read what he entitles  an inventory one table  split in the left lid and two of the joints wanting one cradle a small stool an oysterbarrel one gocart three chairs  two without backs the rush rotten one childs chair  the bottom almost gone four knives  one without a haft do forks  two of the tongs broken one fifth of an iron poker a boxiron one cinder sifter  terribly battered and one wooden fender  burnt in six places n b a small teachest  lock lost   the canisters bruised   december   th  to be carried off or sold the   th inst   sold heavens hush madam  i perceive you are prepared with many questions the answers are melancholy to every thing you can say see madam the good man has discharged his duty in which we must bear testimony he was conscientiously particular and is going out of the room we will follow his example  ah  madam the tears are swimming round your eye and your hand is in your pocket there then  god prosper you with it poor woman see if one of the infants is not quite taken with the flowers upon your ladyships gown another faintly plucks me by the skirt of my coat and is paying strong court to my buttons  the mother is upon her knees to you  she thinks and looks the gratitude she is unable to speak  let us hurry away before the scene becomes too interesting  even the smoky air of one of the most smoky streets of the suburbs is cheerful and salubrious to the oppression i felt in the chamber we have just left  a coach will carry us to a more agreeable part of the town inhabited by different sort of people  in this square we will stop for here is breathingroom hark how the roll of the chariots the report of the horses feet and the echo of the doors prepare us for the magnificence of fashion we are now in the very region of finery as sudden transitions have always a great effect  i will now take your ladyship into a very splendid apartment  these foldingdoors will admit us because we shall not look as if we had no doors of our own for in all cases of that sort there is a peculiar difficulty in getting on the other side of the knocker which for the most part is supported in the jaws of some monster that seems to say to every necessitous crawler or even to every shabby gentleman  come if you dare  approach and be devoured luckily for us madam there is always another monster appears the instant the door opens and as he constantly acts upon the liberal principles of cerberus we will give him a sufficient sop upon which he will become immediately so tame that he will make the hinges echo again even though we were come to dun his keeper the arts of opening a door and delivering a message are sciences that would very well fill a volume  i shall therefore certainly stand excused for having scribbled only a page upon the subject  we are now walking up the geometrical stairs  that door opening upon another door will lead us to another green door which will lead us to the apartment where the family are assembled at breakfast how beautifully and warmly the whole room is carpetted and cushioned  we perceive at the table three hearty children  a lady of an elegant figure and a gentleman in his nightgown and slippers bless me  how the servants bow  what a profusion of gilding and plate and see madam the youngest boy is actually tossing an handful of guineas up and down the floor by way of amusement i heartily wish the poor children we have just left had the trouble to pick them up for my young master if your ladyship will please to retire i will tell you something as you go along worth hearing of this family  the gentleman madam whom you saw in the morningdress is one of those human beings providence has for some wise end permitted to hold the happiness and comforts of a great many other human beings in his possession in the english language he is known by the name of a creditor the moral definition of which term is simply this  a man who having the good things of this life in great abundance distributes a small portion of those good things to such as are destitute a kind of benevolence that would reflect dignity upon the author were it not liable to a trifling circumstance which some will think a drawback upon it  for the benefactor commonly chooses to take in return a small slip of paper by virtue of which he can torment and have the person benefitted as it were on the hip at a moments warning and in fault of payment acquires full authority either to seize the body and deposit it in a jail or take possession of the goods and turn the body into the street in some parts of the future history of benignus will be delineated the whole and extensive science of mancatching wherein will be shown that the slave trade flourishes surprisingly in great britain and that the traffic of buying and selling the human species is daily gaining ground through every part of his majestys dominions and this is esteemed so curious and original a part of the manuscript that i expect a prodigious consideration for the copy  in the above work however a proper and nice distinction is made as to the nature and contraction of debts insomuch that it will infallbily prove a sure guide to creditor debtor and bailiff for those madam are the principal agents in this humane and excellent art i cannot quit this subject without presenting your ladyship with a slight specimen of the above sort of merchandise the business is frequently transacted thus one man in distress borrows in an humble tone with his hat under his arm and in all the confusion of want of another man in no distress whatever value fortyshillings as misfortune is apt to expect a sunshiny day even in the midst of hard weather disappointment trips up the heel of hope and the day of restitution runs by in which the said forty shillings remains like the handwriting on the wall against him from that moment the bargain is struck  the purchaser demands his property and as the transaction is sanctified by the laws of the land the carcass is at his discretion it is dragged from its friends and so cautiously prevented from taking cold in the open air that it is put very tenderly under lock and key and bar and bolt that it is in a perfect cage here a parcel of crows are suffered to peck at it which are a kind of guarantees to the purchaser of the body   and now we will go on with our story  the gay spark who is the subject of our present enquiry became a creditor to the povertystruck family whom we saw in the suburbs of the town by being landlord or possessor of a range of ruins among which is the uncomfortable hut we described the master of that hut who is at present out of the way is amongst the number of those against whose tranquillity the dark events of this life were perpetually pointed  the consequence of this which is pretty frequently the case was the desertion of acquaintances and the distance of friends and he was often accused of obliquity though in truth he seldom deviated into those crooked paths which justly excite agony and shame he was unable to answer the inclinations of his heart and was two years in arrear for the rent one morning the poor mans wife waited at the door of sophron for so will we call him and delivered an apology by great chance the porter thought fit to deliver it immedately and by a chance still greater the young woman was admitted into the prefence chamber where sophron was indulging the surfeiting luxuries of his situation distress had not at that time wholly destroyed the beauty which was naturally extraordinary in her  she caught the fancy of the present moment sophron proposed an immediate treaty and offered moreover a purse for the relief of her starving family  generous as this might be she flatly refused it as sophron was not much accustomed to the language of denial and thought besides his offer not only an honor but a liberality he ordered her hastily to depart she did so and in going home felt one of those sensations which for a moment relieves the sense of the worst condition by the triumph of the conscience she told the whole to her husband and in his rewarding embrace she felt those sensations revived but where misery is constantly shifting from one sorrow to another the pleasures of reflection can seldom have leisure to play  what was the result of this matter  withdraw a moment madam to that gloomylooking pile  the common receptacle  the promiscuous deposit of distress and infamy for a length of years  we will wind up the dreadful stairs  alas how does novelty give force to objects which custom has rendered unnoticed the grating of the bars  the jingle of the keys and the clank of the chains i see terrify your ladyship  pray stop awhile  in that dismal cell behold the consequence of a wifes unseasonable chastity and virtue  there lies the husband  sophron had once risqued as he called it the loan of ten guineas for that sum he was arrested  and for the rent his goods will shortly be sold  and here madam let me pay a compliment to the justice sagacity and christianity of our lawmakers  lawmakers of the most refined and polished nation under heaven  who have assigned to unfortunate men who owe and have the least money a residence of the greatest gloom hardship and discredit amongst wretches who have broken at midnight into our houses  assassins who have shed the blood of our species and robbers who commit hostilities upon the road encircled by such associates is sophron  his children are famishing at home  his wife is condemned to see the necessity every moment increase  his house has suffered a distress  their next migration must be into the street  the plain reason is this  the wife was virtuous  the husband unfortunate  while the oppressor revels in his plenitude though his fortunes were obtained by fraud and are dissipated in every kind of debauchery behold madam the wife is herself entering the cell  she has brought the poor creature a share of that refreshment your ladyships bounty has enabled her to procure  heavens what a shout is there  see they are bringing in a fresh prisoner  how the old inhabitants cluster round the new comer as they would say welcome to newgate brother  pray mr jailer what is his crime  murder  a man was executed yesterday sennight under a public gallows upon strong suspicion of committing that very murder which this prisoner has confessed there is a confusion in the innocence of some people and a cross concurrence of illlooking circumstances very like the blushing evidences of guilt such was the present case  appearances were strong against him human sagacity was baffled and the victim was given up to the laws  he had a large family his wife is in a fever  his son is burying reflection in the dreadful opiates of the bottle and his connexions are in deep and disgraceful mourning  yonder madam lies a miserable object  unnatural parents have driven her from home  she is too honest to steal  she is ashamed to beg and being from the pecularity of her fate under a necessity to borrow  she is at last provided for by the bounty of government that humanely allows the wretched just food enough to perpetuate the sense and lengthen out the period of calamity but now we will leave the sufferings of our own species and in our way home cast an eye upon the sufferings of  the animal world take notice how you team groan under the burden they are laboring in this severe weather for the service of man but observe their driver hark how the knotted whip sounds on their sides  the blood gushes at every stroke  the poor things labor in the extremity and when they have surmounted the difficuly the sanguinary master pats them on the neck not a little pleased with the triumphant vigor of his arm if it could possibly be supposed that brutes deserved a state of perpetual punishment a large city were surely their hell a few lapdogs spaniels and other favorites excepted  the general treatment of animals is savage beyond all comparison of barbarity  there stands a cruel wretch who has beaten out the eye of the forehorse for presuming to stir while the car is unloading he then curses himself for the exploit and concludes the matter by a second blow because the creature threw its eye in the way of the first and see madam you fellow in passing carelessly drives his carriage against another that is going a different road and in order to extricate the intertangled harnesses both drivers apply to the old remedy and instead of calmly setting things right put the animals on their spirit and every thing is at length torn in pieces a fresh beating now ensues and the poor devils are to suffer again for what at first could not on their part be avoided such are the general lives of horses and such the discipline practiced upon them almost every hour  it is an happiness peculiar to the softness of your sex and consistent with the delicate prosperity of the female nature and situation madam that their pursuits and pleasures entirely lay in such parts of the town as make shocking spectacles not very frequent if we compare them with the more busy parts of the city  there is  i cannot but perceive  a civilization of address an urbanity of demeanor amongst the very chairmen of st jamess which we shall in vain look for in the messengers of whitechapel and the porters of thames street the politesse of the court ever influences in some degree the places that surround it but in the city the spirit of humanity is too often trod under feet by the spirit of trade and the laws of trade have indeed so very little in general to do with the laws of benevolence that in the full and i might say the overflowing tide of commercial success a man of business seldom regards any life but such as is necessary to push the point of gain to the extremity   i must once more draw your ladyship out of the way to take a view of smithfield  there madam  it is high market and the distemper which some time since raged amongst the horned cattle even to the alarm of the nation was mercy and providence to the usage which the poor creatures sustain in this place  all that sticks stones and irongoads can effect is here effected against those inoffensive animals by which plenty is procured riches circulated and even life supported   here madam we have selected a few of those innumerable instances which rise up to alarm us that such have often happened cannot be denied and if we were to take a closer survey of the world with a view to collect a more accurate journal of calamity  if we were to bring into the black account the miseries both of the rich and poor  the thousand dreadful casualties which no innocence can help with the tens of thousands of fatal operations of passion which deform existence and agonize our hearts  if we were to consider likewise the plagues the disgusts the cares the contests  the depredations of war and the voluptuousness of peace  if we were to look into the prodigious mass of miscellaneous mischiefs branching out from avarice prodigality gaming swearing lawsuits robberies chagrines murders and every other profanation  or if we were to dive still further and mention the distressful situations occasioned by fire famine pestilence earthquakes inundations public tumults and domestic inquietude  observing at the same time that thousands of every race of beings are frequently pining away life inch by inch and are whole years in dying adding to this eventful catalogue the pangs of sickness the loss of limbs the deprivation of intellect the undeserved loss of character the disobedience of children and the cruelty of parents with the horrid havoc of those detestable appetites of the heart revenge and inordinate desire  what madam  but for the cheerful promises of an hereafter  what should we think  what should we say   that there is much happiness many blessings and many people who deserve them cannot be disputed  the world is in itself a paradise  but passions perverted accidents permitted  mischiefs perpetrated and money turned into the wrong channel have so destroyed its serenity that the soul distressed in the world is obliged to seek frequently for a retired corner and argue with itself  these reflections naturally lead us to the  conclusion it has been the constant design of the author of this letter to examine several facts relating to men  animals  and things in a new manner  with this ultimate view  to vindicate the ways of god not only to man but to every other living creature  the limits i proposed to allow myself are more than exceeded and the length of my letter swelled into volumes seems to demand an apology the utmost that i can venture more is to present your ladyship with a few inferences drawn from the whole of our ramble amongst the fields of unusual speculation  as the innocent man madam has often lost his life and disgraced his relations on suspicion of guilt  as the hardness of a creditor frequently tightens the cord of the law till it pinches the bowels of a numerous family  as there are actually parents in the world which not only desert their offspring but sear up that strong attachment which is generally the vital principle of nature  as modesty ingenuity and honesty are often harrassed by innumerable cares and perplexities to soothe which even the compliments of the conscience are not always adequate  and as  on the other hand  those to whom fortune has been fullerhanded frequently disturb the good order of society and use their adventitious acquisitions to promote oppression and to extend luxury  as those who address the deity in fervor of heart are often destitute of a comfortable proportion of food  wander naked and forlorn through life  and others that have food want appetite to eat it  while those who never mention the deity but to enforce an oath and give poignancy to blasphemy enjoy every temporal good  as even the unblemished state of childhood when power is wanting to perpetrate intentional guilt  as the newborn babe frequently struggles with various distress at a time when its weakness calls for peculiar supports  wanting which its future existence is sometimes wasted under the languors of an unsound constitution  as these with every other calamity i have recapitulated or advanced through this letter  and as many more than can be possibly suggested at a single view have and do actually light upon the human race  notwithstanding all the comforts and all the blessings in the world  some astonishing source of consolation is absolutely necessary to reconcile these facts to the mind  to decide upon the matter as was hinted before agreeable to our ideas of rectitude we should pronounce it without hesitation a monstrous system which confounds right and wrong innocence and error natural reason would condemn it as inconsistent  pagan philosophy would reject it as barbarous  pedantry would call it unfit  poetry would declare it unjust  common sense would pronounce it absurd  here then madam the two comfortable reasons i have promised to give as the only reconciling ones that can possibly make life supportable or the strange intricacies of it consistent deserve to be mentioned they come to us under the cherubic forms of faith and religion  just as we are sinking under our doubts they come forward to dispel them  they give strength to reason  force to philosophy and illumination to conscience  the wretched insulted heart listens to their arguments and finds them decisive  revelation herself steps into our relief  she confesses with the poet there is apparent confusion in the regularity of providence  that the cloudy mirror through which the human eye is directed in purblind speculation represents the path of virtue as thorny and crooked and the road to vice flowery and delightful  but that  were it possible for men to wind with their creator through all the infinitude of mazes that lead from first causes to ultimate effects  to view all the labyrinths which are absolutely necessary to connect continue and complete the system the whole matter would be inverted and the regularity appear without confusion  thus therefore madam all comes right at last  to be good is to be happy the confusion is regular and whatever is is right a future life only  in every instance i have mentioned and in many that i have omitted to mention can make the present life supportable or the present system equitable and upon these rational principles i would argue the essentiality of that futurity  but not so much from the power and wisdom as from the benevolence of the hand that has prepared us for it  nor is the attribute of justice less concerned in this provision  for  were the death of the body the death also of the soul  the devil himself as the system now stands might yet want a malignity in his nature to continue it and in that case the wisest way to put an end to a mans torments would be the shortest and suicide would obtain a sanction from common sense the very equity and tenderness of the supreme power is concerned in a distribution of future punishments and rewards  to those attributes therefore should every unhappy creature look up  from them should expect the hour in which that which is now crooked shall be made strait and every unevenness be smoothed  when the balances shall be poised by an omnipotent arm and justice at last prevail   having thus vindicated the ways of god to man i will now put an end to my letter and beg you will accept it at the hand of  your ladyships most humble and obedient servant            postscript as these sketches are designed for publication and are to stand at the tribunal of a society of literati who review and take cognizance of every thing that ventures into this world of composition i shall lay myself too negligently open to their censure if i leave ultimately the animal creation in the lurch  after having all along declared so much in its favor and this renders a postscript essentially necessary nor should i indeed stand excuseable to your ladyship if i omitted so material a part of the conclusions to be drawn from our survey of the subject  having vindicated  notwithstanding all the miseries of good men and the successes of bad men  the dispensations of god toward our own species let us now then madam in the same transient unsystematic manner vindicate the ways of god to a numerous race of beings no otherwise connected with our species than by the ties either of attachment or necessity   god vindicated to brute methinks madam the haughtyhearted man takes fire at this  what would the wicked wretch put the reptile and the rational upon an equality would he give to the almost undistinguishable atom  to the dog that laqueys my heel and to various monsters of the forest and the ocean the same prospects with man with the erect  the comprehensive  the superior god vindicated to brute  oh infamous blasphemous inconsistent  shall the ox that i kill for the ordinary supply of my appetite and the mule that i drive for my diversion be upon a level with their master  are they not all born to accommodate our convenience  are they not all put in subjection to our control and do we not treat them accordingly  i have no time to answer the cavils of selfsufficiency  we will proceed cooly madam   let us argue this point from the impulses of common sense  in our survey of the sufferings of brutes it appeared that with a great deal less cause they underwent at any rate as much hardship as men our inspection indeed into this matter like our inspection into the calamities of our own species was slight and cursory but were we to set apart a serious opportunity to examine the subject to the bottom we should find animal misery as extended and as exquisite as human i admit that they are destitute of reason and it must be owned that a moral sense of the injuries men suffer frequently give poignancy to the anguish the mind takes as it were an interest in the sufferings of the body thus a blow on the face is resented not because of the pain but because of the idea annexed by the soul to such an act  and with respect to other miseries and accidents the mind by sympathizing often doubles them this may be brought against me as an argument it is none madam even if the sensations of animal pain were merely corporeal they must be sufficiently terrible when we consider that they are molested by every innovation of torture  but i do not apprehend their sensations of anguish only bodily they have not reason but they have something that does the business of reason so well that man is very often put to the blush and is almost ashamed of the privilege that sets him at the top of the scale the fact is  brutes are as sensible of insults done to each other as men  these they resent indifferently  if they do not often resent the barbarities of men it is not i should conceive madam because they do not feel the indignity but because the benevolent creator has implanted in their natures a strong principle either of terror or obedience  an unlimited idea of human superiority or an unlimited idea of his tyranny be this as it may certain it is that the situation of animals in this life particularly such as are subdued to the domestic dominion of man and such commonly display the most amiable qualities is not such as can possibly make that life upon the whole desirable in a state of nature where they took peaceful possession of the woods it might be different in their present state of subordination to the imperious law of man nothing can exceed their miseries nor can any miseries be more diversified will it be urged that a great many of them are savage in their natures and cruel to each other  that they are at continual war  invade the repose property and pleasures of one another  that they actually subsist by murder and rapine  and that man is justified in his usage to them nor can they upon this account fairly claim protection or redress from providence this would prove a sorry argument do not men live upon each other  are not they at perpetual war  are not many of them savage in their natures  do not they disturb the peace and invade the property of their fellow creatures  is not every paltry trick tried and every dirty passion put in motion to perplex overreach and fret one another  is not this so general a fact that the eye sees  the ears ear and the heart feels it every hour is it not the tale of tradition  the burden of composition  the history of the day  and the evidence of every newspaper  spreads it not over the most distant climates  from the polished european who seizes his prey under a mask to the honest hotentot who roasts it upon the ground and sits openly down to his banquet  and yet where madam is the man who would from hence argue that for these reasons they must never look up for mercy but die without hope without expectation  without prospect rather let them mend the imperfections they have been so sharpsighted to detect if the cruel inclination subsisting in the bosoms of particular brutes strikes them with horror let it operate properly upon the human heart but let them reflect that the animal never kills but to gratify the calls of famine or in its own defense  but that the rational frequently murders for sport and inflicts pain from a principle of malignity  the state of animals after they leave the present world has been the subject of very distinguished talents and some have very warmly contended for their immortality amongst sacred writers moses and solomon have leaned much in their favor amongst moderns mr lock dr hildrop soame jennings and many others have taken up the cause neither have french spanish or roman authors been without conjectures on the subject so that i have a sufficient sanction to enter the list as the champion of so many millions of useful beautiful and innocent beings  look upon your favorite  how harmless  how affectionate  would it not hurt you to consider that in a very few years the poor creature must putrify in the dust and mixing with it soon become common earth without hope of resurrection for my part nothing could give a keener shock to my sensibility than the horrid idea of universal annihilation prevailing over the animal world  i protest madam i am almost ready to shed a tear to the very sentiment  must my dear tabythyetta  my demure grimalcena  my merry scugypugissa  you will pardon me madam for italianizing their names there is something so dreadfully dull and mechanic in the sound of an english appellation must all these with that great traveller tripsea sink into nothingness  into oblivion into dirt  oh horrible horrible most horrible but i see madam i am likely to swell my postscript to the unreasonable size of my letter and yet if you knew how extremely painful it is for a man warmed by his subject and entertained by his ideas  just as that subject begins to take possession of him  while a swarm of benevolent arguments are pouring their honey in upon him  and charm him with the prospect of carrying his point  if you knew the pangs that laying aside the pen in so delicate a moment costs a writer  you would certainly pity me  however i have said enough of this matter and every other just to show my intentions and i beg your ladyship  and i beg also my critics may consider the whole as a mere collection of etchings  the pencil roughly run over them  the outlines just marked  but that the boldness  the graces  the proportions  the retouchings and  the sinishings  must be the business of several sedate cautious and careful future opportunities   end of the second volume
