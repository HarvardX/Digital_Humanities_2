poems and plays  vol vi  poems and plays by william hayley esquire  in six volumes  vol vi  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxv  marcella a tragedy of three acts preface the following tragedy may perhaps attract the notice of the curious reader more by a literary anecdote relating to its subject than by any intrinsic merit as a dramatic composition  the story was recommended to young by the author of clarissa  the poet adopted it and wrote a single act but this shared the fate of his other unfinished manuscripts and according to the direction of his will was committed to the flames  these particulars with a concise sketch of the story as related by richardson were communicated to mr thornton by the poets very liberal and amiable son the neighbor and the muchesteemed relation of my dear departed friend who wished me to build a tragedy upon this foundation  some particular circumstances prevented me at that time from executing the desire of a person who from the integrity of his judgment and the uncommon warmth of his friendship had an undisputed title to influence my studies  other works had engaged me and this dramatic story lay for some years neglected but in looking over the letters of my stillvalued though lost correspondent it struck me with new force as the distress with which it abounds is of a private nature it appeared to me singularly calculated for my purpose of forming a drama for a domestic theater i have therefore with some considerable alterations in the principal incident raised from it a tragedy of three acts with what success it is now the privilege of my readers to pronounce  i will not attempt to influence their decision by any arguments in its behalf but let me be allowed to close this short preface with a little poetical acknowledgment to the two literary illustrious friends who first marked the story for the tragic muse and from whom it has accidentally descended to me  sonnet blessed authors with whose fame the world has rung immortal minds of philanthropic mold pathetic richardson sublimer young to you let me inscribe the leaves that hold a theme ye once consulted to unfold fairer its fortune had not deaths despite torn from the silenced bard this tale halftold o could i blend those beams whose separate light forms each a glory round your rival brows sublimity and pathos effluence bright of highest genius  but in vain such vows yet in the reach of emulations flight one eminence ye share  be that my end teach me to rank with you as virtues friend persons of the drama governor of barcelona mendoza lupercio hernandez lopez marcella servants etc scene the governors castle in barcelona marcella act i scene i the governors castle lupercio and marcella marcella let ardent friendship be the bond between us but o subdue this inauspicious love and chase it from thy breast  lupercio impossible think cruel monitor through what long years my heart has cherished an increasing passion till it is grown a portion of my being which i can never relinquish but with life  marcella i know that from our days of infancy thy vows have had the sanction of my father and from the period when he first became the governor of this fair city he has leaned toward thee with an anxious hope to call thee by the tender name of fon nor can the world reprove his generous wishes for barcelonas walls contain no youth of nobler blood or higher estimation  lupercio lovely encomiast sure the songs of seraphs and all the wondrous harmonies of heaven can never strike more sweetly on the soul than the frank praise of those angelic lips  marcella i should despise my own uncandid heart if it refused that tribute of applause which selfish pride and jealous envy pay to thy acknowledged merit  yes lupercio i own thy rank and thy accomplished youth might justly challenge a return of fondness from the most haughty of our flattered sex yet trust me and i speak the words of friendship twere wiser in thee even could my tongue pronounce the free compliance thou entreatest to turn thy partial eyes from cold marcella and for thy wise solicit me no more  lupercio mock not my senses with such admonition as reason must revolt from would thou say to the poor wretch who after many a step over africs burning sands half dead with drought holds in his parched and eager hand at last the liquid blessing that he long has pined for then would thou say that wisdom bids him dash the salutary treasure from his tongue and perish by the thirst that wastes his being such and more cruel is thy counsel now that would induce me to renounce thy charms even in these moments when thy fathers friendship had filled my soul with panting expectation to hear thy heavenly voice declare me happy  marcella i know my fathers hopes and by his worth i swear my heart often wishes for the power most fondly to fulfill them  lupercio ha what bar what secret bar from quickeyd love concealed has envious fortune raised to thwart our union you say that you regard me as your friend then honor me with friendships dearest claim unbounded confidence  unfold your heart  if to cut off the promise of my bliss if there is aught of unknown fondness there which fears a fathers eye confide in me and though against myself   marcella ingenuous youth your mind is noble but you little know marcellas heart above all low disguise proud of its truth nor patient of control  lupercio pardon the fond surmise of fearful love if thy soft breast is free from predilection what other bar  and yet there may be other nature perhaps has cursed me with defects offensive to thy sight some natural blemish of mind or feature which thy delicate sense tries to endure but cannot  marcella no by heaven except the noble stranger whom we saw at mass this morning and whose signal graces drew from us both observance of his person my eyes never gazed upon a comelier youth and reason tells me that i ought to love thee but my heart shrinks perversely from her voice often have i tried to bend my wayward spirit to crown thy constant vows and bless my father yet ever as my soul pursues that thought a secret tremor in my bosom bids me recoil from thy embraces whispering there that i was only born to be thy bane  lupercio thou thou my bane  thou art my lifes support as dear and as essential to my being as the blessed radiance of the sun to nature these are the airy fears of virgin softness most apt to harbor in the loveliest minds banish the visionary dread and give thy lightened heart to all the joys that court thee thy fathers prayers the vows of all our friends will shed propitious luster on our union hymen can never light his genial flame with happier auspices but were they dark and hideous as the sick mans feverish dreams were thou instead of noble garcias heiress the child of want and penury thy dower i still should pant as fondly for thy hand still in thy wondrous charms and lovely virtues think all the blessings of the earth comprised  marcella i know thee generous to a fond extreme it has subdued my waywardness of temper and spite of the reluctance that i feel to speak the important words i will be thine  lupercio blessed be that sound it is an angels voice freeing the spirit of a tortured martyr and opening to his view the heaven he sighed for  marcella and yet i fear   lupercio wound not enraptured love with vain distrust but name the blissful day when my fond heart   marcella i said i will be thine do not with cruel importunity now press me farther as i frankly told thee my soul i know not why is out of tune give me a little time to regulate the strange emotion of my mind and try to meet thee as i wish without these terrors  lupercio thou dear directress of my fate thy will shall ever sway the conduct of my life however it thwart me  yet i pray thee name some period on which hope may dwell to sooth the restless interval or kindly give me some pledge of thy dear promise  marcella take this ring of curious workmanship near tunis found and given my father by a noble moor the wife of asdrubal you know the figure plunging amidst the flames in which she perished wear this a month then claim me as your bride but if you value me preserve the jewel for if you lose this symbol of my faith your negligence may lead me to retract a promise so reluctantly pronounced  lupercio rest here thou radiant harbinger of bliss trust me my love and by thyself i swear that sooner shall my soul and body part than this dear gem be wrested from the finger where now it shines  o let me kiss the hand which has enriched me with a pledge so precious and let my lips thus ratify our compact while he is kissing her hand  enter the governor hernandez and a female attendant governor why this is well i like this pleasing show of mutual tenderness  she has relented and will be yours lupercio  lupercio yes my father i now may call you by that valued title my blissful doom has passed those lovely lips and she is now irrevocably mine  governor may every blessing my paternal prayers can ask of heaven descend upon ye both  thy free consent delights me and thou art my ages comfort  marcella when i cease to be so may life forsake me  twill have lost all value  governor my tender child i thank thee but thou leadst me wide of my present aim  with thee lupercio i must on business of the state awhile hold private converse i will release thee soon to the soft object of thy tendrer thoughts meantime my daughter as the hour of vespers now summons you pray for us and implore your guardian saint to make your nuptials happy your servants wait you  go  on your return you will find us in the castle and at leisure to dedicate the hours to love and joy  now mark me thou brave youth retires to the farther part of the stage with lupercio marcella hernandez you may rest at home  you know it is not your duty to attend on me as i have often informed you  it is strange my father suffers his old foolish steward to pester me with such officious service  hernandez dear lady do not frown  i have no joy but to gaze on you wheresoeer you go and follow like your shadow  would my shape were half so graceful  then i think your eyes could never view me with an angry glance  marcella hence saucy vassal  howsoeer my father use thy preposterous passion for his mirth it shall not thus insult me  hence i bid thee for ever shun my presence drops her glove  hernandez presenting the glove but kind chance is more my friend and makes me still your servant  marcella away fantastic insolence be gone i will not feed thy vanity by wearing aught which thy touch has sullied isabel take it and draw its fellow from my arm bring other gloves and follow me to vespers  exeunt marcella and her attendant hernandez insulting fair i yet may find a moment to triumph over thy scorn  the governor and lupercio advance from the end of the stage governor how now hernandez what has your mistress chid you from her presence i am indeed to blame to treat so long your fooleries with levity and laughter henceforth in this my young and noble friend you must respect a husbands dignity and dare to wound my daughters ear no more with sounds of amorous dotage  lupercio good hernandez you know the infirmity of spanish husbands and youre so studied in your ladys temper i may regard you as a dangerous rival  hernandez i stand corrected  aside curse his happy stars and curse his proud and thinlyveild contempt however deformity may make my figure the butt of his derision i have a spirit in which this fairlimbd youth may feel a rival more dangerous than his vanity believes exit governor that faithful servant is deprived of sense by the absurdest passion that ever triumphed over manly reason he was justly noted for the best qualities that grace his station intelligence and duty till my daughter advanced to womanhood but from that period even in proportion as her beauties ripened his faculties have seemed upon the wane i have too lightly sported with his frenzy which called for harsher discipline  lupercio o no i feel he is entitled to compassion marcella has those fascinating charms which may intoxicate the soberest mind till all its senses reel  i cannot wonder age and deformity forget their nature by living in her sight and only feel that she has beauty which inflames to madness  governor she may indeed with pride the father speaks it be numbered with the loveliest of her sex with joy brave youth but with an anxious joy i give her to thy guard  lupercio doubt not my love  governor trust me i do not but anxiety is the high tax which fond affection pays for all its pleasures and parental hearts as thou may prove hereafter pay it double besides my daughter lovely as she is has qualities that claim the nicest care  lupercio she has a generous pride which to her soul gives awful beauty and proclaims it free from all that poor and petty artifice which manly arrogance presumes to think inherent in her sex  governor you know lupercio she is the only child that ever nature enriched me with my tenderness disdaining the rigid customs of her sex and country has reared her with a freedom little known to spanish fairones for i wished to make her not the cagd vassal of parental power but truth and natures chaste and free disciple her early temper joined with my affection to fix me in this conduct for believe me her mind is like the element of fire treat it with gentle caution it will shine the radiant minister of joy and comfort but close confinement or a blind neglect may rouse its perilous energies to spread unthoughtof scenes of misery and terror  lupercio trust me i never will profane her virtue with abject jealousy and harsh constraint  governor on this nice topic in our hours of leisure well speak more largely when your just affection will give kind audience to a fathers counsel now other cares demand us  you forget the business i have entrusted to your guidance which calls for quick dispatch  lupercio forgive me sir may love that miser who locks up our thoughts nor lets them circulate as duty orders plead with me for your pardon  i am gone exit governor my blessing be thy guard  long have i wished to give my daughter to this virtuous youth but it is the doom of age in deeds of moment to feel the fit of warm desire succeeded by terrors aguish tremblings i begin to fear i have pressed too far her generous mind to what her heart recoils from for she weds to indulge a fathers wishes not her own it is true the tenderest motives have impelled me to urge this union eager to entrust her peace and honor to a kind protector but anxious love though probity may guide it often with a fond precipitancy foils its own dear purpose and with dizzy rashness leaps in the dreaded gulf it strives to shun  my child returned so soon and with a stranger what may this mean  enter marcella and mendoza mendoza it moves i see thy wonder thou honored veteran that thus uncheckd by ceremonys just observances a youth unknown intrudes upon thy presence and dares to make this lovely maid his herald  governor whoever thou art young signor i must own thy graceful semblance prompts me to believe thou have no common claim to courtesy  mendoza it is possible thou art not unacquainted with young mendozas name  governor who knows it not spain has no martial son whose generous veins hold richer blood and fame reports mendoza a youth whose opening virtues have reflected new honor on his noble ancestry our country with a fond impatient pride expects him from his travels but it is said that graced with a discerning monarchs friendship he purposes to pass another year at the imperial court  mendoza such as he is mendoza stands before thee and thou feast him an anxious humble suitor to thy bounty  governor to me my lord  mendoza to thee thou happy father to thee thou blessed possessor of a treasure that turns all other wealth to poverty often had i heard thy lovely daughter praised as beautys standard and no more allowing a competition with inferior fairones than the rich diamonds blaze admits compare with the dark amethyst or clouded opal it was my wish in passing through your city unknown to gaze upon this beauteous wonder as on a prodigy of natures work supreme in loveliness which to have seen gives to the eye that saw it a proud sparkle of exultation whensoeer it is named  governor this lavish praise my lord at once oerwhelms me with joy and pain and both in the extreme pray do not spoil by thus oerrating them the simple charms of an unpolished girl  mendoza your pardon  it is not in the power of language to state their excellence  at mass this morning my eager eyes first feasted on their sight i thought i never had seen till that blessed moment for on my ravished sense her beauty burst dazzling and dear as newimparted light to one whose visual organs from his childhood had pined in moping darkness  from that hour my heart cries loudly that the earth contains no prize worth my contention but her love  report informed me that her soft affections are yet unfixd though an accomplished youth fondly presuming on a fathers friendship hopes hourly for the promise of her hand fired by these tidings as again i saw her approach the hallowed precincts of the temple i threw me at her feet conjured her pity to guide me to your presence and implored the guardian saint whose votary i sued to that when we next that sacred pavement trod heaven might exalt me to the blissful honor to lead her to the altar  marcella often in vain i prayed the gallant stranger to forbear his unavailing suit nor vex my father with fruitless importunity  mendoza to both i bend for pardon that my violent love dared to oerrule the mortifying counsel of maidenly reserve and modest fear if yet thy heart that throne of happiness be vacant i implore thy fathers leave to join the contest for a prize whose value might tempt the monarchs of the world in arms to hazard each his empire  governor noble youth thy generous warmth so wins on my esteem i will entrust thy own ingenuous heart to judge the cause where even thy loves a party  the hours not past in which with her assent i gave my daughter to a valiant friend who long has loved her though i frankly own his birth and fortune make him not thy equal such is my story now assume my place and aswwer for me say shall i a soldier an old plain soldier honesty my pride shall i revoke my promise at the lure of interest and ambition  mendoza thou have found the way to vanquish all mendozas ardour thy words benumb my soul but thou shall see my wounded heart has virtue to decide against itself mendozas voice shall never prompt to the lips of honorable age the abject sounds of infamy  shall thou revoke thy promise no thou brave old man not though my life should end by its completion let the vain sons of italy and france attempt by mental alchemy to turn the lead of falsehood into wisdoms gold and sink their own poor bubbles in the trial it is the glory of a true castilian to scorn such arts and hold his word once given as sacred as the fiat of a god  governor there spoke the spirit of castilian honor brave youth i yet will love thee as my son though fate forbid such union  let us hence it may amuse thy generous mind to show thee the precincts of our castle  mendoza well thou warnest thy giddy guest to fly a dangerous banquet where his warm soul drinks poison  matchless fairone i must perforce from thy enchanting presence tear my reluctant heart while yet i can before the firm resolve of honor melts in that full blaze of frenzykindling beauty i go  still ere i quit these walls for ever i shall implore one parting interview but for a few short moments but to utter my ardent vows that heaven may make thee happy and to entreat that as the years roll on and bring thee as i hope they will new blessings thou wilt deign at least on this revolving day to think not harshly of my hapless passion and give one sigh of pity to mendoza  exit with the governor marcella he is gone ere my full heart allowed me power to frame one grateful accent to the man for whom alone my unconstrained lips could utter vows of genuine tenderness enchanting youth  do thou implore my pity thou can not need compassion love and joy will as thy guardian spirits hover round thee i am the wretch whose lacerated mind cries out for pity which i do not merit fool that i was by a reluctant promise to violate the hearts prerogative this injured sovereign now awakes to vengeance and i deserve these tortures  o lupercio thou were before an object from whose touch my conscious frame recoiled  what art thou now thy very name is discord in my ear that agitates my wounded brain to frenzy and shall i wed thee take thee to my bosom an aspic sooner from whose dearer clasp my miseries might hope for welcome death yet how escape thee and maintain at once my fathers honor and my own unshaken o for some kind assistant whose invention may over my darkened thoughts diffuse one glimpse of cheering light  here comes a minister who wants not will to serve me  enter hernandez hernandez haste dear lady your father asks a moments parley with you in private and before he walks abroad to show our ramparts to a noble stranger  marcella can thou hernandez banish from thy memory all my past anger and exert thy powers to gain my favor by one signal service  hernandez ask me if i exist for while i live i hold my life devoted to your pleasure  marcella i will put thee to the trial for the task allows not even a moment of delay know then i foolishly have given lupercio my ring the pledge of an unguarded promise which my wronged heart forbids me to fulfill i warned him if he chanced to lose the jewel our compact should be void  if thou wilt devise some lucky artifice to lure it from him thou shall have thrice the value of the gem  hernandez would thou elude thy nuptials with lupercio the blessed intelligence revives my soul  marcella he is the hated bar on whose removal my heart might enter paradise and follow the dear suggestions of unfettered love  hernandez enough thou shall be mistress of thyself  marcella make me but that  my father calls  but that and i will reward thee till thyself shall own my gratitude a prodigal in bounty lose not a moment  set me free tonight and through my every hour of future life i will bless thee for the service exit hernandez then tonight shall rid thee of lupercio  thou shall feel sarcastic boy i am a dangerous rival i know in what lone quarter of the ramparts nightly thou walkst in amorous contemplation murmuring fantastic crotchets to the moon there if i miss thee still the blended fires of love and of revenge shall aid my search and guide my thirsty poniard to thy heart  end of act i act ii scene i marcella alone the night is past but the allcheering morn fails to dispel the darkness of my soul my restless heart yet beats with blended throbs of anguish and delight at the idea that these fond eyes may with my fathers leave gaze once again upon the dear mendoza o might they in our parting close for ever  it is strange i yet hear nothing of hernandez but what can he  i was indeed an idiot to think his paltry aid could terminate my miseries i might as well believe that the poor current of a scanty brook might quench the conflagration of the globe o would those final flames that will consume this gloomy world this stage of wretchedness were kindling now for my delivered soul escaping from worse horrors could rejoice in that dread scene of fiery desolation and think it bliss to perish with mendoza  mendoza entering and think it bliss to perish with mendoza extatic sounds may i believe my sense have i such tender interest in that bosom  marcella it is not well done my lord thus at the dawn to steal upon my privacy and rob a wounded spirit of its sole support the secrecy of woes beyond a cure  mendoza pardon the impatient speed of anxious passion i have nor rest nor joy but in thy presence and hastened to thee in the sad belief a burden which my heart would now throw off that this dear interview must prove the last  marcella the last indeed it must be  mendoza if thy voice can speak with such sweet kindness of mendoza thou will revoke that sentence and what power shall burst the hallowed ties of mutual love and tear our wedded spirits from each other  marcella the ruler of thy life imperious honor honor who has already by thy voice pronounced the firm immutable decree that this illfated hand must not be thine  mendoza urge not against me the confused decision of ignorance and blind mistaken pride when i confirmed thy father in his purpose i knew not that to keep his fatal word he must become a tyrant to thy heart and violate the dearest rights of nature i knew not that mendozas adrent love had in thy bosom raised the blessed emotion of tender sympathy  marcella o that my heart had not unwarily betrayed its weakness then might a just ingenuous pride have taught me to bear the painful secret to my grave  mendoza unkindly said  if such could be thy wish thou have not loved mendoza  marcella think so ever i have not loved him duty faith forbid it i am affiancd to a generous youth who claims the full dominion of my heart nor shall mendozas image lurk within it to prove the assassin of my peace and honor  mendoza o lovely haughtiness of mind this conflict this agitation of thy artless bosom proves the enchanting truth i am beloved i read it in those sweetlyspeaking eyes where the faint spark of anger is extinguished in melting tenderness while thus i clasp thee kind sympathy gives to thy every nerve delicious softness and thy swelling heart vibrates in unison with mine to form the extatic harmony of mutual love  thou weepst  o heaven i feel these precious drops fall on my wounded breast like liquid fire o i had rather draw upon my head the worst of human ills thy hate and scorn rather than touch thee with an illstarrd passion if it must prove a source of sorrow to thee and quench the radiance of thine eyes in tears  marcella i can believe thee for thy noble soul is honors sanctuary  then as my friend let me implore the firmness of thy spirit to aid the treacherous failing of my own i am indeed unpracticed in the arts my sex is famed for i have not the skill to hide the emotions of a feeling heart and i will lay it open to thy view i will avow that if my wayward fortune had not forbid the union of our hands i would have met the ardour of thy vows with all the frankness of simplicity proud of its pleasing lot i would have prayed for undecaying charms to keep thy love blessing the god who formed us for each other but since the bar   mendoza there is there shall be none well urge thy hearts unalienable right to be the fool disposer of thy beauty  marcella o speak not thus  my own unbalancd mind whirled in the eddies of tempestuous thought already has been hurried much too far from the safe course integrity prescribes but the remembrance of thy bright example shall be my glorious guide and still preserve me how nobly have thou said thou would not urge my honored father to revoke his promise not if thy life should end by its completion shall thou a stranger thus against thyself stand forth the firm asserter of his honor and shall his child betray it  mendoza do not wound thy own pure spirit by this groundless scruple  marcella it is conviction founded on the laws the unquestionable laws of faith and virtue i must for ever fly thee or disgrace my father and myself and shall i heap grief disappointment misery and shame upon my fathers head and what a father rough as he is in the rude scene of arms the sternest soldier of his time to me the awful thunder of his voice has softened even to the tender sweetness of a lute with me he has for ever thrown aside all the asperities of harsh command and disciplined my wayward infancy with all the mildness of a mothers love  mendoza o might i aid thee in thy dearest office to pay him back those long and large arrears of tenderness and care  yes we will make it the incessant study of our days to lighten whatever load encroaching age lays on him and by the sweet solicitude extend the limit of his blessed and honored life  marcella could it be such our lot indeed were happy but it is impossible should i forgetting the fanctity of promises should i attempt to burst the fetters that involve me and struggle to be yours it could not be kind as he is my fathers firmer spirit in points of honor is inflexible could i myself descend  and wounded pride revolts at the idea  could i stoop to beg that he would countenance my falsehood i know his answer  would thou he would cry make me an object of the worlds contempt shall i be censured as a sordid wretch who having given my daughter to a friend cheated his hopes and sold her venal beauty to the rich splendour of mendozas fortune  mendoza perish the envious spirits who could harbor so base a thought of him who gave thee being but should he be reproached as purest virtue and the beneficence of heaven itself escapes not such profanation it were better than to behold thy peace of mind destroyed and thy soft heart corroded by the shackles the galling shackles of a joyless marriage  think what it is to press the nuptial couch when for the roses love should scatter there the fiend antipathy has formed its pillow of sharpest thorns that lacerate the brain  marcella i know it must be agony far worse than deaths severest pang the thought already has thrown my troubled mind from off its balance and plunged me in distraction  thou art cruel to set my woes thus forcibly before me and aggravate the anguish of my fate  mendoza think rather that with fond anxiety i warn you of the precipice you tread and pant to save you trembling on its brink  marcella i pray you leave me for your dangerous aid can but increase the horrors of my fall o leave me i conjure you  mendoza once assure me you will endeavor to draw back your hand from this abhorred alliance i will rest on the faint hope which may arise from thence  marcella whatever i can do and not destroy my fathers peace and honor shall be done for o it is certain rather than be dragged the victim of lupercios nuptial triumph my heart would choose to languish life away in the lone walls of some sequestered cell where not one pleasing sound could sooth my suffering save when i closed some melancholy prayer with the dear echo of mendozas name  mendoza enchanting softness thou shall yet be mine and these heartrending sighs shall turn to rapture  marcella i hear my fathers step depart i pray thee  mendoza by heaven my feet seem rooted to this spot and have not power to bear me from thy presence  enter the governor governor ah my young friend youth wants a monitor to bid it mark the rapid flight of time is this your momentary interview come force me not to play the testy father and chide you from my roof  mendoza o pardon me i will but seal one vow of tender friendship on this fair hand and instantly attend you  farewell  thou art the loveliest work of heaven and may its purest spirits be thy guard   exit with the governor marcella torn from me banished from my view for ever o shall these wretched eyes behold no more the darling of their sight and as each morn of hated life returns shall they be forced to gaze upon the object that they loath sure all the subtlest of the infernal fiends are leagued to curse me with their keenest tortures ah senseless wretch my folly is the fiend from whom this misery springs twas i twas i slave that i was who fastened on myself this iron bondage that corrodes my soul  hernandez entering lament its weight no more thy chain is broken receive the symbol of thy liberty delivering the ring  marcella it is my ring my gladdend eyes acknowledge its bright assurance of recovered freedom  fly stop mendoza  stay yet tell me first how thou have prosperd thou excelling servant  thou shall have great rewards great as my joy  how did the fond lupercio yield my pledge haste tell me all  i must prepare myself to meet him soon complaining of his loss  hernandez be satisfied  he can no more complain  marcella what do thou mean by that mysterious accent  hernandez his hated voice shall never be heard again  marcella thou have not murdered him  by heaven thou have i read it in thy dark and troubled visage  hernandez i have indeed been bloody for thy sake  marcella is he then butchered by thy savage hand  unhappy youth thy pale and gory spectre will glare for ever in my sight and banish all hopes of quiet from my soul for ever  wretch thou have sunk me in the deepest gulf of horror and perdition  hernandez come be cheered i have delivered thee from him whose being was torture to thy heart  lupercios dead and by my caution it must be supposed the nightly robbers who infest our city have thus revenged his vigilance against them  marcella is this the recompense of all thy merit brave generous frank lupercio  though my heart recoiled perversely from thy love it feels with cold convulsive pangs of vain regret it feels thy worth thy illrequited virtues and all the horrors of thy barbarous fate  hernandez reflect thou only from what hated scenes of hopeless pain my daring hand has saved thee think what thou owst to me who for thy sake have put in hazard my immortal soul  marcella illfated wretch thou also have my pity twas my base conduct blinded as i was that plunged thee in this guilt  but haste be gone fly while thou can where justice may not find thee fly to some distant climate and endeavor by penitence to make thy peace with heaven go where thou will my bounty shall attend thee and aid thee with such lavish sums of gold as may enable thee by those good deeds which charity delights in best to cancel or counterpoise the evil of thy crime  hernandez what can thou vainly think that in thy service i have died my unstained hand in guiltless blood for gold the needy robbers paltry prey  marcella what was thy aim  thy frantic eyes affright me  hernandez here is the nobler recompense i claim thy beauty rich in medicinal balm to heal the envenomed anguish of remorse come to my breast and with thy melting charms drown all the keenest pangs that guilt can waken in extacy more poignant  marcella slave unhand me  away  remember rash presumptuous villain the distance of thy station  hernandez idle pride

use of reason to hear more calmly all thy wretched tale  he leads marcella weeping to the adjoining chamber and closes the door upon her mendoza what is to be done my dizzy soul thus falling from joys

traitress has betrayed me then revenge thou art the only sweet that i can taste and i will banquet on thee  governor if thou art so base a monster of ingratitude prepare thyself for tortures  hernandez spare thy threats thou know not yet the partner of my guilt  thou would not choose to see thy daughters beauty exposed a mangled victim in those streets where never eye surveyed her passing form but with delight or envy  governor slandrous ruffian dare thou profane the virtue of my child  but her pure soul could no more league with thine than heavens mostfavord angel could descend to aid the hellish plots of that arch fiend who prompted thee to perpetrate this murder  mendoza aside to hernandez peace villain and if ever thou hopst for mercy respect the feelings of a wounded father  hernandez talk not to me of mercy  i despise it  death is i know my portion but its pangs are turned to transport by my rich revenge too long the jests of mockery were lavished on my misshapen form and ardent love one gibing youth has paid me with his life for insolent derision and over thee thou haughty husband thou fair golden image whom beauty worships unconstrained over thee my triumph rises to a prouder height of bold revenge  i have enjoyed thy bride  mendoza thou bloodstained liar hence  away with him to strict confinement in your deepest dungeon  hernandez bite thy proud frantic lip in savage hope to see my crooked body on the wheel crushed and exposed a public spectacle my vengeance is consummate but for thine it is the vain menace of presumptuous pride which courage laughs at  i escape it thus stabs himself  mendoza thou have indeed eluded the slow hand of human justice but thou can not foil the surer vengeance of highjudging heaven  governor go bring thy wife she must appear this instant the form of injured innocence must draw from the pale lips of this expiring villain the avowal of his falsehood  hernandez my dim eyes are closing and in this deceitful world shall look no more upon her fatal beauty but in the next  o mercy dies  governor where is my daughter  marcella entering here is the hapless being who once was proud of that endearing name though fallen less guilty than the world might judge me from the base insult of this bleeding wretch whose crimes are closed by death yet o my father too vile to claim thy kindness or to live  governor wrong not thyself thou art all innocence  marcella thou dear deluded parent  twas my wish to die and not deprive thee of a thought in which thy virtuous spirit would have found sweet consolation for thy lost delight  i wished a little longer to support this wretched being that i might not stain by my accelerated fate this mansion the dear asylum of thy honored age but my galled spirit never formed to bear the heavy load of unacknowledgd guilt sunk in its painful efforts to sustain it hence the quick end of that abhorred assassin and hence thy child atoning now by death for her concealed offenses thus implores thee to pardon and to bless her parting spirit  governor o thou dear sufferer whatever thy failings attempt not aught against thy precious life  mendoza live i conjure thee and the tears of love shall wash the ideal blemish from thy heart  marcella my generous husband let me speak that name still precious to me though so rashly purchased think not thy injured bride designed to give to thy chaste bed a vile dishonored partner though forcibly dishonored  governor ha my child have thou endured from that atrocious ruffian   marcella o good my father ask not my faint voice which soon will sink in everlasting silence to unfold a tale whose utterance would call shames burning blush to the pale cheek of death  a friendly poison has already numbed my vital faculties but i have left a written legacy of fatal fondness in which unless my blotting tears have marred it you will read what i have done and what endured  nay weep not both of you may love me dead living you could not  mendoza could affection rescue thy beauty from the grave thou should not die  marcella i know ye generous spirits death will cancel in your kind memries all my fatal errors and hence its pangs are welcome  one base purpose produced these scenes of unexpected horror but heaven has willed that crime should quicken crime to show the danger of one devious step from the clear paths of probity and truth  my dear mendoza thou will not deny me the title of thy wife to grace my tomb and i shall sleep in peace  console my father and let him find in thee a worthier child i had a heart to reverence his virtues but not the strength to imitate  o heaven dies  mendoza it is gone it is fled the proud the lovely soul that could not brook the shadow of dishonor thy monument shall be the nuptial bed on which mendoza will recline and breathe his faithful fondness to thy listening spirit nor will i slight the dear and hallowed trust bequeathed by filial piety to shield with constant care thy fathers honored age  unhappy father round the livid breast of his lost child in speechless agony his arms are riveted  aid me to raise and bear him gently from this scene of death  the two connoisseurs a comedy of three acts in rhyme persons of the drama lord seewell mr beril mr bijou mr cycle tom careless harry servant to mr beril mr varnish daughters of lord seewell lady harriot lady frances mrs bijou joan the two connoisseurs act   scene   chambers in the temple tom careless and mr cycle careless whatever the success of your journey may be my dear rural sage you are welcome to me your benevolent projects i hope you will complete by this trip from your snug scientific retreat in return for amusement you have given me there by your fine apparatus and lectures on air i will show you the town and the town is a science  mr cycle on my tutor dear tom i have a perfect reliance for i know in that study what vigils you have kept  careless it is the only one truly where i am an adept for as to the law that is the science of thorns and though its black robe my lean figure adorns perhaps twice a year for my fathers good pleasure i have renounced i confess both its toil and its treasure from my sapient lord coke this advantage i gain he led me to find out a flaw in my brain that title on which as wise parents have done my father laid claim to the seals for his son  mr cycle such language dear tom is in truth but a brogue that betrays the young heir as an indolent rogue it is the cant of ye all  ye want talents to drudge  careless well think me my friend wise enough for a judge i still must rejoice i have nothing to do as my heart now inclines me to wait upon you i wish i could raise you the cash you require but you know i depend on a closehanded sire who promises largely and often has said he will make me a croesus whenever i wed but to drive me i think to the conjugal state keeps the purse of the bachelor woefully strait and guineas at present are scarce to my sorrow how much are you now come to london to borrow two thousand do you say  mr cycle yes two thousand at least and perhaps rather more as my plan is increased i wish for no profit but public esteem and much good to the world must arise from my scheme  careless well i wish you may prosper but as i am a sinner i as soon should expect a roast phoenix for dinner as in times like the present such loans from a friend when opulence has not a stiver to lend you philosophers look with contempt upon cash but the fools of this town are so fond of the trash that as youre a chemist both skilful and bold you had best try to make a few odd lumps of gold and this newlyfound art you may try with less cost since to borrow with ease seems an art that is lost  mr cycle dear careless youre welcome to rally my hopes so attack them with all your rhetorical tropes the man is illwrapt in philosophys cloak whose bosom is ruffled dear tom by a joke i know moneys scarce yet i will not despond i have two friends who will supply what i want on my bond  careless what two such good friends so rich open and free dear cycle i pray introduce them to me for not one of that cast my long list can produce why man such a friend is the goldeneggd goose you may hunt for the bird even as long as youre able but at last you will find it is only a fable i wanted but one hundred pound the other day and asked fifty friends that chance threw in my way but they all shook their heads with a negative nod so i dunnd my old father in spite of the rod  but pray do i know the good creatures you mean  mr cycle aye both  they are two friends whom for years i have not seen but in juvenile days i held each as my brother and i trust that we all are still dear to each other youre acquainted with beril   careless well there i confess your wishes have some little chance of success if there is one in the world who regardless of pelf would relieve a friends wants though he straightened himself you have now named the man yet perhaps he cannot lend i know he has suffered by aiding a friend and i fancy he has but a slender estate it is true he never plays though carest by the great yet in statues and books he is expensive it is said  i have seen him bid high for a porphyry head  mr cycle it is hard fortune still should torment him with crosses i soothed him to bear the severest of losses i was with him when blasted in youths blooming charms his lovely sophia was torn from his arms you knew not i think that unfortunate fair the victim of cruelty love and despair she was bound to our friend by a mutual affection but her rich sordid parents opposed the connection the canker of sorrow incessantly preyed on the perishing bloom of the delicate maid her duty her sufferings made nature relent and wrung from her father a tardy consent but death rendered vain the late sanction he gave and his childs bridal bed was the pitiless grave many years have now softened the lovers wild grief perhaps some new beauty now yields him relief he is still single i think  careless yes in learning and art he has sought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart hence a pleasing mild elegance runs through his life and had i a sister i would wish her his wife  but now for your second friend  what is his name for acquaintance with him too i will certainly claim you say that i know him come tell me who is it  mr cycle yes indeed it is one whom you frequently visit and here you must own that my hopes are well founded since in kindness and wealth he has ever abounded and a legacy lately   careless you dont mean bijou that collector of knickknacks  mr cycle indeed tom i do i have a title to ask any favor from him he has some little vanity some little whim yet still he is a friendly benevolent man  careless you may rap at his door  but get in if you can your friend when you saw him was jocund and free his heart full of bounty his spirit of glee his vanities too had so mirthful a cast that friendship herself even wished them to last but marriage that changer of mind and of feature has made poor bijou quite a different creature  mr cycle i am told that his wife with a pocket well laden was a little fat ancient and wellbehavd maiden who having a similar taste for virtu put her cabinet under the care of bijou  careless yes indeed in an odd fit of amorous hunger he married an old curiositymonger who is ready to faint if a visitor knocks while she is brushing the dust from her rareeshew box her maid the other day threw her into a swoon by cracking the eye of a great stuffed baboon for instead of young children whose troublesome noise might disturb their sedate virtuosical joys she fills their fine house with new monsters or mummies  mr cycle of your story dear tom i perceive what the sum is you dont like the lady  she may not please you and yet be an excellent wife for bijou i am told she has really much merit and taste in her morals they say she is remarkably chaste so with lectures perhaps she has wounded your ear and you rakes of the temple may think her severe  careless no faith with the lady i stand very well i bought her esteem with an old empty shell i own she has piety morals and sense to chastity no one will doubt her pretense but though with these virtues i freely invest her my heart i confess is inclined to detest her she has ruined her husband  at least so i think to a dwarf she has made his benevolence shrink and puffed up his vanity into a giant to all her strange whims he is so servilely pliant he would obey her caprice whatsoever it might hint and deny himself bread to buy her an odd flint  mr cycle why tom that is a proof of his fond tender heart  careless to me it proves naught but her ladyships art and so you yourself would explain the whole riddle if you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle as a more wretched brush never blotted poor paper and never squeakd a cremona beneath a worse scraper though pampered with flattery thus by his wife our friend has quite lost all his humor and life and whenever i look on his cold chearless face as he stands by the side of his wifes fossilcase i think her a perfect medusa i own who has turned her poor husband himself into stone  mr cycle you loungers dear tom in your idle disputes love to ridicule all lifes amusing pursuits but they all have their use and the lady who joys in collecting an odd set of whimsical toys is herself a rare gem that my judgment regards more than all the fair votaries of scandal and cards i know i shall like her in spite of your stricture and i am going to see how you have failed in her picture my old friends good will i shall put to the trial and solicit his aid without fear of denial  careless come along  i will see if your welcome is hearty indeed i may serve you by joining the party and i am eager to know for my portrait is true what you think of the change she has wrought in bijou to a knowledge of nature i never will pretend if when you have seen in the house of our friend all the natural rarities ranged in a glass you dont rank his heart in the petrified class exeunt scene changes to a drawing room at mrs bijou s with a door open into an interior cabinet of curiosities  several stuffed creatures and other rarities discovered in the apartment joan with a brush lackaday would i once were well out of this house where i tremble to move full as much as a mouse and nannys afraid to come into this room indeed the poor creature can scarce hold a broom for my mistress she says has done nothing but bait her since she brushed off the tail of the new alligator i have a great mind to lay up my brush on the shelf and leave madam to dust all her monsters herself would my master would make her for these stocks and stones a young little plaything of good flesh and bones but alas these old ladies who cannot raise a baby are as full of nonsensical maggots as may be and our house is so crammed with this whimsical jumble that if you touch one thing another will tumble madam says i misplace whatsoever i clean but i will venture to wipe off the dust from this screen throws it down a plague take the things they do nothing but fall lud my fingers have run through the cover and all taking up the screen and uncovering it it is my masters new drawing  how madam will thunder  this fine naked beauty i have torn quite asunder and the rent must be seen  i can thrust my whole thumb in and i have no time to mend it  my mistress is coming   mrs bijou entering in a dark brown bedgown with a brush of peacocks feathers

beautiful work of your master  joan my finger slipped through as i wiped it in haste but i am sure i can mend it again with some paste  mrs bijou you awkward pert hussy pray let it alone can paste mend a flaw in a goddesss zone ye stars give me patience  get out of this door and pray let me never set eyes on you more i knew i should suffer as soon as you came for taking a thing with so gothic a name  joan i will go  for i live but the life of a cur yet pray on my name do not throw any slur i am sure it is good english although it is joan and that is more than youre able to say of your own exit mr bijou entering what is the matter my dear  what new plague from your maids you for ever are vexed by these pestilent jades if bred in this town you object to their morals if rustics they break all your glasses or corals let em come whence they will they bring trouble and strife and your quarrels have made me half sick of my life  mrs bijou dont say so  you know my dear mr bijou i take no young maids out of fondness to you and these middleagd creatures are all so unhandy they make me as fretful as old mr shandy but my dear if you see me sometimes in a flame i think you will not say that my tempers to blame twas my love for the works of your delicate hand which produced an emotion i could not command if i rated old joan in a great agitation i am sure you will own i had much provocation when you see this sad cause of the bustle between us she has utterly ruined your very best venus this new lovely drawing the joy of all eyes i vow i could cry   mr bijou what sweet softness  she cries  these feelings indeed prove the true connoisseur this ill treatment of art her fine sense cannot endure henceforth of my works let them say what they will no painter can boast such a test of his skill  come cheer up my dear cognoscente come come i can mend it again with a brushfull of gum  mrs bijou do you think you can mend it  and will not it look brown if you dont hide the skin with the skirt of a gown twould be pity to cloak up a body so fine especially since you have drawn it from mine and you know i caught cold when i stripped to the waist to sit for the figure in true attic taste but i did it from fondness that you might not roam and wickedly hunt after models from home to be sure i love art  but all artists they say by their studies of nature are tempted to stray and i own that your genius gives me great alarms  mr bijou my dear tender creature pray trust your own charms  mrs bijou affectionate terrors will rise in my head i was jealous i own the other day of the dead  mr bijou what fond sensibility exquisite feeling  mrs bijou i hope i was wrong but strange fancies will steal in when fondness has opened the heart to suspicion youre so dear to the females of every condition but i hope lady fancybird was not so vicious there was nothing indeed in her air meretricious yet a jealous pang seized me i own when i found that by will she bequeathed to you three thousand pound it is true that a legacys very commodious yet the money appears to me utterly odious when i think it was possibly meant as the price of endearments to which she had art to entice and not in return for the pictures you drew of her parrot her bullfinch and old cockatoo  mr bijou lord my dear if such phantoms your quiet consume you will make the old lady jump out of her tomb it is true that i flattered her favorite passion as i love to be well with old ladies of fashion but pray dont suppose i was ever so absurd as to stroke her pale cheek for the pole of her bird  mrs bijou ah you humorous man you have such infinite wit you can turn to a jest whatsoever you think fit  but my heart on this point can be never at ease unless you will allow me to spend as i please half the money of which youre so oddly possessed and then i shall think it an honest bequest besides there is an auction at lady toytruckles and i long for a rap at the duchesss knuckles who outbid me you know the other day for a shell it is all for your credit  mr bijou well well my dear well i never refuse you the cash i can spare  mrs bijou you are sure i shall turn it to something most rare for indeed i am no pitiful hoarder of pelf and i have now set my heart on some true ancient delf  mr bijou it is time you were dressed  mrs bijou as i live there is a rap i am not fit to be seen in this bedgown and cap run and charge them my dear not to let in a soul  with my cabinet dust i am as black as a coal  mr bijou looking out i am too late  mrs bijou for my orders they dont care a pin and to vex me old joan has let somebody in i will escape  i cannot bear to be seen in this trim  mr bijou it is only tom careless  you need not mind him  enter careless and mr cycle careless here good folks i have brought you a very rare bird it is five years since his notes in this town have been heard  mr bijou mr cycle my worthy old friend how do you do  give me leave to present to you mrs bijou  mrs bijou i am ashamed to be found in this garb  mr bijou o my dear from a man of true science you have nothing to fear he will freely allow for he is candid and just philosophical ladies must dabble in dust  mr cycle my wife is a curious collector in natural knowledge i hope you will direct her you are master of all from the earth to the stars and may aid her in ranging her fossils and spars  mr cycle she shall freely command all the little i know  mrs bijou youre extremely obliging dear sir to say so but i cannot attend you in this dusty vest i will soon slip it off  careless you shant stir i protest to talk of your dress my dear maam is a joke to a sage who exists but in chemical smoke your robe is indeed like the robe of saint bruno yet still by your air we might take you for juno while the tail of your peacock that type of command with such dignity waves in your awful white hand  mrs bijou youre a young saucy creature  mr cycle these idie rouges madam more like sons of the serpent than children of adam are apt to esteem it a dull occupation to study the wonders of this fair creation and hence they all rally with humor illplacd those who seek for amusement in science and taste  mr bijou well said mr cycle  i am glad that virtu has found both a friend and a champion in you come and peep at my wifes philosophical treasure i hope you will survey it again at your leisure  my dear do you allow me to show your museum  i am exact in all matters of tuum and meum  mrs bijou mr cycle i am sure is a privileged man  mr bijou it is open  come sir  exit with mr cycle into the interior apartment mrs bijou tell me tom if you can is not this mr cycle a man of great worth who wrote a most excellent book on the earth  careless it is the author himself and i know not what college can show his superior in virtue and knowledge he is a man of few words with a heart and a mind ever busied in schemes for the good of mankind and he now visits london in hopes to procure some support in a plan for relieving the poor  mrs bijou the poor  of their name i am alarmed at the mention mr cycle indeed may have no ill intention but i fear he will involve my good husband in trouble  these projects of charity end in a bubble the poor are ungrateful disorderly wretches who can shift for themselves by their tricks and their fetches they deserve not a learned philosophers thought  careless your pardon  he will think if he thinks as he ought that philosophy drawing from heaven her birth is the science of softening the evils on earth by your fears you have done our friend infinite wrong for though his hearts tender his judgment is strong to the projects of folly he never can stoop  philanthropys friend is not phantasys dupe  mrs bijou why careless you talk in a language quite new who could dream of a charitysermon from you  careless oh a cobbler can preach when his spirits inflamed mine is apt to blaze forth if i hear a friend blamed and indeed i cannot stifle my hearts ebullitions when such good folks as you harbor vile suppositions but i am sure you will forgive all the warmth i have shown when the worth of our friend is to you better known if youre angry i know that your anger will cease when you hear on what terms i can purchase my peace a shell i can bring you  my interest such is  very like what you lately gave up to the duchess perhaps i may give it you   mrs bijou youre a good soul  as large as her graces and perfectly whole  careless yes i think it is as large and in color as high  mrs bijou are you sure of its shape  careless do you question my eye i will convince you i am right let us instantly look at the fine colored plates in your great danish book  mrs bijou come  you give me more joy than i am able to speak  i cannot bear that her grace should possess an unique  they retire into the interior apartment from whence mr bijou and mr cycle return mr bijou this scheme my good friend does you honor indeed in a business so noble i hope you will proceed and may you accomplish your utmost desires in raising the sum which your project requires  pray look at this new little drawing of mine dont you think it an elegant pretty design  mr cycle yery lively indeed  but my friend you forget what i have said on the point of incurring this debt do not fly from the subject  i hate all evasion i must say for your aid i have serious occasion you know what i have asked and in asking i deem that i give you a proof of my cordial esteem in a poorhouse myself i would rather work hard than apply thus to one whom i did not regard  mr bijou mr cycle i know youre a man without guile and you think in a noble and singular style but if asking for cash is of love a sure test with affectionate friends all the wealthy are blessed  mr cycle i have done as i see that you wish to evade a request that i thought i with justice had made as you know when of fortune you felt a reverse you had once the command of my prosperous purse and since you of opulence now are possessed more enriched too of late by a friendly bequest i supposed without trouble   mr bijou dear cycle it is true you shall have it but mum toward mrs bijou  mr cycle o i now understand all the cause of demur and if that is the case i have done my dear sir at the hazard of discord the sum you shant lend in family strife i will not plunge my old friend  mr bijou do not think me a slave  there is no danger of strife but you will find if you ever try the conjugal life it is best not to waken the frowns of a wife besides there is surely no reason why you should talk on such business to mrs bijou  mr cycle there is certainly none  you shall do as you please  mr bijou one thousand my friend i can spare you with ease it is the sum i shall go to receive very soon if you will call here again you shall have it by noon and to tell you the truth i would have you make haste lest my wife should demand it for matters of taste when an auction is near she is apt to be rash in laying her hand upon all my loose cash and as she is thought so judicious a buyer her elegant wishes i seldom deny her yet it is time to grow prudent  but hush here they come remember my charge  dear philosopher mum  enter mrs bijou and careless mrs bijou o my dear i am in raptures my young friend has cured all the bitter vexation i have lately endured now in shells by the duchess i am not surpast tom will bring me the fellow to what she bought last  mr bijou he is exceedingly kind  but my dear it grows late remember the guest whom you must not make wait old baron vanbettles appointed today your curious collection of flies to survey as some business abroad will oblige me to leave him i entreat you my dear to be dressed to receive him these friends will excuse you  mrs bijou i will bid them farewell mr cycle your servant  remember the shell exit mr bijou o my friend you have a thousand new drawings to see  i can tell you our artists grow jealous of me  joan entering hastily sir a coach is just stopped and a man with a star on   mr bijou ods life i must leave you to wait on the baron  mr cycle i beg we may not keep you  mr bijou my good friends adieu dear cycle pray meet me again here at two i am sorry i am forced thus to part with you now but for such an engagement i am sure you will allow for the flies are all ranged in the parlour below and a guest like the baron one cannot leave you know as the keys in the case he perhaps might unlock it and whip the best butterfly into his pocket it is a law with the curious to watch a collector and you never must trust him without an inspector exit careless now my friend what do you say to the portrait i drew were my colors too dark for good madam bijou but how have you fared in your moneypetition if you get it i will call you a mighty magician i can tell you that madam suspected a plot  mr cycle i have his promise  but shall i accept it or not  careless if you can by all means  twill be saved from her clutches who would throw it away in outbidding a duchess and at auctions indeed she would her husband undo were she not in her house quite a closehanded jew but on saving a penny she frequently ponders and her avarice scrapes what her vanity squanders  o if i were her master her whimsies i would cure and make a good wife of this vile connoisseur  now for beril  he is one of a different cast  mr cycle come along  since i saw him some long years have past and i am eager to clasp his affectionate hand  careless stop a moment and answer me this one demand dont you see a sad change in our poor friend below where is the lively companion the humorous beau all his pleasantrys gone   mr cycle i confess by his carriage he seems to be rendered more serious by marriage  careless by my life i am grieved in thus seeing him grow the poor trumpeting slave to his wifes rareeshew  well ye gods if whenever my nuptial star twinkles i should wed an old hunter of odd periwinkles to engage her nice eye with unchanging attraction may i turn in her arms to a cold petrifaction  end of act i act ii scene i an elegant apartment ornamented with a few busts and books a large statue covered up and a door open into a more extensive library mr beril and harry mr beril pray harry remove from the statue its case and be careful in clearing the dust from its base  harry directly sir  mr beril yes you must instantly do it for my worthy lord seewell is coming to view it  now my sweet lady frances i soon shall behold all thy quick sensibility wake and unfold thou will pay to this sculpture the tribute most dear thou will praise the fine work by an eloquent tear unless by gay harriot thy softness is checked how i long in thy features to mark the effect produced by the wonders of exquisite art on a delicate mind and a sensible heart but why on thy graces do i rashly dwell why study those charms that i know but too well in my station it is madness to think of thy hand yet thou of all women in this lovely land thou only could fill in my desolate breast the place that my tender sophia possessed  harry advancing there sir it is as neat as a newtwisted cord but i hope you will not sell this fine thing to my lord he is a desperate bidder for stonework i am told yet i hope you will keep it in spite of his gold  mr beril do you hope so  pray why  i should rather have thought you would rejoice if his lordship the statue had bought it would save you some trouble  harry for that i dont care why i wish you to keep it i will freely declare  i have observed since the day that poor miss sophy died and that is five years i think next bartholomewtide there is only this statue that is now in our sight in which you have seemed to take any delight and if this marble woman your heart so engages before you should sell her i would give up my wages  mr beril you are a generous lad with an excellent heart  honest harry the statute and i shall not part but i hear a coach stop  haste and let my lord in  exit harry mr beril alone harrys warmth is affecting  it is pleasant to win a regard unconstrained from the low ranks of life which are falsely supposed full of baseness and strife how mistaken is he who incessantly raves that domestics are nothing but idiots or knaves when nature often shines with a luster most fervent in the zeal of an honest affectionate servant  enter lord seewell with lady frances and lady harriot lord seewell dear beril my girls would attend me to see either you or your statue  however that may be i know you will allow them a sight of your treasure  mr beril my lord i confess i had hopes of this pleasure and my statue henceforth i more highly shall rate since to that i am in debt for an honor so great  lady harriot that is right mr beril  i pray make it known that we come for the sake of the marble alone for though we have both a fair name as i think yet our poor reputations will instantly sink if it is said by your neighbor old lady snapfan that instead of a statue we visit a man  mr beril if on spirit and worth there is any reliance lady harriot may set every hag at defiance and force even scandal in silence to sit  if not just to her innocence awed by her wit  lady harriot my dear sir do not talk in so pleasing a tone if you do i shant relish the silence of stone and the statuell seem dull  so pray tell us where is it pray present us to her that we are now come to visit  mr beril here is the lady you honor shewing the statue  lord seewell indeed this is fine what perfect expression what strength of design  mr beril pray my dear lady frances advance to the place which will give you i think the best view of the face it is the tender alcestis just yielding her breath on the arm of her husband reclining in death and though pain over her form so much languor has thrown you may still discern beauties resembling your own  lord seewell whence came it dear beril  it is surely antique the work my good friend is undoubtedly greek i swear the laocoon is not so fine had i choice of the two this i am clear would be mine the subject more pleasing  expression still higher  this longhidden treasure where could you acquire  mr beril i owe it to chance to acknowledge the truth and a princely and brave neapolitan youth whom i luckily saved in a villainous strife from the dagger of jealousy aimed at his life the work was dug up on his fathers estate and knowing my passion for marble is great he nobly has sent me the gift in your view in return for what accident led me to do  lord seewell it is the first piece of sculpture perhaps on the earth and i hardly know how to appreciate its worth but if ever you wish to dispose of the treasure i will accept it at three thousand guineas with pleasure  mr beril my lord you now speak with that liberal spirit which you ever display when you estimate merit though i own works of art of such high estimation seem but ill to agree with my fortune and station yet these figures at present i wish to retain though the wish may appear ostentatious and vain but my lord if they ever change their master anew they shall find a more worthy possessor in you  lady harriot well ye dear connoisseurs you amaze me i own by the value you set on this sorrowful stone i indeed can believe it is a fine piece of art but to buy it for furniture  as to my part i would as soon over my house throw a sepulchres gloom and purchase from westminsterabbey a tomb  lord seewell youre a wild idle gipsy and past all correcting you have not the least relish for what is affecting  lady harriot that is your fault dear papa  but my sister you see makes ample amends for this failing in me she gazes like you with such serious delight that she is half turned to marble herself by the sight i vow it has made her unable to speak and has drawn a cold tear down her petrified cheek  lady frances pray my dear dont expose me  mr beril o seek not to hide what nature designed your chief beauty and pride  with different charms she enriches the earth to your sister she gave the sweet dimples of mirth and that each in her province no rival may find all the soft pensive graces to you she assigned  lady harriot believe me you shine mr beril most brightly in the delicate science of praising politely in which many beaux are so savagely stupid they a scalpingknife take for the weapon of cupid and to tickle one nymph basely slash every other  well dear frances how are you  lady frances indeed i cannot smother what i feel in surveying this wonder of art it has something which takes such fast hold of the heart in the faint dying wife such a fond resignation in the poor widowed husband such wild agitation such sorrow such anguish such love to alcestis  lady harriot that is true but i know the whole story a jest is and admetus i think such a shuffling poltroon that he moves me no more than the man in the moon a pitiful fellow to live in his case and let his poor wife pass the styx in his place modern husbands indeed i believe would be merry if their wives in their stead would cross over that ferry  mr beril but perhaps maam you think that no husband could find a young modern wife of alcestiss mind  lady harriot no indeed my good sir  here is my dear sister fan she would be willing to die to preserve her good man but i own for myself i should doubt and demur if i thought my spouse wished his own trip to defer though myself to his fortunes i would freely devote if we both might embark at one time in the boat i confess i should scarce be so wondrously kind as to set sail myself but to leave him behind  harry entering two gentlemen sir wish to see you below mr careless is one  lord seewell to mr beril harriots favorite beau  lady harriot lord papa mr beril will think me in love  mr beril to harry let the gentlemen know we expect them above  exit harry lord seewell tom and harriot have long had flirtations together but their courtship has changeable fits like the weather the improvident girl thinking lovers are plenty declares she will not wed till she is past oneandtwenty nor even then take her beau in her charms such her trust is unless he bids fair to become a chief justice and tom is the heir of too large an estate to load his gay spirit with laws heavy weight  but here comes our young lawyer to urge his own plea  enter careless and mr cycle mr beril my dear tom how do you do  my good stars can it be is it you my dear cycle my longabsent friend  mr cycle and still heartily yours  mr beril but why would you not send and of your affection afford me a proof by bespeaking your quarters here under my roof however i am happy that chance is so kind as to give me the occasion i have long wished to find to present you to one who of all men on earth is most able to judge of your genius and worth  my dear lord to your notice now let me commend the man to whose name youre already a friend behold mr cycle  lord seewell dear sir let me say that i often have wished for this fortunate day which makes me acquainted with one whom i deem so justly entitled to public esteem whose writings and life show in fairest alliance philanthropical virtue and genuine science  mr cycle my good lord these are honors far more than my due yet i own with delight i receive them from you as youre led to oerrate my poor merits i feel by this dear partial friends kind affectionate zeal  lord seewell he indeed is your friend  i regard his applause but to wish your acquaintance i have still higher cause be assured i shall think myself truly your debtor if you will give me the pleasure of knowing you better either beril or careless will guide you to me i have some things perhaps it may please you to see yet no gem i believe that is so worthy your sight as a statue which beril has just brought to light allow me to show it you   mr beril to lady frances your tender breast my dear lady frances i fear is oppressed by this sculptured distress the mere creature of art yet too painful a scene for so feeling a heart  lady frances no indeed  at first sight though it made my veins thrill and i felt through my bosom a cold icy chill that impression once over i view it again with a soothing delight unembitterd by pain  lady harriot to careless and pray sir from which court of justice come you  careless from the worshipful court of wise madam bijou where blind as old themis she utters decrees on the price of stuffed parrots and petrified trees  lady harriot o you mischievous creature you certainly mean by the sound of her name to awaken my spleen you know that the thought of her sickens me quite and that i at her house must do penance tonight  careless then i vow i will be there if it is only to see how mortification and you may agree even that gloomy spright must appear with some grace if it lurks in the lines of so lively a face  lady harriot all my gaiety dies when her presence i come in no crampfish could give me a shock so benumbing  she is my utter aversion   lord seewell pray tell me my dear of whom do you speak in a style so severe  lady harriot of your friend dear papa your good mrs bijou  lord seewell that is ungrateful dear harriot  she is civil to you and you should not indulge a satirical vein  lady harriot you forget my dear sir how you often complain that her low little pride and nonsensical whim have reduced your old friend to a pitiful trim and i think she has made him so gloomy a slave she has pent her good man in trophoniuss cave such to him was the temple of hymen for after he entered its vestibule  farewell to laughter  lord seewell why harriot you really are quite acrimonious but if you call wedlock the cave of trophonius have a care if that cavern you chance to step near you love laughing too well to resign it my dear  lady harriot and therefore though wooed like the nymph of toboso i never will marry an old virtuoso who thinks himself blessed with taste science and worth because he picks up all the odd things on earth  when a passion for art or for nature is joined with a warm friendly heart and a liberal mind i respect the pure taste which that union produces free from vanitys sordid fantastic abuses though i do not possess it i see and commend such taste dear papa both in you and your friend but i view with an utter contempt i confess those who awkwardly ape what you really possess and for mrs bijou she has just as much soul as a monkey who carries queer things to its hole she with wonderful gusto half gothic half dutch like an old squirrel hides all she can in her hutch  careless an excellent portrait and true i protest for i have just had a peep at the old squirrels nest  lady harriot pray since we together her closet inspected what whimsical rarities has she collected  careless o before i could count half the baubles she buys i could tell you the name of each star in the skies her sphere is too wide for my genius to scan it but i know what she reckons her georgian planet her newlyfound star  which tonight if youre free through a glass she perhaps may allow you to see  lady harriot what wonder is this  is it flesh fish or fowl a lilliput dog or a brobdignag owl or is it a remnant from josephs odd coat  careless it is something once held by a person of note in our island and now i defy you to guess  lady harriot is it essexs ring or the ruff of queen bess or alfreds caketoaster or rizzios fiddle pray tell me  i hate to be teased by a riddle  careless in short it is a nightcap not worth half a groat which she for a guinea has luckily bought because this old fragment of worsted she vows once served as a crown for poor chattertons brows though i think we should find if we knew the whole truth that the cap was never seen by that wonderful youth  lady harriot now chatterton boast that thy illfated verse can teach antiquarians to open their purse yet had thou in misery sud for that guinea its mistress had called thee a vain rhyming ninny and proved to thy grief by the style of her giving virtuosos have little esteem for the living  lord seewell come harriot i must stop the tide of your wit though youre now on a topic you dont love to quit to mr beril we must take our leave  many thanks for our pleasure  mr cycle remember  your first day of leisure  you shant stir my dear beril you shant leave your friend here is careless you know on the girls to attend let us see you together and shortly  adieu  lady harriot to careless aside below let me whisper a few words to you  mr beril and mr cycle mr beril well my worthy old friend i rejoice you are here and that now you are known to that excellent peer who free from all pride affectation and vanity unites useful virtue to pleasing urbanity plain simple sincere yet of judgment refined and fond of the arts as they are friends to mankind ennobled much less by his birth than his spirit the model of honor and patron of merit but how have you done for this age and what plan for the profit of science or service of man brings you now from your favorite sequestered retreat whatever the occasion i am glad that we meet though i meant to be with you ere next summers sun  mr cycle i know my dear beril that you are not one whose welcome will suddenly sink into sorrow when i tell you i now visit london to borrow  mr beril if i am able to levy the sum you require the world can scarce give me a pleasure much higher than that of assisting a friend to whose mind i have infinite debts of a far deeper kind i can never forget what i owe to your care in the frenzy of desolate love and despair when my reason had yielded to passions wild strife your friendship alone reconciled me to life but tell me dear cycle what sum will suffice  mr cycle you must know i have lately been led to devise a scheme for the poor   mr beril my dear friend at your leisure i will hear your benevolent projects with pleasure but farther discourse you must let me prevent on the source of your wants till i know their extent for indeed i cannot rest till i am happily sure that whatever you wish i have means to procure  mr cycle not to keep you in doubt then my dear ardent friend two thousand i fancy will answer my end the one i am promised today from bijou for the other i own i have depended on you  mr beril and why not allow me to furnish the whole  poor bijou has a wife with no liberal soul if any demur in that quarter you see i entreat you to take all you wish for of me but of this more anon  here is careless returned  mr beril mr cycle and careless careless well my worthy philosopher ant you concerned to find our friend still unsupplyd with a wife thus formed as he is for the conjugal life as youre fond of new schemes for the good of the nation i will recommend one to your consideration to revive wedded love that old obsolete passion and bring honest hymen again into fashion  mr cycle in truth my dear tom i am quite of your mind there is no better scheme for the good of mankind and nothing i know that could give it more weight than the grace which our friend would bestow on that state  mr beril you are merry good friends  i subscribe to your joke  my gravitys fit for the conjugal yoke  careless i am serious indeed and have often declared that had i a sister for wedlock prepared of all men in the world if you would deign to embrace her in your arms it would make me most happy to place her but youre courted too much to be easily won he whom many are fond of can fix upon none  mr beril indeed my dear tom you are wrong on this theme  in return for a proof of your cordial esteem i will tell you the reason with frankness and truth why no nymph has supplied the lost love of my youth there is one whose mild virtue and elegant grace the dear girl i deplore in my heart might replace but my fortunes too humble for her rank of life though she may be your sister she cannot be my wife  careless would you wed lady frances  mr cycle the lady i have seen  she is like poor sophia in features and mien  mr beril you are right my dear friend  it was that very thought led my heart to attach itself more than it ought but my reason considers her rank and her station and forbids me to form any rash expectation nor would i attempt to engage her affection without the least hope of our happy connection  careless more honor than foresight you show by this strain be bold  there is nothing you may not attain  more of this when we meet  i must now say adieu  mr cycle so must i  for you know my appointment at two  mr beril but i hope my good friends you will both dine with me  mr cycle for myself i will return to you soon after three  careless i am grieved to refuse such a frank invitation but to tell you the truth  i have a kind assignation  mr beril love and pleasure attend you  careless dear beril adieu let us all meet tonight at the house of bijou exeunt the drawing room of mrs bijou mrs bijou speaking as she enters look over the staircase and tell me who knocks  joan entering mr varnish is come with a thing in a box  mrs bijou a thing in a box  youre a horrible goth but as youre to leave me i will stifle my wrath it is a picture you oaf  bid him bring it to me  exit joan some cabinet jewel i now hope to see this intelligent varnish my patronage courts and i get the first peep at whatever he imports  mrs bijou and mr varnish mrs bijou well varnish  mr varnish dear madam with most humble duty i have brought you a gem of unparagond beauty  mrs bijou good varnish what is it  mr varnish an exquisite titian you never saw one in such brilliant condition  mrs bijou and what is the subject  mr varnish opening the case now maam i will display it  here is a feast for the eye that knows how to survey it here is a joseph  i never saw his like in my life and pray maam observe what a potiphars wife how chaste the design yet the colors how warm what tints in each face and what life in each form pray madam remark how he struggles to fly we hear him exclaiming no mistress not i  mrs bijou it seems very fine and has striking expression  was it ever in any great persons possession  mr varnish not a soul here has seen it except a poor peer for whom it was bought  but alas twas too dear his steward my friend  but i must not be rash and betray a good earl with more gusto than cash  our lords are all poor and so ruined my trade is i should starve were it not for you welljudging ladies there is my old lady oglenud had she a peep would certainly buy it before she would sleep but having received many favors from you i made it a point you should have the first view  mrs bijou i thank you good varnish  but what is the price  mr varnish she would give me a thousand i know in a trice and buy some companions besides if i had em but i will leave it with you for eight hundred dear madam  mrs bijou eight hundred  sure varnish that sum is too much  mr varnish dear madam observe what a delicate touch see how finely it is pencild and what preservation there is not i know such a gem in the nation and italy has not a brighter i am sure the figures so glowing the story so pure  good ladies would never have wandering spouses if they would only hang subjects like this in their houses  mrs bijou i protest your remark is ingenious and new you have gusto in morals as well as virtu  mr varnish aside i have hopes that my hint will assist our transaction for the old dame is jealous they say to distraction  mrs bijou well i own mr varnish your picture is fine  if my husband is rich it shall quickly be mine here he comes to decide it  enter mr bijou mrs bijou my dear here is a fight you are luckily come to complete my delight mr varnish has been so exceedingly kind as he knows on a titian i have long set my mind to bring me the finest i ever surveyed and as we have often befriended his trade he offers to leave it a bargain with us  mr bijou its merit or price it is vain to discuss though the picture possesses so tempting an air at present my dear i have no money to spare  mrs bijou mr varnish pray step in the parlour below our final resolve you shall presently know  mr varnish dear madam for hours i will wait on your pleasure and i beg you will note all its beauties at leisure aside as he goes out now success to the sex  be this struggle more glorious may the joseph be kind and the lady victorious  mrs bijou my dearest you will not let the picture depart when you see it has taken such hold on my heart  i really cannot rest till a titian we have got that we may have something lord seewell has not and as we expect him you know here tonight i would show him this piece with triumphant delight  mr bijou i love to indulge all your wishes my dear but i am quite out of cash  mrs bijou nay bijou i am clear you have now all i want in your pocket  come come i know you went out to receive a large sum and still have it about you  i vow i will look  here it is  here are notes in this little red book takes out his pocketbook  mr bijou indeed i must beg you that book to release  mrs bijou here are ten i declare of an hundred apiece  i will take just enough and restore you the rest  mr bijou i cannot suffer this freedom my dear i protest for the notes are not mine they belong to a friend  mrs bijou to a friend  o i guess sir to whom you would lend your slylooking guest mr cycles the man i know he was here on a borrowing plan  throw your thousand away on a charity bubble and leave your poor wife to vexation and trouble  mr bijou nay my dear be not vexed  you have misunderstood the sum will be safe and the interest good  mrs bijou and what is the pitiful profit you will raise compared to the transport with which we should gaze on the picture my fondness would have you possess for reasons the purest that wife can profess unkind as you are  i have reasons above even profit and pleasure  the reasons of love it is my aim by this modest production of art to strengthen your virtue and chasten your heart if you daily survey an example so bright this model of continence ever in sight no naughty young women will tempt you to wander but your truth and your love will grow firmer and fonder  mr bijou what a tender idea  how virtuously kind what affection and taste by each other refined  mrs bijou but if for a poor and a foolish projector you can thwart a fond wife can afflict and neglect her  go go i shall weep while abroad you may roam that your charity has no beginning at home  mr bijou it begins and shall end there  i am melted my dear  you may keep all the notes  let me kiss off that tear  mrs bijou now again youre my own dear delightful bijou and the titian is mine and my love will be true exit in great haste mr bijou alone such virtuous endearments what heart could resist yet i fear by poor cycle this sum will be missed and what shall i say for the failure  in sooth i think twill be fairest to tell him the truth and sage as he is he perhaps too has felt that gold at the breath of a woman will melt  as i live here he is and i look rather small with a pocket so empty to answer his call  enter mr cycle mr bijou mr cycle youre come and i am really confused but i know the mischance will by you be excused in notes i had got you the thousand complete they were all in this pocket   mr cycle the thieves of the street have not picked it i hope in the bustle of strife  mr bijou it was picked i confess by the hand of my wife but for reasons so pure in so tender a mode   mr cycle i am happy the sum is so justly bestowed  mr bijou i know you will forgive when i come to explain  mr cycle dear bijou let me save you at once from that pain and assure you with truth that i now really come as ready to quit as to take up the sum since berils so kind that without my desire he has offered me all that my wants can require  mr bijou i protest i am glad you have found such a friend but if you hereafter should wish me to lend i beg you will call without scruple on me  your worthy friend beril tonight we shall see and seewell in gusto the first of our earls will be here with his daughters two delicate girls to prove my good friend your forgiveness is hearty let me hope you will kindly make one of the party  mr cycle most cheerfully  mr bijou well  i am grieved i must say that i cannot detain you to dinner today but to tell you the truth when for these gala nights my wife is preparing to show her fine sights she spends so much time in adjusting her shelves that we take a cold snap in the kitchen ourselves so i am sure you will excuse it  mr cycle your reason is strong and i am sorry my friend i have intruded so long  mr bijou we have time enough yet  do not hurry away  mr cycle it really grows late  mr bijou i will not press you to stay as at night over our concert you will come to preside  i am heartily glad all your wants are supplied  mr cycle indeed i believe you my honest bijou so till night fare you well  mr bijou my dear cycle adieu  end of act ii act iii scene i lord seewell and lady harriot lady harriot dear papa dont betray me  her delicate mind would be wounded i know and would think me unkind so far from allowing what now i impart she herself little knows the true state of her heart  lord seewell believe me my dear i with pleasure survey the sisterly fondness you warmly display but you who for others so sensibly feel may here be the dupe of affectionate zeal and i hope youre mistaken  lady harriot my dear sir observe you may trace her attachment in every nerve if i name mr beril in some idle tale poor fanny will blush and as often turn pale in his absence still more and more pensive she grows yet thinks not from whence her uneasiness flows and when he returns though her pleasure is meek yet the glow of content may be seen on her cheek and her heart as if fully consold by his sight appears to repose in a tranquil delight dear papa you will perceive if you will open your eyes that from none but herself she her love can disguise one other exception perhaps we may find as i think mr beril is equally blind and robbed like herself of the talent of seeing by that diffident love which denies its own being  lord seewell i hope this attachment which neither has shown exists my good girl in your fancy alone  lady harriot why so my dear sir  should it prove as you fear i hope dear papa that you will not be severe consider the delicate frame of my sister but i know you have a heart that can never resist her if you once clearly see she has fixed her affection though she own not her wishes for such a connection as you know that her natures so modest and meek she would die from concealment before she would speak i have strength to encounter the crosses of life and to make my part good as a daughter or wife but our gentle sweet frances is illformd to bear the undeserved load of vexation and care and therefore should wed unregardful of pelf a husband as tender and mild as herself  lord seewell your reasoning i think is not perfectly just in the kindness of beril perhaps i might trust but the motive you urge for this union my dear is what i confess would awaken my fear as you say your mild sister should never be harrassd by those various ills with which life is embarrassd i should guard her from all the vexations that wait on a liberal mind with a narrow estate and if beril had thoughts of becoming my son had i not more objections yet this must be one  lady harriot i will remove it my lord for indeed this is all as you think they will be pinched by an income too small you shall add to their fortune and large it will be two thirds of the portion you have destined for me  lord seewell dear harriot i am charmed with thy soul i confess you are a generous girl  to a noble excess  lady harriot to that name dear papa i have no title indeed as i only give up what i never can need in your house all my wants will i know be supplied and if i should leave it as carelesss bride the liberal heir of so large an estate will not grieve that my fortune has sunk in its weight or should my swain frown at the change in my purse he may even take old themis for better for worse for though i confess he has won my regard yet the knot of my love is not twisted so hard but twill slip in a moment if ever i see that he is rather more fond of my purse than of me  lord seewell it is a pity the friendly illusions of youth cannot instantly turn into substance and truth your affectionate fancy my dear is delighted with the dream of beholding two persons united whom you fondly suppose only formed for each other  lady harriot i should like mr beril i own for my brother because i am convinced that no mortal on earth in manners in temper in taste and in worth is formed so exactly to suit such a wife on their lasting attachment i would venture my life  lord seewell your warm heart my good girl your young judgment deceives and what the first wishes the second believes dear harriot to this fancied match there may be many bars which your eyes are unable to see a mistress concealed with a young little fry   lady harriot should an angel declare it the fact i would deny for had beril been loaded with such a connection in his eyes i had never perceived his affection but i will presently solve any doubts of this kind as i am soon to be told the true state of his mind for careless has promised   lord seewell o fie my dear fie your intemperate zeal has now risen too high i am really concerned at your great indiscretion  lady harriot nay but hear me my lord  i have dropped no expression no not one single hint that could truly discover why in such a research i commissioned my lover dont think dear papa i would my sister betray   enter a servant servant mr beril my lord sent this letter  lord seewell stay stay does any one wait for an answer below  servant no my lord the mans gone  lord seewell very well you may go  exit servant lady harriot should this be an offer  twould give me great pleasure but i fear he is too modest to take such a measure  dear papa does he venture on any advances  lord seewell there my dear  you will not find any mention of frances and i think by the note which to you i resign your conjectures are not so well founded as mine  lady harriot perusing the letter occasion for money  the statue to you  i am amazed  and can hardly believe it is true he never would part with so dear a possession but for some urgent reason  lord seewell you see his confession his strong call for money is frankly declared and i fear his small fortune is greatly impaired  lady harriot these tidings indeed give me real concern but the source of this step i will speedily learn careless soon will be here  i will make him discover and till we know all give no peace to my lover  but now my dear lord by this note you may find how the heart of my sister is really inclined i am convinced this will prove her affection is strong here she comes for the trial  pray see if i am wrong  lord seewell well my dear i will try by an innocent plot if your sister has really this passion or not  enter lady frances lord seewell dear fanny youre come our concern to partake for we both are much grieved for our friend berils sake  lady frances mr beril dear sir  is he hurt  is he killed  lord seewell no  with terrors too lively your bosom is filled my dear how you tremble  but i was to blame to raise this alarm in your delicate frame he is well but some crosses of fortune i fear make him sell what he justly confiderd so dear you will see by this letter  aside to lady harriot ah harriot it is so the excess of her fear from affection must flow  lady frances how painful to him must the exigence be which extorts from his hand the agreement i see how cruel for him to relinquish a treasure whence his elegant spirit derived so much pleasure but i trust dear papa that your generous mind will not now press the bargain he once has declined and scorning to profit by any distress will not catch at the gem he still ought to possess  lord seewell my dear can i now what i offered withhold and should i the statue no less would be sold  lady frances perhaps if you chose half its value to lend from so galling a sale you might rescue your friend  lord seewell i am pleased my dear girl with your spirit i own but these are bad times for a dangerous loan and to tell you the truth in this knotty affair i have just at this crisis no money to spare but i will frankly explain our finances to you and you shall instruct me in what i shall do  as i have seen that old fathers though reckoned most sage often injure a child by the frolicks of age that you may not suffer from follies like these i have just now consigned to the care of trustees all i have saved for you both  so if i prove unsteady you are safe  when you wed both your fortunes are ready  lady frances how kind my dear sir is whatever you do but no child was ever hurt by a parent like you  lady harriot i must smile dear papa at your terrors of slipping they who take such precautions are seldom found tripping but if in old age your philosophy varies i protest i will forgive you for any vagaries  lord seewell very well madam harriot remember your word i shall claim your indulgence if ever i am absurd but as what i have done our loose money secures i no longer can touch what i have firmly made yours  lady frances let the fortune of harriot be sacred i pray for not very distant is her wedding day but as i am convinced i shall not wed at all let my portion papa answer every call i must beg you to look on it still as your own and if it may serve for so timely a loan it cannot give me more joy whatsoever my station than by saving your friend from such mortification  lord seewell my dear girls you are both the delight of my life may each warmhearted daughter be blessed as a wife  what i said was but meant your kind spirit to try for the wants of our friend i can amply supply of esteem it will please me to give him a proof and preserve the fine statue still under his roof  enter a servant servant mr careless my lord  lady harriot now the whole i shall know going  lord seewell stay   servant he wishes to see lady harriot below  lord seewell being equally anxious this point to discover we will all my dear harriot attend on your lover exeunt scene the apartments of mrs bijou mr bijou where the deuce is my wife  all her rarities placed her apartments adjusted with exquisite taste some disaster has happened or she would be here where she ought to be waiting to welcome the peer and i fancy i heard her in anger below  enter mrs bijou in great agitation mr bijou what is the matter my love  mrs bijou o my dear such a blow i really had swoond if vexation and wrath had not quickened my spirits to scold at the goth that awkward old joan  an unmannerly minx has knocked off the nipple my dear from a sphinx and now on our chimney it cannot be placed with a wound so indelicate maimed and disgraced but i have happily got these two griffins of gold in the room of the sphinxes our candles to hold  mr bijou my dear the exchange is most lucky and right for a sphinx is an awkward dispenser of light but whether your griffins of gold or of copper a flame from his mouth is exceedingly proper  mrs bijou by your lessons my love i improve in virtu all the gusto i have i have gathered from you  i have fixed the great mummy my dear to the wall lest the pert lady harriot should give him a fall she would be glad to throw down my old king out of spite and i would not be vexed in our triumph tonight i know our new picture will stir up her gall and this titian will make us the envy of all my dear dont you think it looks well by this light  mr bijou the colors indeed are uncommonly bright  mrs bijou what a beautiful youth is this joseph  i swear i am more and more charmed with his delicate air i delight in him more since i have found dear bijou that in one of his features he is very like you  mr bijou where can you my dear any likeness suppose  mrs bijou i protest he has got the true turn of your nose not the aquiline curve but a little socratic and his eye flashes fire that is chastely ecstatic  there is a rap at our door and i hope my lords come if vexation and envy do not strike him dumb i think he will harangue like a critic of greece on the exquisite charms of this beautiful piece i long to behold how he is touched by the sight but i know that his envy will sink his delight the moment he sees it he will think his luck cruel in missing so precious a cabinet jewel  enter mr beril and mr cycle mr bijou dear cycle i take this exceedingly kind and i hope you have not left your cremona behind in your presence tonight i most truly rejoice and shall call for the aid of your hand and your voice as my wife gives a snug little concert below when you have seen what her upper apartments can show  mr cycle you may freely command me my friend as you please  mrs bijou youre a judge mr beril of treasures like these and i am eager to show you a titian that is new since we last had the joy of a visit from you  mr beril the story is told maam with striking expression  mrs bijou dont you envy my husband this brilliant possession i thought you would burst forth into rapturous praise but with no keen delight on this picture you gaze  mr beril to confess maam the truth i am a whimsical being and a subject like this i have no pleasure in seeing on your lovely sex it is a satire most bitter that ill nature may laugh at and levity titter but i am grieved when an artist has lavished his care on a story that seems a disgrace to the fair  mrs bijou our sexs chief luster i own it obscures but think what a lesson it offers to yours  enter lady harriot lady frances lord seewell and mr careless mr bijou my dear lord i this instant was wishing for you your voice is decisive in points of virtu and youre come in the moment to end an odd strife in a matter of taste about potiphars wife  should her story be painted  we want your decision and here is the picture that caused our division  lord seewell ha my poor old acquaintance  but how dear bijou how the deuce could this picture find favor with you i hope that rogue varnish has played you no trick  you have paid no great price   mrs bijou i am cut to the quick sure my lord you never looked on this picture before  lord seewell dear madam it is one that i turned out of door and as i may aid you to scape from a fraud i will proceed to inform you i bought it abroad to relieve the distress of an indigent youth who copied old masters with spirit and truth and when it came home as i valued it not my steward by chance this gay furniture got to a new house of his it has lately been carried and as your friend varnish his daughter has married i suppose the sly rogue by this picture has tried to increase the small fortune he gained with his bride search the garment of joseph you will find on its hem and within a dark fold the two letters t m  mrs bijou aye there is the mark  we are cheated we are plundered that infamous villain to ask me eight hundred  but the law shall restore it  mr bijou see mrs bijou see the fruits of my hasty indulgence to you  lord seewell cheer up my old friend  it is my wish that this night may be witness to nothing but peace and delight i will engage to make varnish your money restore and perhaps this adventure may save you much more all we old connoisseurs if the truth we would own have at times been outwitted with canvass or stone but here is one whose example our tribe now invites to correct our mistakes and improve our delights here is beril though blessed with a treasure most rare that with few works of art will admit of compare gives up the proud joys that on such wealth attend for the nobler delight of assisting a friend  mr beril my lord you amaze me how could you divine  o careless your zeal has betrayed my design  lord seewell you have fixed on the traitor yet are not aware that youre almost involved in a dangerous snare but i will show you this traitors accomplice my friend and tell you what mischief these plotters intend you must know tom and harriot in concert pursue their dark machinations against frances and you they have sworn you have a tender esteem for each other which you both have in modesty labored to smother if their charge can be proved i your freedom restrain and sentence you both to the conjugal chain  mr beril o my lord that i love lady frances is true yet i could not avow it to her or to you but to force my confession such means you employ i almost may call them the torture of joy i am overwhelmed with surprise with delight and with dread lest i falsely have heard the kind things you have said speak my dear lady frances my anguish relieve does this tumult of hope my wild fancy deceive  lady frances i so long have my fathers indulgence confessed that against his decrees i shall never protest  mr beril o how shall i thank thee dear pride of my life  lord seewell by cherishing still in the mind of your wife such generous feelings as you have displayed  from my hand my dear beril receive the kind maid your statue is not more indebted to art than she is to nature for molding her heart they both shall be yours both the statue and bride and the wants of your friend shall no less be supplied  being free from one modish and wealthwasting vice from those pests of our order the turf and the dice i enjoy my dear children the fortunate power of securing your bliss by an affluent dower your quiet shall never by your income be hurt which shall equal your wish though below your desert  mr beril of your kindness my lord i so feel the excess that my voice cannot speak what my heart would express  mr bijou i am charmed my dear lord by your choice of a son  lord seewell i know my old friend you will approve what i have done you and i dear bijou wanting proper correction have on vanity lavished the dues of affection we have both squandered cash on too many a whim but in taste let us take a new lesson from him and rate our improvements in real virtu by the generous acts he may teach us to do to remember this truth is the connoisseurs duty a benevolent deed is the essence of beauty  mr bijou i confess i too often have been vanitys fool but shall hope to grow wise my good lord in your school and as mirth should be coupled with wisdom i will go and see if the fiddles are ready below exit lord seewell tonight my dear madam you must not look grave though varnish has proved such an impudent knave i promise to make him your money refund  mrs bijou with surprise and vexation i almost was stunned but depending my lord on your friendly assistance i am ready to drive all chagrin to a distance and to share in the joy of our dear happy guests  mr beril what i owe to you careless this fair one attests and our sister i hope if i dare use the name from your friendship will judge of your loves ardent flame and shortning your rigorous term of probation now fill your kind heart with complete exultation  lady harriot the warm blaze of our joy i assure you dear brother with the cold damp of prudery i will not smother your friend has for you played so feeling a part i confess i am charmed with his spirit and heart as in law and long courtship he likes not to drudge i will make him at once my comptroller and judge  careless i with transport and pride the dear office embrace  lord seewell and long may you fill it with spirit and grace  my voice my dear careless confirms her election and i give her with joy to your tender direction for sealing dear tom you may fix your own day without dreading from law any irksome delay as your father and i have with friendly advances already adjusted your nuptial finances  mr bijou entering our musicians below are all ready my lord of pleasure you teach us to touch the true chord i have selected a few little pieces tonight that are suited i hope to the present delight  may we all think this day the best day of our life it will prove so i am sure both to me and my wife if a bargain should tempt us we will not be rash but remember the titian and pocket our cash to friendship and want all we can we will give and buy no more baubles as long as we live  lord russel a tragedy of three acts preface i have endeavored to delineate in the following drama an exact portrait of the noble personage whose name it bears as i believe that a more engaging model of public and private virtue can hardly be selected from the annals of any nation although the extreme mildness of his temper the simplicity of his manners and above all his unaffected piety are such qualities as are very rarely admitted in the formation of a tragic hero  to render my performance interesting to my country i have adhered as closely to our history as the nature of dramatic composition allowed me to do and in points where i have varied from historical truth such variations are i trust supported by dramatic probability  in the spirited and judicious introduction to the latelypublished letters of lady russel the testimony of different historians in collected concerning the sentiments of charles the second and his brother on the impending fate of lord russel  in the duke of monmouths journal it is said that the king told him he inclined to have saved the lord russel but was forced to consent to his death otherwise he must have broke with his brother the duke of york  kennet  the sentence just quoted is i hope a sufficient foundation for the conduct which i have assigned to charles whose character indeed was such that fiction can hardly impute to him any instance of irresolution duplicity and falsehood which the tenor of his life will not bring within the limits of theatrical credibility  the candid reader will readily allow the liberty i have taken in laying the scene in the tower after russels condemnation as it affords many advantages to the conduct of the play  in compliance with that respect which dramatic authors have lately paid to the clerical character i have not introduced either tillotson or burnet among the persons of the drama though the latter was so constant an attendant on the captivity of my hero an omission which i have in some degree supplied by the introduction of mr spencer a character drawn from the printed trial of lord russel where the name of that gentleman appears in the list of those who gave an honorable evidence in behalf of the noble prisoner  i have many obligations to the journal written by burnet at the request of lady russel which contains all the minute circumstances that occurred during the imprisonment and at the execution of her lord this very interesting and pathetic narrative is printed in the general dictionary under the article russel i have not only taken from it many of the sentiments which i have assigned to him in this tragedy but i have sometimes adopted the very words that were really uttered by lord russel and this i have done not only from an affectionate admiration of his character but from a despair of surpassing the elegant simplicity and the force of his expression  the offer relating to his escape so generously made and so nobly refused is a fact universally known and must render the names of cavendish and russel an honor to our country as long as magnanimity and friendship retain their just value in the estimation of mankind  persons of the drama king charles the second james duke of york earl of bedford lord russel lord cavendish mr spencer lieutenant of the tower lady russel lady margaret russel officers etc scene during the first act in bedford house and afterward in the tower lord russel act i scene i bedford and lady margaret russel lady margaret rest here my gentle father nor again expose your wearied age and wasted spirits to scenes of such dread influence to shake each fiber of a heart that feels like yours  i pray you rest with me  bedford my tender child thanks to thy filial aid my strength returns and my reviving soul has gathered force to bear the killing sight  it is true when first i saw my mild and unoffending son pride of my age and englands dear resource in these disastrous days when i beheld my blameless russel at that bar arraigned where only guilt and infamy should stand when i beheld each servile judge support a lawless jury basely framed against him indignant anguish robbed my wounded heart of vital energy quick from the court my hasty friends hurried my senseless frame to this our quiet home but since my daughter thy kind endearing cares have now restored me i will resume my station by thy brother in these distressful moments  to his side affection calls me and paternal duty  lady margaret forgive me that i dare to thwart your wish but from my generous brother i have received a kind injunction to detain your age from that afflicting scene he has engaged to tell us by repeated messengers each petty circumstance that passes there already from the number of his friends he has selected one to bring us tidings his faithful spencer comes  enter spencer bedford what from my son  the sentence is not passed  spencer no my dear lord england is yet unsullied with the stain that must disgrace her if the sword of justice turns to the murderous dagger of revenge to stab your virtuous son  by his request i come to soothe your anxious sufferings and to relate the process of a scene where he conjures you to appear no more  bedford what perjured slaves have they suborned against him how far has truth been wronged and law been tortured to frame those snares of legal death in which they labor to involve incautious virtue have they not dealt most hardly with my son  spencer he has experienced subtle cruelty from venal ruffians in the robes of justice but the base wrong his patient worth endures is the dark foil which gives the diamond luster when he requested aid for his defense his keen insidious foes who strongly feared some upright advocate might save their victim enjoined him to employ a servants hand there rose indeed a servant at his side most eager for the task but o what words can speak the fond surprise and thrilling anguish which shook the bosom of each sad spectator who in that servant saw his lovely wife the crowd with eyes bedimmd by starting tears of tenderest admiration gazed upon her and murmured kindest prayers as they beheld connubial love in that angelic form thus firmly yielding unexpected succor to virtue struggling in oppressions toils  bedford most excellent of women worthy offspring of my departed friend the good southampton if tyranny prevails against thy husband how shall the wretched bedfords feeble age support thy widowed heart i can no more than in strict fellowship of bitterest sorrow echo thy groans and mourn our mutual loss  lady margaret do not dear father do not yield so soon to comfortless despair  we yet may hope the radiant probity of russels life will dissipate each dark and dangerous cloud that perjured calumny can raise around him remember all the candor of his mind think how his temperate virtues have been praised by envys self how to the gaze of youth his conduct has been held up as a book in which all english eyes may read their duty and learn the fairest path to spotless honor  spencer if abject lawyers and a venal jury should violate the sanctity of justice by russels condemnation still his merits are engraved so deeply on the nations breast he stands so firm the idol of her love oppressions self will fear to execute the sentence of the prostituted law against a life so prized  bedford alas my friend when did a tyrant like vindictive york for it is the duke who thirsts for russels blood when did a spirit of that sullen temper impelled by rancorous hate by bigot rage and abject terror when did such a spirit respect the virtue nature made its foe and treacherous fortune gave it power to crush but tell me of the scene from whence you come say what has been alleged against my son i have been told the fierce and subtle jefferies the dukes base agent in this bloody business relies upon the evidence of howard as the sure instrument of russels death unprincipled he is and prone to utter what interest and fear may bid him swear what has he said or is he yet unsummond  spencer before i left your son the faithless howard began his artful tale but soon he falterd with feigned affliction of a dread event which suddenly was rumored through the court and struck the thronged assembly with such wonder malice stood mute and persecution paused fresh from the tower the tidings came that essex from terrors of that bar where russel stood had with rash violence rushed out of life and stained his desperate hands in his own blood  bedford it cannot be the firm the gallant essex could never end his being so ignobly and in the moment when his generous soul felt only for his friend his russels life yet wavering in the balance  spencer such my lord such is the comment of all honest hearts on this dark story  heaven reveal the murder and punish it though in the assassins veins the tainted stream of royal blood may flow  soon as the rumor reached your son he bade me attempt to penetrate this dark transaction and bring you the result of all i heard adding that in the instant of his doom he would dispatch to you the noble cavendish with tidings of his sentence  bedford ah my friend the fatal word that ends his blessed life has rung already in my tortured ear for i have seen the venal band suborned to purchase by the sacrifice of truth the blood of her mild champion there is his guilt it is that his pure and patriotic zeal guiding the voice of an enlightened senate has labored to preserve the throne of england from that bloodthirsty bigot at whose feet her laws now lie in hasty prostitution slaves to a tyrant yet uncrownd converted from sacred guards of slandered innocence into base engines of vindictive murder  lady margaret alas my father thou have judged too well thy dreadful presage is too soon confirmed behold the zealous cavendish he comes with no quick step of joyous exultation but in his agitated gesture shows a settled sorrow and a fierce despair  enter cavendish cavendish i come my lord the wretched messenger of that accursed event which my weak judgment not reaching the extent of human baseness had hastily pronounced beyond the line of possible injustice all the crimes that coward tyranny can wish committed shall now have credit  russel is condemned  lady margaret o mockery of justice  righteous heaven yet interpose to save him  bedford my kind friend thou but relatest what a fathers eye foresaw too clearly when i viewed the jury so justly challenged by my innocent son marshalled without the warrantry of law to ensnare his life  cavendish eternal infamy fall on the base assassins chiefly fall on those superior ministers of evil the treacherous guardians of our trampled laws who in the robes of heavens high delegates perform the work of hell from prostrate justice wrest her pure sword to stain it with the blood of her most faithful votary  lady margaret yet try try my dear father ere it prove too late by urgent intercessions to preserve him your friends are many and however inflamed by the vile arts of sanguinary york the king has still a tenderness of heart that may incline to spare my gentle brother  bedford alas my daughter cherish not too much a hope whose cruel failure will impart new poignancy to thy too keen affliction all the mild virtues which to thy pure sense plead for thy brothers safety in the ear of envious hate and terrified oppression cry loudly for his death  cavendish he shall not die what though the bloodhound jefferies has fastened his fangs upon him though the barbarous judges would make the temple of insulted law the slaughterhouse of tyranny  there yet are means to turn the sharpened axe aside and shield the life of their devoted victim  bedford what would thy dauntless zeal  cavendish your gentle son has such just credit with this injured nation for public virtue and designs exempt from every selfish bias of the soul thousands would throw into extremest hazard their fortunes and their being to preserve the dying martyr of defenseless freedom i hold it easy in the very hour oppression means to triumph in his blood with some selected horsemen to oerpower the slaves who guard him ere they reach the scaffold and bear him swiftly to a safe retreat applauding millions will assist his rescue and bless the efforts of his brave deliverers  bedford no cavendish by friendships holy ties that prompt thy generous purpose i conjure thee to think of it no farther  cavendish what my lord shall we look tamely on and by connivance be made a party in this legal murder  bedford dear ardent friend there are disastrous times and this is one of them when all the functions true courage is allowed to exercise are resignation and a brave endurance my word is given to thy kind thoughtful friend to check all desperate sallies of affliction all that the fond intemperance of love could hazard for his safety  cavendish generous russel by heaven it is happier far to share thy death than live to see our wretched country robbed of all her hopes in thy unequalled virtue  bedford to me much happier  to a fathers heart it would be consolation and delight to perish with his child but there are duties more painful to sustain than the short struggle that ends our mortal being  and to us these duties now belong  let us remember the trust that he bequeaths  his wife his children it is ours to live for them remember too his noble answer to the princely monmouth offering to share his prison and his fate did he not say it would embitter death to have his friends die with him  cavendish o my lord your sorrow is of pure and heavenly temper mine the fierce anguish of indignant frenzy pray pardon it  bedford pardon thee gallant spirit thou bright example of exalted friendship thou have my love my fondest admiration in my just heart thou rankest with my children and art the pillar now my russel falls that my weak age must cling to for support  cavendish in duty my dear lord though not in merit you may account me yours and pitying heaven may yet in mercy to a nations prayers spare to your virtuous age your worthier son i cannot bend my spirit to admit his fate inevitable gracious powers who watch over suffering virtue who inspire the prosperous deeds of chancedefying friendship assist my laboring and distracted brain whose faculties are on the rack to find expedients to preserve our countrys pride the friend and champion of her faith and freedom from the base stroke of tyrannous revenge  bedford vain are those anxious thoughts the vigilant eye of keen oppression will secure her victim the nerveless arm of childhood could as soon wrest from the tigers gripe his bleeding prey as we by violence deliver russel from the vindictive york  cavendish after a pause i thank thee heaven the bright idea is i feel from thee and it has chased the darkness of despair from my oerclouded mind  bedford what means thy ardour  cavendish good angels have suggested to my soul a project yet to save him  bedford name it name it  cavendish your pardon my dear lord  accept alone this firm assurance that my new design has naught of rash exertion to involve a single life in danger or if one it must be mine alone and in this crisis how gladly shall i yield my life for his and die triumphant in the blessed exchange exit lady margaret brave cavendish  he is gone  ye saints of heaven if friendship like your own deserves your care go ever with him and from all the perils that wait the noble selfneglecting spirit protect him and assist his godlike aim preserve this matchless pair of gallant friends and let them shine the ornament of earth  bedford thou prayst in vain dear child  this dauntless friend transcendent as he is in truth and honor can naught avail us he must prove the dupe of ardent passions and of sanguine virtue if there is a ray of glimmering hope that yet may faintly lead us through this night of horror it cannot rise from any bright endowments in those we love but rather from the vice the abject vice that glares in our oppressors our tyrants are necessitous and thirst for gold as keenly as for innocent blood kind fortune happily for this great emergence has made me master of no common wealth and this with lucky art distributed among the needy minions of the king may purchase still our russels forfeit life  come my dear child retire we to consult on this our sole resource thou will not scruple to meet and to embrace a noble poverty if thy lost portion can redeem thy brother  lady margaret blessed be thy happiest thought my tender father all wealth all good is centered in his safety and witness heaven my heart would freely bear all the loathed hardships of the houseless vagrant and think them blessings if they aught conduced to rescue russel from a traitors death  end of act i act ii scene i lord and lady russel in prison a table with papers pen and ink lady russel must i entreat in vain  alas my russel where is thy sweet compliancy of soul that made till now thy rachels voice a stranger to rude and irksome importunity has life so little to engage thy wishes thou will not ask to live  russel can thou my love by so unkind a question can thou give such hard construction to thy russels thoughts where is there one inhabitant of earth if not thy husband who has every cause to cherish his existence  gracious power whose wisdom regulates the lot of mortals i feel and with devoutest gratitude bless thee for signal bounties to thy servant but most for this thy best and dearest gift this lovely virtuous woman whom to part with is now my hardest trial but from thee dread arbiter of every human scene however strange to mans contracted sense this trial comes o strengthen us to bear it with tender fortitude and meek obedience  lady russel it is our duty still and heaven enjoins it to make all blameless efforts to preserve a life so precious if thy rigid honor in pity both to me and to thy children will stoop to write one line of supplication to the allpowerful york he will obtain thy instant pardon from the pliant king  russel thou know not the inexorable hate of that bloodthirsty spirit  it has pleased the author of my life to let the rage of ruthless bigotry prevail against it a band of venal or misguided men have doomed me to the scaffold on the plea that i have plotted to destroy my sovereign though heaven and thou who know all my soul see the base falsehood of the bloody charge but to the voice of law however tortured i owe a prompt obedience naught remains but that i meet the stroke of stern oppression as suits the votary of public virtue i must not sully by a base submission a name yet spotless the sole legacy it is allowed me to bequeath my children  lady russel dear as i hold thy life which is in truth my only anchor in this sea of troubles believe me russel i would rather yield without a struggle yield that precious life to persecutions stroke rather than lead if aught could lead thy clear and resolute virtue to one base act of weakness and dishonor  russel alas my love the cloud of thy affliction has dimmed thy quick discernment but the paper which thy fond care now urges me to write would darken all the story of my life i must not in that storys closing leaf where fortitude should fix the seal of honor mar the fair record with a fearsul blot  lady russel dear russel exercise thy purer judgment these are not scruples of thy manly reason but niceties of proud fantastic honor of honor jealous to a vain excess how can the measure that my love solicits involve thee in disgrace without abasement can injured innocence not say to power give me the life of which iniquity has made thy voice the arbiter  russel thou know dear inmate of my secret soul kind prompter of my best thoughts it has been long the aim of my past life to win my countrys love not by the popular arts of vain ambition which nature never formed me to possess but by incessant vigilance to shield our faith and freedom by an ardent wish to prove that patriot virtue the stale jest of servile spirits as an empty name is an existing vigorous principle in minds of english temper i have failed in the prime object that my soul pursued to save our pure religion and our laws from bigotrys encroachment and i lose my life endangered by that noble conflict but i have gained and let me still preserve it the kind esteem of this enlightened nation this i must forfeit forfeit all the praise and influence of no inglorious life if i become an abject suppliant to that fierce zealot from whose iron rod i strove to shelter this devoted land  lady russel no russel the corrupted lips of faction are prone to evil but the voice of ages the sentence of the world is firmly just and by that sentence thou art sure to stand high on the list of those bright characters immortalized with pure idolatry by truth and freedom men whose very name is sweetest music to the ear of nature if in a future age when we are dust thy virtues can be questioned it must be by sycophants who flattering royalty with slanderous surmises would degrade each just antagonist of lawless power or by those yet more abject enemies those skeptics of a cold sarcastic spirit who judging from their own contracted hearts possess no confidence in human virtue  russel affection overrates thy russels merit but let this fond opinion of his fame preclude thy vain request which being granted would but afflict thy love consider well how it would wound thy generous pride to hear thy lord had stained the life thou deemst so glorious by an ignoble eagerness to live  lady russel believe me russel it would wound me more to think that deaf to all my just entreaties my husband careless of his orphan children with sullen dignity threw life away rather than stoop to sue for the remission of his unrighteous doom  russel alas my love should i implicitly pursue the dictates of all thy fond solicitude such conduct would but provoke the insult of our foes and could avail thee nothing  lady russel yes my russel should the relentless york reject thy prayer in those sad years of bitterness and anguish when if the will of heaven is fixed to part us my widowed soul with unabating sorrow must dwell upon thy image and for ever repass in thought these agonizing scenes it will afford me then a faint relief to think my active love in this distress omitted nothing that had dutys sanction to snatch thee from the scaffold  russel lovely suppliant thy virtuous tenderness has melted me and though i could not purchase it by guilt thy peace is dearer to my heart than glory thou shall not say thy russel ever refused one prayer of thine  give me again the pen my weak disdain rejected russel writes lady russel bless thy kindness bless thy prevailing love for i perceive how hardly it has struggled to obtain this triumph over brave indignant pride abhorring even the shadow of disgrace  o thou allpowerful spirit who can make the meanest implements of mortal use thy ministers of safety or destruction grant that this lovedirected pen may prove an instrument of gracious preservation guide thou my russels hand  into this paper pour words of heavenly potency to change the bloody wish of blinded superstition and melt vindictive rancour into mercy  enter spencer lady russel kind spencer opportunely art thou come to cheer my russels solitary hour while my keen hopes to win by supplication from potent york the pardon of my lord force me to leave him  spencer ill befall the heart that melts not at the voice of such a suppliant

frail and yielding resolution his pliancy i know will meet with blame but those who have a heart to feel thy merits will blush at their quick censure and recall it  lady russel now let me russel from thy prison fly like the exploring dove whose eager wing flew from the ark to visit it again with blessed assurance of subsiding storms exit russel my worthy kinsman when my voice is silenced as soon

lord may save us from that scene of private woe and national distress  russel believe me though i stoop to ask for life i ask not thinking to obtain my suit but from the tender wish to mitigate the future sufferings of a faithful mourner by this compliance with her fondest prayer  spencer the touching eloquence of her affliction joined to the memory of her fathers merit that honored servant of the crown southampton may wrest your pardon from the savage heart of sullen york  russel impossible my friend my lifes the prey that his infatiate rage has keenly chased  he holds it in his toils and every prospect of escape is closed  spencer yet think my lord that other means of safety   russel no spencer i have thought i trust not vainly of the chief object that my mind must dwell on how to sustain the trying part to which the will of heaven appoints me how to meet the sudden stroke of ignominious death as may become the man whose life has won from this brave land observance and regard  o spencer when the wearied eye surveys the gloomy face of earth the laws abuse and freedom sinking under savage power the wreck of public virtue the base arts and treachery of her apostate sons with all the countless ills that in her train a blind and barbarous superstition brings when these are present to the guiltless mind it seems a fair and blessed fate to fly from this dark den of misery and vice to the bright presence of divine perfection  spencer yet of how pure a nature are those blessings this earth would furnish to your rescued virtue  russel o gentle kinsman in my softer hours my heart still clings to those attractive objects of tenderest attachment for this heart was framed by nature for the sweet enjoyment of social duties and domestic bliss i will avow to thee for thy mild spirit can sympathize in every true distress that when i think to what excess of anguish i leave the worthiest and most tender wife that with endearing innocence and love ever blessed a husband the forbidden tear starts from my heart perforce my frame is chilled and shudders at the sharp divorce of steel so soon to fall upon our chaste affection  spencer yet may ye live a blessing to each other and give a bright example to mankind that happiness abides with virtuous love  life stands within your choice  the king who knows with what a fond respect and confidence the generous people lean to the opinion of men so rooted in their hearts as you are courts your acceptance of immediate pardon if you will but acknowledge in his presence that you believe no subject has a right however tempted to resist the throne  russel have any of my friends supposed that russel could buy existence at a price like this  spencer the worthy churchmen who in this vile prison have been your kind assiduous attendants build on this ground strong hopes  they have obtained the sanction of your venerable father to argue with you this important question believing they may lead your candid mind to terms which in their cool considerate judgment have the clear warrantry of truth and reason  russel good men they are an honor to the church for signal harmony of faith and practice but happily cramped by pietys nice scruples their minds have not expanded to embrace the mighty cause of freedom  o my friend i want the spiritstirring faculty of eloquence to range in bright array the potent claims of nature and enlist in her pure service all the noble passions that give distinction to the life of man but gracious heaven endowed me with a heart to act the upright virtuous citizen and meet the axe much rather than betray the charterd rights of this my native land  spencer are you my lord so settled in your thoughts on this nice question that no arguments may shake the airy fabric of opinion  russel good spencer thou have known me many years and for a man of plain and simple reason which clearly tells me that the kings position once granted sinks the freeborn sons of england to the tame vassals of a turkish despot my mind can frame no image of a state that laws have limited without a right to guard those limitations and my conscience that higher sovereign who challenges my first obedience in all points of moment will not permit me by a different language to purchase life from the deluded king  spencer with painful admiration i have heard the steady dictates of your patriot virtue that will with mingled agony and joy confirm the presage of your noble father however he listens with attentive fondness to all that friendly zeal suggests to save you he knows and glories in your firm adherence to the dear rights of england nor can wish though with the sanction of such friends to see you exchange it for the lure of forfeit life  russel although i trust he fully knows that mind which his fond cares have strengthened and enriched with its best powers of manly resolution yet as illgrounded and distressing doubts are natural infirmities of age at times perchance my venerable father may fear lest the approach of violent death should with disgraceful pliancy infect the spirit of his son  i therefore pray thee return assure him that our pious friends must lose their wellmeant labor in debate my minds unchangeable and gracious heaven as my dark fate draws nearer gives my soul new strength to triumph over its shadowy terrors assure the tender bedford i shall meet the hour of execution as his love must wish with that sedate and cheerful brow which suits the guiltless son of such a father  spencer my lord i will religiously obey you and on the instant as i now

our inviolate friendship and by ties yet stronger on thy heart thy wife and children swear thou will grant me one request  russel dear cavendish thou would engage me in some hasty business pregnant with danger to thy generous self else had thy frank affection never devised a bond so needless to the mind which holds requests from thee as sacred as the laws of faith and honor  but explain thy purpose  cavendish here in this happy hour of privacy let us exchange our habits so may thou muffling thy face as in the veil of sorrow pass unsuspected and elude the guard two of our trusty friends

the baffled malice of thy foes  russel brave cavendish it is hard to quit a world that furnishes such friends yet easier this than by a hasty flight from death to hazard a life i hold still dearer than my own no i can never expose thy generous virtue to that base fate thou urgest me to shun  cavendish they dare not strike at me their venal juries have past no treacherous verdict on my head  russel the eminence of thy exalted virtue would make thee their sure victim and perchance the latent ruffians such i think there are who robbed the injured world of gallant essex would double in the mind of their base master their murderous merits by dispatching thee  cavendish there is no peril but admit the worst i want not strength to grapple with such villains and wear a dagger here to punish them  russel friend of my inmost soul thy generous offer yet closer draws those honorable bands that in our mortal pilgrimage have bound us firm to each other and defying death will prove to us i trust in brighter scenes a lasting unextinguishable source of pure ambition and angelic joy but the kind purpose of thy noble zeal thy russel must reject granting thy plan free from all perils to thy precious life and it abounds with many most alarming flight howsoeer effected would produce dishonor to thy friend as wanting trust in spotless innocence or manly courage  cavendish the tongue of slander dares not to impeach thy fortitude  russel yet more for i will lay my secret soul before thee  thou have seen how far thy friendship and my rachels love have power to make life lovely in my sight and my kind father whose declining age  but i must pause and check this natural burst of tender gratitude  thou fully know all the strong ties that chain my heart to earth yet i perceive these adamantine links touched without doubt by heavenly influence seem to give way and my aspiring soul begins to covet that ignoble fate which shows so horrible in vulgar eyes  cavendish and can thou wish to leave us  russel o my friend among the strongest passions of my heart perhaps more forcible than love and friendship from childhood i have cherished an attachment to my brave country  though a transient cloud now hovers over her my prophetic eyes perceive that she is destined to emerge to happiness and glory thou shall live dear noble friend to view and to assist this blessed event  the

radiant image of thy signal virtues as a pure charm of potency to guard the lowliest mind from every servile thought  hark sure i heard the hated voice of york dares he insult imprisoned innocence by venturing to approach it may we not move farther off from that detested sound it shakes my tortured brain and almost tempts me to rush at once and from the coward breast of that apostate tear the

intercession with the king to save an innocent and injured subject  york rise madam  tell your lord that i forgive him his bold seditious practices to bar my just succession to the english throne but

fruitless labor in opposing that stroke of justice which we all lament but which the safety of the realm requires exit lady russel thou ruthless hypocrite thy sullen cruelty converts the swelling tear of supplication to fiery scorn and my prophetic spirit foresees an hour in which thy abject soul with more than womanish terror shall implore that succor thy hard heart denies to me  lieutenant o lady

heavenly impulse  never was monarch more loudly called by equity and truth to the exertion of his noblest power the privilege to spare  so may my soul find grace before the judgment seat of heaven as it is sure my russel never harbored a single thought of blood or aught of evil against the life and welfare of his king nay more my liege i know his gentle virtue has often joined in painful fellowship with bold bad men whom his pure heart abhorred to lead your child the young and princely monmouth from the dark paths of their pernicious counsel  king your lord is happy in an advocate of most persuasive powers i wish but dare not to stop the course of the offended law against the man for whom your tender virtues plead with such fervency  my kingdoms peace demands the dread completion

urgent prayer and change her husbands death to banishment  york by heaven it must not be  what when the law that faithful guardian of your sacred life has past its sentence on your prostrate foe for base conspiracy and bloody treason false to yourself shall you in weak compassion to an insinuating womans tears thus rescue and empower rebellions idol to form a second more successful plot  king

good spencer on a princes word whose resolution is the plaint slave of artifice and importunity reason disdains to take into account a poor possession held on such a tenure i can believe the king inclines to save me but know how soon his unresisting spirit yields to the voice of that vindictive zeal which with incessant and increasing fury now clamours for my blood  i therefore hold it the part of prudence to leave naught undone which on a sudden summons to the block i yet might wish but want the time to do  spencer useless though noble may this caution prove  russel be that as heaven thinks best  since busy rumor in his blind haste to catch a fleeting image is apt to form a faithless portraiture of public characters i here my friend have as a legacy bequeathed the world a true

which in his hour of heavenly audit must prove the ground of his eternal doom here is my latest task peruse this letter which on my death the king is to receive  spencer it breathes that gentle magnanimity for which your life is noted  russel at the time the solemn time when the calm soul prepares for quick departure to that world of peace where enmity and anger cannot dwell it is surely right to close our earthly feuds and part from all men in pure charity though i have never sinned against my sovereign by any deed or thought that meant him ill in many vain and inconsiderate hours i yet have sported with his name and frailties so idly that i hold it decent now to crave his pardon for such levities and in the gentlest language i can use to intimate that dying thus unjustly i pardon all promoters of my death the highest as the lowest  spencer cease my lord to dwell on dying thoughts with eyes that speak of life and comfort your deliverer comes to restore you to domestic

 in vain thy suppliant father had offered to exchange his envied treasures for that superior wealth which in his heart outweighs all opulence  sullen revenge subduing avarice with scorn rejected thy proffered ransom blank despair had seized me but in the hour when human efforts failed this pitying seraph in a womans form brings heavenly aid and turns a tyrants heart to bless the trembling world with russels life  russel dear objects of my love i pray you check this eagerness of joy for o i feel that it must prove to you the treacherous herald of heavier grief  your kind exulting hope is a brief day of summer out of season that promising to end stern winters tyranny does but supply to his suspended breath the power to pierce more deeply  pray be cautioned and with just foresight arm yourselves against the certain rigor of the inclement time  bedford has not the king relented and engaged his royal word to save and set thee free  russel alas my father had his word possessed that steadfast sanctity which should belong to the pure breath of princes this fair isle who trusted in his faith had never known her present depth of national disgrace have we not seen our sovereigns

hopeless effort more to stop the vengeance of insatiate york exit russel go ye kind beings for the busy love that finds employment though in fruitless labor lightens the pressure of the grief it bears  thou see good spencer that my tender wife is now supported by her zeal to save me but on my death the quickness of her spirit will work like latent fire within her heart a slow consumer of her wasting frame it is her fate that wounds me  for my own is but the shortest and most easy passage from earthly trouble to celestial joy it is the fancy of the vulgar mind that foolishly arrays the dreaded form of sudden death in visionary horrors believe me spencer in the month just past the transient sickness of my lovely boy pressed harder on my heart and more disturbed the native calmness of my even spirit than my near prospect of the ready scaffold  spencer yet my dear lord i view with awful wonder the firm serenity of soul you show on this hard test of human fortitude  russel reflect my friend that my imprisonment has made the fearful image of my fate familiar to my thought it is surprise that gives to death his most appalling power to the clear eye of guiltless contemplation that gloomy spectre grows a gorgeous herald whose trumpet sounds the triumph of the soul and speaks its entrance on the stage of glory how grand how pregnant with delight and wonder must be the change of scene from earth to heaven  what if a mortal who had passed his days in the dim cavern of a noxious mine worn with hard toil where healthannoying vapors vexed and confounded his imperfect sense if such a mortal suddenly were laid on the bright summit of a lofty hill to taste the balmy sweetness of the morn and for the first time see the rising sun array this fair and smiling earth in all the radiant loveliness of form and color  o spencer if i felt for self alone this period deemed the saddest of my life could only fill my mind with heavenly joy but for my mourning friends and most for

dictate of thy virtue may heaven to punish me take from my soul the dear remembrance of our amity  russel it is well  thy promise ends my only fear farewell my gallant generous bosomfriend farewell  still think me living in my children still in their little frames embrace thy russel russel departs but after a short pause returns russel one thing there is that yet i wish to say  cavendish o speak for every accent of thy voice pierces my breast and all thy words shall live graven as laws on my retentive heart  russel friend of my youth i have for many years held a prime place within thy noble bosom and studied all its rich and rare perfections the radiant virtues in fair order marshalled beneath the guidance of presiding honor i have seen thee full of high and glorious thoughts toward this world but pardon if i say that thy brave mind to me has seemed to fail in homage to the sovereignty of heaven  cavendish thou godlike monitor in such a moment to feel for my offenses  russel do not wonder at the calm temper of thy dying friend use thy own spotless and exalted spirit to commune more with heaven and thou will find the blessed habit of considering that we are acting in our makers eye arms the unshrinking soul for every scene weigh well the powers of simple piety make it the keystone in thy arch of virtue and it will keep that graceful fabric firm though all the storms of fortune burst upon it yet farther would i press this counsel to thee but time forbids me  once again farewell long be thy life and crowned with every blessing till in its peaceful close we meet in heaven exit cavendish smiling he is gone to triumph over oppression by brave endurance while my voice suspended by anguish love and wonder wanted power to breathe one last adieu  while yet he lives i cannot bear to be divided from him no i will follow  i will fondly gaze on the dear model of consummate virtue even to his latest moment i will see his heavenly patience meet the murderous axe i will behold his death though in the sight my tortured eyestrings burst with agony exit enter york with an officer york at length i have prevailed  the traitor dies spite of the weakness in my wavering brother this is indeed an hour of exultation to all the friends of our true ancient faith this public fall of her arch enemy is a sure omen that she soon will rise in all her gorgeous pomp of elder time and from the turbulence of heresy clear this recovered isle  officer her fairest hope lives in the spirit of your highness zeal  york yet this insidious russel is so dear to the deluded vulgar i still dread a struggle for his rescue  say my friend have thou arrangd our private partisans at proper intervals to guard the scaffold and keep the gaping multitude in awe those rusty knaves who in this factious land are ever ready to engage in riot and hazard life for every bold impostor or subtle demagogue who raves on freedom  officer fear not my lord the voice of loud sedition will hardly dare to breathe a single murmur upon her idols fall  york and have thou settled a clear succession of immediate signals which may as russel drops transport to me a quick assurance that his head is off  officer your highness in the minute of its fall will be apprizd it is fallen by the sound of fifes now stationd in this armoury  york it is well my trusty friend i thank thy care i cannot rest till i am satisfied the heretic has lost all power to hurt us  bedford entering in extreme haste yet pardon yet preserve him princely york i know thy word is able to suspend the lifted axe  york away thou weak old man  bedford spurn not my prayer its object is thy peace not less than mine  by all thy trembling hopes of future greatness and secure dominion haste thou to snatch him from impending fate if in these moments of extreme despair thy pity saves my son thou will appear as the bright delegate of heavenly mercy the fifes sound york away the sound thou hear is a signal that the just rigor of the law has fallen upon his finished life  bedford o my lost child  but he is happy in the fellowship of saints who to his higher purity pay blessed homage  his delivered spirit gives a new impulse to my lifeless heart his sufferings all are ended but this hour which sees them close for thee relentless york beholds a train of dark calamities the spreading offspring of thy cruelty rise into being  york go retire old man and heal thy shattered mind i have not leisure to hear the ravings of distracted age  exit york with the officer bedford it is not the frenzy of a weak old man that now proclaims thy fate inhuman bigot rushing through guiltless blood to thy destruction it is the spirit of my angel son he for a moment leaves the heavenly choir whose ready harps shall usher him to glory to drown a fathers anguish in this vision of soulpossessing prescience  yes it is he who now presents to my astonished eye these crowding images  i see thee now insatiate york invested with that crown for which thy barbarous ambition panted i see it fall from thy unkingly head shaking with fears vile palsy  in thy terror i see thee sue imperious abject spirit to the insulted bedford but in vain thy power that highest trust of heaven abused passes from thee the cruel bloodstained tyrant wanders a wretched exile this wronged island emerges from the darkness of oppression  hail scenes of triumph to all english hearts hail thou bright festival of settled freedom i see and bless thy firm establishment and hark the justice of a patriot king uniting with a grateful nations voice turns the base sentence of my murdered russel to a fair record of soulsoothing honor and hails me glorious in my matchless son  enter cavendish cavendish it is past my lord i have beheld him seal a life of virtue with a death of glory  bedford and thou can tell me dying he appeared even as he lived a model to mankind  cavendish never did martyr with more lovely grace part from a world unworthy to possess him to the surrounding crowd he mildly spoke a few short words of pardon to his foes with fervent benediction to his country commending to the hearts of all who heard him a love of peace and purified religion then with a cheerful readiness invited the stroke of death i saw the unhappy man who with a trembling arm lifted the axe over his unshaken victim in his tremor measuring the neck to strike his even blow i saw him raze the skin and in that moment the cheek of russel held its native hue unblancd with fear  it was a sight to turn the grief of friendship to idolatry and your paternal sorrow into pride  bedford dear cavendish i will not wound his spirit his gallant spirit by unmanly mourning no i have pride such pride as heaven approves nor would i now exchange my murdered russel for any living son in christendom  cavendish bless this fond firmness of the english father it penetrates and chears my aching heart  come my dear lord let us retire from hence to soothe yet fonder sorrow weeping now in scenes which he has hallowed by his care in his past days of social happiness there let us sit and still with sad delight talk over his numerous virtues they shall be the theme of every tongue and ages hence still fix the love of every english spirit then if the voice of learning would compare what rich antiquity and modern time have seen of public virtue while the hand of glory justly in her balance throws the gathered worthies of the pagan world england shall boast her own superior wealth and poise the rival scale with russels name  the mausoleum a comedy of three acts in rhyme persons of the drama carey jasper rumble facil trope gerrard the butler lady sophia sentiment widow of sir simon sentiment a wealthy merchant frances sister to jasper and a relation of the deceased sir simon mrs rumble servants etc scene the magnificent villa of lady sophia the mausoleum act i scene i carey and frances frances pray temper with patience your warm indignation and treat with more mercy my tender relation because with your passions her whims interfere to her foibles dear carey youre grossly severe  carey my patience sweet frances i own is exhausted she will wed the first suitor by whom she is accosted though in widowhoods dainty vagaries her pride forbids her fair cousin to shine as a bride and keeps us my love from that altar away where hymen with justiceupbraids our delay but in noble contempt of your unsettled dower let us seize on the bliss that is placed in our power and if such artful vanities yield her relief leave my lady to play off fresh fountains of grief while we my sweet girl pass our happier youth in delights that are hallowed by nature and truth though my income is small with your prudent direction dear fanny   frances i am pleased with this proof of affection yet before we our union dear carey complete as your love is so ardent  let mine be discreet no honest return of regard should i feel could i suffer your heart in its generous zeal to abandon a portion your bride should obtain and hazard by hurry what patience will gain it is unlucky my cousin sir simon forgot to specify what he designed as my lot but i know this omission by which i am left at her ladyships mercy of fortune bereft was the work of old vellum whose foresight and skill were employed for himself when he made the knights will yet her ladyship says that my cousin told her the sum that he meant upon me to confer and though she delays from a delicate whim lest our marriage should seem disrespectful to him   carey good god my dear fanny how can you defend her to refinement and faith she is an empty pretender have not twelve months elapsed from sir simons interment yet her sorrow still bubbles in ludicrous ferment though the farce of her grief as our friends have all said is addressed to the living much more than the dead and her vanity means though she prizes not pelf to keep you unmarried and marry herself  frances indeed you mistake all her harmless intentions she will certainly give me the fortune she mentions i know her kind heart and its pure inclination  carey say rather we know her absurd affectation and as for your portion my dear i as soon shall expect an estate to drop out of the moon as to see you receive from my lady a shilling allowing indeed that her heart may be willing she soon will have nothing i fear to bestow so profuse is she grown in her whimsical woe on the new mausoleum what sums does she waste that fantastical fabric of barbarous taste where all decorations that art can devise to adorn the proud tombs of the valiant and wise are mixed over the bones of a simple old cit who displayed not a sparkle of valor or wit who though rich passed i think with small comfort through life a mere slave to the whims of his highblooded wife  frances that preposterous vault i have viewed with concern and have cried and have laughed over sir simons rich urn but at length having studied her ladyships trim and loving her virtue in spite of her whim i have a scheme that i think with success will be crowned on this folly itself her correction to found by indulging her foible that foible to banish and make all her mournful absurdity vanish  carey to your judgment dear fanny i often submit and much could i hope from your goodness and wit yet i think you cannot make in her youths giddy season such a vain wanton widow a creature of reason  frances you judges of nature and lords of creation however you pretend to profound speculation are exceedingly apt your wise selves to deceive in the judgments you pass on the daughters of eve and most when you reckon in every transaction one indelicate foible their sole spring of action my lady sophia you greatly mistake by nature she is neither a prude nor a rake at present i own she appears too demure but though her hearts tender her bosom is pure to a strong understanding she makes no pretense but has many mild virtues and does not want sense one foible alone has oerclouded her mind the foible of seeming supremely refined but if i succeed this slight fault she will mend and you will find her a worthy agreeable friend  carey you may say of her purity what you think fit but her case one specific alone will admit believe me whenever a young widows so prim and by quaint affectation so cramped in each limb a new husband alone by his pliant embrace can restore her starched form to its natural grace is this my fair quack the new nostrum you have got  frances indeed you shall not hear any part of my plot till i know its success  carey ah my dear i am afraid this is some coy device my request to evade and to keep the wished day of our wedding still distant  frances no in truth by the aid of a secret assistant i have a plan of great moment in high agitation which may happily end all our various vexation allow me three days for its perfect digestion and if in that time you will ask me no question i promise thenceforth without murmur or strife to obey your commands for the rest of my life  carey i gladly subscribe to this bargain of bliss so allow me to seal the kind bond with a kiss remember three days i cannot add a day more and shall fancy those three in duration threescore  frances o they will pass very quick  much amused you will be with the three rival bards whom today we shall see to whom my sad cousin obliged me to write for sepulchral inscriptions in praise of her knight they have sent each an epitaph hither before em and are coming themselves with all solemn decorum as each without contest expects here the laurel on her ladyships judgment they will probably quarrel as you know the whole group you must wait on the choir to soothe the irascible sons of the lyre  carey as to facil and trope if they are hurt i will engage that one glance of your eyes will extinguish their rage you will find them two cheerful and goodhumored lads and whether their pegasus gallops or pads it will please me i own if her ladyships fancies may tend to recruit their declining finances but for splenetic rumble who grandly absurd never speaks without using a sixfooted word i care not how much he is mortified here  frances but the length of his words hits her ladyships ear  carey his stiff phrases indeed may accord with her sorrow yet his spleen will insult her ere this time tomorrow for often he will call with quaint arrogant vanity every head but his own the abode of inanity because a great authors defects he has caught he vainly pretends to his vigor of thought though on similar grounds he as well might suppose that because some dark spots may be seen on his nose his face has the luster and force of the sun  frances in our chorus of bards i am glad he is one for i am curious i own the strange elf to survey though i am rather afraid of his wife who they say reads all the rough verses her husband has penned till she stuns every ear she can tempt to attend she is to come with her poet  carey i fancy they are here for i think i have the hum of his rhymes in my ear  frances no no it is her ladyship mightily smitten with the highsounding epitaph rumble has written  enter lady sophia reading lady sophia this doleful domicile of dust contains sir simon sentiments inert remains though deaths cold stroke infrigidate his frame commerce resounds his emporetic name ah my friends here is verse truly grand and pathetic how exceedingly fine is the word emporetic  why carey you seem quite untouched by its beauty of friendship i fear you forget the last duty you two giddy creatures though both tenderhearted think more of yourselves than of my dear departed  carey as your ladyship chooses to press me so hard i confess though his memory still i regard that my thoughts from sir simon will frequently roam and i hope when you have decked his funereal dome your ladyships mind may by natures direction assume a more lively and cheerful complexion that you will mix once again   lady sophia never carey no never no time from his grave my devotion shall sever in my eye the fond tear of remembrance shall swim and each sigh of my soul shall be sacred to him  carey consider dear madam that custom and reason prescribe to our sorrows a natural season you have mourned like a model of conjugal truth now attend to the claims of your beauty and youth in the bloom of your graces   lady sophia hold hold you wild thing in your fancy i find gross ideas will spring it is the fault of you men  ere i chastend his mind my sir simon himself to that failing inclined but i taught him to change the loose laugh of futility for the sweet melting tear of refined sensibility till through his mild frame such pure tenderness ran  to such delicate softness i brought the dear man  he would weep over the withering leaf of a rose and smile at the thorn though it wounded his nose  ah my gentle sir simon  frances indeed he was such that your thoughts cannot dwell on his image too much  lady sophia your soothing kind sympathy charms me my dear i now trust you will wait till the end of next year nor with hymens festivity gross and indecent profane our chaste sorrow so graceful and recent  carey aside to frances how can you so flatter her cursed affectation between you i am really half mad with vexation  lady sophia as you my good girl with such feeling attend when over the dear tomb of sir simon i bend that your thoughts may not roam when our duty we pay to that most precious piece of inanimate clay that you may not omit over his ashes to sigh in considering what weddingcloaths you must buy i have determined my dear as i think it your due to resign all my colored apparel to you to wear it again i indeed am unable and on earth while i linger my garb shall be sable  speaking to a servant behind the scene jenny bring in the chest that i bid you prepare  frances aside to carey what do you think of this singular present  carey o rare her crisis is coming without much delay there might have been doubts had she fixed upon gray but a vow to wear black all the rest of her life is a strong indication she will soon be a wife  two servants bring in a large chest lady sophia to frances i have told you my dear that refined in my joy the array of affection i never could destroy these are garments unsoild that i beg you to take thus preserved for the conquest they helped me to make in the sweet days of courtship these garments i wore vain memorials of pleasure that now is no more of those dear days of triumph you will now see the trophy when sir simon first called me angelical sophy  the fond recollection subdues my soft breast  frances dear madam forbear then to open the chest  lady sophia no no my good girl i will show you the whole and how colors expressed various shades in my soul in soft variegation i vied with the dove and revealed by my dress the gradations of love here is first a cold brown  in this gown i was nice and repelled my warm swain with the chillness of ice but growing more soft in this azure attire i allowed him with hope to enliven desire in this pale lilach lutestring he found me relent and this rosecolourd silk was the blush of consent o i never shall forget   gerrard entering would your ladyship choose to receive mr rumble  carey the bard and his muse  lady sophia no not for the wealth that is below the chaste moon till i meet all the bards in the sable saloon by his sudden arrival i am sadly confounded and should faint if he saw me with colors surrounded to miss jaspers apartment away with this chest  dear frances and carey pray wait on my guest till my poor shattered nerves are a little composed and the freshbleeding wound of my bosom is closed stay gerrard  if cards should be called for tonight place the new japannd tables alone in my sight for the pool of quadrille set the blackbugle dish and remember you bring us the ebony fish exeunt lady sophia and gerrard frances what the deuce shall i do with the wife of the poet she may ruin my scheme if she happen to know it she may pry   carey never fear it i will venture a wager that the rhymes of her husband will fully engage her you have seen a proud bantam crow over a pen where a small egg has dropped from his favorite hen he crows and he flutters and struts round the yard so engrossed by her joy is the wife of a bard and by similar bustle attention she begs and crows over her partners poetical eggs but here come little partlet and old chanticleer  enter mr and mrs rumble carey mr rumble i am happy in seeing you here mrs rumble  miss jasper  you know maam her brother  and you ladies will soon be well known to each other  mr rumble though we meet in the house of refined lamentation in your presence i feel sir some exhilaration since i in this spot as a stranger appear i rejoice in a friend who domesticates here my lady is lodged in a sumptuous mansion and i am pleased with her parks evanescent expansion as my wife has a taste for the grand and stupendous i am glad i complied with her wish to attend us  miss jasper you have had maam i hope an agreeable ride our prospects are pleasant on every side and our roads are so good   mrs rumble that you will wonder to learn we were stopped on our way by an odd overturn  miss jasper indeed you surprise me i hope that no harm has ensued from the accident save your alarm  but how could it happen  mrs rumble sometimes on the road my dear mr rumble composes an ode for he says in such motion his fancy shines most and all true lyric poets you know travel post but a chaiseboy alas is a sad ignoramus and the poor honest booby whose blunder oercame us mistook a pindarical ejaculation for a horrible vulgar profane execration and turning to stare at my dear mr rumble drove against a steep hillock which gave us a tumble  miss jasper a most cruel event whence i fear we may lose the unfortunate fruit of the terrified muse twas indeed most unlucky  mrs rumble dear maam not at all such a genius is not to be crushed by a fall the accident brightened his fancy and on it he gallantly gave me an amorous sonnet as i know you love verse   mr rumble mrs rumble i vow this display of my trifles i cannot allow you for ever mistake to my endless vexation gay levitys sparkle for wits coruscation  mrs rumble ah you dear modest man in a napkin you would hide the talent my love must contemplate with pride as miss jasper i am sure is a lady of taste she shall see some sweet things that i packed up in haste a few satires and odes  takes out an enormous pocketbook stuffed with papers mr rumble as you dread my displeasure put up that red volume  mrs rumble what bury my treasure indeed i must read one sublime composition  mr rumble mrs rumble the part of a wife is submission  silly woman to whom for my sins i am yoked with pulverized gravel you almost are choked and fatigued with vehicular dilaceration you would murder my verses by rough recitation  mrs rumble no indeed do but hear me one stanza rehearse it is my favorite ode  mr rumble as you grow so perverse to preserve my own temper from exacerbation i must thus stop your organs of vociferation lays his hand on her lips mrs rumble well my dear i defer it to some fitter time and i kiss the sweet hand that has written such rhyme  miss jasper your connubial obedience dear maam i admire but i am sure your fatigues some refreshment require  give me leave to attend you  mrs rumble it gives me concern to trouble you maam but i hope to return your obliging attention so kind and polite by a peep at a satire which never saw the light  exit miss jasper with mrs rumble carey mr rumble youre blessed in an excellent wife that superlative prize in the lottry of life the vow of the altar she rises above and adds admiration to duty and love  mr rumble my wife has i think the right feminine nerve her sex was created to wonder and serve as their minds have from nature no ponderous powers they have nothing to do but to venerate ours  carey o fie can you estimate woman so low to our fair female authors pray think what we owe  mr rumble i cannot read one sir without oscitation they dont understand antithetic vibration their ideas have nothing of height and profundity their conceptions want vigor their periods rotundity their truth is too stale or too feeble their fiction and i cannot endure their anomalous diction but enough of these garrulous wasters of ink  her ladyship likes my inscription i think that lugubrious poem no critic shall garble and i trust you can show it me graven on marble  carey it would please me to give you that pleasure dear sir but in truth on this point there is a little demur her ladyship means to consult on the case  mr rumble what sir is my poem exposed to disgrace her critical quacks does this woman engage to slash my sound verse with empirical rage  carey believe me good sir all the homage that is due to poetical genius she offers to you but her ladyships love for sir simon is such she thinks that he cannot be honored too much and to give all his virtues their due celebration she from diverse poetical pens of our nation has a cargo of epitaphs  mr rumble hah is it so are there rivals to shoot in apollos strong bow this should have been told me before  but no matter my concurrents perhaps may more lavishly flatter yet in funeral song they cannot equal my tone where pope has miscarried i triumph alone  pray who are these bards that with me are to cope  carey i think youre acquainted with facil and trope  mr rumble what facil whose verse is the thread of tenuity that fellow distinguished by flippant fatuity who nonsense and rhyme can incessantly mingle a poet  if poetrys only a jingle  carey poor facil wants force yet may frequently please by a light airy mixture of mirth and of ease but tropes lofty muse has a higher pretension  mr rumble sir trope is a rhymer devoid of invention who talks in a high strutting style of the stars and the eagle of jove and the chariot of mars and pompously tells in elaborate lines that now the moon glistens and now the sun shines  carey how severe my good friend are you bards to each other yet if each would indulgently look on a brother for your general honor   mr rumble i cannot agree that these fellows have aught homogeneous with me to contend with such scribblers i deem a disgrace and my dignity bids me abandon the place with her ladyships judgment i mean not to quarrel but shall leave her to crown any monkey with laurel  carey mr rumble in points so exceedingly nice i do not presume to obtrude my advice but allow me to mention before you depart what may tend to encourage your liberal art sir simon you know had a passion for fame and left a large sum to eternize his name by some structure of note yet he never said what so a grand mausoleum is raised on this spot at so vast an expense that my lady i find has surpast what the knight for the building designed the superfluous cost be it great as it may from her own private purse she designs to defray though an annual fund by the will is adjusted with the guidance of which she is also entrusted but from this as i hear she has formed an intention to give the best epitaphwriter a pension  mr rumble has she so  it is a gracious effulgent design i protest of her judgment i highly opine her face has been chiefly the subject of praise but a splendour of intellect now she displays i cannot abruptly depart from a scene whose mistress discovers the mind of a queen nor rudely desert though my time is precarious a lady whose graces are so multifarious but pray lest some puppy should here circumvent me to her ladyship cannot you directly present me though i fear since my fall i am hardly so clean as a bard should be seen by a female maecenas  carey never fear  in your coat there is not so much dust as to blind the bright eye that to merit is just if you will step in this room which is called the apollo and wait a few minutes i will speedily follow and acquaint you how soon we may hope for admission  my lady loves form in her present condition to amuse yourself there you will however be able for you will find all the epitaphs ranged on the table  mr rumble are they so  it is well  i indeed love to slash an inane poetasters incongruous trash exit carey there i will venture to leave the old cynical rumble the prey he has seized to growl over and mumble if this bard whom my lady regards as her darling has infused in his brothers his talent of snarling i think she will find little room to admire the harmony formed by her lyrical choir  but lo the kind muse an example now sends that two mortals at once may be poets and friends  enter facil and trope carey my dear lads of parnassus youre welcome together i am glad you associate like birds of a feather that fools may not cry every bard hates a brother and poets like pike are the prey of each other how fare ye my friends have you prosperd of late i hope each has raised his parnassian estate in our last conversation i heard ye lament that your farms on the mountain produced a low rent  facil in truth it is a niggardly soil at the best as i and my brother can truly attest but with hopes of a new golden era my friend on your patroness here we are come to attend to encourage the arts she has spirit and sense and we are told my dear carey her wealth is immense  trope in fortune and soul she is a queen it is agreed and of genius as fond as christina the swede for the publics dull taste she we trust will console us and make our poor helicon rich as pactolus  facil perhaps my dear carey we owe to your care the favor of this truly liberal fair you are doubtless apprizd that my lady requires   carey i know she has paid due respect to your lyres yet indeed on that title no thanks can i claim youre indebted alone to your common friend fame her ladyship knows with what spirit you write and has begged your two muses to honor her knight and i trust to your mutual advantage and joy she will reward the rare talents she wished to employ but be not too sanguine  i know how you bards build the fabric of hope like a castle of cards enter nous our good lady is odd in her taste though her mind is no doubt with munificence graced perhaps to one bard she will be lavishly kind and appear to the other as utterly blind then let each be prepared  facil so we are my good friend and by mutual support shall each other defend to tell you a secret we both wrote in haste and strangers alike to her ladyships taste but agreed as our purses are equally low to divide what on either she deigns to bestow  carey the compact is friendly i wish from my heart that all who pursue the poetical art would learn from you two their mean rage to suppress and not rave at the sight of a rivals success  facil there indeed they may copy from trope and from me from envy thank heaven we are happily free we rally each other as much as we please  i laugh at his figures  he laughs at my ease yet with rancor we never try each other to hit but value benevolence far above wit the art we still dote on has ruined us both yet to quit the deceiver we are equally loath from commerce and law we were led to retire by the splendid illusions that wait on the lyre and though each has obtained a fair portion of praise we have no golden fruit in our chaplet of bays still we look without spleen on our gains and our losses each endeared to the other by similar crosses  carey in truth my dear bards your good humor is rare youre philosophers both and a singular pair with what excellent temper i have heard you rehearse a malicious burlesque of your innocent verse  facil o with me it is a rule not to quarrel with those who attack what i scribble in rhyme or in prose to skirmish with you how unjust should i be if perchance of my verses you dont think with me when to tell you the truth i am so various an elf i have twenty opinions about them myself  carey what an honest confession  facil it is perfectly true yet my works i must own i too rarely review and too quick in their birth are the brats of my brain my muse is no parent inured to long pain who dandles a rickety chit while it lives and loves it the more for the trouble it gives she with lively dispatch like a provident mother soon as one child is born thinks of rearing another  but enough of a jade that is merely ideal let us talk of a female kind lovely and real an inspirer of something much sweeter than verse and i hope with a few thousand pounds in her purse i allude my good friend to miss jasper your flame but perhaps she no longer is known by that name and has wisely exchanged it for carey  carey not so the day or our wedding you will certainly know as i hope that your muse will the altar attend with a rapturous ode on the bliss of your friend  facil i accept the gay office with infinite glee  but at present i hope the fair nymph we shall see trope and i were the intimate friends of her brother what a genius was he  i never knew such another at school we first saw him his talent display i remember he modeled our figures in clay the trade of a sculptor we thought not his fate but supposed he would have half of sir simons estate  carey so he would had not vellums more provident care when he made the knights will named himself as his heir my lady indeed has the rents for her life but to vellum yields half if again she is a wife and if without issue her ladyship dies all this ample estate is old latitats prize  facil and what says poor jasper that spirited lad faith i think such a will might have driven him mad though engaged by his art he i am sure must be nettled but in russia they say he is happily settled  carey when a generous mind has embraced a fine art with fortunes vain gifts it can readily part from the worlds dirty cares it detaches itself to contend for a prize far superior to pelf and looks with contempt i am sure that you feel it upon hearthardning gold and the villains who steal it such a mind from his childhood your friend has possessed and in russia i hear he is busy and blessed for a patroness there of imperial spirit the munificent catherine honors his merit  facil i protest in the different realms of the earth there is no friend like woman to genius and worth  trope i wish you and i may a catherine find in the widow whose knight in our verse is enshrined  facil you perhaps my dear carey can tell us some news has her ladyship told you her thoughts of our muse  carey one thing my good friends i can tell you at present but i fear you will not think it exceedingly pleasant yet it is certainly fit you should instantly know it and indeed emulation inspirits a poet nay look not so grave  it is a rival  that is all a candidate come at her ladyships call  facil a rival who is it  trope a rival pray who  carey one i will venture to say fully known to you two a bard whose pretensions are not very humble  facil you surely dont mean the pedantical rumble  carey even so that longwinded loud stentor of song and the ladies all think that his language is strong  trope it is as strong and as knotty as hercules club and as rough as the roll of the old cynics tub  carey hush hush  in this chamber the bear is enclosed growling over the epitaphs you have composed  facil is he so  introduce us  i long to partake in the courteous remarks that his candor will make  carey o if such is your wish to our guest i will present you but i fancy his comments will quickly content you  facil as for me i defy him to give me vexation and trope will delight in some retaliation  end of act i act ii scene i miss jasper and gerrard miss jasper pray watch for my brother and bring him to me and let no one good gerrard my visitor see on your faithful prudence i solely rely we are undone if our guests should his person espy from all but ourselves we must keep him unknown and if seen he must pass for a friend of your own i depend on your prudence  gerrard dear miss never fear to do him any good i would watch for a year heaven knows i have prayed for him early and late since the old lawyer robbed him of this fine estate and would give all i am worth could i get him his due  miss jasper honest gerrard i know we have a good friend in you but look out for my brother  he will want your assistance  gerrard i think i shall know him at half a miles distance  miss jasper he will be here ere you stir  prithee run to the gate  gerrard dear miss you forget i am past sixtyeight but i will make all the haste that i can for your sake and i will pray for you both at each step that i take exit miss jasper that is a worthy old creature though rather too flow he is trusty and will not betray us i know but though he is secure i still shudder to think how my hopes in a moment to nothing may sink as the crisis comes on in a hazardous scheme with what infinite terrors the fancy will teem  in my hopes of the match i was sanguine and hearty but i now have my fears in regard to each party should my gentleman turn out too squeamish and coy how vain the kind art i have deigned to employ should my lady show familypride at this season i have depended in vain upon nature and reason i have studied her well and i clearly descry she is destined again to the conjugal tie in spite of the whims false refinement has taught her she is honest dame natures benevolent daughter though a truly good creature in virtue so strong she would not for the world do a thing she thinks wrong yet of such yielding wax her soft bosom is formed it will melt in a moment if properly warmed provided her fancy affectedly nice can delude her kind heart with some dainty device some delicate plea for becoming a wife to the youth who conjures her to bless him for life on this i have founded my whimsical plan in hopes of producing this fortunate man my brother i know has a passion for her and she soon to all men would his person prefer but in my rapid project he will not be steady unless i persuade him she loves him already for men rarely know though of knowledge they are vain by a wellmanagd minute how much they may gain and should he detect the kind art i employ farewell to my hopes of their conjugal joy  i yesterday thought that my plan could not fail now i think twill be mavelous should it prevail  but away cruel fears hence ye painful alarms i behold my dear brother restored to my arms  enter jasper jasper heaven bless thee dear girl  you have got me once more in spite of my vow not to visit this shore and i joyfully fly with affections quick pace to enfold thy kind heart in a brothers embrace with that in my grasp i true opulence feel and my wealth in this casket no lawyer can steal  miss jasper if love and esteem may be reckoned as treasure you indeed my dear brother are rich above measure o how have i longed all your feelings to learn how ardently prayed for your speedy return how often accused your indignant delay what a million of things had i ready to say what questions to ask  and yet now you are come the confusion of joy has almost made me dumb  jasper my tender good girl  i perceive you retain all your lively sensations of pleasure and pain  but these tears will relieve you  dont check them my dear it is a tribute my heart is inclined to revere all flattering language i prize them above and hold them the truest expression of love and indeed when i think what distress and regret have harrassd your sensible mind since we met when i think how from sordid selfinterest free you forget your own wrongs in attention to me i feel tears of gratitude ready to start and confess my dear sister the pride of my heart  miss jasper yet for life you could talk of deserting this sister  jasper but you see when she pleaded i could not resist her  when i first was informed of old vellums vile fraud in my rage i determined on living abroad for russia you know i departed from rome however my dear you may safely presume such an absence from you i could never endure had you not brought me back by a different lure and my friends of the law with your wishes conspired to make me return with the haste you desired as they give me some hopes of soon changing our fate and regaining from vellum the pilferd estate  but how fares my dear widow whose partial affection seems kindled by some friendly angels direction to redress half our wrongs and defeat the old thief who imposed on sir simons too simple belief a rascal to feign a regard for my fame and steal my estate not to injure my name i thought not my cousin so easy a fool how the deuce could old vellum so make him his tool for the knight on this plea signed his will when in health not to spoil a great artist by giving me wealth  but where is my kind widow  i long to express   miss jasper you must pardon a little demureness in dress nor expect her though you to all men she prefers to fly into your arms  jasper no let me fly to here is  miss jasper not so fast my dear brother you surely forget by what vigilant enemies we are beset should vellum whose spies are now under this roof and against whose vile art no affection is proof should he get the least hint of my ladys attachment he would rage like the wolf in that newpainted hatchment your mutual regard he would set at defiance and move earth and hell to prevent your alliance  jasper would he so  by my faith as the widows so kind i care not what mischiefs may lurk in his mind not a legion of imps by a lawyer instructed shall mar the sweet business her heart has conducted  but has she quite hid her connubial design has the rogue no surmise she will shortly be mine  miss jasper no not any  jasper well managed my dear fairy elf  miss jasper to say truth it is a secret not known to herself  jasper to herself  am i dupd then  miss jasper dear brother be cool  jasper have you sent for me home but to make me a fool  miss jasper no indeed but to make you most happy for lifc and give you a lovely and excellent wife in so serious a point could you think that i jested  have you purchased the license my letter requested  jasper here it is  and our folly will finely expose if the fair one escapes whom this chain should enclose  miss jasper implicitly trust to my care as your guide and ere midnight perhaps you may clasp a kind bride  jasper you teaze me dear girl with much whimsical pain but i beg that you will clearly these riddles explain i fear you have formed some nonsensical plot has the widow declared she will have me or not  miss jasper dear brother indulge me with patient attention and our true situation i will honestly mention but however my project may strike you at first into rage and despair do not hastily burst to be bold in such points is in truth to be wise and a widows a fort to be won by surprise  jasper so she has not engaged then to give me her hand  miss jasper have patience  her state you shall soon understand that she loves you i know and with innocent art i have cherished the passion still hid in her heart for she fancies good creature that safe from loves flashes she is devoted for life to sir simons cold ashes  you know she affects to be highly refined and a project i have built on this cast of her mind which if you will obey me i will venture my life like a stroke of true magic will make her your wife and before any soul can suspect our intention  jasper well my girl and pray what is your magic invention  miss jasper you must know she believes that you only return to oblige her by gracing sir simons rich urn she thinks the czarina on this one condition that you travel incog gives you her kind permission and her ladyships mind i have filled with these notions as they form an excuse for concealing your motions so she hopes from your hand with the highest delight to behold a fine statue of her noble knight now sir simon and you have been thought much alike and to make the resemblance more forcibly strike i mean to array you her heart to entrap in his blue satin nightgown and red velvet cap the dress which to humor his elegant fair the courteous old cit was contented to wear  jasper and is this your fine plan you impertinent jade dress me up as the punch of a dull masquerade  miss jasper have patience  my scheme must surprise you no doubt yet i think you will applaud if you hear it throughout and if you have spirit i know twill succeed  jasper to play the dead man  a fine project indeed  miss jasper nay but hear me  your actions i will not control  jasper well you have made me an idiot so tell me the whole  miss jasper no i have taught you to make yourself all you desire if you will but restrain this intemperate fire  come attend to my plot  you fond creatures shall meet in the new mausoleum that pensive retreat on a pedestal there you your person must place to show how a statue the building may grace to behold you so fixed i will my lady prepare she will be struck in surveying your figure and air she with tender surprise will your features review and fancy she sees her sir simon in you then spring from your pedestal seize her sweet charms and swear as you fold her soft heart in your arms you are like her sir simon in soul as in form that your heart toward her is as tenderly warm you may add  in a vision he bade you direct her to take you for life as her legal protector and to make her chaste love to his memory known choose his living resemblance before one of stone  there is a promising scheme for a widows relief  jasper set woman to woman as thief to catch thief  i confess in your plot there is spirit and soul on her governing foible you have grounded the whole and rapid success might attend on your plan but for puppetshew courtship i am not the man i possess not the face that your stratagem needs for so bold an attack on a widow in weeds and i feel some reluctance in truth at my heart to such an appearance of fraudulent art  miss jasper away my dear brother with scruples like these of the amorous heart doubts a common disease but one that my counsels may speedily cure you both love each other  your meaning is pure  the gentle sophia you will tenderly treat her form is enchanting her temper is sweet and if your odd courtship appears like a jest in your marriage i am sure you will be equally blessed without it indeed our fair friend is undone for old vellum intends that the coxcomb his son when he comes from his travels  but somebodys near a sudden surprise in this quarter i fear let us haste to my room  i must school you above and you will act as i wish if you have one spark of love if i find you have not  i shall honestly say you must give up the part that i meant you to play exeunt hastily enter lady sophia with papers in her hand attended by carey lady sophia unfold the great doors of the sable saloon the scene opens and discovers a large apartment with a black velvet pavilion at the thoughts of this business i am ready to swoon but you my good carey will lessen my pain and aid my weak nerves the sad scene to sustain as my gentleman usher you will kindly attend and bring the three bards to an audience my friend i shall sit to receive them beneath my pavilion to repay their sweet verse i could wish for a million but i think that each bard will be pleased with his lot so bring them  stay carey one thing i have forgot but now it is too late for my purpose i fear i meant to have ordered the horns to be here with a little soft music these rites to begin and to sound a dead march as the poets walk in  carey dear madam their verses will want no such aid let me haste to present them  fantastical jade aside as he goes out  lady sophia seating herself under the pavilion and looking over the papers in her hand from these epitaphs thus i may happily borrow the parts that most flatter my delicate sorrow and while in one piece i harmoniously blend four lines from each poem these authors have penned i am pleased that on them no vexation can fall that i shall not hurt one and must gratify all  but the geniuses come  enter carey introducing rumble facil and trope who advance with profound bows toward the pavilion lady sophia ye kind friends to my grief who employ your fine parts in afflictions relief my mournful distress by your talents ye calm and my dear lost sir simon your verses embalm as i ought let me first mr rumble address what i owe to you sir i can never express yet the force of your pen let my gratitude mention  rumble aside i perceive she has sense  and i am sure of the pension  lady sophia in my choice i have done equal justice i hope to you mr facil  and you mr trope from your various productions twelve verses i choose and i blend the rich sweets of each different muse thus a wreath is completed to deck the dear shrine and to honor sir simon three poets combine here you will see how i have managed this nice combination distributing a paper to each  rumble i protest i cannot suffer this conglomeration of marble and brick this anomalous jumble  carey in a whisper to rumble remember the pension my good mr rumble  rumble sir my admurmurations shall loudly be heard iye a right to exclaim that my ladys absurd in her cap she as well might conquassate together the down of green geese and an ostrichs feather  facil i think mr rumble my lady displays the most dexterous art in uniting our lays your elder muse first like the wagon of night moves solemn and grand  like the chariot of light airy trope then advances with different pace  and like twilight between you i find my right place  rumble remember young man while this splendour you brag on that rich ponderosity rides in a wagon  but i will not descend to a vile contestation our minds were not fashioned for reciprocation my lady i pardon on this one condition that she quickly proceeds to a decomposition she may choose of our epitaphs which she thinks fit but a mixture so monstrous i will not admit she as well with her scissars might hastily snip from different portraits the eye nose and lip and think that her needle accomplished great matters by compacting a face of the discrepant tatters  lady sophia o mercy  dear sir pray this business adjust and do not disturb my sir simons calm dust if a squabble concerning his tomb you excite i am sure his dear spirit will haunt us tonight i feel in this terror new anguish arise and a fresh flood of sorrow swells into my eyes  carey aside to rumble mr rumble i fear if you do not submit my lady will have an hysterical fit  rumble sir in points that my credit and honor involve a few drops of salt water will not melt my resolve  facil aside to carey i protest though fantastic i own she appears i can not bear the sight of such beauty in tears and as i perceive she is really distressed i will at once put an end to the strife in her breast  to lady sophia dear madam that you on this point may not grieve and your delicate mind from all doubt to relieve let me and my friend our pretensions resign and leave one single bard to embellish the shrine we beg that alone mr rumble may bear the honor he thinks that we ought not to share  carey no no my good friend youre too modest indeed i have a plan for ye all that i trust will succeed  lady sophia what is it good carey i wish to pursue some happy expedient suggested by you  carey at mecca dear maam seven poems we are told over the prophets rich tomb were suspended in gold now let three worthy bards each an elegy write and suspend all their works over the tomb of your knight  lady sophia o charming  your thought is enchantingly fine  mr rumble i hope you applaud his design  rumble from this proposition i will not revolt though my young rivals pride it may serve to exalt of the honor you do them i will not be jealous but i will teach the vain youths to revere an entellus  lady sophia well i hope what has past will be kindly forgot and that now you will all deign to compose on the spot  i commend my good carey the bards to your care entertain them i beg with the choicest of fare and as it grows late you must leave me my friend in afflictions chaste rites my lone evening to spend  farewell worthy sirs  you now leave me to sorrow but i hope to attend you at dinner tomorrow  carey come my friends now permit me to be your director  mr rumble rack punch is your genuine nectar as the nights coming on i will prepare a rich bowl that shall give to you poets fresh vigor of soul for the muse with newforce like the flyingfish springs when she stoops for the purpose of wetting her wings  exit carey with rumble facil and trope lady sophia alone i am glad we have soothed mr rumbles chagrin  enter miss jasper lady sophia o my dear with the poets i have had such a scene they have shaken my nerves to that cruel degree i shall quiver all night like a poor aspentree  miss jasper my tidings new life in your heart will infuse the young sculptors arrived  lady sophia that indeed is sweet news then in effigy soon i shall clasp my dear knight is the block too provided and perfectly white of the true parian marble i trust he will mold the statue my bosom so pants to behold  miss jasper i assure you the business engages his heart and you will see a fine work from his exquisite art to my brother already the vault i have shown and of attitudes there he is thinking alone as i mean to conceal his arrival at home we went by the pass under ground to the dome  lady sophia we will join him dear fanny and go the same way i long at the tomb my devotions to pay to hear how your brothers fine fancy and skill with new decorations the structure may fill and to see in what posture the statue may stand  miss jasper let us go  he will be happy to kiss your fair hand exeunt  the scene changes to the inside of a grand mausoleum on one side a large oblong tomb of white marble on the other some sleps ascending from a subterraneous passage jasper appears in the gown and cap of sir simon jasper what a part has my sister induced me to play i wish from the scene i could well slip away i shall never succeed  surely love was never made since the days of old jove in such odd masquerade i scarce know myself in this whimsical plight but i fancy i look very like the old knight yet if you my sweet widow incline to my plan this image will beat the original man  gad i hope she will not fancy i am really his ghost  but i hear them below  i must leap to my post jasper places himself in a striking attitude on the top of the marble tomb while lady sophia and miss jasper ascend the steps from the subterranean passage lady sophia starting o mercy  what phantom amazes my sight has the grave to my love given back the dear knight it is himself i perceive  it is no fanciful dream o i faint   falls on the arm of miss jasper jasper flies to lady sophia in great agitation and speaks at the same time to miss jasper see the end of your pitiful scheme  as i live her fond fears have suspended her breath and i have frightened the delicate creature to death  miss jasper never fear simple charles you will not lose your wife  you understand marble much better than life  lady sophia reviving where am i  o pray sir are you mr jasper  miss jasper whispering her brother in your arms you poor simpleton hasten to clasp her  if you stand so confounded how can you succeed i shall presently think you a statue indeed  jasper to lady sophia how fare you dear lady  it is true that you see your devoted affectionate jasper in me of your beauty my heart has long felt the effect in chaste admiration and tender respect no licentious design with my passion could mingle but the very first moment i heard you were single all my foreign pursuits i resolved to disclaim for your smiles are to me more attractive than fame though the wintry ocean was roaring between us my love with fond hope in the favor of venus bade me cross the rough deep and disdaining control fly with speed to the distant delight of my soul  lady sophia how like my sir simon in person and air the mild turn of his lip and his eye to a hair  jasper o think not the likeness lies only in feature i have his soul heart and passious my sweet lovely creature in me then o fancy you see him restored and with fondness connubial be loved and adored instead of a senseless cold image of stone make his living resemblance for ever your own a soft statue of wax in your hand i will prove you shall mold me to all the chaste fancies of love  lady sophia i protest your idea is sweetly refined to delight the pure warmth of a delicate mind i could wish such a likeness to keep in my view and for ever contemplate sir simon in you but though the mere offspring of tender sensation such a wish would be reckoned a gross inclination and i am sure i should die at that horrid suggestion  jasper embracing her dear angel no tongue shall thy purity question  lady sophia o charles to my bosom you give such a flutter all my reasons against you i want breath to utter  jasper by the eloquent glance of that dear melting eye with my delicate purpose i know you will comply  miss jasper hush hush i have heard some one step near the door pray be still till the coast i can clearly explore  lady sophia o my stars should my people discover at home that by night i converse with a man in this dome   miss jasper haste away under ground you must quickly retreat  jasper taking up lady sophia in his arms come escape in my arms  lady sophia dont you feel my heart beat  jasper so does mine lovely creature my soul is on fire  lady sophia but i never can yield to your sensual desire  exit jasper bearing off lady sophia down the subterranean staircase carey speaking without the great door of the mausoleum miss jasper miss jasper pray are you within  miss jasper opening the door is it you sir who make so uncivil a din  pray what is the cause of this sudden intrusion have your poets produced a new scene of confusion  carey gerrard says you have locked up the key of the rack so to give the bards punch be so kind to come back come my dear   miss jasper the deuce take your poetical potion you have spoiled my poor ladys nocturnal devotion  how forgetful old gerrard is suddenly grown he has surely the key in some drawr of his own but you jest  get you gone  i must hasten to her  carey but without a few kisses indeed i shall not stir  miss jasper pish  nonsense  make haste then  i have no time to spare  carey cannot you give me some minutes my dear busy fair  miss jasper no in truth not a moment my hurry is

what figure  facil why rumble i now see him stand with his garments halfbuttond a scroll in his hand and the poor frighted girl   trope what the deuce do you mean in an odd wanton frolic has rumble been seen  to an abigails room did the old bard repair  facil no no i will relate to you all the affair  you must know that our punch had so heated my brain that to sleep half the night i endeavored in vain but was just in a slumber between three and four when a halfarrayd figure threw open my door twas a poor trembling damsel who hastily said rise rise or you will surely be burnt in your bed and i heard rumbles voice thrice repeat the word fire but as that dreadful word was soon followed by lyre i perceived the good girl i now held by the arm had mistaken his verse for a cry of alarm  trope very good  he has often these starts in the night but how did you calm the poor girl in her fright  facil the wild little wench like a poor frighted hare knew not which way to run and did nothing but stare when holding the door of my chamber ajar we perceived by the aid of the bright morning star the old bard who of liquor had taken his fill sally forth from his quarters in odd dishabille with punch and with poetry heated he swaggers and reels down the stairs like a horse in the staggers repeating with emphasis several times the unfortunate word in his dangerous rhymes and the girl who now saw her mistake very clear laughed in spite of her shame at the source of her fear  trope and you i spppose when her terror was fled taught her bloom to revive by the warmth of your bed  facil no indeed had her panic been only affected i perhaps had been foolish as you have suspected but her fear and her modesty both were so true that they won my regard and she safely withdrew  trope but where is our friend rumble  facil o nobody knows  trope to some shady retreat he is gone to compose  facil on the housetop perhaps like a bird he may sit he considers keen air as a friend to his wit it would not surprise me this phoenix to see oddly perched on a bough of an old lofty tree for he thinks he writes best when he is nearest to heaven but he will soon want his breakfast  it is much after seven  trope hark what is that noise like the woodmans loud stroke  facil as i live it is rumble in yon shattered oak dont you see where he is sitting astride on the branch he has cracked that large limb by the weight of his paunch  trope i believe he is asleep  shall we give him a call lest he chance in his slumber to get a bad fall  facil never fear  here is one to take care of his life here is the nurse of our brobdignag baby his wife  enter mrs rumble hastily mrs rumble pray gentlemen where is my dear mr rumble  i have news for you poets to make you all grumble but where is my husband  i seek him in haste  facil dear maam we are surpised that with singular taste from the soft arms of beauty he strangely has fled to embrace the rough limbs of an oak in their stead  on that bough you may see him  mrs rumble ah barbarous man he will venture his life let me say what i can i am sure some mischance will his genius overwhelm the other day he fell down from the top of an elm  mr rumble take care  mr rumble my dear  facil in this case my dear madam you have nothing to fear behold it is an incident only for mirth for the bough gently falling consigns him to earth  mrs rumble i rejoice he is landed  enter rumble stretching himself and yawning mrs rumble my dear mr rumble it is well you have met with so easy a tumble i wish that your fancy was not so romantic all the people will think you are perfectly frantic  rumble peace woman  i care not for idle derision i have had a superb elegiacal vision homer says with great truth onar ek dios esti  mrs rumble on first waking my dear you are apt to be testy but i am glad if the muse has been kind to your slumbers and i hope we shall hear your mellifluous numbers  rumble in my dream i have composed and with clear continuity such emollient verse for the grief of viduity twould have soothed the fad relict of old king mausolus  mrs rumble in our passions the nine may have charms to control us but your muse i am afraid might as well have miscarried for the lady you praise as a widow is married  rumble peace woman youre crazy  facil how married dear madam  mrs rumble ay married as sure as we are children of adam you know sir rich folks with a license have power to marry without the canonical hour and leaving her guests over their punch to carouse my lady at midnight received a new spouse  rumble mrs rumble i fear it is our punch that has bred these nuptial phantasmas in your giddy head your story has nothing of concatenation  mrs rumble mr rumble you always will doubt my narration but i deal not in fiction although a bards wife on the truth of this secret i would venture my life from one of the housemaids i happened to worm it and here comes a gentleman who will confirm it  enter carey mrs rumble your voice mr carey will prove i am right pray was not her ladyship married last night  carey dear madam your question can hardly be serious  mrs rumble i am sure she was wed though the weddings mysterious  carey do you really believe it  dear madam to whom it must be to one of these bards or a groom for excepting ourselves and the men of her train not a male did this mansion last night entertain but whence your conjecture on what is it grounded  rumble silly woman i tell you your brain is confounded but i think we may guess from your dream of this fact how in widowhood you will be tempted to act i suppose when i have finished my scene of mortality however you sorrow in show and verbality you soon will renounce all your dignified gravity and enticed by some bellmans poetical suavity go to church with a fellow who deigns to rehearse a quatrain on your charms in his annual verse  mrs rumble o you barbarous man by so cruel a jest would you wound the chaste love of so tender a breast you know me too well to believe what you say  thank my stars here is an evidence coming this way and you will see truth and justice are both on my side  enter miss jasper mrs rumble hastily miss jasper pray is not my lady a bride  miss jasper you are right my dear madam  carey it cannot be real  miss jasper from you bards i request a sublime hymeneal  trope so suddenly married  facil you certainly joke

happy man may so fair a prize fall  miss jasper the bridegroom i will soon introduce to you all and you poets i trust will a new string employ with singular pleasure to echo his joy  rumble so my fine elegiacs are now out of season  i was mad to think woman a creature of reason and on widowhoods slippery virtues to raise the luminous fabric of rythmical praise but i will haste to be gone from this scene of fatuity come along mrs rumble i have done with viduity  my lady may welcome more juvenile comers i have no time to waste upon conjugal mummers  miss jasper mr rumble pray stay in our joy to partake  mrs rumble stay my dear mr rumble you will stay for my sake though the grand and the gloomy is all your delight i confess that festivity pleases my sight pray indulge me for once  it would half break my heart without seeing the bridegroom were we to depart  rumble curiosity ruined your grandmother eve and to gratify yours you shall not have my leave from a farcical scene it is time we should go and who plays the jack pudding i want not to know  mrs rumble my lady may still wish your verse to peruse  rumble for politics henceforth i give up the muse though political paths may have some tortuosity to enter on them i have less scrupulosity than to feed your vain sex with poetical flummery and at last be the dupe of their amorous mummery but i will have my revenge and before my spleen cools i will prove all the sexflattering poets are fools  come away mrs rumble  your dutys submission  exit bearing off mrs rumble miss jasper poor woman i pity her dismal condition and am grieved that so roughly he makes her return  but here is one to console us for every concern  enter jasper miss jasper to you my good friends i the bridegroom present and you all will rejoice in this happy event  carey dear jasper overwhelmed by this joyous surprise i am almost afraid to believe my own eyes are you really returned and in truth are you married has this excellent plan been so suddenly carried or with potent illusion and artful pretenses has this fair little sorceress cheated our senses  jasper you may trust in her magic as honest and true she has rendered me happy and so

shall hardly refuse whatsoever you request  jasper though a few dainty whims of a singular kind have oerclouded the worth of her excellent mind the soul of my lady sophia is fraught with the true mental pleasures of generous thought she perceives and disclaims for the rest of her days the foibles to which false refinement betrays she now thinks this proud fabric of illapplied art the ridiculous whim of too feeling a heart sir simon had many calm virtues whose claim from ungrateful oblivion shall rescue his name but all the distinctions of rank are confused fame herself is insulted and art is abused when the plume and the laurel insultingly wave over the honest plain merchants preposterous grave convinced of this truth it is my ladys design to alter this dome on a new plan of
