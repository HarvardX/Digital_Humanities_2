the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland  vol ii  by mr brook  dublin printed for the author by dillon chamberlain in dame street facing fowness street mdcclxvi  the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland author you are welcome my friend but pray to what may i be indebted for the favor of this visit   friend in compliment to your work rather than to its author i confess that curiosity impelled me hither in spite of some other urgent occasions indeed i heartily cursed the intruders who disturbed us in so interesting a point of the story and i should not have slept since had i not in some measure satisfied my impatience by making out the remainder in my own mind   aut and pray how have you contrived the business   fr in a way as i thought that could not be avoided the natural affections of a parent joined to the recent obligations by which old clement was bound to his son must necessarily effect a perfect reconciliation and all end as one would wish in future prosperity in truth i thought it full time to put a period to the readers distress by putting an end to those of the unfortunate clement   aut happily guessed my friend your imagination has supplied my place to great advantage to proceed would answer no manner of purpose   fr but then it struck me this morning that the deplorable condition in which these people were found could not be consistent with my plan this has brought me in a hurry i think that my plan is still the right one i fear you have indulged yourself in the mavelous at the expense of nature it is the fault of all novellists i am in great pain for you i cannot conceive how you bring yourself off in this plunge   aut here  had you called sooner you would the sooner have had your spleen or your curiosity gratified   chap viii during his fit the surgeon came with his instruments and dressings and having in vain attempted to restore him by sprinkling water in his face and by the application of hartshorn to his nose and temples he took some blood from him whereon he opened his eyes and began to breathe with freedom he then examined his wound which was a little above his forehead and declared it so slight as scarce to be an excuse for keeping his chamber the surgeon having dressed it received his fee and retired and my father ringing for the drawer ordered up a flask of burgundy with a cold fowl oil and vinegar  when the table was laid and the waiter desired to withdraw my father again looking earnestly and compassively upon me i believe says he my child may be hungry and strait his countenance falling and the muscles of his lips beginning to work he broke into tears barbarous wretch he exclaimed unnatural ostrich who could thus leave the firstbegotten of thy bowels to the nakedness of the sands and to the blasting of the elements  no no my father i cried again throwing myself on my knees before him kill me not with your tears crush me not with this your unmerited concern all is well all is happy and blessed as i can bear it to be this moment overpays my years of anguish it is like heaven after passing the vale of death and mortal sufferings  after supper of which my father scarce tasted he got up and as i rose at the same time he stepped to me and catching me passionately in his arms and putting his neck across mine my child he cried my beloved child my lifes blessed preserver come once more to my bosom enter thy forsaken mansion too long has it been desert and desolate without thee but here i vow to the almighty that no stepdames nor viperous instruments shall ever hereafter insinuate between us accursed be they who shall attempt to divide us and may they come to an evil end who shall desire to deprive me of thee the light of mine eyes till i am cold and insensible to every other joy  while we sat over our bottle my father called for ink and paper and first presenting me with a purse of fifty guineas he again gave me a bill at sight on his banker for five hundred pounds i started up but stopping me he cried hold hold my hammy i see myself overpayd in the acknowledgments of that dear though meagre countenance and then as i kneeled before him with both hands held over me and eyes raised to heaven he blessed me in an ejaculation of the tenderest ardour  the reckoning being discharged and two chairs ordered to the door my father desired me to meet him at the same tavern the following evening and said that in the mean time he would think of settling some certain income upon me and thus we parted as though our souls had accompanied each other  it was now near two oclock and the morning bitter cold my arabella had long since put her child to rest and i found her in tears by a fire scarce alive she started up on my entering her face gleamed with a sickly joy and she uttered some soft reproaches of love and apprehension for my absence at those hours  before i ventured to let in the full tide of our returning happiness on her weak and alarmed spirits i took out some confections and a pint of sack which i had purposely brought in my pocket i broke some naple biscuit into a cup and pouring some of the wine upon it i set her the example and prevailed on her to eat  mean while she gazed earnestly and inquisitively in my face my hammy she tenderly cried what is the meaning of this what eyes are these hammy what new kind of a countenance is this you have brought home to me ah forbid it my god that the darling of my soul should have done any thing criminal first perish your arabella perish also her infant rather than on our account or on any account the least of the virtues of my hammy should be lost  no no my angel i cried daughter of highest heaven god has been wonderfully gracious to me he blesses me for your sake my arabella i have seen my father we are happily reconciled and famine and affliction shall come near us no more  i then took the bellows and lighted up a good fire and while we were emptying our pint of which i compelled my wife to take the larger share i gave her a transporting detail of what had passed and poured my purse of guineas into her lap so we went to bed in peace regardless of futurity the happiest of all the pairs on whom the succeeding sun arose  we lay in bed till the day was far advanced i then ordered some comforting white wine caudle for breakfast and calling up the landlady i discharged our quarters rent  when she was dismissed i consulted with my wife whether she would choose to retire to france or holland or rather to york or some other remote place within the kingdom but reflecting again on the present excess of my fathers tenderness for me she joined in thinking it advisable to act with his concurrence and i determined that very evening to reveal to him in confidence the whole pathetic history of our marriage and adventures  mean while i thought it best in all events to secure the means of moderately compassing our purpose by taking up the l 00 from my fathers banker i found by experience that i had now little to fear from being known to any one my shabby apparel and emaciated face and limbs that had prevented the knowledge and remembrance of a father appeared a double security against all other eyes i therefore adventured though not without circumspection to mr giless in lombard street and presenting my bill demanded payment  my friend said mr giles it is not two hours since a stop was put to the payment of that draught and i was desired at the same time to put this paper into the hands of the party who should call so saying he gave me a note which i opened with a trepidation that was turned into agony on reading the following words  to hammel clement most subtle and most accursed of all cruel contrivers thou did thyself then set that villain on thy foolish and fond father by whom his blood was shed and his life nearly lost i renounce thee i abjure thee from henceforth and for ever and as i continue to disclaim all sorts of ties with thee either here or hereafter so may heaven continue to prosper  bartholomew clement   on reading this dreadful paper i retired from the counter without speaking a word i got home i know not how for i neither knew what i did nor considered what i was about i walked up stairs without perceiving that i was followed but i had scarce got into my room when five or six men entered almost along with me and one of them stepping directly up to my wife cried mistress i arrest you in his majestys name  hereat i turned and was stunned and rouzed again in an instant i caught up the poker and aiming at a well dressed man whose face was not wholly unknown and who appeared the most active and joyous of the crew i missed the crown of his head but tore off one ear and cut him through his clothes and shoulder to the bone i then flew upon the rest i dealt my blows with inconceivable fury and quickness i cleared my room in a few seconds and though several shots were fired at me from the stairs i chased them all to the entry and returning to my arabella i barrocaded the door  it was then that she interposed and dropping on her knees before me what is my hammy about she cried what madness has possessed my love would you be guilty of actual and instant murders through a rash and vain attempt of rescuing from our laws a person whom neither god nor man has yet condemned this indeed were to ensure the ruin you apprehend ah no my hearts master let us neither commit nor fear iniquity join with me my hammy let us trust in our god and nothing but good can happen unto us  while she spoke the late terrors of her countenance disappeared and her aspect was gradually overspread with a serenity to be imagined in some measure from the face of an evening heaven in autumn when the songs of harvest are heard through the villages all about  i gazed on her with a speechless and complacent reverence she gently took the weapon from my unresisting hand and leading me back she seated me in the furthest chair she then removed every bar and obstacle to their entrance the stairs were now filled with people who had been called to the assistance of the kings officers but they still appeared apprehensive and fearful of advancing  gentlemen said arabella be pleased to walk in i deliver myself peaceably into your hands ye shall find no further opposition to his majesty or the laws the officers accordingly entered but bowing and with a timid kind of respect neither did any of them offer to lay a hand upon her good god madam exclaimed the foremost is it possible you should be guilty of the crimes laid to your charge by that rascal whom your husband has half killed he is carried off to the doctors but i think in my conscience that he has got his deserts and as for the few hurts that we have received we excuse your husband madam for your sake and we think him the braver and the better man for what he did by my soul sweet madam you are well worth defending  i thank ye gentlemen said my wife gracefully smiling and curtseying pray be pleased to sit while i prepare to attend you i am guilty indeed of the death of a man and yet guilty of nothing that i would not repeat in the defense of virtue but gentlement says she again smiling you are likely to be troubled with more prisoners than you look for one of them indeed is young and as little meaning of harm to any one as his mother i must therefore beg your indulgence in sending for a coach and pray do me the favor to accept this trifle as the means of washing away animosity between you and my husband so saying she presented their chief with a guinea who rising and awfully bowing ordered one of the others to step for a coach  had the harp of orpheus been tuned like the voice of my arabella at this season it is not to be wondered that tigers should grow tame and bears crouch down before him and lick his feet since wretches like these hardened in hourly acts of insolence and inhumanity were now awed to downcast reverence and on her return from the closet with her infant in her arms dropped a tear of still compassion as though they had not wholly forgotten that they were born of women  in the mean time my fury having subsided at the instance of my wife i should certainly have fainted if i had not been relieved by a gush of tears which i endeavored to conceal by turning aside and putting my hankerchief to my face a cloud of thick darkness again overspread my soul and every internal idea grew pregnant and labored with apprehension and horror i cursed my meeting with my father and his treacherous appearance of bounty which had served to bring this decisive ruin upon us and i looked upon fortune as solicitous and industrious to bring evil and destruction out of every presentment and promise of advantage  being conducted to newgate i agreed with the keeper for a tolerable apartment at two guineas per week and putting on the best cheer i could affect before my wife i sent out for a nourishing dinner for i judged it late to be frugal when death was at our door and i had determined not to survive my arabella a moment  the day following i procured copies of the depositions of the three witnesses the first of whom was our own servant maid these i laid before two of the most learned in the law but received no consolation from their report they told me that had my wife been actually guilty of the robbery as alleged she might have had some prospect of being acquitted of the murder by being enabled to bribe off the evidence but that if she was really innocent of the robbery as i affirmed it then became the very cause as well as interest of the guilty evidence to have her condemned on both articles of accusation  as the fearful day approached i bought at second hand two decent suits of mourning with the requisite appendages for my wife and myself whenever i could get apart i was drowned in my tears and half suffocated by my sobs and i did every thing but pray for my arabella for i could not think of lifting my heart to a heaven where i had lost all dependence  in the mean time my beloved daily recovered felsh and health her eyes grew more brilliant her complexion more clear her countenance was as the surface of a depth of peace and i gathered i knew not why a kind of reflected confidence by beholding her aspect  early on the fatal morning when i had left her within at her prayers and had pulled my hat over my eyes and sat down in a corner to vent the throbbings of my heart i cast my eye on a paper that appeared from under the door i took it up with precipitation and in it found the following lines  i though mountains threat thy naked head though circling gulphs around thee close though help is distant hope is dead though eearth and hell are sworn thy foes ii yet heaven their malice shall defy and strong in last extremes to save shall stand with guardian seraphs nigh and with thy slandrers glut the grave i had no sooner read this paper than i dropped down involuntarily on my knees my hands clenched together and i breathed up a most ardent petition that some overruling power would take my arabella under his protection  soon after she came forth adorned like the moon when girt about with clouds through whose blackness her beauty breaks forth with improved luster  while we fat at breakfast i presented her with the verses she read them over and over with deep attention and then returning them with a smile this says she has been the stratagem of some very charitable person who judged that hope was wanting to support me at such a trial  as the dreadful hour was at hand and as i had considered before now that at last it must come i had prepared a small bottle of salts and a cordial to support myself as well as my wife from an unseemly dejection of spirits in court  ah sir can you tell me how one thing should come to pass can you account for this most extraordinary of all the workings in human nature that a man at some times should more feelingly live or die in others than in himself had i been called to my last audit had the decision of my own existence been at stake my apprehensions as i think could not have equalled what i felt at that period  at length the keeper appeared and warned my arabella that she must speedily set out i turned instantly cold and pale and it was long before i recovered strength to rise from my chair in the mean time my wife returned to our bedchamber and bringing out her infant gave him in charge to a nursekeeper she then held her hands over him and raised her eyes to heaven in blessing for some time again she fixed them on his face and gazing upon him as it were for a last farewell look tear dropped after tear in a pathetic and affectionate silence  being conducted to the old bailey my wife on entering the court turned suddenly pale and her countenance was downcast with a diffidence that she could not for some time overcome the concourse was excessively great and chiefly consisting of the nobility and gentry of both sexes the great man himself was there with a crowd of his dependents and all the male and female relations and friends of the deceased  i gave my arabella the salts to smell to and as she weakly and bashfully advanced to the bar a confused and jarring murmur was heared on all sides and the words impudence and innocence resounded throughout  when according to order she had held up her hand and heared her indictment the judge with a countenance and voice equally stern demanded guilty or not guilty she answered guilty my lord i confess of the death of lord stivers but never guilty of any kind of robbery or malice woman said the judge you confess yourself guilty and i should proceed to your sentence but i ask you for the last time guilty or not guilty not guilty my lord she then rejoined if to do what i approve and shall never repent of is not to be guilty  again the murmur was repeated but continued much longer and with more virulence on the one part and more concern on the other  i shall not detain you sir with an account of the examination of the two first witnesses one of whom had been our own servant girl and the other the principal footman of lord stivers they had all manner of encouragement and countenance from the court and concurred in every circumstance that could serve for condemnation the sound of triumph was heared through all the gentry and the populace sighingly gave my arabella for lost  the third witness was then called he was a very genteel and modestlooking young man and was now out of livery  my lord says he with a respectful but resolute voice before i give my testimony in this case i request that the two first witnesses should be taken into custody into custody cried the judge do you know what you say i do know what i say my lord and i repeat my request that they should be taken into custody why friend said the judge they are as you are they are witnesses for the crown against a criminal and no man has a right to order them into custody i say rejoined the youth with an air still more determined that they are witnesses against innocence against his majesty and against the laws that they alone are criminal that i am evidence against them and i again require it of your lordship of the jury and of all present that they should not be permitted to make their escape  i see exclaimed the judge you are a prevaricating villain but i shall trounce you before we part where is this fellows examination  my lord my lord said the young man with somewhat of a severe and sarcastical tone you were not placed there to prejudicate in any matter no more than i was called here to be browbeat and sentenced without trial if you find that i prevaricate if you desire to fifth me as wheat and find any chaff in me i refuse not the bitterest punishment that our laws can inflict but as your lordship observes i am an evidence for the crown and his majesty god be praised will not fix his tribunal in any unrighteousness i therefore demand to be heared in the cause to which i am cited and all present shall be assured that i speak nothing but the truth and you gentlemen of the jury i petition you to intercede in favor of equity with his lordship and to prevail that these criminals for such i affirm them to be should not be suffered to get away and further that they should be instantly searched and all that is found about them reserved for the inspection of yourselves and his lordship  my lord said the foreman i humbly conceive that no ill consequence can ensue from searching and setting a watch over those people their testimony is already given and cannot be invalidated thereby  i cannot agree to it answered the judge they are free subjects there is no indictment nor deposition against them they are also evidence for his majesty and are therefore under his peculiar protection but i would willingly hear what this fellow this turncoat has to say for himself  my lord replied the youth i now stand before a tribunal that is infinitely more aweful than that of your lordship and provided i approve my truth before god i shall be the less afflicted for having fallen under your lordships displeasure my name is edward longfield i was born to happier prospects my father was a gentleman and about eighteen months ago i took the degree of bachelor at queens college in oxford but misfortunes and misunderstandings happening in our family i was left to be the former of my own fortunes and arriving at london i was taken into service by my late lord stivers he grew fond of me beyond my merits and i began to partake of his friendship and confidence at the time that i was deprived of the most generous of masters by the most unhappy of all events  my lord had one foil to his many virtues it was an invincible passion for femalebeauty the last night of his life having called me aside ned says he i must take you on an adventure tomorrow i have positively the finest girl in the universe in chase and i must enjoy her in all events but the devil on it is that she is virtuous though i hope not incorruptible i have put her husband out of the way upon a feigned action for debt and i have bribed her maid over to my party so that i have nothing to contend with but her own lovely person and that will be the sweetest dispute in the world sure my lord i cried you wouldnt force her pshaw said he damn your impertinent scruples another such word ned and you are blown with me i can tell you a fine woman my lad must be won at any rate if she is garrisoned with virtue and cannot be got by stratagem she must be taken by storm  the day following my lord took me and his footman robert there who is one of the witnesses to a tavern directly opposite to the house of the prisoner he dined there alone and kept us in waiting most part of the afternoon in expectation of intelligence from that other witness there who has borne false testimony against her mistress as he looked out from time to time at one of the street windows he at last as i suppose received the appointed signal for hurrying down stairs he ordered us to follow the door was purposely held open for us by that woman is all safe deb says my lord yes says deb but may i depend on these who come with you you may child cries my lord they are my own people it is very well cries deb i have just got miss hodgins out of your way my mistress is above and alone for want of better company to her then my lord she is a dish for an emperor but if she should prove too many for you i know where the shame will lie for ever well well cries my lord shut the door softly deb and take these lads down with you to the kitchen but whatever ye hear on your lives let me have no stir i charge ye so saying my lord went tripping up stairs and we followed that bad woman to her darker region  i soon observed that my campanion mr robert there was intent on making up his acquaintance with mrs deborah and as i found myself extremely uneasy i gave them the slip without being observed and stealing up stairs i put my ear to the door where i heared the voice of my master blessed heaven to what surpassing sentiments was i then an amazed witness to what proofs of a virtue that cannot be rated at less than divine if i should not be tedious i would deliver to the court to you my lord in particular and to you gentlemen of the jury the best account i can of those wonderful passages  hear him hear him hear him was then almost the universal cry till he was permitted by the bench and desired by the jury to speak with freedom  he then repeated in a more ample and pathetic manner all that passed as i have told you between lord stivers and my wife but stopping as he drew near to the fatal catastrophe i could no longer bear he said the piercing cries and agonizing shrieks of such virtue in such extremity had i any kind of weapon i thought i should have done my lord good service by protecting the purity he was about to violate but i trembled and grew exceeding sick and hastening down to the kitchen i threw myself into a chair and swooned away  while i was in my fit and that robert and deborah were busy about me the fatal stroke as i imagine was given and the prisoner made her escape with her infant in her arms when i was somewhat recovered and had taken a dram of mrs deborahs bottle she put down the kettle and invited us to a dish of tea i requested my companions from time to time to step out and listen but they reported that all was quiet above stairs and when i wondered at this tut says deborah the lovers have made it up before now i warrant and my mistress is so well pleased with what she was forced to that it is well for your master if he gets off before midnight  at length it grew darkish and being all of us surpised that no candles were called for we went in a body up stairs and deborah ventured gently to tap at the door but hearing no voice nor stirring in the chamber she turned the bolt softly and peeping in she gave a loud shriek and drew suddenly back again we then entered together and as i was prepared by my knowledge of the ladys virtue for some dreadful catastrophe i was the less shocked and concerned at what i beheld  the floor was half covered with clotted blood my master lay in the midst already stiff and cold and part of the fatal scissars was still within the wound we all stood for some time in silent astonishment and then with joint tears lamented his fate at length says deborah i would gladly see if my bloody mistress has taken care to provide for her journey so saying she stooped and taking his lordships purse from his pocket she counted down two hundred and ninety seven guineas she then took out his fine goldrepeater and next his gold snuff box and last took his large diamond ring from his finger  come my lads says deborah my lords silence gives consent and we can no more be said to rob this piece of earth than the people in the mines who gather gold from clay if my mistress is ever taken she must suffer death for the murder and they can do no more to her for the robbery and twenty such matters together if you will therefore be of my counsel we will comfort ourselves as we ought for this melancholy business and share a prize between us that no one else has a right to and that no body will want  robert did not hesitate long in a little time he appeared more sanguine than deborah herself and they urged me to join them by a number of interesting and cajoling instances i was dispirited i was affrighted i saw a scene of blood and slaughter before me and i doubted not that if i refused them i should be made the second victim to their resentment and avarice i pretended to value the watch at an unmeasurable rate and that i should be greatly the gainer if i got it for my dividend mrs deborah then went to her mistresses drawers and taking out half a dozen of silver spoons a tea equipage and several articles in laces and cambricks she fairly laid them before us and observed at the same time that her mistress would not call in a hurry to demand them and that the landlord would take all if we did not come in for snacks she then made a new division she compelled me further to accept of the snuff box she gave the purse of gold entire to robert and contented herself with the diamond ring some gold medals my lords handkerchief and the plunder of her mistress  while mr longfield was in this part of his testimony the foreman of the jury cried out stay sir good people pray stop those witnesses there i see they are making off and now do us the favor to search their pockets and to put what ye find into two hats severally and to hand them up to us  this being accordingly done mr longfield says the foreman be pleased now to proceed  i have little further to say replied mr longfield here is my noble masters watch and here is his snuff box they are undoubtedly known to many honorable persons at present in court and i bless my god that i have been enabled to preserve them for the vindication of innocence and the illustration of virtue at this day  here mr longfield paused and the judge cried out clerk hand me up the examination of this prevaricator this his lordship perused with a countenance and scrutiny apparently inveterate but finding that the deponent had not touched upon the robbery and that neither the words feloniously nor of malice were inserted in that part that referred to the death of lord stivers he tore the examination into twenty pieces come come he cried again i have not yet done with this same longfield i perceive perfectly well how he came by the watch and suffbox the transference was not difficult from the prisoner who stole them to this her confederate but tell us my wonderfully honest friend how came you to keep these things from their lawful owners for the very long space of twelve months and upward why did you not immediately or long before now give examinations against those whom you so suddenly take it into your head to accuse and why would you suffer that so exceeding chaste and innocent lady to labor all this time under the infamy with which her character in my judgment is still justly loaded  to all these questions mr longfield barely smiled but bowing with his head and making a motion with his hand to two gentlemen who sat on one side in the gallery mr archibald an eminent merchant and an alderman of the city got up and spoke to the following effect  i wish my lord that i could as well content your lordship as i can satisfy the jury and all others present on the articles you require the day immediately succeeding this fatal accident mr longfield came to me and in presence of mr true love here my worthy and substantial neighbor gave a detail almost word for word of all that he has this hour deposed in court he then deposited the watch and snuff box with us and did not reclaim them till early this morning as i am of his majestys peace he also gave in this examination before me which however i must not venture to hand over to your lordship till i have your previous engagement that you will not tear it i thereupon offered to issue warrants for apprehending the delinquents but mr longfield most sensibly and judiciously observed that such a step must unquestionably shut the door against justice and all knowledge of the truth that the criminals were two to one against their accuser that on the slightest alarm they would infallibly abscond or make away with the effects of which they now held themselves the peaceable and unquestioned possessors or contrive some further plot to invalidate his evidence or probably make him away by pistol or poison and so deprive that unhappy gentlewoman of the only witness of her innocence but says he if they are permitted to enter the court under the confidence of my confederacy they will have no reserve upon them no foreformed evasions or contrivances for escape my unexpected testimony will suddenly confound their guilt and they may happen to carry some articles about them which might serve for their conviction beyond ten witnesses  in the mean time mr longfield mr true love and i were solicitous and unwearied in our inquiries after the unfortunate prisoner that we might persuade her to stand her trial and to deliver herself up to justice but all our search proved fruitless till the day in which she was discovered and taken  here mr archibald ended and the judge exclaimed crier call the two first witnesses into court that we may hear what they say to this fair weather speech the crier accordingly vociferated several o yeses for deborah skinner and robert callan to come into court but had they been within call they did not choose to hear during the attention of the court and jury to alderman archibald they had imperceptibly slipped behind their next neighbors and proceeding in like manner from one to another they at length confounded themselves with the crowd and got clear off  my lord then began to sum his charge to the jury and dwellt with much emphasis on some articles here says he we have lost a nobleman a minister one of the first ornaments of our country and stays of our land and what i pray ye have we got in recompense of this great damage why my friends we have got a new thing upon the earth we have got a saving of the honor of a milliner but if this princess is inviolate as still is pretended how come she to be guilty of this most horrid of all murders before she knew to what extremity his lordship would have proceeded how did she dare capitally to execute a peer of the realm on a simple attempt for which our laws would not have confined a common porter this woman must certainly have been a trader in blood and her felonious intents and malice are fully expressed in the very peculiar use and inhumanity of the weapon with which she perpetrated this most desperate deed you need not therefore gentlemen go out of you box to bring her in guilty of the murder i will not affirm with equal certainty touching the robbery and yet to me it is apparent that she could not have enterprized so barbarous a fact if she had not done it in prospect of plundering the deceased but as she is capitally punishable in the first instance i leave ye gentlemen to determine of the second at pleasure  first permit us my lord replied the foreman to examine what we have got in these hats he then drew a long purse from among the relics of robert and having counted out seventy guineas mr longfield says he would you know my lords purse if it is my masters purse said longfield it is of green silk and has toward the top a coronet and the letter s wrought under it in silver twist the very same sir indeed rejoined the foreman and now let us see what mrs deborah might have got in her honest keeping so saying he took from the second hat a small wooden box it was nearly stuffed with cotton in which he found my lords diamond ring three gold medals and the ends of the handles of several silver spoons mrs clement says he i imagine we may have got some of your property among us pray had you any mark to your silver spoons yes sir said she scarce audible a g at top for graves and a d and a below for dorothy and arabella i wish madam replied this gentleman that we were equally enabled to find an equivalent for your merits as to restore to you this trifling remnant of your rights  come gentlemen cried the judge the day wears apace it is time for ye to retire and consult on the verdict ye are to bring in  my lord answered the foreman you truly observed that we need not leave our box for the purpose you require we are already agreed and unanimous in our verdict and i would to heaven that we were not confined on this occasion to literal precedents and forms of law that we might give a verdict some way adequate to the merits of the prisoner who however depressed by fortune is superior in all excellencies whom we judge to be an honor to humannature and the first grace and ornament of her own sex but since we are limited by custom in these matters we do say with one voice and a conscience that compells us to utterance not guilty my lord not guilty  the words were scarce pronounced when the courthouse was almost split by a sudden peal hats caps and wigs universally filled the air and jostled against eachother the triumph was caught and echoed by the crowds without and the sound was repeated and floated from street to street till it seemed to die away in distant parts of the city  my wife then turned gracefully curtsying to the foreman i thank you sir says she i thank ye gentlemen says she again curtsying to the rest of the jury and then glancing modestly round she saluted the assembly and sat down but i could not contain my gratitude my transport overpowered me and falling on my knees and lifting my hands toward the jury god alone can reward ye gentlemen i cried may he for ever preserve the prosperities honors and families of the worthy citizens of london from violation and insult  i then rose hastily i slipped out of the bar and rushing up to mr longfield i catched him eagerly about the neck i could not speak i hid my face in his bosom and broke into tears he attempted to disengage himself but i held him fast i believe said he you must be mr clement i congratulate you sir with all my soul but you owe me nothing i barely did my duty  o my friend my brother my preserver i cried i owe you more than life existence had been my greatest of curses without you that i am not at this moment the deepest damned of the creation that i find myself the most blessed of all beings to you alone it is owing my longfield my deliverer nay hope not to escape me we never more must part you are my captive for life and i and all that i am or have is yours to eternity  as the people within and without were still in great commotion the court appeared much alarmed and the judge and most of the gentry made homeward through a private door that opened into a back alley but their fears were groundless for the crowd was wholly intent on another object and impatiently waited for a sight of my arabella  as she walked forward attended by mr longfield and myself they made way for her on either hand and the atmosphere again rung with shouts and acclamations so sincere is the respect that the populace pay to virtue and such is their exultation when innocence rises superior to oppression but when innocence and virtue are accompanied by beauty their reverence grows almost criminal and approaches to adoration  thus we returned to newgate amidst the blessings prayers and praises of a yielding multitude who still respectfully opened as arabella advanced the windows on all sides poured forth congratulations and those through whom we had passed pressed forward for another sight as though their eyes could not be satisfied with beholding  before we entered her late prison my wife turned about and curtsied three or four times to her numerous attendants with an acknowledging grace and humility that seemed oppressed by their favors she then entered hastily and running up stairs she caught her child from the nursekeeper she held him some time in her arms her bosom gently heaved and the tears rolled in silence down her placid countenance but on our approach she turned suddenly into the bedchamber shut to the door and continued there in private for near an hour  in the mean time i sent out for a warm dinner and a bottle of wine mr longfield now told me that he had often been tempted to introduce himself to us during my wifes confinement but he feared that the discovery of any acquaintance or correspondence between us might prejudice arabella upon her trial and that therefore he had made use of the little stratagem of the verses which he had thrust under our door in order to preserve us from a total depression of spirits  when the cloth was laid i whispered gently through the keyhole to my arabella and soon after she came forth with a harmony and beatitude of motion and aspect as though she had instantly dropped from that heaven which had wholly possessed her during her absence  at table mr longfield gave us some heads of his history he further told us that since the death of his late lord he had entered into another service but that he had been out of place for about a month past i have saved says he about thirty guineas of my wages but that is not the whole of my treasure this morning as i was just upon entering the court a very comely gentlewoman twitched me by the sleeve she asked me if my name was not longfield and if i was not one of the witnesses on the impending trial when i answered in the affirmative she took me a little aside and putting ten guineas into my hand keep up said she to your evidence be zealous in avenging the blood of your lord and this is not the last gratification which you shall receive  after some further discourse i called up the keeper discharged the reckoning and fees and returned thanks for his civility and particular respects to my arabella i then sent for a coach and we drove home together  on the way i prevailed upon mr longfield to take up his lodgings at mrs jennetts provided he could be accommodated at a reasonable rate  mrs jennett received us with warm congratulations we immediately ordered the kettle down and invited her to a dish of tea over which she agreed with our friend for the street room on the same floor at three shillings per week  the day following i left mr longfield to entertain my arabella i went to our late landlord and called him to an accout for the furniture we had left in his house hereupon he produced an inventory of particulars taken upon oath with the bill of appraisment and sale and returned me the surplus that remained over the rent amounting to somewhat upward of nine pounds deborah as i suppose had carried off whatever was most valuable and portable  i then hastened to the miss hodginses they received me with such transports as my heart found to be unfeigned they already knew the happy tidings they huddled on some loose matters and away we tripped together with all possible dispatch  the meeting was accompanied by many tender and mutual tears ah my love cried the eldest of the miss hodginses pride and beauty of your sex how jealous we are of you we went yesterday to your trial with the most substantial of our friends in order to give you a character if required but you neither called upon us nor would look on the side where we stood ah my dear girls my sweet friends cried arabella how could i hope or imagine that you would acknowledge or even think of so low and lost a wretch as i was  arabella was now at liberty to revisit her old acquaintance she was caressed more than ever and took in so much work that she was obliged to hire a girl to attend the child  i was now at the very pinnacle of human happiness i had twenty guineas left of the fifty i got from my father my wife earned from two to her three shillings per day and mr longfield who generally dieted with us frequently brought tea and sugar or a bottle of cordial or some such matter in his pocket which he pretended to have gotten excessively cheap or as a present  thus we lived in a kind of frugal affluence affliction was no more the remembrance of distress and poverty had vanished as a dream our days moved upon down and joy and peace nightly prepared our pillows  happy days happy hours above the lot of mortality heaven preserve me from ever tasting the like again lest they also should be attended by so terrible a reverse  mr longfield was very lovely in his person and manners he had made the belles letters his peculiar study and he used to procure a variety of entertaining novels and memoirs in french which he read fluently into english while my wife was at work we had contracted a friendship which i imagined too strict for time or chance to untie and i loved him the better for his attention to my arabella whose entertaiment seemed to form the chief delight of his life  i gave him my story in parts from time to time and he had plentifully watered the several passages with his tears his own experience had taught him to join with mr goodville in thinking that the education of a mere scholar was no way suited to the common occasions of life he therefore introduced me to mr marfelt his late master to whom he had recommended me as private tutor to his son and we agreed at l 0 per ann to commence as soon as the young gentleman should descend from the nursery  mr longfield as i told you was very lovely in his person and he daily became more amiable and engaging in my eyes i was pleased that he appeared in the same light to my wife she was indebted to him for her life and in her i held myself indebted to him for all things i thought that we could never love him enough and i daily and nightly importuned my arabella to affect him with a tenderness equal to my own  at length i became uneasy i knew not why nor wherefore i grew diffident at the comparison which i made in my mind between longfield and myself and i was disgusted as it were with my own demerits wherefore i grew dejected and dispirited and yet affected to appear the reverse of what i was i however sighed in secret when i could form a pretense for retiring or going abroad i took a solitary walk or withdrew to some recess where i lightened my oppression by a loose to my tears and i was thereby the better enabled to seem cheerful on my return and to assume a face of gaiety that was foreign to my heart ah are not the real evils of life sufficient yet man adds to the heap by his tendency to realize what is merely imaginary  the source of my malady was now no longer a secret to me my longfield i cried to myself my arabella my angel you are still faithful my longfield you are still chaste my arabella and there is nothing wherewith i can reproach the one or the other but you are both of ye too amiable you are fitted for eachother your clement loves ye too well to be a bar to your happiness you two are the whole treasure and delight of his existence he will have no bliss but yours your happiness shall be his and he will die to accomplish it since his life is an interruption  i was pleased that i daily declined but the affectation of cheerfulness became irksome and painful to me one night as we sat together my wife looked at me with an affectionate disturbance what is the matter hammy she cried what is come over my love you look not you speak not like the once fond the delighting and delighted consort of your arabella  ah i cried it is enough i die and i die contented since i leave the only two happy for whom i could wish to live what is this i hear hammy replied my arabella you die you say and you say also that you die contented ah  you love me no longer what business have i then any longer to  live she would have said but she instantly swooned  my eyes were suddenly opened i cursed my infatuating jealousy i wished for instant death to rid me of my confusion neither did i dare to look up into the face of my injured friend who by this as i feared had discovered my folly and who all trembling and pale as death was assiduous in helping to the recovery of my wife  at length she opened her eyes and looking about with a languid kind of displeasure mr longfield says she your services have been great but at present i am not under any necessity for your assistance whereupon he silently bowed and withdrew to his apartment  i then dropped on my knees before her my arabella my angel i cried loveliest of womankind most consummate of human creatures  but here with a forbidding hand and a countenance averted no hammy no says she in a voice interrupted by tears after what has passed your lips i cannot be deceived and i will not be comforted you would leave me you say hammy and you would leave me forlorn but i will not be forsaken i will prevent your unkindness i will go where i shall not be altogether friendless ah my aunt my all relations in one why did you abandon me you thought you left me the world in this husband this friend and protector as you called him but he says he is contented to part and he bids me be happy without him i come then my dear aunt i will rejoin you my beloved parent you will take your forsaken arabella to your bosom you will comfort her the best you can and we will part no more  here her words were suffocated by sobs and a burst of affliction but still continuing my posture i am guilty my love i cried i am guilty past pardon alas you have been wedded to weakness and frailty ill deserving of purity and perfection like yours but i will live if you desire it my arabella i will live to repent my follies and to repair my defaults but i cannot a minute longer survive your displeasure  she then beckoned me to rise and sit beside her which i did when reaching one arm about my neck and gently leaning over she joined her face to mine and silently shed her sorrows into my bosom  soon after i perceived that she was seized with a kind of shivering and calling to the girl i ordered her in all haste to warm the bed and i assisted my wife directly to undress  as soon as she lay down and was somewhat composed i stepped to my friends apartment i found him leaning on a table with his eyes downcast like the image of discomfort stooping over a monument what is the matter i said what ails my dear longfield i hope i have not offended him past forgiveness indeed i am not well says he heavens what an overcasting of such a sunshine too do not look at me hammy i cannot bear to be looked at i beseech you to leave me to my own thoughts till morning i understand you mr longfield i cried i confess myself no longer worthy of your friendship and i shall no more demand it of you till you condescend to make the tender and so saying i suddenly quitted his chamber  all night my arabella was cold and hot by turns and her sleep was discomposed by starts and moanings in the morning i observed that her breath was short and feverish and i got up in haste and went for a physician the doctor refused to pronounce with certainty on her disorder but said that he greatly feared she was taking an ague  as soon as he had written his prescription i went eagerly to wish mr longfield a good morning and to apologize for the abruptness of last nights behavior but my longfield had taken a long adieu and this letter which i shall ever preserve about me was all i had left to console me for his loss or rather to give me cause to lament his departure for ever  to mr h clement i leave you dearest of friends and i leave you for ever wretch that i am to have brought affliction on the only two for whom i would have lived for whom i would have died  heavens what a fate is mine i voluntarily depart and i go where i must be miserable since i leave those whose sight and converse made the whole of my enjoyment that which doubles my unhappiness is partly to suspect that i have been guilty is it any alleviation that i had no knowledge of my fault and that i now fly from it on the first notice  your arabella my hammy i begin to fear that i loved your arabella alas i feel that i still love her and that i must love her during life i loved her indeed with a tenderness full of infinite respect but the pangs i suffer at parting give me also to understand that i loved her with infinite passion  ah fond and foolish passion that could neither hope nor wish nor even accept of any kind of gratification save the sight and society of the object of its ardour no most amiable of men were it possible for your arabella to stray but in thought from her truth from her duty from her tenderness to you i could have loved her no longer she would have lost that seraphic excellence that more than mortal purity for which i almost adored her which gave a sweet apology to my heart for its affection and betrayed me into a persuasion that i loved her no more than i ought  i am jealous for you my friend i am jealous of myself in your dearer behalf and i will amply avenge you on the injurious and hapless longfield  ah let no man henceforward confide to his own strength i daily beheld your arabella i daily conversed with her but i saw not my danger i therefore did not resist the current that drew me beyond my depth the gracefullness of her motions the sound of her voice and the loveliness of her aspect hourly sunk upon my soul with an intoxicating delight and i wished and was solicitous to become pleasing in her eyes at the time that i would have taken the life of any man who had attempted to deprive you of your smallest right in her affections  my confession has been full and reaches the utmost of my faults but from what a dream of delight has it suddenly awaked me how blessed have i been with my hammy and his arabella how happy were we in eachother surpassing the lot of mortality enchanting sensations ye are departed for ever and all the future portion that ye leave me is bitterness  but beware of one thing i conjure you beware that you never reveal the smallest hint of my love to your arabella wound not her delicacy i beseech you with so disgustful a recollection neither deprive your unhappy friend of the only consolation that now is left him an innocent though fond hope that should she ever remember your longfield it may not be with detestation  p s in the drawer of my table on the left hand you will find a nopaper carefully sealed and addressed to you it contains a poor legacy though all that could be bequeathed by   your departed ed longfield   i wept as i read this pathetic epistle i felt all the passion and anguish of my friend my breast heaved and was agitated with emotions of selfreproach and with a tide of returning tenderness to my longfield  ah unjust though most generous of men i exclaimed i alone am guilty and thou assumest to thyself a burden that thy virtue disclaims would to heaven that men and angels might love my arabella with a purity like thine she would not then as now be wholly dependent on my sole and poor guardianship for the defense of her innocence  i found seventeen guineas in the forementioned paper a most seasonable and yet a most unacceptable supply as i feared from the generosity of my longfields temper that it contained very nearly the whole of his possessions  as the doctor had conjectured my wifes distemper turned out a tertian ague and after exhausting the circle of the materia medica toward a cure the dregs of the disease settled into a rheumatism that principally affected her arms and hands and thereby prevented her from earning any subsistence for herself or her infant  it was now upward of four months since mr longfield had left us during all which time i hardly ever departed from the side of my arabella our finances were again reduced to about two guineas and this was not sufficient to discharge our sixth quarter that had been due some time i was however confident of a supply in the tutorship promised me by mr marfelt and i dressed in the best i could and waited upon him  i was concerned to find the family in black but when mr marfelt himself appeared and told me with a voice interrupted by sighs that his only son my pupil in expectance had been lately carried off by a malignant smallpox my mourning passed all shows and suits of sorrow  i took my leave with a dejection and absence of mind that forgot there was any road left for me upon earth i went i knew not where a way that led from home i saw nothing but the labyrinth within my own soul and from thence i could perceive neither outlet nor escape  rapines and robberies again offered themselves to my view as the only expedients by which heaven had ordained that my wife and my infant that virtue and innocence should be permitted to live nature has cast my lot said i to myself among tigers and vultures who have no choice save to perish or subsist by prey i dwelt long on this thought and then pushed it to extremity and the perpetration of desperate deeds again the stretch of my resolution began to relax and the tide of my thoughts flowed backward to the sensations and meltings of humanity ah i cried my fellow creatures you in whom i see myself my brothers in whose service i would gladly spend my life pardon me that i take from you what i would give you twenty fold or rather powerful author of nature i cried take from us our existence since thou refusest the means whereby we may exist  my eyes at last were opened and i perceived that i was now much further from my lodgings than when i set out from mr marfelts i turned homeward as well as i could fatigued in body and with more than a mountains weight upon my mind on the way i lifted my eyes and wrung my hands together in a kind of agony bread bread i cried inwardly merciful heaven a little but a very little bread my helpless wife my helpless infant a little pittance for them i crave it in mercy and o save me from more than the torments of the damned from beholding them famished and gasping for a morsel of sustenance before my face  i looked round and beheld nothing but scenes of luxury or plenty with joy business or content visible in the countenance of the meanest ah what is here said i to myself powerful being how partial are thy dispensations how highly are those exalted to what a depth do thou crush the wretch whom thy wrath has distinguished i am selected from among thy works i am equally the outcast of heaven and of earth might i become but as one of yonder beggars i should derive a chance morsel from that charity which now hardens itself against me against my babe and my arabella the most pitiable objects of the creation  as soon as i had crawled home another weight was added to the burden i already bore a bailiff was in waiting and my landlady with an aspect as inexorable as iron ordered me directly into custody for the last quarters rent  i was on this occasion obliged to disburse my last two guineas and further to deposit my wifes gown as a security for the small remainder of rent and caption fees i had not now wherewithal to purchase a pennyworth of bread that like the widow of sarepta my wife my child and i for this last time might sit down together and eat before we died  thus abandoned of every hope divine or human i did not dare to turn my eye to borrow patience or consolation from the countenance of the saint to whom i was united i pretended to have forgotten somewhat and again hastened out of doors the night had just fallen and was still and gloomy rage anguish and despair gave me new strength and spirits and i turned fiercely down an unfrequented street without any arms save my fury and natural phangs with which i determined like the maternal lioness to rend subsistence for my young from the first i should encounter  i perceived a man advancing at some distance i hastened to meet him and coming within a few paces stand i cried pass no further why said he with a fearless and benevolent voice is there any thing wherein you desire i should serve you oh save me i replied you must you shall save me from the terrible damnation of seeing my wife and infant famish before me god said he sends you this by my hands he sees your distress but disapproves your conduct you have now twice sinned in this way but clement beware the third time another offense like this would prove fatal to you  he spoke and putting five guineas into my hand he instantly slipped away or vanished i know not which for such was my sudden astonishment and confusion that i neither remarked nor saw what became of him  at length i awaked as from a trance i stepped up to a single lamp that glimmerd before me and opening my hand i perceived that the money which i held was gold i hurried it into my pocket and turning back i began slow and pensative to move toward home the fury with which i was so lately exasperated against heaven and earth again subsided and my heart began to change from that of a tiger and to feel a new infusion of compunction and humanity  ah i cried i am then known the darkness of the night has not been able to conceal me my guilt is laid open before god and his angels and my present and past transgressions are entered in his book he yet pities he yet relieves me he snatches me from the gulf wherein i had already plunged and saw no bottom to show me that no extremity can pass his power and that on this side of existence it is always too early to despair of his bounty i will then be patient o my god i will no more repine nor kick against thy dispensations it is sufficient that i stand within thy continued notice this last instance of thy goodness it is enough it is enough i desire no further proof of thy providence or regard and though thou kill me i will trust in thee to the latest gasp but for me it matters not how thou please to dispose of me i will surrender to thee that which is infinitely more dear i confide to thee my wife and child o that thou did love them with a love like mine but they are thine as i am thine and if they perish before my eyes why let them perish we were all born to perish before the eyes of our heavenly father and he may slay without compunction who can revive at his pleasure who would not perhaps slay us if it were not to revive us to a better life to a life that shall no more be acquainted with calamity  before i reached home a sudden faintishness came over me and turning into a dramshop i called for a quartern and changed a guinea if the other four guineas said i to myself are made of aetherial money i have however got something substantial to supply my little tommy and my dearer arabella with a morsel of bread  as soon as i got to my lodgings i redeemed my wifes gown and sent out for a frugal supper i then stepped up stairs and taking a chair just opposite to my wife i sat down and continued silent but dared not to look up she eyed me through and through my hammy says she you are apt to meet with strange adventures in very short spaces of time i know you not for the same person you are not what you were a few minutes ago  i then found myself under the necessity of openly avowing to her all that had happened but gracious heaven to my death through time and through eternity never shall i forget the reply she made  hammy said she with the face air and accent of heavens mildest minister it ill becomes me to reprove a respected husband for the excess of his goodness to me and my child and yet i have suffered more from the consideration of this excess than from all our other trials and calamities put together i love you entirely my hammy but i love that part of you most which you appear to regard the least it is a part that must survive the dissolution of all the rest their short joys their idle anxieties their fierce desires and empty possessions and it must thereafter be yourself to all eternity  when a man is bound on a voyage to some distant region he fails not to enquire into the length and dangers of the way the nature of the climate the disposition of the inhabitants what food they subsist upon and what sort of goods chiefly bear a price or value in so remote a country with such goods alone a wise voyager will load his vessel nay he will be careful to make and transmit lodgments before he sets out as also to form and establish previous friendships in that country that he may not be rejected as one unknown and unregarded when he happens to arrive ah my husband i will not adventure to ask what enquiries and provisions you have made for the great purpose  i once thought my love that learning was the principal promoter of piety as it best taught the nature of god and man their relations to eachother and the consequent duties of the creature to his creator but i have long since discovered that to know is not to feel and that argument and inclination are often as opposite as adversaries that refuse all means of reconcilement  i will suppose you for instance in the depth of your knowledge and extent of your genius the most comprehensive of all creatures and the widest discoverer of the attributes of infinity but what will this do for you my hammy you may contemplate these great objects as matters with which you are no way connected you may yet repine and curse in secret the particular dispensations of that providence whose general wisdom and propriety your philosophy admits  god with all his omnipotence can no otherwise make his image in our humanity happy than by connecting us with himself since from him we derive our existence and in him that existence can alone be continued and this connection can no way be formed but by our dependence upon him and this dependence can no way be made but by our confidence in him by feeling that in ourselves or the world around us there is neither footing nor hold to save from finking for ever and by catching at god alone for the support of that existence which his bounty bestowed  it is this confidence my dear husband which is called by the name of faith throughout the gospel which strengthens all weaknesses which heals all diseases which enlightens all blindness which may be capable of omnipotence by its connection with god and in his power can perform all manner of wonders at least hammy we ought to have such a portion of this faith as might enable us to say to the worst that can befall what the three jewish captives said to the king of assyria our god is able to deliver us and he will in time deliver us from all these afflictions but though he should not deliver us we will not forsake our hold and our confidence in him neither bow to any temptation that guilt can set up  from the beginning to this day the world has ever proved a traitor to those who trusted in it and o my hammy that you would join with me in looking only to the principle from whence salvation can come to a poor and impotent creature for all creatures are poor and impotent in themselves even the cherubim and seraphim the mightiest and most exlated of the works of omnipotence would be reduced to a state of nothingness by an independence on their creator  since god therefore cannot communicate happiness to a being who refuses to trust in his goodness or to repose upon his power where he is peculiarly favorable and determines to take a faithless though beloved creature to himself he blesses him with all sorts of crosses and disappointments he breaks under him all the props of worldly confidence he snatches from him the helps on which his hope had laid hold that in the instant of sinking he may finally compel him to catch at his creator and to throw himself on the bosom of that infinite benevolence which is desirous of receiving him to everlasting rest  be pleased to reflect my love how affectionately solicitous if i may venture to say so your savior has been to win you to himself he has left you by turns to the confidence of a variety of the most promising establishments as first in the success of your own talents when they acquired you as much weekly as might subsist you for a year again when you had all the right that man could have to rely on the honor and even the interests of the government for whom you were so prosperously and profitably engaged and again in the rencounter and preservation of your father on whom nature and your own merits had further given you an indefeisible title and foundation for dependence but you may remember my hammy that your god caught all these and all other the like pillars as suddenly from under you as though they had been instantly changed to a void and yet you did not appear at those times to discern that it was no other than your heavenly father and your heavenly friend who contrived by such crosses to wean you from impotence and to woo and to win you from your courtship of a cloud to an affiance with essential and infinite beauty  i am your loving and humble wife my husband and this is your dear and promising infant but what are we further to you you neither made us nor can you preserve us nor are you obliged to provide for us beyond your weak and finite endeavors commit us then to him in whom we have our existence and know that should he permit this innocent to suffer and my confidence in his mercy to fail of support the retribution is instantly and infinitely in his hands and his excess will even consist in the overflowings of his goodness  i love you my hammy too much too intensely for my own peace here i will say nothing of my interests in an eternal hereafter and yet my darling were it put to my choice i would rather famish with you from hour to hour and day to day provided you perished content and resigned and in a blessed conformity to the will of your creator than to enjoy in conjunction with you for a million of ages all that this world can bestow till its dissolution  here ended my arabella but the sweetness of her voice continued to vibrate in my ear like the tone of a fine tuned harp when the finger has ceased to touch the sounding strings  she had opportunely laid hold of the season for making the impression she desired as my mind was still affected and softened by the late adventure i did not indeed yet behold the world or its author in the light by which they are represented in the christian system but even in the eye of philosophy all that my wife had said appeared reasonable and right and conformable to the nature of a being infinitely powerful benevolent and wise here was a principle without whose continued will and operation no one thing in the universe could either begin or continue to exist and as all things in that universe must of necessity depend upon him he had of necessity an equal claim to their confidence in him i reflected indeed that he had hitherto permitted much of evil to intermingle with the beauties both of material and moral nature but this i held to be well accounted for if we considered him as a being who chose to work by progression as first by producing a chaos out of nothing and again by producing the present system out of chaos and lastly by preparing the present system for a final state of unchangeable and consummate perfection i therefore held it incumbent to bear the bruisings of mortality with content and thankfulness as a matter previously necessary to our future sublimation even as the coarse earth of china must be crushed and pounded to powder before it can obtain that purity and consistence which renders it capable of the final polish and beauty  i am apt sir to think that there are very few men who do not at different times behold the world and its creator in very different lights according to the different events with which they are affected or according to the different tempers which a change of constitution will frequently produce if a man is in health and finds successes coming upon him from several quarters all is summer all is sunshine he sees nothing but a delightful world and a wise and benevolent disposer thereof he feels no want he perceives nothing amiss and therefore thinks that all is full and that all is right in the very next hour let the very same man be but crossed in his fortunes or distempered in his blood and his universe shall be covered with a sudden gloom the world which he now beholds shall be crowded with objects of wretchedness divine providence shall appear to him as a daemoniac dispensation of all kinds of evil and though he may not dare to say he will secretly think that if he had the formation and ordering of nature he would never have had the malevolence to fill it with tempests earthquakes inclemencies plagues pestilences famines tumults wars devastations strifes violences murders griefs losses calamities rage vexations disappointments pains diseases and deaths  again sir i am apt to think that there are very few men who do not depend upon this world for happiness as our first parents depended on a tree a mere piece of vegetable wood for the conferring of wisdom and divinity upon them they will tell you indeed that human life is short that even that short term is hourly determinable by a thousand trifling accidents that it is subject to a number of unavoidable calamities that all its joys are transient and ever followed by a weighty reverse of pain and that even its best possessions are attended by cares that overbalance their value they say true but to what purpose they regret that things are so without learning to prize them the less and they repine at the miseries that are incident to mortality as it were at a distemper for which however they never think of providing a remedy they tell you that the world is a broken staff yet they still lean upon it they curse it and yet cling to it as to their only blessing and thus sir it is most likely that from the beginning of things to their final dissolution each man will be seeking on earth for a happiness to which no other person could ever attain it is a happiness for which the immortal soul is athirst and though she finds the whole world no better than an empty vessel she is never tired of her trials and endeavors to drink  this however was not altogether the case between the world and me at this period i had been so bruised and buffeted and treated with such severity and bitterness by it that i neither looked nor wished for any advantage from it i therefore cast about for some kinder support and i said to myself as the best lover of earthly happiness may say with great truth if there is not another state to which this system of things is merely preparatory if there is not some infinite good to be derived from this world of multiplied evils the author thereof must have been some very malevolent or very petulent being who delights in the misery and anguish of others or makes sport of the wretchedness of the creatures of his power neither can angels or men invention or reason any otherwise account for the present calamitous state of mortal nature  in these sentiments i eagerly applied for further instruction to those writings that had brought life and immortality to light i began at the creation and proceeded with the deepest attention and delight again another system of matter and morals another world and another god presented themselves before me but i shall not here detain you with an account of my new faith as i may justly call it for though i always had held myself vulgarly speaking a christian i found on examination that i had been wholly a stranger to the necessity as well as beauty of the christian dispensation neither had i felt a single ray of its comforting influence  my wife began now to recover of her rhumatism and hoped soon again to be able to take in work i determined however to be beforehand with her if possible for at this time i regarded not how mean or humiliating my occupation would be provided i might earn any kind of lawful and honest bread  accordingly as i rambled in search of such employment i observed a porter attending before the door of a tavern clad in an ordinary frock with a belt about his waste and an apron before him i thereupon went to monmouth street and purchased a uniform for the like purpose i then passed through several streets till i came to a splendid tavern where no porter was in waiting i stepped over the way where i deposited my former coat with a poor hucksterwoman to whom i promised some small matter for the trouble i gave her i then dressed in my porterly robes and applying to the chief drawer i promised him part of my earnings provided he put me into speedy employment  i had not stayed long till i was dispatched to a considerable distance with a letter i was afterward sent on a variety of errands and messages and by the close of the day i had accumulated three shillings six pence whereof i gave to the drawer i then stepped in high triumph to my friend the huckster woman i gave her two pence reassumed my former garb and left my weeds in her custody i returned home with a satisfaction to which i had been a stranger of a long time and i that night eat heartily talked cheerfully and slept in peace  i continued this occupation during five successive days in one of which i earned to the amount of five shillings  it is sure that laying personal pain and the social feelings apart human happiness does not in any way depend on the degrees of station or fortune or on any external circumstance whatever it is merely domestic it is wholly imbosomed and cannot live from home i was now engaged in one of the lowest and least lucrative employments of life but a divine friend was at hand of whose favor i was confident i was content i was cheerful and i felt a peace within that passed all the understanding i should otherwise have had of happiness though i had been in possession of the crownrevenues  late on the fifth night of my new occupation as i was on my return and within a few doors of my lodging i was seized and assaulted by four men who were porters as i found by the sequel i struggled the best i could and got one of them under me but the rest fell upon me and cuffed kicked and bruised me in a miserable manner oy they cried you are a gentleman and be damned and yet thief as you are you must steal into our business and glean away the few pence by which we get our daily bread but well cure you for carrying of burdens we warrant you  they would undoubtedly have murdered me had i not feigned myself already dead but observing that i lay without any signs of life they made off in haste  i rose as well as i was able and holding by the rails and wall got with difficulty home where crawling up stairs my wife helped to undress me and i went to bed  she then sent for our old physician who ordered me some potions with outward fomentations to assuage the contusions i was however seized that night with a violent fever which continued upward of three weeks but without any delirium and within another week i was able to sit up though still very weak and greatly ematiated  our last five guineas with the fruits of my late employment were now nearly expended on doctor drugs and so forth wherefore i found it necessary to abridge our domestic charge as close as possible and having sent our girl with a token for my porters habiliments i gave them to her in lieu of what remained of her wages and with the help of an additional shilling discharged her  i was now able to bear the light and the windows were half opened but how was i shocked on observing that my arabella and my little tommy were as pale and as much fallen away as myself for arabella had half starved her infant and almost wholly starved herself in order to save sufficient for my sustenance during my illness yet she bore up with a sweet and smiling semblance and in her alone was realized all that ever i have seen of the boasted patience of stoicism or of the power of christianity in effecting a new nature  within a little time i was once more able to walk about the room when on the day preceding that wherein our quarters rent was to become due mrs jennett entered with a face wherein was prefaced whatever insolence hardness of heart or contempt of our wretched situation could dictate mr clement says she if so be your name be clement i suppose i am not to tell you that tomorrow is quarter day and yet if some people mr clement cannot afford to eat i cannot see how they can afford to pay rent mr clement and so you know it is every bit as comfortable to starve in jail as in lodgings but this is nothing to the purpose i am myself but a poor woman and no better than richer folks yet poor as i am comparisons may be odious between some people and some people and then i dont come for charity i come for nothing but my own and that you know is the least that will satisfy any body if you had any one else to befriend you but myself you might a been put upon the parish before this but as i was saying i cannot be an only friend and all friends at once and i must tell you that i hate objects for i have so much pity in my nature that it pains me to look at em and above all i cannot abide em in my own house and so as i told you mr constable will be here in the morning and he will show you to lodgings that will fit you much better and so mr clement and mrs clement if so be that your names be clement i wish ye both a mighty good morning and so away she went without waiting an answer  as soon as she was gone hammy says arabella our kind landlady puts me in mind of the wife of honest socrates whom he took for the trial and exercise of his patience ah how cringing was this woman how insolent is servility when it attains any power but what i wonder is become of our friends the miss hodginses i would have sent to inquire after them but i was petted at their neglect of us during our long illness i will step there this minute and borrow as much at least as will snatch my hammy from the fangs of this fury  so saying weak as she was she dressed herself with a cheerful air and going pleasantly repeated your servant mr clement if so be that your name be clement i wish you a mighty good morning  she was not long abroad and on her return i observed a kind of heavenly radiance that seemed to beam through her countenance from whence i prophesied all manner of happy success but continuing silent for some time and looking eagerly at me she suddenly threw herself into my bosom and burst into tears  ah hammy she cried i had hopes i was very stout but frail nature in spite of grace confesses me a coward i thought i could have seen you perish with patience with delight provided i saw a happy immortality before you but now that your sufferings are at hand i find them insupportable i tremble also for your faith lest it should not support you under the impending trial yes hammy all is over all is finished my love and the hand of our god is in it our dear miss hodginses were not to blame the eldest died suddenly since we saw them and the youngest is with a distant relation in the country we have nothing further to hope neither to fear from this world our god has shut us out by every door and will neither permit the friendship the humanity or charity of others neither our own industry or ingenuity to yield us a morsel of bread to convince us that we are his and that all things are his that when he opens his hand there is plenty on every side but when he pleases to shut there is no resource what say you then my husband are you willing to run this last short course the prize is glorious unspeakable and lies within a very few paces of your grasp you must run it my husband and your repugnance would but serve to make it insufferable but patience and courage would give you strength to endure and a little further conformity to the will of our disposer would turn all the bitterness into delight our time is done our task is finished we are already brought to nothing that our all may be in god  yes i answered it is evident from a chain of successive proofs i see the hand of god in all that concerns us and i am pleased with any instances of his notice and attention whatever his final purpose may be i will no longer struggle with his omnipotence nor make my ignorance a soundingline for his unbottomed wisdom if to see you and our little innocent thus famishing by the hour if in contemplating your wants and imagining your pains i feel an anguish above what death can give why let it be rend heart into a thousand pieces a period must at length be put to our sufferings and all beyond shall be peace or what god pleases but do you arabella do you lead the way my patroness my director i will endeavor to keep the brightness of your example in view that neither here nor hereafter i may lose sight of her without whom here or hereafter i think i cannot be happy  about nine the next morning our landlady entered followed by two constables and two appraisers thus authorized as she imagined the first thing she did was to search our pockets for money but without effect as we had expended our last penny the day before for bread she however found my wifes case of scissars and other implements for her business and gathering up our boxes linen handkerchiefs and a variety of articles which we never had a notion of converting into money she laid them all before the appraisers who on frequent consultation valued the same to four pounds nine shillings my wifes gown included being nine and thirty shillings more than we owed but this our honest landlady very prudently observed was scarce sufficient for costs and other damages which she had suffered or might have suffered or might yet suffer on our accounts  thus we were turned out almost naked to the mercy of the elements o how deeply degraded below the birds of the air the beasts of the forest or even the worms of the sod who rightfully claim sustenance from the earth whereof they were bred and have some hole apart whereto they may creep for shelter  the world indeed lay before us it was wide and all sufficient and yet nothing to our purpose we had neither act or part conern or interest therein it was to us as a harbor to tempestbeaten mariners who are shut out and driven thence on suspicion of the plague  all hopeless weak and faint we took our way we knew not whither without home whereto we might travel or point whereto we might steer we could think of no one living who would receive or acknowledge us and we seemed to have no way save that of hastening as fast as we could from the presence of mankind  slow and tottering as we went my wife and i carried our little tommy by turns and in the smoother places he walked with the help of our hands thus with much toil and fatigue we got out of london and reposed ourselves on a bank that lay a little off the causeway here we found ourselves greatly distressed with thirst and getting up again we made toward a small hut that stood beside the road where they had the charity to treat us with a draught of cold water with this we were wonderfully refreshed and recruited and putting on again hammy says my arabella no conqueror on his triumphal entry into rome ever exulted as i do in your fortitude this day and what signifies it now that it comes to the test it is but to travel my love till we can travel no further and then we drop fit and ready and ripe for eternity o how sweet it is to perish with a patience that is pleased how fearful how horrible to die struggling and kicking against the almighty  as we went gently along still mutually supporting and exhorting eachother i applied for alms from time to time to a number of passengers but my voice and address were so feebly importunate or their attention was so engaged on distant and different matters that my oratory returned as empty as it set out  at length i met a poor beggarman with a wife and seven children following in a train i looked at him wistfully and having civily saluted him i entreated some little matter from his bag or his can to keep my infant from perishing on the highway gods mercy master says the charitable mendicant i am very sorry to see any body poorer than myself but the truth is that i have traveled a great way and have eat and drunk all with a pox except this last two pence halfpenny here it is master gods blessing go along with it i grieve and shall grieve that it is not two pounds for your sake  in expectation of the refreshment we should derive from this supply we kept on at a creeping pace till we came to a little ale house that stands about half a mile from this town there we entered and called for a penny worth of bread and a pint of drink with some milk for the child while we sat to repose ourselves the poor man of the house having eyed me with a kind of earnest compassion you look said he to be in much trouble but if your trouble is of a kind that may be cured there is one mr fenton at hand whom god has placed in this country as the sun in heaven to give comfort to all within his reach  my heart revived within me at these tidings and was further prophetic of some happy revolution having finished our pint and laid up the remainder of our bread in store we discharged our reckoning and set out on our last stage  the prospect of speedy relief and the possibility that it might not arrive too late gave us spirits beyond our powers and we pushed on till we came nearly opposite to this house though we did not then know to whom it belonged here slackening our pace we found ourselves growing extremely sick whether it was that we were overpowered by the late nourishment we had taken or by a toil and fatigue that surpassed our abilities  hammy said my arabella god be praised it is done it is finished i die my hammy but i would not die within the gaze of public passengers help me into the field if you are able my love i have no further use for charity now save that of laying my limbs with decency in the ground  she spoke nor had i the power to answer but overcome as i was by sickness and anguish i exerted myself to help her through the turnstile and sitting down on the sod i laid her head in my lap where she fainted away and there we remained in the situation in which your charity found us  friend your story of clement my friend is truly interesting and in some passages may be edifying also i have only to observe that it is too long for an episode and that the character of your heroine milliner is constrained and unnatural it is elevated above the fortitude and virtues of man himself but quite out of the sight and soaring of any of her weak and silly sex had she been a princess and empress she could not have figured in your history with greater dignity   author there lay my error sir unhappily i did not reflect that royalty or station were necessary to christian resignation and lowliness of temper   fr your drollery is more provoking than argumentative i must tell you sir i was not speaking of the lowliness but of the fortitude of your arabella indeed it exceeds every thing that i have met in romance such an exaltation of female character is of evil influence among the sex each woman will be apt to arrogate some of the merit to herself their vanity will be inflated and they will rise on the stilts of arabella to a presumptuous level with their natural lords and masters women unquestionably have their becoming qualities in the bedchamber kitchen and nursery they are useful to man but beyond these my friend they are quite out of the element of nature and commonsense   aut i have sadly mistaken this whole affair it seems i actually apprehended that woman might be admitted as a companion to man and was intended occasionally to soften his temper and polish his manners they have at times formed governors legislators and heroes the great pericles derived all the powers of his oratory and the elegance of his taste from the example and instructions of the lovely aspasia and the grachi also caught the spirit of their eloquence and the fire of their patriotism from their mother cornelia   fr pshaw the women you have mentioned were but as single luminaries perhaps one in many centuries who shot away and shone out of their appointed spheres   aut mayhap i can produce still better authority to prove to you my friend that woman was not merely intended to form and instruct us to soften and polish the rudeness of our mass she was also appointed to native empire and dominion over man   fr by all means my dear sir i am quite impatient to be instructed in the policies and constitution of this your petticoat government   aut whenever you shall be pleased to turn over to the third chapter of the first book of the prophet esdras you will there find it written to the following purpose  in the reign of darius hystaspes successor to the grand cyrus whom you may have read of in romance darius made a great feast to all his princes and nobles chief captains and governors of his hundred and twenty seven provinces  and at the feast three young and princely geniuses arose and offered to dispute for preeminence before the great assembly and the question turned on what was strongest and the first said wine is strongest and the second said the king is strongest and the third said woman is strongest and then the advocate for the bottle thus began  o ye princes bear me testimony that wine gives and takes away according to its mightiness it takes away the strength and capacities of nature and gives powers virtues and talents of its own acquiring  it trips up the wrestler and lays a giant low and bears the feeble and the fearful into the midst of the battle  wine is an opener of hearts and a revealer of secrets it raises hope into certainty and gives jollity and enjoyment in exchange for care  it unfolds the purse of the usurer and enriches the needy and frees the prisoner from his chain and the debtor from his obligation  it levels the rich and the poor the high and the low the king and the clown to one temper and condition it can set companions friends and brothers at variance and cause rivals competitors and enemies to embrace  wine enlarges the narrow heart and thaws the frozen understanding it instructs the ignorant in arts and to the silent and illiterate gives phrase and elocution  it can elevate the peasant from a cottage to a throne for he who is drunk is as great as an emperor  o ye princes what in nature can be stronger than that by which all the powers of nature are inverted or surpassed  and having so spoken he held his peace  then arose the advocate for kingly dominion and waving his hand thus addressed the assembly  o princes how short and sickly is the influence of wine it passes away as a vapor at the dawning we recollect it with disgust or remember nothing thereof but all power that is stable or durable subsists in majesty  the king is but one man among a hundred and twenty seven nations of men yet he overseeth connects and governs the whole his are the honors counsels and strength of all his people  the sun who from on high looks down on the wide world beholds not at once the extent of our kings dominion he must travel for the prospect through the blue expanse of heaven and leave the western nations involved in night when his beam begins to rise on their fellow subjects in the orient  for the king they plow and they sow they reap and plant vineyards for him the stars shine and shed influences upon earth and the seasons change to yield our monarch variety of productions for him the fruits ripen the shrubs drop their balm and the blossoms breathe their odours all winds blow incense to him and the four quarters of the world pay him tribute day by day  if he bids to build they build and if he bids to lay waste the nations are made desolate bliss and bane life and death ruin and restoration are in the breath of his lips  if he cries war it is war the banners of blood are let loose to the wind and the sound of the clarion kindles all men to battle his hosts cloth themselves in harness and range in terrible array and his horses begin to neigh and tear up the ground and his chariots to roll as distant thunders they move and cover the earth wide as the eye can reach the forests are laid flat the mountains shake beneath them and neither the rocks nor rivers impede the march of his armies they trample into dust the fruits of the field and the labors of the industrious houses vineyards and standingcorn the villages and towns smoke and flame on every side  yet none ask the king wherefore is peace or wherefore is war for he stands exalted on ruin and is glorified in destruction his word is the bolt of irresistible power and his will makes the appointment and sanctitude of law  and having so said he sat down amid the applauses of the whole assembly  lastly slow and bashful arose the young advocate for the fair and bowing thrice around let his words go forth as the breathing of soft music  great o princes great is the strength of wine and much greater the strength and glory of majesty but yet there is a power that tempers and moderates to which rulers themselves pay delightful obedience  man is as the rough and crude element of earth unmollified by the fluidity of water and light heaven therefore sent woman gentle bright and beauteous woman to sooth form and illumine the rudeness of his mass  she comes upon man in the meekness of water and in the brightness of the morningbeam she imperceptibly infuses love and delight into him and bids his affections go forth upon kindred and country  the planter who planted the vineyard and the vintner who pressed the grape were born of woman and by woman alone the subject and the sovereign receive existence with all that can make existence advantageous or desirable  she brings man forth in his weakness and she brings him up to his strength he is fostered in her bosom he is nourished with her substance and he imbibes into his being the sweetness of humanity with the milk of his mother  without woman where would be father or where would be child where the relations endearments and connections of kindred the charities that bind the wide world together into one inclusive family the great brotherhood of man  she comes not against you in the hostility of weapons or fearfulness of power she comes in the comfort and mild light of beauty she looks abashed and takes you captive she trembles and you obey yet here is is the surest of all signories on earth for her dominion is sweet and our subjection is voluntary and a freedom from her yoke is what no man could bear  there are no forms of human government that can exempt us from her sway no system of laws that can exclude her authority do we not study toil and sweat and go forth in the darkness and put our face to every danger to win and bring home treasure and ornaments to our love even the robbers and savage spoilers of mankind grow tame to the civilizing prerogative of beauty  if men seek peace it is to live in kindly society with woman and if they seek war it is to please her with the report and renown of their valor  even the highest the mightiest the lord of lords and king of kings is caught in the fascinating net of his apame i saw her seated by his side she took the crown from his head and gave it new luster by the beauty of her brow and the brightness of her tresses i saw her chide him in her playfulness and strike him in her petulance yet he pressed the hand of her pleasing presumption to his lips he gazed fondly and fixedly on her if she laughed he laughed also but if she affected displeasure he spoke and looked submission and was fain to plead and sue for reconcilement  here ended the blooming orator the monarch rose from his throne and gave loud applause and the roofs resounded with the shouts and acclamations of the assembly  wherefore it was decreed by the laws of the medes and persians that female beauty ought to govern the world in meekness and that men owed thereunto a voluntary obedience   fr pray my good sir this same esdras is it among the canonical books   aut i cannot affirm that it is but it is held as authentic and very sacred i assure you   fr it is a pity that your system of female government should be apocryphal but since you have not proved their dominion to be jure divino permit me to retain my faith and to go on with my story   chap ix mr clement said mr fenton i am singularly obliged and instructed by your story the incidents of your life have been very extraordinary and have been evidently accompanied by the control and attention of a peculiar providence the same providence is undoubtedly with and over all his works though we are not willing to admit him in what we call common occurrences and which we think we can account for without his interposition but in the passages of your story we see omnipotence walking along with you step for step by sudden successes by calamities as sudden compelling you to attend to him wrenching every other prop and support from your dependence shutting every other prospect and resource from your sight and never forsaking you in weal or in woe till he had fully convinced you of his fellowship and regard and had reconciled you to the bitterest of the dispensations of your creator  your story my dear friend has been generally conversant in middle or low life and i observe that there is scarce a circumstance in it which might not have happened to any body on any day of the year and yet in the whole i find a chain of more surprising and affecting events than i have met with in history or even in romance  god i see has made use of very severe methods to call you and as i may say to compel you to come in but do you think mr clement that any methods less severe would have been equally effectual you must admit they would not and this demonstrates to me the difficulty and almost the impossibility of diverting any man from that habit of thinking and acting which he contracts from the people with whom he is daily conversant in a world of saints a sinner must be a devil but in a world of sinners the man who has grace to deviate must be a saint indeed  had i been in your situation on the day in which you say my charity relieved you i should have thought myself very little beholden to that person who would have plucked me back from my opening paradise into a world of whose woes i had been so justly weary no no my friend i did you and your arabella the worst office as i think that ye will ever receive it was not to you that god intended any benefit by restoring you to life it was to those and i hope they are many in number who are to have the advantage of your example and instructions it is an advantage of which i also propose to avail myself and i request you in behalf of my little harry in particular to accept your first retainer from our hands  so saying mr fenton carelessly slid a purse of a hundred guineas into clementss coat pocket and hastily calling to know if supper was ready left the room without ceremony  in about an hour the cloth was laid and mr fenton ordered his family to be called together he had seldom seen arabella and never had noticed her for fear of adding to that confusion with which he saw her oppressed at their first meeting but now his senses were all open and alive for observation and on her entrance he saluted her as he would have received and saluted a descending seraph  she had not yet recovered her flesh or her complexion and mr fenton for some time looked at her in vain to discover those striking and irresistible beauties to which lust had fallen a victim by which friendship had been seduced and to which a whole people had borne joint testimony by a voucher of public prostration and applause but of all that mr fenton had previously thought necessary for producing such extraordinary and astonishing effects he saw nothing but a sentiment of lowliness throughout a something in face in voice and in motion that was lovely for no other reason that he could find but for its being quite impossible that it should not be beloved  when they had sat down to table and eat and chatted awhile on indifferent matters dada says harry sure mrs clement is a greater scholar than mr vindex and she taught me a latin lesson to day and i would rather learn five lessons from her than one from him for she cannot look so cross at me as mr vindex do you think she can dada no harry i think not says mr fenton if she can find in her heart to be cross she cannot find it in her face and so we shall know nothing of the matter well well dada says harry for all that i am sure she cannot find in her heart to whip half so hard and so i dont repent of my bargain what bargain harry why says harry you must know that she is to be my tutor and i am to pay her at the rate of twenty kisses a day but indeed it is not an honest bargain as you shall hear poor mrs clement has cheated herself most sadly for every kiss i give her i take two away and they are the sweetest kisses you ever got in your life  here poor arabella was put sadly to the blush though she could not help joining in the laugh of the company  harry says mr fenton you talk as feelingly of kisses as if you had been the son and heir of one secundus who wrote a very ingenious treatise on the subject but pray mrs clement do you understand the languages ah sir said arabella again blushing i fear that my young lover has brought me into a sad scrape i know nothing indeed sir that does not serve to put me in mind of my own ignorance ah what a boast is there replied mr fenton the wisdom of solomon and all subsequent philosophers fall infinitely short of such an extent of knowledge but tell me hammel continued mr fenton does your arabella understand the latin and greek languages not that ever i knew of i do assure you sir said clement and yet i thought i had discovered the limits of her talents though i despaired of ever reaching the extent of her virtues  hammy hammy said arabella would you banish me from a table where conversation makes the feast and mr fenton is a speaker but sir since my desire of instructing this your little harry the dearest and loveliest of all human creatures has brought me to the shame of betraying a foolish smattering in such matters i will tell you how it happened  my dear good father was a clergyman and as his living was very small he derived his principal income from boarding and instructing the children of the neighboring gentlemen as i was his only child he loved me to a faulty excess and hardly ever suffered me to be out of his sight i used therefore to work at my sampler in his schoolroom and the frequent repetitions which the boys made of their lessons insensibly and involuntarily forced themselves upon my memory i was by degrees infected with the desire of knowing something of what engaged the whole attention of all about me the floor and the windows were often spread with books which i took up and perused in private at my pleasure and at length i was applied to by most of the scholars as well for my assistance in framing their exercises as for my powerful mediation in saving them from the lash  my error in thus wandering from the sphere of my sex will appear as i hope the more excusable when i assure you sir that from the moment i entered the world with my dear deceased aunt i never looked into one of those my favorite authors though i still retain many of the passages in them but above all i shall never forget the indiscretion of homer in his character of hector the great enemy of greece the poet appears to make a mighty parade of the power the valor and virtue of his countrymen he further gives them the whole merit and justice of the cause and he calls upon gods and men in their favor for the righting and reformation of iniquity and offense but does he give you the sensible and odious instances of this iniquity on the part of the adversary by no means as i take it he sums up all troy and even all asia in the character and prowess of a single man on the part of the trojans on the side of the delinquents you see nothing but hector you hear of nothing but hector and again what do you hear of him or what do you see of him even all that is admirable all that is amiable whatever can be severally culled and collected from the worth and the sweetnesses of humannature in his submissions to his king in his attachments to his country in his filial affections in his conjugal delicacies in his paternal fears and feelings in his ardour for his friends in his humanity to his enemies and even in his piety to the gods that he worshipped no deduction from his courage according to ancient arithmetic i should be glad i say to know in what history true or feigned i might find his fellow  how injudiciously then did this author connect an iniquitous cause with so righteous a person to whom no one living could take exception and with whom no one living could cordially be at variance in favor therefore of hector you wish well to the abettors of the ravishers of helen and in favor of hector you are almost tempted to wish ill to those generous patriots who at the risque of their honors their fortunes and their lives came to vindicate the undoubted rights of their country and consequently the rights of all mankind  but  but  is there no one so friendly here as to interrupt me before all my folly is let out  you have no such friend here i assure you madam said mr fenton  well well gentlemen said arabella blushing deeper than before i leave ye to laugh away and i would stay and laugh with ye with all my heart at any expense but that of female learning ye know and so saying up she started and away she would have flown but mr fenton got between her and the door  mrs clement mrs clement said he would you serve us so do but think what sort of a world this would be without a woman and then think what a figure this humdrum hammy of yours and i should make without you so saying he took her hand and replaced her in her chair but why continued he why all this blushing my dear mrs clement indeed my child it is a compliment that we cannot deserve  ah sir cried mrs clement it is a compliment which i would very gladly spare if i could help it but i must be a very guilty body to be sure and my faults i find must be very much my enemies when they are ready to fly in my face every moment  why mrs clement said mr fenton do you hold blushing to be any evidence of guilt certainly sir said arabella it can be nothing but a consciousness of somewhat amiss that ought to give shame to any sensible person mr sergeant clement cried mr fenton pray what is your judgment on the case in hand  in truth sir said clement it is a case to which i am not prepared to plead i have indeed heard many and various opinions on the subject though generally coinciding with that of my arabella and more particularly in conversations of ribald entendre i have heard it affirmed that the blushing of a woman is a sure proof of her understanding much more than became her  hold there cried mr fenton the mere understanding of good or evil can no more be a fault in the creature than in the creator the essence of guilt bears no reference to knowledge but consists in the approbation of evil alone a woman therefore who blushes at what she disapproves blushes not for herself but for the faults of her rude and illmannered company who have not the grace to blush for themselves  when i speak here of blushing i would not be understood by any means to include the flushings of desire or the reddenings of anger or any such like turbulent and irregular emotions i mean no other than that ready expression of shame which as our arabella sweetly hinted just now arises from an apprehension of something being amiss in ourselves or others but who or what is it that apprehends in this case is it guilt that is afraid or ashamed of guilt no surely it is virtue alone that can fear or be ashamed of the neighborhood of its adversary  i will take an instance from a person who is actually guilty of something very enormous and who blushes on his being questioned or suspected of the transgression his blushing here demonstrates his sensibility and his sensibility demonstrates some principle within him that disapproved and reproached him for what he had committed and so long as this spark or principle remains unquenched in the bosom so long as the wicked themselves can feel compunction and be ashamed of wickedness so long their recovery is not to be despaired of  it is therefore from the fountain of virtue alone that this flush of shamefacedness can possibly flow and a delicacy of compunction on such occasions is as a sensitive plant of divinity in the soul that feels shrinks and is alarmed on the slightest apprehension of approaching evil  well sir said arabella allowing all that you have advanced in behalf of blushers and that is doing them more favor than i fear they deserve can it amount to more than this that however faulty they may be they still have goodness enough to acknowledge their guilt or in other words that they have the justice to be ashamed of themselves  yes madam said mr fenton it amounts to much more and you know that it does but you are a wicked little sophister and deserve to be punished by our yielding to you the cause that you have undertaken against yourself  when i observed that nothing but virtue could undesignedly express a disapprobation of vice i ought further to have observed that the greater and the purer the more excellent and more vivid that this virtue is the more apt it will be to take alarm at the bare apprehension of having said or done or of being suspected to have said or done or thought of any thing amiss or contrary to its own nature  as far as a guilty person loves and is reconciled to guilt it becomes a part of himself and he cannot blush at it but goodness will blush in a closet in a desert in darkness on fearing it was in danger to have said or done any thing unbecoming or disgustful to its own sensibilities for a delicate virtue is like a delicate chastity that will blush to have been seen or even suspected to have been seen within the suburbs of drury  but again where such a delicate virtue is accompanied by lowliness there needs not any thing amiss nor the slightest apprehension of any thing amiss to excite this sweet confusion in the soul and in the countenance humility will blush to be found in the presence of those whom it reveres it will blush to be thought of either too meanly or too highly by those whose favorable opinion it wishes to merit and i once knew a lady blush for being detected of accomplishments that would have been matter of pride and boasting to any other woman  this graceful effusion of a virtuous and humble heart is as i once hinted the highest and generally the most grateful compliment that a person can pay to the company as it is an expression of deference and a comparative acknowledgment of superior merit but it is more peculiarly amiable in your sex mrs clement it is that shamefacedness so grateful to god and man and which in scripture is called the most becoming clothing and best ornament of a woman  however my dear child as this emotion is generally attended with some little matter of pain the present company are too much your friends to receive any kind of pleasure from a compliment as unmerited as it is wholly unnecessary and in truth there is but one thing that i can think of for which mrs clement ought to blush  pray sir dont hold me in pain what is it i beseech you it is for being a reproach almost to her whole sex  ah sir cried arabella rising smiling and blushing and curtsying down to the ground excuse me if i dont stay to hear myself so abused and turning away she swam and disappeared in an instant  as soon as she was gone clement took out his purse of a hundred guineas and pray sir said he what shall i do with all this money o as for that matter said mr fenton i know people not half so ingenious as you are who could quickly contrive to get rid of a much larger sum lay it out in decent clothing for yourself and your arabella and i will find some way to have you reimbursed in short hammel i cannot think of parting with you if my fortune may serve for a sufficient cement i will pay you two hundred guineas yearly while you stay with me and i will settle on you one thousand pounds in case of my mortality to put you into some little station of independence  sir sir cried clement hesitatingly you oppress me you  hush hush said mr fenton putting his hand to his mouth no compliments my dear friend it is not your thanks but your services that i want and you may readily make them more than an equivalent to such matters i value the instilling of a single principle of goodness or honor into the mind of my dear harry beyond all the wealth that the indies can remit ah hammel why was not that brat of yours a girl instead of a boy she might one day have been the wife of my precious harry and i should then have had some of the breed of this wonderful arabella  but hammy continued mr fenton i would not have you through any zeal or attachment to me think of pushing my boy into learning or the languages beyond his own pleasure neither would i have you oppress or perplex his infant mind with the deep or mysterious parts of our holy religion first be it your care to instruct him in morality and let the law precede the gospel for such was the education which god appointed for the world give him by familiar and historical instances an early impression of the shortness of human life and of the nature of the world in which he is placed let him learn from this day forward to distinguish between natural and imaginary wants and that nothing is estimable or ought to be desirable but so far as it is necessary or useful to man instruct my darling daily and hourly if possible in a preference of manners and things that bear an intrinsic value to those that receive their value and currency from the arbitrary and fickle stamp of fashion show him also my hammel that the same toils and sufferings the same poverty and pain from which people now fly as they would from a plague were once the desire of heroes and the fashion of nations and that thousands of patriots of captains and philosophers through a love of their country or of glory of applause during life or distinction after death have rejected wealth and pleasure embraced want and hardship and suffered more from a voluntary mortification and selfdenial than our church seems to require in these days for the conquest of a sensual world into which we are fallen and for entitling us to a crown in the kingdom of eternity  so saying mr fenton got up from table and observing that it was late wished clement a good night  our hero was now eight years of age and weekly and daily continued to be exercised in feats of bodily prowess and agility and in acts of mental benevolence and service to mankind  mr fenton had already provided his favorite with a dancing master the most approved for skill in his profession as also with a noted fencingmaster who further taught him the noble sciences of the cudgel and quarterstaff he was now on the search for the most distinguished champion of the beargarden in order to accomplish our hero in the mysteries of bruising of wrestling and of tripping and having in a short time procured the person desired he purchased for his harry a small but beautiful spanish jennett that was perfectly dressed as they call it or rid to the manage and once in every week or fortnight he accompanied his darling to the ridinghouse in islington where he saw him instructed in all the arts and elegancies of horsemanship  thus harry had his little hands as full of business as they could hold but he was naturally of an active and vivid disposition and time unemployed lay upon him as the heaviest and most irksome of all burdens he therefore proceeded from his book to his exercises and from one exercise to another as an epicure does among a number of dishes where the variety of the seasoning excites in him a new appetite to each  within a few weeks after the late dissertation upon blushing the same company being present and dinner removed harry says mr fenton tell me which of the two is the richest the man who wants least or the man who has most let me think dada says harry  why sure they are the same thing arent they dada by no means my darling cried mr fenton  there lived two famous men at the same time the one was called diogenes and the other alexander diogenes refused to accept of any worldly goods save one wooden cup to carry water to his mouth but when he found that he could drink by lying down and putting his mouth to the stream he threw his cup away as a thing that he did not want  alexander on the other side was a great conqueror and when he had conquered and got possession of all the world he fell a crying because there was not a hundred more such worlds for him to conquer now which of these two was the richest do you think  o dada exclaimed harry diogenes to be sure diogenes to be sure he who wants nothing is the richest man in the world diogenes dada was richer than alexander by a hundred worlds  very true my love rejoined mr fenton alexander had a whole world more than diogenes wanted and yet desired a hundred worlds more than he had now as no man will allow that he wants what he does not desire and all affirm that they want whatsoever they do desire desires and wants are generally accounted as one and the same thing and yet my harry there is a thing of which it may be said that the more we desire it the less we want it and that the less we desire of it the greater is our want  what in the world can that be dada  it is goodness my love well says harry i will not puzzle my brains about nice matters all i know is that no man has more goodness than he wants except it be yourself i dont talk of women for i believe mrs clement here is very good pray look in her face dada dont you think she is very good  i see harry said mr fenton that young as you are you are a perfect physiognomist why pray sir said arabella is it in earnest your opinion that the character of mind or manners may in any measure be gathered from the form of the countenance is not the world filled with stories of the deceit and treachery of such false appearances you remember how horace says that a prudent mariner puts no trust in the gildings or paintings of a ship such superficial glossings as one might think ought rather to be suspected of an intention to conceal the rottenness of the timber and then the passage of the famous physiognomists at athens so often quoted as a proof of capacity and knowledge in this way proves wholly the reverse as i take it their judgment of socrates is opposite to truth in every instance they pronounce him the most debauched irascible and malicious of men and it is a very poor apology that socrates makes for their ignorance when he affirms that he was by birth the very person they deemed him but that philosophy had given him a new nature for if education can change the heart without changing the countenance how can we form any conjecture of the one by the other  though i insist mrs clement that you are wrong in your thesis replied mr fenton i admit that you are perfectly just in your inference for if a change of mind or manners can make no change in the aspect the whole science of physiognomy must fall to the ground i therefore take this passage relating to socrates to be a mere fiction and i affirm that neither philosophy nor christianity can make a new heart or a new nature in man without making a suitable alteration in his visage  as the heavens are made expressive of the glory of god though frequently overcast with clouds and tempest and sometimes breaking forth in thunders that terrify and lightenings that blast so the general tenor of a human countenance is made expressive of the nature of the soul that lives within and to which it is ordained an involuntary interpreter  many persons have made it the study of great part of their lives to counteract providence in this honest appointment to shut this window by which an impertinent world is so apt to peep in and spy what they are about and as far as possible to make the expressions of their countenance to belie every sentiment and emotion of their heart  i have known hypocrisy treachery pride malice and lust assume the opposite semblance of saintship fidelity lowliness benevolence and chastity but it is painful to keep the bow of nature long bent its elasticity will still struggle to have it restored and a skillful discerner at the time of such delusion will often detect the difference between a real character and the acting of a part for when nature dictates the whole man speaks all is uniform and consenting in voice mien motion the turn of each feature and the cast of the eyes but when art is the spokesman and that nature is not altogether suppressed the turn of the eye may contradict the tongue and the muscles of the face may counteract each other in their several workings and thus i have known an expression of resentment remain on the brow while the face labored to invest itself with a smile of complacence and i have known the eye to burn with illgoverned concupiscence while voice action and address united in the avowal of chaste and honorable regards  i perceive sir said mr clement by your own account that he must be a very learned proficient in the study of physiognomy who can decide with any kind of certainty on an art that requires such attention and penetration  i beg leave to differ answered mr fenton the science is much more obvious than you may imagine and i fancy there are very few persons who do not trust without reflecting to their own skill in this way and who do not inadvertently form a character to themselves of almost all the people with whom they are conversant  i am persuaded that there is not a single sentiment whether tending to good or evil in the human soul that has not its distinct and respective interpreter in the glance of the eye and in the muscling of the countenance when nature is permitted to express herself with freedom by this language of the face she is understood by all people and those who never were taught a letter can instantly read her signatures and impressions whether they be of wrath hatred envy pride jealousy vexation contempt pain fear horror and dismay or of attention respect wonder surprise pleasure transport complacence affection desire peace lowliness and love  now all persons are born with propensities whether they be mental or constitutional to some passions and affections rather than to others i will take two instances the one of a male infant who is born with a propensity to pride and arrogance the other of a female infant who is born with a propensity to bashfulness and lowliness in either case it is evident that from the first occasion that may serve to excite these several affections in these several infants the sentiments of their souls will be suitably and intelligibly expressed in their aspects and every further occasion of renewing the same impressions will render them more obvious and legible to every eye insomuch that if no future influence arising from accident or education shall check the pride of the one or divert the lowliness of the other the male will be seen to look on those about him with an habitual selfsufficiency and contempt of his species and the female will be seen to regard humankind with an amiable diffidence and a complacent respect  let us see however how far education may be able to change these sentiments and how far a change of sentiments may produce a change of face  if the scorner should be so happy as to meet with worthy tutors wise and diligent to inculcate the insufficiency of all creatures and more particularly the wants weaknesses and vileness of our lapsed natures and that no honor can belong to man in this his state of depravity but above all should this scorner prove so happy as to be educated in the never failing school of christian meekness even the school of adversity of pain sickness depressing poverty and mortification his lofty crest by degrees will be effectually unplumed his sufficiency and high mindedness will sink to an humble prayer and look out for relief and he will respect even the wretched because he will acquire a social sense and fellowfeeling of their wretchedness  here then is another man as new made and as different from his former self as he can possibly be supposed from any other of the human species but will this total change of sentiment produce no change of aspect think you will this benevolent and lowly man retain the same front of haughtiness the same brow of overbearance the same eye of elevation the same lip of ridicule and the same glance of contempt it cannot be said it cannot be imagined  when god by his inspired penmen expresses his detestation of a lofty look was he quarrelling do ye think with the natural and unavoidable cast of an unhappy countenance no no my dear friends in condemning a proud aspect he condemned a proud heart forasmuch as he knew that a loftiness of look and a sauciness of soul could not be divided  but to clear up this question from any remaining doubt let us suppose that the female infant with bashful and lowly propensities is just brought down blushing and trembling from the nursery let us suppose her education to be taken in hand by a mama of figure and fashion and by other dames of quality whose estimate of happiness is measured merely by the mode she now becomes instructed in more instances of selfdenial than such as dictated and tuned by christianity would have sainted her for eternity she is taught to suppress her natural feelings and inclinations and to bridle the impulses of an affectionate and humble heart she is taught to prize what she dislikes and to praise what she disapproves to affect coldness and distance to inferiors whom she regarded and to proportion her appearance of inclination and respect to the station of the party  as i have been earwitness to several of these quality lectures i might give you many familiar instances of their nature and tendency fie harriet says my lady what does the girl blush at you are handsome and wellshaped my dear and have nothing to be ashamed of that i know no one blushes now a days except silly country wenches who are ignorant of the world but if you have any naughty thoughts that make you blush why keep em to yourself child and we shall never be the wiser but dont let your face be a towncrier harriet to let every body know what you have in your mind to be ashamed my girl is the greatest of all shames  again my dear i warn you that you must not be so fond of the miss collesses who used to visit you in the nursery for though they are good sort of girls their parents are people in but middling life and we never admit em when there is company in the house and then there is the miss sanclairs how low you curtsied to em yesterday and what a rout you made about welcoming and entertaining them but let me have no more of that for though they are rich they are cits and people of business and a nod of your head or inclination toward a curtsy with some yeses and noes when they ask you a question will be matter enough of salute and discourse from you to them  you say that your stays are too low before and that they pain you about the waste but i know it is impossible for a young lady must never dislike or be pained by any thing that shows the fineness of her skin or shape to advantage  i must further advise you harriet not to heap such mountains of sugar nor to pour such a deluge of cream into your tea people will certainly take you for the daughter of a dairymaid there is young jenny quirp who is a lady by birth and she has brought herself to the perfection of never suffering the tincture of her tea to be spoiled by whitening nor the flavor to be adulterated by a grain of sweet and then you say you cannot like coffee and i could not but laugh though i was quite ashamed at the wry faces you made the other day when you mistook the olives for sweetmeats but these things my child are relished by persons of taste and you must force yourself to swallow and relish them also  i was talking awhile ago of young lady jane quirp there is a pattern for you harriet one who never likes or dislikes or says or does any thing a hairs breadth beyond the pink of the mode she is ugly it is true and very illnatured but then she is finely bred and has all the becoming airs of a miss of distinction her you must love my child and to her you must pay your court for you must learn to love and prefer such matters and persons alone as will serve in the beaumonde to render you noted and respected for the accomplishments in vogue  these lessons and efforts in time have their influence miss comes to accommodate her taste and relish of things to the taste and relish of those whom she is proud to resemble she now is ashamed of nothing but in proportion as it is below the top of the mode and she blushes at no indecency that fashion is pleased to adopt her whole soul and essence is futilized and extracted into show and superficials she learns that friendship in high life is nothing but compliment and visits intimacies and connections the polite grimace of people of distinction that to talk elegantly upon nothing is the sum of conversation that beauty and dress are the constituents of female perfection and that the more we depreciate and detract from others the more eminently we ourselves shall shine forth and be exalted she is followed by fops she is worshipped by fortunehunters she is mounted aloft upon the wings of flattery and is hardened against public opinion by self conceit while she beholds a circling group of the taylors creation admiring the harmony of her motions the fineness of her complexion and the luster of her ornaments the same vanity that bids her to be desirous of conquests bids her also to despise them but for the vulgar world she regards it as the dust beneath her steps created to no end save to be looked down upon and trodden under foot  will ye now affirm or can ye conceive that any trace of native bashfulness and lowliness should remain in the frontlet of this piece of courtpetrefaction no such trace can remain  as i observed to ye before that every affection of the human soul has its distinct and respective interpreter in the countenance i am further to take notice that each of those many interpreters has its respective set of tubes and fibers leading thereto through which the blood and spirits flow on their respective emotion thus whatever the general tenor of a persons temper may be such as joyous or melancholy irascible or placid and so forth the vessels relative to these affections are kept open and full by an almost constant flow of the blood and animal spirits and impress such evident characters of that persons disposition as are not to be suppressed except for a time and that too by some powerful and opposite passion for the muscles so employed grow stronger and more conspicuous by exercise as we see the legs of a chairman and the shoulders of a porter derive bulk and distinction from the peculiarity of their occupation  now i will take the argument in the strongest light against myself i will suppose a man to be naturally of a melancholy cast of countenance that he has the additional unhappiness of a bileous constitution and that he is confirmed in this look and habit of despondence by a train of distressful circumstances till he arrives at his twentieth or thirtieth year i will then suppose that his habit of body and temper of mind are totally changed by medicine a flow of success a happy turn of reason and resignation or perhaps of complacence in the divine dispensations he now grows sociable benevolent cheerful always joyous when in company and placid when alone i ask on this occasion will ye continue to see the same cast and habit of melancholy in this mans countenance no more than ye can see the gloom of last winter in the smiling serene of a summersevening for some time i admit it will be difficult for the set of joyous muscles and glances to overpower their adversaries who have so long kept the field but in the end they must prevail they will receive constant supplies from within and the passages for their reinforcement will be opened more and more while their opponents daily subside give place and disappear  what i have observed with respect to melancholy may be equally affirmed of any other affection whose opposite gets an habitual empire in the mind i say habitual because there are some persons of such variable and fluctuating tempers now furious now complacent now churlish now generous now mopingly melancholy now merry to madness now pious now profane now cruelly hardhearted now meltingly humane that a man can no more judge of what nature or disposition such people are than he can determine what wind shall predominate next april and yet when the wind blows he can tell by every cloud and weather cock from what point it comes and may as easily decypher the present temper by the aspect  but sir said arabella might not nature impress as in the case of socrates such conspicuous characters of vice in his peculiar cast of countenance and strong turn of muscling as no internal virtues should be able to retract  by no means madam answered mr fenton for if such characters are impressed by nature on the countenance independent of any such characters in the mind this would first overthrow the whole system of the physiognomists who judged of the mind by the countenance alone and secondly it would owerthrow the opinion of socrates himself who allowed that his countenance had received such impressions from the natural bent and disposition of his mind but again if the mind has really a power to impress her own character or likeness on the countenance what should take away this power why does she not retain it why should not a total change of character in the soul make some suitable change of character in the aspect it does madam it does make a total change and there are thousands of faces in yonder sanctified city that once expressed all the sweetness of bashful modesty and yet are now as much hardened and bronzed over with impudence as the face of the statue at charing cross  in the soft and pliable features of infancy and youth the mind can express itself with much more force and perspicuity than in the features of people more advanced in years the nerves and fibers in our early age are all open active and animated they reach to the outward surface of the skin and the soul looks forth and is seen through them as a spanish beauty is seen through a veil of gauze but time destroys many of these intelligible fibers it also obstructs others and it renders the remainder less susceptible of those offices and mental impressions for which they were ordained till the surface of the countenance grows so callous and rigid that the beauties of the soul can no more be discovered through it than the luminaries of heaven through an atmosphere of clouds scarce any thing save sudden passion can then be discernible like flashes of lightening that break through the gloom  for this very reason my dear mrs clement were it possible for you to advance in virtues as you advance in years you will however grow less amiable in the eyes of mortals as your beauties will be more and more shut in from their observation  this brings me to my last and most important remark on the nature and power of beauty itself and here we must note that though nothing can be affectingly lovely or detestable that does not arise from some sentiment of the soul there is yet in many faces such a natural symmetry or disproportion as is generally called by the name of beauty and ugliness thus in some countenances you perceive a due relation and agreement between the parts while in others the forehead may overwhelm the nether face or the mouth threaten to devour the other features or the nose may appear as a huge steeple that hides a small church or as a mountain that is the whole of a mans estate insomuch that as some may be said to want a nose to their face in the present case they may be said to want a face to their nose but this species of beauty and ugliness excites no other kind of pleasure or disgust save such as we receive from two pieces of architecture where one is executed with propriety and the other is obviously out of all rule and to continue the simile if people should be seen looking out at the windows of those two buildings we may come to detest and avoid the first and to love and frequent the latter for the sake of those who live therein and just so it is with regular faces that express a deformity of soul and with disproportioned features that may however be pregnant with the beauty of sentiment  by beauty therefore i do not mean the beauty of lines or angles of motion or music of form or color of numerical agreements or geometrical proportions nor that which excites the passion of some pragmatical inamoratos for a shell a tulip or a butterfly all these have undoubtedly their peculiar beauty but then that beauty has no relation to the power or perception of that which contains it it is derived from something that is altogether foreign and owes the whole of its merit to the superior art and influence of god or man  in the designings of sculptors of painters and statuaries we however see very great and truly affecting beauty i have at times been melted into tears thereby and have felt within my bosom the actual emotions of distress and compassion of friendship and of love i ask then what it was that excited these sensations could any lines colorings or mere symmetry of inanimate parts inspire affections of which in themselves they were incapable no they could only serve as the vehicles of something intended to inspire such sensibilities nothing further we must therefore look higher for a cause more adequate to such extraordinary effects and the first that presents itself is the designer who must have conceived amiable sentiments within himself before he could impress their beauty on these his interpreters in order to excite suitable affections in others  here then it is evident that whatever we affect or love in the design is no other than the sentiment or soul of the designer though we neither see nor know any thing further concerning him and thus a sculptor a painter a statuary or amiable author by conveying their sentiments in lasting and intelligible characters to mankind may make the world admirers and lovers of their beauty when their features shall be rigid and incapable of expression and when they themselves shall no longer exist among men  from hence it should seem as indeed i am fully persuaded that mind can affectingly love nothing but mind and that universal nature can exhibit no single grace or beauty that does not arise from sentiment alone  the power of this sentimental beauty as i may say is in many cases great amazing and has not yet been accounted for that i know of by any philosopher poet or author though several have made it their peculiar study and subject we have seen and read of many instances where it carries people as it were quite out of themselves and gives them to live and to be interested in the object of their affections alone they will run to fight bleed suffer and even to die in its defense and in its absence they will pine and despair and attempt to destroy themselves rather than bear to be divided from what they love in a manner above their own existence  this is wonderful perhaps mysterious and may possibly be involved in impenetrable darkness let us try however if we can throw any probable lights upon it  we have already seen that human artificers can impress the beauty of their own sentiments on their inanimate works suppose then that god should be barely the same to universal nature that a finite designer is to the piece he has in hand he finds that the stuff or material which he is to form and to inform is in itself utterly incapable of any thing that is beautiful and consequently incapable of any thing that is desirable he therefore finds himself under the necessity of imparting to his works some faint manifestation or similitude of himself for otherwise they cannot be amiable neither can he see his shadow in them with any delight on matter therefore he first impresses such distant characters of his own beauty as the subject will bear in the glory of the heavens in the movement of the planets in the symmetry of form in the harmony of sounds in the elegance of colors in the elaborate texture of the smallest leaf and in the infinitely fine mechanism of such insects and minims of nature as are scarce visible to eyes of the clearest discernment  but when god comes toward home if the phrase may be allowed when he impresses on intelligent spirits a nearer resemblance of himself and imparts to them also a perception and relish of the beauty with which he has informed them he then delights to behold and will eternally delight to behold his image so fairly reflected by such a living mirror yet still they are no other than his own beauties that he beholds in his works for his omnipotence can impress but cannot possibly detach a single grace from himself  i am not quite singular in this opinion i have somewhere read the following stanza  it is goodness forms the beauty of the face the line of virtue is the line of grace here is also a little poem lately published on a lady who was beholden to the graces of her mind alone for all the attractions of her person and countenance  what is beauty is it form proportion colors pale or warm or is it as by some defined a creature of the lovers mind no  it is internal grace pregnant in the form and face the sentiment that is heard and seen in act and manners voice and mein it is the souls caelestial ray breaking through the veil of clay it is the godhead in the heart touching each external part wrapped in matter else too bright for our sense and for our sight beauty envy be thou dumb is divinity in  here we reach at the nature of that enchantment or magnetism with which some persons are so powerfully endued as to engage the liking of all who barely behold them an enchantment often attractive of friendship affection passion to tenderness languishment pain sickness and death  here also we discover why the bliss which we reach after eludes our grasp why it vanishes as it were in the moment of enjoyment yet still continues to fascinate and attract as before forasmuch as the beauty after which we sigh is not essentially in the mirror where we behold its similitude thus ixion is said to have clasped a cloud without reflecting that it was but a bare resemblance of the real divinity who had excited his passion  this will at once account for all the wonderful effects of beauty for if nothing but god is lovely if nothing else can be beloved he is himself the universal and irresistible magnet that draws all intelligent and affectionate beings through the medium of creatures to the graces of their creator till the veil shall finally be taken away and that he himself shall appear in his eternal unclouded and unspeakable beauty infinitely lovely and infinitely beloved  but i have out talked my time says mr fenton rising and looking at his watch i am engaged for an hour or two above street and wish ye a good evening  while mr fenton was abroad ned who would not willingly have exchanged his unluckiness for the heirship of an estate happened to take a little ramble through the town he held a stick to the end of which he had a long ferule of hollow tin which he could take off at pleasure and from the extremity of the ferule there arose a small collateral pipe in an angle of about forty five degrees he had filled this ferule with puddlewater which by a sudden pressure of the stick he could squirt out to double the height of his own stature  on his return he saw an an elderly gentleman advancing whose shadow being lengthened by the declining sun attended with a slow and stately motion as ned approached he exclaimed with a well counterfeited fear look look what is that behind you take care of yourself sir for heavens sake take care  the gentleman alarmed hereat instantly started turned pale and looked terrified behind him and on either side when ned recovering his countenance said o sir i beg pardon i believe it is nothing but your shadow what sirrah cried the gentleman in a tone highly exasperated have you learned no better manners than to banter your superiors and then lifting a kane switch he gave our merry companion a few smart strokes across the shoulders  friend this i presume must be some very respectable personage some extraordinary favorite of yours since within a few lines you style him three or four times by your most venerable of all titles the title of a gentleman   author sir i would not hold three words of conversation with any man who did not deserve the appellation of gentleman by many degrees better than this man does   fr why then do you write or speak with such acknowledged impropriety   aut i think for myself but i speak for the people i may think as i please for i understand my own thoughts but would i be understood when i speak to others also i must speak with the people i must speak in common terms according to their common or general acceptance  there is no term in our language more common than that of gentleman and whenever it is heard all agree in the general idea of a man some way elevated above the vulgar yet perhaps no two living are precisely agreed respecting the qualities they think requisite for constituting this character when we hear the epithets of a fine gentleman a pretty gentleman much of a gentleman gentlemanlike something of a gentleman nothing of a gentleman and so forth all these different appellations must intend a peculiarity annexed to the ideas of those who express them though no two of them as i said may agree in the constituent qualities of the character they have formed in their own mind  there have been ladies who deemed a bagwig tasseld waistcoat new fashioned snuff box and swordknot very capital ingredients in the composition of  a gentleman  a certain easy impudence acquired by low people by casually being conversant in high life has passed a man current through many companies for  a gentleman  in the country a laced hat and long whip makes  a gentleman  in taverns and in brothels he who is the most of a bully is the most of  a gentleman  with heralds every esquire is indisputably  a gentleman  and the highway man in his manner of taking your purse and your friend in his manner of debauching your wife may however be allowed to have  much of the gentleman   fr as you say my friend our ideas of this matter are very various and adverse in our own minds perhaps they are also indetermined and i question if any man has formed to himself a conception of this character with sufficient precision pray  was there any such character among the philosophers   aut plato among the philosophers was the most of a man of fashion and therefore allowed at the court of syracuse to be  the most of a gentleman  but seriously i apprehend that this character is pretty much upon the modern in all ancient or dead languages we have no term any way adequate whereby we may express it in the habits manners and characters of old sparta and old rome we find an antipathy to all the elements of modern gentility among those rude and unpolished people you read of philosophers of orators patriots heroes and demigods but you never hear of any character so elegant as that of  a pretty gentleman  when those nations however became refined into what their ancestors would have called corruption when luxury introduced and fashion gave a sanction to certain sciences which cynics would have branded with the illmannered appellations of debauchery drunkenness whoredom gambling cheating lying etc the practitioners assumed the new title of gentlemen till such gentlemen became as plenteous as stars in the milkyway and lost distinction merely by the confluence of their luster  wherefore as the said qualities were found to be of ready acquisition and of easy descent to the populace from their betters ambition judged it necessary to add further marks and criterions for severing the general herd from the nobler species  of gentlemen  accordingly if the commonalty were observed to have a propensity to religion their superiors affected a disdain of such vulgar prejudices and a freedom that cast off the restraints of morality and a courage that spurned at the fear of a god were accounted the distinguishing characteristics of  a gentleman  if the populace as in china were industrious and ingenious the grandees by the length of their nails and the cramping of their limbs gave evidence that true dignity was above labor or utility and that to be born to no end was the prerogative  of a gentleman  if the common sort by their conduct declare a respect for the institutions of civil society and good government their betters despise such pusillanimous conformity and the magistrates pay becoming regard to the distinction and allow of the superior liberties and privileges  of a gentleman  if the lower set show a sense of commonhonesty and commonorder those who would figure in the world think it incumbent to demonstrate that complacence to inferiors common manners common equity or any thing common is quite beneath the attention or sphere  of a gentleman  now as underlings are ever ambitious of imitating and usurping the manners of their superiors and as this state of mortality is incident to perpetual change and revolution it may happen that when the populace by encroaching on the province of gentility have arrived to their ne plus ultra of insolence debaucherry irreligion etc the gentry in order to be again distinguished may assume the station that their inferiors had forsaken and however ridiculous the supposition may appear at present humanity equity utility complacence and piety may in time come to be the distinguishing characteristics  of a gentleman   fr from what you have said it appears that the most general idea which people have formed of a gentleman is that of a person of fortune above the vulgar and embellished by manners that are fashionable in high life in this case fortune and fashion are the two constituent ingredients in the composition of modern gentlemen for whatever the fashion may be whether moral or immoral for or against reason right or wrong it is equally the duty of a gentleman to conform   aut and yet i apprehend that true gentility is altogether independent of fortune or fashion of time customs or opinions of any kind the very same qualities that constituted a gentleman in the first age of the world are permanently invariably and indispensably necessary to the constitution of the same character to the end of time   fr by what you say i perceive that we have not yet touched on your most reverable of all characters i am quite impatient to hear your definition or rather description of your favorite gentleman   aut the very first time you tire i will indulge you if you desire it   chap x ned was not of a temper to endure much without attempting at retaliation and directing the pipe of his ferule to the front of his adversary he suddenly discharged the full contents in his eyes and face and upon his clothing and strait taking to his heels he hoped to get in at door before the stranger could clear his sight to take notice where he sheltered  ned however happened at this time to be somewhat over sanguine in his expectations mr snarle for that was the name of the party bespattered had just cleared one eye in season to remark where his enemy entered and hastening home he washed undressed and shifted his linen and clothes with less passion and fewer curses by the half than he conceived to be due to so outrageous an insult  mr snarle had himself been a humourist in his time and had acquired a pretty competence by very fashionable means such as gambling bearing testimony for a friend in distress procuring intelligence for the ministry and wenches for the peerage he had some years ago been bullied into marriage by the relations of a young termagant while he attempted to take such a sample of her charms as might enable him to recommend her to an acquaintance of quality she was neither gentle by nature nor polished by education she liked nothing of her husband except his fortune and they lived together in a state of perpetual altercation and mutual disgust  old age and a quarrelsome companion for life seldom happen to be sweeteners of the human temper and mr snarle had now acquired such a quantum of the infirmities both of body and mind as might justly apologize for a peevish disposition he had lately taken a handsome house on the hill for the benefit of air as soon as he had reclaimed himself from the pickle into which ned had put him he sent to enquire the name and character of the owner of that house where he had taken refuge and being sufficiently apprized of what he wanted to know he walked toward mr fentons hastening his pace with the spirit and expectation of revenge  mr fenton had arrived but a little before and desiring to know mr snarles commands he was informed in terms the most aggravating and inveterate of the whole course and history of neds misbehaviour the delinquent thereupon was called up to instant trial he honestly confessed the facts but pleaded in mitigation the beating that mr snarle had already given him but as mr fenton did not judge this sufficient to reform the natural petulance of a disposition that otherwise was not void of merit a rod was immediately brought and andrew was ordered to horse and frank to flog the criminal in presence of the party aggrieved  during this operation mr snarle observed that franks hand did not altogether answer to the benevolence of his own heart whereupon he furiously snatched the rod from him and began to lay at ned with might and main hereat mr fenton ordered andrew to let the boy down and observing that he would no further interfere in a cause where the appellant assumed judgment and execution to himself he carelessly turned his back upon mr snarle and left him to cool his passions by his evenings walk homeward  poor ned was more afraid of mr fentons displeasure than he would have been of a full brother to the whipping he had got but mr fenton was too generous to add the severity of his own countenance to the weight of franks hand and ned was quickly reinstated in the good graces of the family  his genius however returned with an involuntary bent toward obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had received from mr snarle provided he might retaliate without fear of detection and he was not slow in contriving very adequate means  there was a villager in hamstead about ten years of age who had conceived an uncommon kindness for ned on account of his sprightliness his wit and good humor to this condoling friend he had imparted his grievances and on him alone he depended for execution of the project proposed for redress  on a certain moonless night they mustered four tame cats and having bound some feuze round three or four inches of the extremity of each of their tails they lodged them together in a bag and somewhat after suppertime when all the town was silent they marched softly and cautiously to the house of mr snarle there neds friend with his knife dextrously picked away the putty from a pane of the window of a sidechamber where no light appeared and having put fire to the feuze of each tail successively they slipped their cats one by one in at the window and again having pegged the pane into its place they withdrew to a little distance to watch the issue  the poor cats remained silent and universally inoffensive while they felt no damage but as soon as the fire had seized on their tails they began to speak to you in a language wholly peculiar as one would think to sentiments and sounds of diabolical intention  mr and mrs snarle had been jangling over the fire in an opposite parlour when their dispute was suddenly settled by this outcry as they imagined of a legion of infernals they instantly started up and cast a countenance of pale and contagious pannic at each other but george the footman a strong and bold fellow having just before entered on some business to his master turned and ran to the chamber from whence the peal came he threw open the door with his wonted intrepidity but this was as far as mortal courage could go for the cats spying a passage whereby as they conceived they might fly from their pain rushed suddenly and jointly on the face and breast of george and back he fell with a cry of terror and desperation on however went the cats and flying into the parlour one fastened a claw in each cheek of mr snarle and as his lady screamed out and clapped her hands before her face another fastened with four fangs on her best brussels head and rent and tore away after a lamentable manner  the chambermaid and cook hearing the uproar from the kitchen were afraid to ascend and still more afraid to stay below alone they therefore crept softly and trembling up stairs the torture the cats were in did not permit them to be attached to any single object they had quitted mr and mrs snarle and now flew about the parlour smashing dashing and overturning piers glasses and china and whatever came in their way as though it had been the very palace of pandaemonium itself  george was again on his legs his master and mistress had eloped from the parlour and met the two maids in the middle of the entry they concluded nemine con to get as speedily as they might from the ministers of darkness and would willingly have escaped by the streetdoor but alas this was not possible one of the devils guarded the pass and clinging to the great lock with all his talons growled and yelled in the dialect of twenty of the damned the stairs however remained open and up they would have rushed but were so enfeebled by their fright that this could not be done in the way of a race  as they mounted by the help of the walls and the banisters says mrs snarle to her mate in a languid and soft voice my dear and my jewel it is all along of you that i am thus haunted your old friend i find makes no distinction of persons and when he comes to take you home as come he will it is twenty to one but he takes me for company indeed my angel cries mr snarle in a tone of like complacence i should much rather he would be pleased to take me single wherever it may be his good pleasure to carry me for i know of nothing that i have done so heinous neither to have one damnation heaped on the top of the other  having scaled as far as the dining room they all entered and bolted the door and mr snarle opening a window saw a large posse of neighbors who had gathered below what is the matter sir cried one of them what is the meaning of this horrible uproar and din one would think that hell was empty and that all its inhabitants were come to keep carnival in your house  o a ladder a ladder cries mr snarle deliver us good people good christian people a ladder we beseech ye a ladder a ladder that indeed cries a wag is the last good turn an honest fellow has occasion for  the ladder was soon brought and this panicstricken family were helped down and charitably conducted to the great inn of st george and the dragon where with the help of sack whey warm beds and their remaining terrors they got a hearty sweat and were somewhat composed by ten oclock next morning they then got up and having breakfasted on a pot of milled chocolate they hurried to london without adventuring to send to the haunted mansion for any change of clothes or linen for they would rather have put on garments that had been dipped in the blood of nessus than have touched any thing in a house of which with the furniture plate bedding and other appurtenances the devil as they conceived had taken legal and full possession  in truth there was scarce an inhabitant of the whole town of hamstead who differed in opinion on this head insomuch that as day after day began gradually to shut in all people who had occasion to pass by the dwelling of the late ejected mr snarle kept more and more aloof to the opposite side of the way in proportion as their apprehensions increased with the darkness and all things in the house remained as safe from depredation as though they had been guarded by a regiment of dragoons  imaginary howlings were heard by the whole neighborhood and still continued to issue from thence night by night and it was as firmly believed as it was currently reported that while mr snarle made his escape through the window satan clawed off a collop from his posteriors in earnest of his carcass in remainder on a further day  the cats in the mean time lived plentifully and at free cost on the cold meats which they found in the kitchen and larder and as the anguish of their tails was now no more remembered they kept undisturbed possession of their new acquisition so that during their residence not even a mouse was stirring  in about a week after mr snarles departure for london he sent an undertaker and a friend on whom he depended with authority to enter the haunted house to take an inventory of all the effects and to sell them to the inhabitants by public auction they accordingly borrowed a ladder and got in at the same window by which the family got out they found all quiet and stepping somewhat timorously down stairs they opened the street and back doors and parlour windows and then prevailed upon two or three reputable neighbors to enter and witness the inventory they were going to take  the cats in the mean time finding all late impediments and embargoes removed slunk silently and unperceived away and retreated in excellent plight to their respective habitations though gammar gruff and goody gurton gave many a curse to the rats who had so flead and mauled the tails of their tabbies  the inventory being ended public notice was given throughout the town of the sale to begin precisely at ten the following morning at the hour appointed there was scarce a living animal left to continue the possession of any house in hamstead all crowded to see the goods and chattels of the devil sold according to law the auctioneer mounted his oratorial eminence and pranced and paraded for half an hour like the sign of the flyinghorse in holbourn without proceeding a foot in the business on which he came sir madam good intelligent people observe observe i say you table what a beauty what an admirable curiosity is there that table gentlemen and ladies is all of virgin yew taken pure and undefiled from its native forest there is a complexion there is a polish it is a looking glass in which the favorite sultana or daughter of the grand seignior might behold every charm reflected with advantage note the variety of its tints the luxuriance of its veinings how prodigal nature has been in expending on this favorite piece of vegetation such a number of excellencies such a profusion of beauties neither has art fallen short of the graces and perfections of nature herein mark the taste the manner the mouldings how jointed and framed together as one organized body the operator no doubt took a pleasure by his workmanship to rival the beauties of the subject on which he wrought  i set it up at five guineas  what is five guineas my friends  not the half of what ye will bid at the second word  and what is five times five guineas to the intrinsic value  the curious indeed have nothing so rare in their cabinets  neither ever had prince arthur or any of the knights of the famous roundtable the honor of sitting round such a table as this gentlemen  ladies  who bids  you think the merits above price and that may discourage you  bid something  bid any thing  it is the first article of sale  i will make a kind of present of it  i set it up at five shillings  i set it up at five pence  what the devil is come over ye neighbors has money and common sense quitted the world together  ay ay thought all present the devil the devil that is the case indeed and thus our orator might have been preaching like saint anthony to the fishes till the day of doom before any of his dumb auditors would have returned a word of answer  the fact is that as the devil was a personage however respectable with whom the wellmeaning inhabitants of this ancient village did not choose to have any manner of dealings neither desired to go snacks in matters of property with beings whom they held much wiser than themselves and of whose honesty they had but a very slender opinion these agents of mr snarle were obliged to return just as rich as they came their reckoning deducted and mr snarle soon found himself under the necessity of disposing of those his questionable commodities at less than half value to some london undertakers but what he lost in point of property he gained in matter of morals for he grew extremely cautious of adding to the measure of his former iniquities for fear of another visit from his recent guests  as mr fenton could not but be frequently apprized of these prodigies and alarms that kept all hamstead waking and nightly grouped every family into a single room he compared in his own mind the discomfiture and banishment of the unfortunate snarle with the circumstances of the provocation which ned had received he found that all answered as well in point of time as to neds natural unluckiness and talents at invention yet he could scarce conceive how a child little more than eight years of age should be capable of contriving mischiefs so formidable in the execution and so extensive in their consequences now ned was so happy on this singular occasion that nothing transpired wherefore as mr fenton could produce no manner of proof was too delicate to ask any questions on the case lest on one hand he should tempt the boy into a lie or on the other be obliged to chastise or check him for faults that his generosity might induce him to confess  matters therefore with respect to ned preserved their state of tranquillity though mr fenton would often view him with an eye of wonder and suspicion and could hardly bring himself to believe that a boy of his extraordinary genius should be no other by birth than a beggars brat but here pardon me mr fenton if i dissent from your opinion with humble deference to your judgment in other matters i conceive that an infant begot on a dunghill brought forth in a pigstye and swathed with a rotten remnant of the covering of an ass may have talents and capacity above the son of an emperor  friend the singularity of your sentiments often strikes me with astonishment do you really think in a way apart from all other people or is it a distinction that you affect here you set yourself at fistycuffs with universal persuasion with historical facts and with the experience as well as opinion of all ages you seem wholly to have forgot the circumstances that attended the birth and discovery of cyrus of o edipus of romulus and remus with a thousand other instances whereby it is evident that the beauty prowess and virtues of great and glorious ancestors naturally devolve upon their offspring   author the great teutonic theosopher jacob behmen affirms that a father begets the soul as well as body of his child and this strongly coincides with your judgment of the matter all animal nature also concurs in the same position and the offspring of a lion an eagle and an ass invariably partake of the qualities of their progenitors  in the very early ages of mankind when honor and empire precedence and station were assigned to superior merit alone to prowess in the field or wisdom in the council it is but natural to suppose that the more immediate descendents of such heroes or patriots inherited in a great measure the beauty strength genius and disposition of those from whom they sprung but some thousands of years are now passed my good sir since all this matter has been totally reversed and the world affords but very rare instances where washerwomen or shepherds where a catherine of russia or koulikan of persia or theodore of corsica by the mere force of genius have raised themselves from obscurity to dominion these instances also are very far from making any thing in favor of your argument though unquestionably were you to write their romance you would agreeable to your thesis derive their respective pedigree from the queens of utopia or some emperors in terra australis incognita  when time was young when men were respected and advanced as i said according to their personal distinctions and accomplishments uncommon beauty strength and agility of body informed by superior genius and talents were accounted genuine proofs of a royal or noble descent but in process of years when art had introduced luxury and luxury had introduced corruption among the great a feeble distempered frame informed by a perserse pusillanimous and impatient temper became an indication by no means improbable of the genuine descent of a child of quality   fr my dear friend be cautious to speak lightly or degradingly of dignity and station does not become people of a certain sphere   aut with all deference and due submission to those who sit in the seat of moses or in the throne of caesar when we speak as philosophers we should speak independent of vulgar prejudice  i am not insensible of that internal respect which the world is pleased to pay to external luftre if one man acquires a crown another a red hat and another a coronet by means that deserved the gibbet of haman they instantly become the presumptive proprietors of i know not what catalogue of fine qualities and accomplishments wherefore as i am so singular so perverse or so unhappy as to differ from the judgment of so wise a world in this matter it is the more incumbent upon me to bring proofs that are selfevident at the same time that i treat so reverable a subject with all possible delicacy  in the first ages of acorns when all that sustained the simple nature of man lay open and in common like light and air as people knew of nothing further that was to be had they thought there was nothing further to be desired as they had no wishes they felt no wants and neither pride envy covetousness or debauchery could commence before they contrived the distinctions of property and materials of intemperance and thereby contrived the causes of quarrel and corruption  but as horace says quum oppida caeperunt munire when they began to build and set out landmarks to plow and to sow to spin and to weave to handle the file and hammer in proportion to the advancement of invention and arts on necessity convenience arose upon convenience elegance upon elegance luxury new desires increased and multiplied with the means of gratification real wishes became the offspring of imaginary wants as those wishes waxed warm the passions were enkindled and the vices lastly grew in mathematical proportion to the growth of the passions  all histories as well profane as sacred in every age in every nation and in every instance bear unquestionable testimony to the above state of facts and hence ensues the necessity of our growing worse and worse till the pinnacle of art shall put a limit to desire till invention shall be exhausted and no longer prolific of new wants and additional wishes in man  but so long as untried allurements so long as untasted pleasures so long as new objects can be set up to our imagination in our eager pursuit after happiness on earth our wishes will inflame our impatience to reach the prize in proportion to that impatience our endeavors will be exerted in proportion to such exertion the fences of law and morals will be broke through or trampled down and in proportion to the insufficiency of moral restraints all sorts of fraud and violence of licentiousness and corruption of debauchery and profligacy must prevail throughout the world   fr from what you say i should conclude that people of wealth of station and power are the least impassioned and the most virtuous of all living forasmuch as they are already in possession of what their inferiors so earnestly continue to thirst and to chafe and to labor after the great are above temptation the world has nothing further to exhibit for their seduction and in this light also they are become the most respectable of all people   aut whenever you can make it evident that to humble the spirit of man you ought to place him in authority that to convince him of personal defaults and infirmities you ought to enclose him with sycophants and servile dependents that to make him temperate you should seat him at the table of a lucullus and that to humanize his disposition you should remove him as far as possible from a sense of the miseries of his fellow creatures when to cure a man of distempers incident to his nature you would place him in the midst of adventitious contagion then and not till then will wealth station and power be productive of reformation and virtue in man  your error lay in supposing that sensual appetite and spiritual ambition would cease or abate on gratification or indulgence but this is not possible the spirit of man is a deathless desire its cravings cannot be satiated till it is possessed of some object that is adequate to its nature and as this world has no such object to exhibit gratifications only serve to provoke to further desire or finally to sink us into utter despondence and this makes the moral that was intended by the philosophers when they fabled that the son of philip broke into a passion of tears on finding that no more worlds remained for him to conquer  your pardon yet i pray  with respect to your opinion that the descendents of the mighty and the exalted inherit the qualities and excellencies of their progenitors you speak as though this earth and all that was thereon were invariably permanent whereas the knowingones will tell you that the one and the other are subject to annual and even diurnal revolutions  perhaps there is not a beggar or slave upon earth whose sometime progenitor was not a prince or an emperor perhaps there is not a prince or emperor upon earth whose sometime progenitor was not a slave or a beggar have you then the discernment to perceive in the beggar the lineaments of the prince or in the prince to retrace the lineaments of the beggar you have not sage sir i will tell you a story  the cardinal campejius or some such great cardinal happened to have a dispute with the duke of modena altercation rose high do you know says the prince in passion that your father was no better than my fathers hogherd i know it full well coolly answered the cardinal and i am persuaded that had your highness been the son of my father you would have continued of the same profession to this day  in such a world as this all things are in perpetual change rotation and revolution it is natures process as the summer and winter gradually succeed and encroach upon eachother or as the sun dawns and arises from darkness till he reaches the midday fervor of his culminating beam and thence declines till he sets in utter darkness even so mighty nations as well as families have their commencement ascent and summit declension decay and period the virtue of all nations and families begins in poverty thence arises to industry genius honor perhaps to conquest and empire there is their zenith but then comes on the load of ponderous wealth that gradually weighs them down from this meridian to indulgence sensuality guilt corruption prostitution slavery perdition  let us now with the eye of philosophy consider two men in the most contrasted state that this world can admit suppose a king and a beggar here the king is more highly fed and more gayly clothed than the beggar but if these are advantages deserving estimation we behold both this luxury and luster surpassed by the be in the garden and the lily in the valley further whatever the native qualities of the king or beggar may be independent of the said external or personal distinctions we may however be assured that an education in the midst of sensuality and deception of the exhibition of temptations and gratification of lusts of parasites and pandars obeisance and prostration of corporal indulgence and mental imposition can be no very good friend to the virtues  if we carry the comparison further than this we find the body of the king to be as frail as obnoxious to pains disease and inclemencies even as naked poor and perishable as that of the beggar  but if we take the eye of faith to see further than with that of philosophy we behold their souls alike immortal of equal dignity and extent we see creatures resembling the creator himself breathed from his own spirit formed in his own image and ordained to his own beatitude and eternity here all other distinctions fall away and lose their respect as an instant would do in comparison of ages or a molehill in comparison of yon boundless expanse and here we find a beggar whom the king himself is bound to reverence as being the unquestioned heir of a king in comparision of whom all other kings are but as beggars how utterly vile and contemptible is all dignity and dominion to such and heirship as this an heirship hourly approaching perhaps just at hand when the magnificent ruin of man shall be rebuilt when his weakness shall put on power his corruption put on glory and his mortal be wholly swallowed up of immortality   fr i confess that for once you have convinced me give me leave to proceed   chap xi some time after this mr fenton privately took ned into his closet and calling him a good boy and giving him a few shillings to buy playthings desired him to give the best history he could remember of himself and his adventures before he met with harry  sir says ned the first thing that i remember of myself is my going from house to house a begging with my mammy i dreamed indeed that i was once in a fine house and among fine people but i dont know where nor when and so i believe as i say it was only a dream  do you remember your daddy ned no sir i never had a daddy that i know of my mammy was very cross to me and used to take from me all the money and victuals that i begged and that was a great deal for i never let people rest till they gave me something and so sir as i was saying my mammy was very cross to me and used to half starve me and gave me a beating for every hour in the day  did she teach you your prayers ned no sir i believe she had no prayers to teach me for she used to swear and scold sadly and so sir as i was telling you we begged from house to house sometimes in a town and sometimes in the country till the day she run away from me  how came your mammy to run away from you ned why sir we were begging in your town and had got some halfpence and filled our bag when my mammy took up a child at the towns end and run with it till she got into the next fields the child sir cried sadly and my mammy went so fast that i could not keep up with her do my best and so we heard a man shouting behind us and my mammy turned and saw him running after her very fast and so she threw down the child and her great bag on the ground and made the best of her way to the next hedge and got through it sir and so i never saw any more of her  what became of the child neddy when the man sir came up he lifted it off the ground and he kissed it a great many times and made it quiet and i am thinking he was so glad to see it he took no notice of me howsomever he took up my mammys great bag and turned back and went the way he came then sir i fell a crying and roaring terribly to be left all alone and to have nobody in the world who would have any thing to say to me and i wished for my mammy again bad as she was to me and i strove to follow her through the hedge but was not able and so i saw a great house on one side and i was very sad when i went to it and there it was that i met my own young master and he put clothes upon me with his own dear hands and he took me to himself and he is ever since so kind to me that it troubles me very much for i can do nothing at all for him you know sir and that grieves me more than all the world  well neddy says mr fenton dont cry my child be a good boy and mind your book and be sure you tell no lies nor do mischief to any body and i will take care of you and be a father to you myself but tell me ned would you know the woman you call your mammy if you should see her again yes yes sir cried ned there was not a day of my life but she gave me reason to remember her i should know her from all the world if i was not to see the face of her for a hundred years to come  i find ned you are not over fond of your mammy no indeed sir answered ned i love master harrys little finger and i would love yourself if i dare sir better than a thousand such mammies as mine was and that i suppose is very naughty for all good children they say love their fathers and mothers well ned says mr fenton if you happen at any time to see her among the great number of beggars that come to our door dont you speak to her or show that you take the least notice of her but come and tell me or honest james in my absence that we may take care of her and force her to confess whether she is in reality your mother or not  while mr fenton was speaking andrew entered with tidings that a chariot was overturned not twenty yards from the door and that he feared the people in it were much hurt mr fentons humanity was much alarmed at the news he ordered the servants to follow him and instantly hurried out to give all the assistance he could to the strangers  the chariot happened to be overturned by the slipping out of one of the linchpins that kept the wheel on the axletree the company had already got out they were an agreeable young couple mr fielding and his wife who had come from london on purpose to take an airing on the hill mrs fielding had suffered nothing except from her fears but mr fieldings right arm was something bruised by his endeavoring to preserve his lady in the fall  mr fenton appeared the greatest sufferer of the three and addressed the strangers with a countenance that convinced them how feelingly he was interested in their safety he left andrew to have the chariot set to rights and having conducted his new guests to his own house he ordered up a bottle of sack and some naple cakes to the parlour  when they were all seated and the glass had gone round i find sir said mr fielding that people are apt to be disgusted with what they call accidents and which may afterward turn out to their greatest advantage perhaps i should never have known what true humanity was if our carriage had not been overturned this day if you knew all said mr fenton with a tender bluntness you would be far from laying any humanity at my door since i rejoice at an accident where the damage is all yours and the advantage that arises from it is all my own  i would hold fifty to one cried mrs fielding that this is the very mr fenton we have heard so much about indeed madam said mr fenton you surprise me much if i had the pleasure of ever knowing you there is something in that face i should not have readily forgot  no sir said mrs fielding i speak from information i never had the happiness of being known to you till now we have a fosterer in this village rose jenkins a poor widow one of those many persons you have down on your list she was nurse to our only child while he lived and was with us she was a constant visitant but as soon as soon as  here mrs fielding hesitated her lip trembled and her eye glistened with a filling tear  i say sir as soon as a very sad affair happened the poor woman came near us no more one day as we were taking the air through this town i thought i saw a face that was familiar to me i called to the coachman to stop it was my old nurse she had a family of small children and had fallen sadly to decay before you came mr fenton to settle in the town i chid her for becoming a stranger to us ah madam said the kind creature the tears bursting from her eyes how could i go near a place where every thing would put me in mind of my dear lost child  she still continued to weep  and i  wept for company  i put a guinea in her hand and insisted on her coming to see us she did so it was then mr fenton that we learned your name and character and you must expect the mortification now and then of hearing a little of those many things that are spoken to your advantage i am sorry madam said mr fenton that my nothings should be talked of lest it should intimate that other people are less ostentatious  mrs fielding was still affected by what she had been saying and though mr fenton wished to know what the sad affair was at which she had hinted he declined asking any questions for fear of renewing her affliction  mr and mrs clement had walked abroad upon a visit with their pupil harry so that mr fenton and his friend ned with mr and mrs fielding made the whole of the present company  you are happily situated sir says mr fielding i blame myself and all others who have any independence and yet live in a city health pleasure and spirits are all for the country did any poets or philosophers ever place their golden aeras or golden scenes amidst such a town as london a man can scarce be himself he is confused and dissipated by the variety of objects and bustle that surrounds him in short sir i am like many others the reverse in persuasion of what i am in practice i live in a city although i detest it it is true that i am fond of society and neighborhood but experience has shown me that london is not the place in which i can enjoy it  no sir said mr fenton if i was a lover of solitude if i wished to be the most recluse of all anchorites that bid adieu to the commerce of mankind i would choose london for my cell it is in such a city alone that a man may keep wholly unknown and unnoticed he is there as a hailstone amidst a great shower he jumps and bustles about awhile then lies snug among his fellows without being any more observed than if he were not upon earth till he melts away and vanishes with the rest of his fraternity  i am not for a cell sir replied mr fielding i love society but yet a society that is founded in friendship and people in great cities are so divided and dissipated by the multitude of soliciting objects and acquaintance that they are rendered incapable of a particular attachment i imagine however that in a well peopled and civilized part of the country a man might make an election of persons deserving his esteem such as he would wish to live with in a happy interchange of kind offices and affections this indeed is my plan for my remainder of life but the lawsuits in which i am at present involved will not permit me to go in search of my utopia  at law exclaimed mr fenton then sir you are much to be blamed or much to be pitied  i hope rather to be pitied than blamed rejoined mr fielding four suits descended to me on the part of my own father and three on the part of the father of my wife and my adversaries on all sides are such cocks of the game that no overtures can induce them to listen to any terms of compromise or accommodation  if matters of wealth or property said mr fenton are really matters of valuable estimation in life it is much to be lamented that there is no place on earth wherein property can be said to be fixed or ascertained throughout the regions of mahomet and asiatic despotism life and property are alike tenures at the will of the ruler again throughout the european continent no man indeed no nation can be assured of their possessions exposed as they are to the ambition and avarice of their almost perpetually invading neighbors lastly in these northern islands whose defense nature herself appears to have undertaken by a guardianship of circling rocks and seas this does not however defend us from intestine convulsions and changes think what a general change of property has been made in great britain during the two very late revolutions i am told that in a neighboring country the alienation has been nearly universal perhaps a third revolution is also at hand  it is affirmed that the civil constitution of england is the best calculated for the security of liberty and property of any that was ever framed by the policy of man and originally perhaps it might have been so when twelve simple and impartial men were appointed for the speedy trial and determination of life and property  our ancestors unquestionably were at that time unblessed by the liberal and learned profession of the longrobe they would not otherwise have committed the disposition of property a matter held so much more valuable than that of life to a few men who could have no virtue under heaven to recommend them save the two illiterate qualities of common sense and common honesty  those were ages of mental darkness and no way illumined as we are by those immense and immaculate volumes of refined and legal metaphysics that now press the shelves of the learned and are read with such delight a man in those times had no play for his money he was either stripped or enriched of a sudden whereas now in the worst cause hope is left during life and hope is said to be the greatest cordial in this vale of human controversy  it is greatly to be lamented that the learned in our laws are not as immortal as the suits for which they are retained it were therefore to be wished that an act of parliament might be especially passed for that purpose a matter no way impracticable considering the great interest those gentlemen have in the house in truth it seems highly expedient that an infinity of years should be assigned to each student of the belles lettres of our laws to enable them to read over that infinity of volumes which have already been published to say nothing of the infinity that are yet to come which will be held equally necessary for understanding the profession of critically distinguishing and oratorically expatiating on law against law case against case authority against authority precedent against precedent statute against statute and argument against reason  in matters of no greater moment than life and death juries as at the beginning are still permitted to enter directly on the hearing and decision but in matters so sacred as that of property our courts are extremely cautious of too early an error in judgment in order therefore to sift and boult them to the very bran they are delivered over to the lawyers who are equally the affirmers and disputers the pleaders and impleaders representers and misrepresenters explainers and confounders of our laws our lawyers therefore maintain their right of being paid for their ingenuity in putting and holding all properties in debate debated properties consequently become the properties of the lawyers as long as answers can be given to bills or replies to answers or rejoinders to replies or rebutters to rejoinders as long as the battledors can strike and bandy and till the shuttlecock falls of itself to the ground  soberly and seriously speaking english property when once debated is merely a carcass of contention upon which interposing lawyers fall as customary prize and prey during the combat of the claimants while any flesh remains on a bone it continues a bone of contention but so soon as the learned practitioners have picked it quite clean the battle is over and all again is peace and settled neighborhood  it is worthy of much pleasantry and shaking of sides to observe that in intricate knotty and extremely perplexing cases where the sages of the gown and coif are so puzzled as not to know what to make of the matter they then bequeath it to the arbitration and award of two or three plain men or by record to the judgment of twelve simply honest fellows who casting aside all regard to the form of writs and declarations to the lapse of monosyllables verbal mistakes and misnomers enter at once upon the pith and marrow of the business and in three hours determine according to equity and truth what had been suspending in the dubious scales of ratiocination quotation altercation and pecuniary consideration for three and twenty years  neither do i see any period to the progress of this evil the avenue still opens and leads on to further mischiefs for the distinctions in law are like the newtonian particles of matter divisible ad infinitum they have been dividing and subdividing for some centuries past and the subdivisions are as likely to be subdividing for ever insomuch that law thus divisible debateable and delayable is become a greater grievance than all that it was intended to redress  i lately asked a pleasant gentleman of the coif if he thought it possible for a poor man to obtain a decree in matter of property against a rich man he smiled and answered according to scripture that with man it was impossible but that all things were possible to god i suppose he meant that the decrees of the courts of westminster were hereafter to be reversed  perhaps sir said mr fielding neither our laws nor our lawyers are so much to blame as the people who apply to them for protection for justice satisfaction or revenge might not the parties who adventure on the course of litigation begin where they are most likely to end their career in the award of a few persons or a verdict of twelve neighbors  but the nature of man is prone to contention and quarrel there is a certain portion of yest or fermentation in his mass that will have vent in some way and our courts of law are the most obvious receptacles for the ebullitions of pride avarice envy resentment and wrathfulness the insolences of temper and overflowings of fortune  mr scruple an attorney a very singular man in his way was lately recommended to me as a person equally qualified for alluring or compelling my litigating opponents to an accommodation and he told me an exceeding pleasant story as well respecting the process and forms of our courts of law as respecting the contentious disposition of our neighbors  some time since walter warmhouse a substantial farmer in essex was advised by sergeant craw that he had an unquestionable right to a certain tenement in the possession of barnaby bonniface his next neighbor and gossip who fattened by the dint of good ale and good humor  barnaby who equally hated debate and dry bowels offered to leave the matter in question to any honest neighbors of walters own choosing but walter proud of a weighty opinion and as weighty a purse rejected the proffered compromise with scorn and took a mortal aversion to honest barnaby because he refused to surrender his possessions on demand  walter warmhouse accordingly began the attack in form but mr scruple who had the uncommon conscience to remember that barnaby had once recovered his purse from a highwayman determined as far as possible to preserve the property of his old friend for this purpose he kept warily and cheaply on the defensive and while he held a watchful eye over the motions of the adversary he followed him close through a thirteen years labyrinth of lawforms and what with exceptions to bills and replies expensive commissions for examination of witnesses demurrer imparlance and essoign with hearings and rehearings defer of issue thereon costs of suit and costs of office he pretty nearly exhausted both the purse and the patience of the valorous plaintiff walter warmhouse whereupon his prudent patron the good sergeant craw deemed it high time to consent to a motion for referring the case to the arbitration and award of certain umpires though not of his clients choosing as at first proposed  soon after this order sergeant craw had occasion to travel to the farther parts of essex and his road led to the concerns of his old client walter warmhouse here walter happened to meet him and warned him of the manifold dangers of the way and of the numbers of thieves and highwaymen that infested the passages that lay just before him and pray then very smoothly says the sergeant is there no way through your fields mr warmhouse there is sir said warmhouse as good as any in england and may i not be permitted to pass most safely and a thousand welcomes  hereupon client warmhouse opened the gate that led from the road into the fields and in issued the equipage of his learned advocate and kind patron  goodman warmhouse was mounted on a round ambling nag and rode much at his ease by the chariot of his malefactor they chatted as they went about the prices of cattle and improvement of lands the fall and rise of grain the necessity of industry and above all of the advantage of good enclosures which as the sergeant observed were emblems of the english laws and secured every mans property from question or encroachment  while thus they beguiled the way walter led his respectable patron through this field and that field and through you gate and the other gate and now went a head like a fox and now doubled like a hare till having mazed it and circled it for the space of three hours he finally conducted the sergeant to the very gate at which he had first entered  how how exclaims the sergeant methinks we are just where we set out we have not gained an inch of ground by the many miles we have traveled  quite as much replied walter in a journey of three hours as your honor gained for me in a journey of thirteen years and i leave you as you left me  just where you found me  your story cried mr fenton is as pleasant as it is apt and reminds me of an observation made by harry the  th of france that is equally pertinent to the subject  a certain judge of a court of law in that kingdom had grown aged on the bench and honored by the innumerable sentences which he had passed and which were all deemed conformable to the most perfect measure and dispensation of equity the gainers of the several suits applauded his discernment and justice to the skies and even the losers allowed that they had no right to complain the fame of his wisdom and integrity reached the throne the monarch was curious to see a judge of so peculiar a cast and character and he sent for him under color of thanking him for the great honors which he had done to his regency  after a most gracious reception and some compliments at the levee the prince took him apart and in confidence said  my lord judge the infinite complaints that come before me from all parts of the kingdom respecting the erroneous or iniquitous sentences daily passed by your fraternity cast the highest luster on the singularity of your conduct and give me an eager curiosity to know by what measures you have been enabled to content all parties i adjure you then by all that you reverence to disguise nothing from me on this head you have not any thing to fear from my censure of means that have proved so very successful and you have all things to hope from my approbation  the judge thereupon cast himself at the feet of his prince and rising addressed him thus  to you my sovereign as to heaven i will open my whole soul  in the first place in order to enable myself to give a guess whether the judgments to be pronounced might be right or wrong i gave all possible attention to the merits of each case during the process i daily took minutes of the pleadings on either side i enlarged and commented on those minutes while matters were fresh in my memory and i never interrupted any cause till it had run itself out of breath through the circuit of forms and due course of law  in the next place may it please your majesty i never took bribe or present of any kind or from any hand lest favor or inclination should insensibly tempt me to cogg or give a partial turn to the final cast  thus prepared as soon as matters were ripe for a decree that is to say as soon as the respective lawyers had agreed among themselves that nothing more was to be said nor any thing more to be got on either side of the question i summed up the repugnant merits so equally and impartially with respect to circumstance evidence and ordinance of law as induced both parties now wearied and wishing for rest to think that the decree must inevitably be given against themselves and having appointed a certain hour for uttering the fatal sentence i got up under visible concern and retired  from the bench so please your graciousness i withdrew to my closet and having locked myself up i called upon my tutelary and never erring directors in the solution of all knots and unwinding of all intricacies in short i went to a little drawer and took out  my box and dice  box and dice exclaimed the monarch half starting from his seat yes sire replied the judge i repeat it box and dice and if your majesty will be pleased to attend for a few moments i trust to convince you of the propriety of this proceeding  humanum est errare this my liege is a maxim that has never yet been controverted by precept or by practice and it is as much as to say that life is a mere labyrinth of errors in which all men are appointed to travel and to stray  nothing save number and measure is yet determined upon earth nothing is certain save that two and two make four and that lines are equal or differ according to their dimensions  all men further than this depend upon reason as their enlightner and director in the search of truth and yet reason itself has nothing whereon it may rest or depend it first doubts and then proceeds to examine it calls in evidence and arguments on this side and on that side pro and con it compares canvasses and discusses sifts and boults matters suppose to the very bran it endeavors to poise the scales of its own uncertainty and now recovers some lapsed circumstance and casts it into this scale and again throws some new proof or discovery into that scale and so changes its opinion from day to day while prejudice and partiality stand invisibly at its elbow and at length determine the long suspended balance by casting their own weights into one scale or the other according as interest or pleasure would wish to preponderate  truth so please your supremacy has been sunk in so very deep a well as to mock the fiveinched fathom of mere human ratiocination whether it be a dealer or retailer of physic or metaphysics of the distinctions in law or the distinctions in philosophy and i flatter myself that i alone the least and most unlikely of all your majestys subjects have hit upon a method for fishing up truth by a line which i acknowledge is not of my own twisting  within my memory and nearly within that of your majesty particular laws have been in force for trial by combat and trial by ordeal and though at present those laws are held to have been iniquitous and wholly absurd they could not have been instituted without just and ponderous reasons they related my liege as my sentences do to the interposition of providence in the jewish lots whereby all doubts however general could be speedily ascertained where the nation drew lots according to tribes the tribes according families and the families by individuals till the criminal was detected  thus in trial by combat i have known and read of manifold instances wherein guilty courage and prowess have been foiled by the weak and fearful and in trial by ordeal heaven never failed to guide the steps of the hoodwinked innocent between the narrow intervals of the burning plowshares and thus conscious of my own infirmity and blindness i have referred all my decrees to a power of better discernment and he never failed to determine according to truth  indeed said the monarch i cannot wholly disapprove your method when i reflect on your motive and according to your account when i think on the plague and anxiety loss of time and loss of fortune to which my subjects are put by these professors of the law you have clearly convinced me my good lord judge that it would be infinitely better to cast dice at the beginning than to give the most righteous judgment at the end of any lawsuit  while the gentlemen were thus plunged in the bottomless gulf of the law mrs fielding beckoned ned to a remote part of the room and was greatly taken with his lively and innocent chat  pray mr fenton said she is this your son no madam said mr fenton we know not to whom he belongs poor fellow and i am persuaded from many circumstances that he was stolen in his infancy from his true parents  mrs fielding instantly colored like scarlet and casting at her husband an eager and animated look gracious heaven she exclaimed who knows my dear but this may be our precious our lost and long lamented boy to whom providence this day has so wonderfully conducted us  madam said mr fenton it is thought that hundreds of children are yearly spirited away from their parents by gypsies by beggars to excite charity and by kidnappers to carry to the plantations but i hear of very few that ever have been restored except in romance pray had you any particular memorandum or mark whereby you would know him to be your child on the presumption of his being found  alas no sir said mrs fielding he was scarce two year old when his nurse got leave to go and see a relation the only visit poor woman that she made from the time she took my child to the breast she left him in the care of the house maid who used to caress him with particular tenderness he stood with her at the door some one called her in suddenly but quickly returning my child was gone  ah could the wretches who took him have guessed at the heartrending anguish which that loss cost me it were not in the nature of barbarians of brutes of fiends themselves to have imagined a deed of such deadliness for three days and nights life hovered like a flame that was just departing and was only retained by my frequent and long swoonings that for a time shut up all sense and recollection neither do i think that my dear husband suffered much less than myself however he might constrain and exert his spirits to keep up as it were some appearance of manliness  we dispatched cryers throughout the city and through all the neighboring towns with offers of vast recompense to any who should discover and restore our child to us and we continued for years to advertise him in all the public papers but alas he must have been taken by some very illiterate wretches who could not read and who never heard of the rewards that were offered their own interest must otherwise have engaged them to return him pray mr fenton how did you come by this pretty boy  here ned assisted mr fenton to give a detail respecting himself of the circumstances already recited and mr fenton mentioned the precaution he had taken for seizing his former mammy if ever she should make her appearance  if heaven should ever bless me with more children said mr fielding i have determined to fix some indelible mark upon them such as that of the jerusalemletters that in case of accident i may be able to discover and ascertain my own offspring from all others such a precaution said mr fenton is more especially incumbent on those who send their children abroad to be nursed where it is so practicable for fosterers to impose a living infant in the place of one who has died or by an exchange to prefer a child of their own to an inheritance for the features of infancy generally change to a degree that shortly leaves no trace of the original cast of countenance and it is common with parents to leave their children at nurse for years without seeing or renewing the memory of their aspects  mr fenton says mrs fielding will you give me your interest in this sweet foundling i will regard him as my own child i will be good to him for the sake of the one i have lost tell me my dear will you come and live with me  what say you ned says mr fenton would you like to go and live with that lady o sir cried ned could i find in my heart to leave master harry and you to be sure i would give the world to be with this dear lady so saying he caught at her hand and pressed it eagerly to his lips mrs fielding found herself surprised and agitated by this action and taking him in her arms and repeatedly kissing him the gush of passion which she had sometime suppressed broke forth and she shed a plenteous shower of tears upon him  word being now brought that the chariot was put to rights and at the door mr and mrs fielding took a tender farewell of mr fenton and ned and set off for london  as we propose after the manner of the celebrated vertot to drop all the heavy and inanimate parts of our history and to retain nothing but the life and spirit thereof we take the liberty to pass over a few months during which nothing material happened save that our harry increased in stature and in all personal and mental accomplishments  it was the latter end of august the weather fair and pleasant when harry issued forth to his little campus martius accompanied by neddy and the faithful james  he was there met by his customary companions in arms and they had nearly settled their courses and exercises for the evening when a young phoenomenon of nobility made his appearance like a phoenix among the vulgar birds attended by two servants in flaming liveries  all the boys except harry and ned who kept close to him immediately approached the glittering stranger and paid their respects with admiration and a kind of awkard obeisance while harry eyed him askance with a half sullen and half disdainful regard and notwithstanding the native benevolence of his temper felt no kind of complacence in his bosom toward him  the young nobleman to make a parade of his wealth and at the same time to indulge his petulance of disposition took a handful of sixpences and shillings from his pocket and throwing them among the crew cried a scramble boys a scramble  hereupon a scuffle royal instantly ensued all of them save three eagerly grappled at the pieces that had fixed their eye while each at the same time seized and struggled with his fellow our hero mean while observed all that passed with a distingushing attention but as the cause of quarrel was quickly conveyed from sight nothing worse happened than a few trips and boxes to which the parties had been accustomed and therefore did not resent insomuch that my lord was wholly defeated of the benevolent intention of his generosity and looked upon himself as defrauded of his coin  to compensate this disappointment and to make surer for the future of his dearly beloved mischief he took a crownpiece from his pocket and holding it up to the full view of the assembly he proclaimed it as the prize of victory between any two who should step forth on the spot and engage in a boxing match at the word an unknown champion sprung forward instantly stripped and challenged the field  this unknown had arrived but that very morning with his parents who came to settle at the village he was by nature a very valiant but very quarrelsome boy he had consequently been engaged in a number of occasional combats wherein he had generally come off victorious and this gave him as full an assurance of conquest as though his brow had already received the wreath  the stranger in bulk and stature exceeded the field and no one had yet offered himself an antagonist when harry stepping up thus addressed him in a gentle but admonishing accent  i find sir you are a stranger you are therefore to be excused for behaving amiss as you are yet unacquainted with the laws of this place but i must now be so free to inform you that whoever quarrels here or boxes for money must afterward take a turn with me for nothing as well before as after briskly replied the adversary but i scorn to take you at an advantage prepare yourself and strip you must first show me rejoined harry that you are worth stripping for  the unknown instantly fired at what he held to be a boastful insult and leaping forward aimed a punch at harrys stomach with all his force when harry nimbly catching the right wrist of his adversary in his left hand and giving him at the same instant a sudden trip with his right foot and a stroke across the neck with his right arm the strange heros heels flew up and his shoulders and head came with a squelch to the earth  as this unfortunate champion lay astonished dismayed and wholly disqualified by his fall from further contention harry generously stepped forward and offered to raise him but turning from him he painfully and slowly arose and muttering something not intelligible he walked away with a sullen but much abased motion  harrys companions hereat began to set up a cry of triumph and derision after the vanquished but harry suddenly stopped them and cried for shame my friends he is a brave boy and deserves to be honored though a stranger to our ways and i hope in my heart that he may not be hurt nor discouraged from coming among us any more  our young nobleman mean while had observed all that passed and considered our hero with an envious and indignant attention when harry calling to him the three boys who had declined to partake of the scramble for my lords money my good boys cries he aloud you had the honor to refuse to quarrel and tear your companions and friends to pieces for the dirty matter of a few sixpences and the first part of your reward shall be many sixpences  so saying he put his hand in his pocket and taking out three crowns made a present of one to each then feeling a secret touch of self approbation he turned to my lords servants and addressed them in an accent and with an action rather too highly elevated go he cried my friends take your young master home to his father and mother and tell them from me that since they have already made him a lord i wish the next thing they do would be to make him a gentleman  what you scoundrel cried my lord do you tell me to my face that i am not a gentleman and flying instantly at harry he gave him a smart stroke on the left cheek harry had just begun to recollect his error but being again kindled to quick resentment he half repressed and half enforced a sudden paunch which he reached at the nose of his lordship who giving a scream fell backward and measured his length on the field  the two servants immediately stooped to raise their bleeding master and one of them highly exasperated to see his lord in that condition turned furiously upon harry in order to chastise him but jack freeman his fellow servant strait caught him by the arm crying hold patrick hold remember fair play and old england  so saying he suddenly stopped catched at our heros hand pressed it warmly to his lips and cried o my noblest child how i envy the happiness of those who serve you then turning he took his lord by the hand and straight led him away from the field of battle  friend appropo to your turning a lord into a gentleman when your hero gave that just though over haughty reproof to the insolence and petulance of the gay stranger had he not a clear conception of the character of your true gentleman   author if he had not a positive yet you see he had a negative apprehension of the matter if he could not say what it was to be  yet he could tell you what it was not to be a gentleman and he clearly perceived that neither finery grandeur of equipage title wealth superior airs affectation of generosity neither a mischiefmaking temper nor a taking of delight in the broils conflicts passions and pains of others were any constituent qualities in this reverable character   fr i beseech you then at this interval to satisfy my impatience and to make good your promise that you would give me a detail of the qualities that entitle a man to this supreme of denominations   aut that perhaps may be done with better effect to the understanding as well as the heart by instancing and exemplifying rather than defining  it has already been intimated that hector was the finest gentleman of whom we read in history and don quixote the finest gentleman we read of in romance as was instanced from the tenor of their principles and actions  some time after the battle of cressy edward the third of england and edward the black prince the more than heir of his fathers renown pressed john king of france to indulge them with the pleasure of his company at london john was desirous of embracing the invitation and accordingly laid the proposal before his parliament at paris the parliament objected that the invitation had been made with an insidious design of seizing his person thereby to make the cheaper and easier acquisition of the crown to which edward at that time pretended but john replied with some warmth that he was confident his brother edward and more especially his young cousin were too much of the gentleman to treat him in that manner he did not say too much of the king of the hero or of the saint but too much of the gentleman to be guilty of any baseness  the sequel verified this opinion at the battle of poictiers king john was made prisoner and soon after conducted by the black prince to england the prince entered london in triumph amid the throng and acclamations of millions of the people but then this rather appeared to be the triumph of the french king than that of his conqueror john was seated on a proud steed royally robed and attended by a numerous and gorgeous train of the british nobility while his conqueror endeavored as much as possible to disappear and rode by his side in plain attire and degradingly seated on a little irish hobby  as aristotle and the critics derived their rules for epic poetry and the sublime from a poem which homer had written long before any rules were formed or laws established for the purpose thus from the demeanor and innate principles of particular gentlemen art has borrowed and instituted the many modes of behavior which the world has adopted under the title of goodmanners  one quality of a gentleman is that of charity to the poor and this is delicately instanced in the account which don quixote gives to his fast friend sancho pansa of the valorous but yet more pious knight errant saint martin  on a day said the don saint martin met a poor man half naked and taking his cloak from his shoulders he divided and gave him the one half now tell me at what time of the year this happened was i a witness quoth sancho how the vengeance should i know in what year or what time of the year it happened had thou sancho rejoined the knight any thing within thee of the sentiment of saint martin thou must assuredly have known that this happened in winter for had it been summer saint martin would have given the whole cloak  another characteristic of the true gentleman is a delicacy of behavior toward that sex whom nature has entitled to the protection and consequently entitled to the tenderness of man  the same gentlemanerrant entering into a wood on a summers evening found himself entangled among nets of green thread that here and there hung from tree to tree and conceiving it some matter of purposed conjuration pushed valorously forward to break through the enchantment hereupon some beautiful shepherdesses interposed with a cry and besought him to spare the implements of their innocent recreation the knight surprised and charmed by the vision replied  fair creatures my province is to protect not to injure to seek all means of service but never of offense more especially to any of your sex and apparent excellencies your pretty nets take up but a small piece of favored ground but did they enclose the world i would seek out new worlds whereby i might win a passage rather than break them  two very lovely but shamefaced girls had a cause of some consequence depending at westminster that indispensably required their personal appearance they were relations of sir joseph jeckel and on this tremendous occasion requested his company and countenance at the court sir joseph attended accordingly and the cause being opened the judge demanded whether he was to entitle those ladies by the denomination of spinsters no my lord said sir joseph they are lilies of the valley they toil not neither do they spin yet you see that no monarch in all his glory was ever arrayed like one of these  another very peculiar characteristic of a gentleman is the giving place and yielding to all with whom he has to do  of this we have a shining and affecting instance in abraham perhaps the most accomplished character that may be found in history whether sacred or profane  a contention had arisen between the herdsmen of abraham and the herdsmen of his nephew lot respecting the propriety of the pasture of the lands wherein they dwelled that could now scarce contain the abundance of their cattle and those servants as is universally the case had respectively endeavored to kindle and inflame their masters with their own passions  when abraham in consequence of this perceived that the countenance of lot began to change toward him he called and generously expostulated with him as follows  let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee or between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen for we be brethren if it be thy desire to separate thyself from me is not the whole land before thee if thou will take the left hand then will i go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left  another capital quality of the true gentleman is that of feeling himself concerned and interested in others never was there so benevolent so affecting so pathetic a piece of oratory exhibited upon earth as that of abrahams pleading with god for averting the judgments that then impended over sodom but the matter is already so generally celebrated that i am constrained to refer my reader to the passage at full since the smallest abridgement must deduct from its beauties and that nothing can be added to the excellencies thereof  honor again is said in scripture peculiarly to distinguish the character of a gentleman where it is written of sechem the son of hamor that he was more honorable than all the house of his father  this young prince giving way to the violence of his passion had dishonourably defloured dinah the daughter of jacob but his affections and soul claved to the party whom he had injured he set no limit to his offers for repairing the wrong ask me he said to her kindred ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife  from hence it may be inferred that human excellence or human amiableness does not so much consist in a freedom from frailty as in our recovery from lapses our detestation of our own transgressions and our desire of atoning by all possible means the injuries we have done and the offenses we have given herein therefore may consist the very singular distinction which the great apostle makes between his estimation of a just and of a good man for a just or righteous man says he one would grudge to die but for a good man one would even dare to die here the just man is supposed to adhere strictly to the rule of right or equity and to exact from others the same measure that he is satisfied to mete but the good man though occasionally he may fall short of justice has properly speaking no measure to his benevolence his general propensity is to give more than the due the just man condemns and is desirous of punishing the transgressors of the line prescribed to himself but the good man in the sense of his own falls and failings gives latitude indulgence and pardon to others he judges he condemns no one save himself the just man is as a stream that deviates not to the right or left from its appointed channel neither is swelled by the flood of passion above its banks but the heart of the good man the man of honor the gentleman is as a lamp lighted by the breath of god and none save god himself can set limits to the efflux or irradiations thereof  again the gentleman never envies any superior excellence but grows himself more excellent by being the admirer promoter and lover thereof  saul said to his son jonathan thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou have chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion for as long as the son of jesse lives upon the ground thou shall not be established nor thy kingdoms wherefore send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die  here every interesting motive that can possibly be conceived to have an influence on man united to urge jonathan to the destruction of david he would thereby have obeyed his king and pacified a father who was enraged against him he would thereby have removed the only luminary that then eclipsed the brightness of his own achievements and he saw as his father said that the death of david alone could establish the kingdom in himself and his posterity but all those considerations were of no avail to make jonathan swerve from honor to slacken the bands of his faith or cool the warmth of his friendship o jonathan the sacrifice which thou then made to virtue was incomparably more illustrious in the sight of god and his angels than all the subsequent glories to which david attained what a crown was thine jonathan when thou wast slain in thine high places  saul of tharsus had been a man of bigotry blood and violence making havoc and breathing out threatenings and slaughter against all who were not of his own sect and persuasion but when the spirit of that infant who laid himself in the manger of human flesh came upon him he acquired a new heart and a new nature and he offered himself a willing subject to all the sufferings and persecutions which he had brought upon others  saul from that time exemplified in his own person all those qualities of the gentleman which he afterward specifies in his celebrated description of that charity which as he says alone endures for ever  when festus cried with a loud voice saul thou art beside thyself much learning does make thee mad saul stretched the hand and answered i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness for the king knows of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him king agrippa believe thou the prophets i know that thou believe then agrippa said unto saul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian and saul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were not only almost but altogether such as i am  except these bonds  here with what an inimitable elegance did this man in his own person at once sum up the orator the saint and the gentleman  from these instances my friend you must have seen that the character or rather quality of a gentleman does not in any degree depend on fashion or mode on station or opinion neither changes with customs climates or ages but as the spirit of god can alone inspire it into man so it is as god is the same yesterday today and for ever   friend it is a standard whereby i propose for the future to measure and judge of all my acquaintance  but let us return to our little gentleman monitor   chap xii never did harry feel himself so deeply mortified so debased in his own eyes as when my lords footman in terms and with an action so uncommonly respectful had stooped and kissed his hand his heart but just before had whispered to him that the manner in which he had admonished the young nobleman expressed more of the pride and insolence of his own temper than any friendly intention to reform the faults of another and he already began to suspect that the manner in which he had dispensed his own bounty showed the same ostentation which he meant to reprove and with which he had been so highly offended in his lordship  thus disgusted with himself and consequently with all about him he turned away from his companions walked sad and silent homeward and passing softly through the hall withdrew to his own chamber  james had followed harry at such a distance as just to keep him in sight and entering where his master sat reading in the parlour mr fenton enquired eagerly after his boy james cast at his master a look of much solemnity and shaking his head in token of concern ah sir said he i am sorry to tell you that master harry today was not altogether as good a boy as i could have wished indeed i observe of late that at times he is apt to be very sudden and passionate i doubt sir we shall have woeful doings by and by he has terribly abused and battered the son and heir of the earl of mansfield one of the worthiest noblemen in all england to be sure we shall have sad complaints against him i was present at all that passed and truly master harry was very much in fault  you delight me you transport me cried mr fenton my only affliction was that he had no faults i want him to have faults james i want him to have faults such faults as may make him feel them but tell me minutely as particularly as you can how this affair happened james then gave a special detail of what we have recited whereupon mr fenton exclaimed o my noble my generous my incomparable boy where is he let me see him what is become of him  upon enquiry mrs susan reported that she had seen him stealing softly up stairs mr fenton then taking his book in his hand stole up after his harry and opening his chamber door with the least noise possible saw him seated in a dejected attitude in a far corner of the room and looking attentively at him perceived that he had been in tears  he thereupon took a chair and gently seating himself beside him what is the matter my harry he said what ails my love dont ask me dont ask me sir cried harry i darent tell you indeed i dare not you would love me no longer you would hate me if i should tell you hate you my darling cried mr fenton that is quite impossible i can never hate you my harry but come be free with your friend tell me openly and honestly for what do you think i should hate you for my faults sir for my faults to be sure there is not in the world so bad a boy as myself and what is worse than all that when i think and mean to do better than ever something comes in the way and spoils the whole and so turns all the good that is in me into nothing but naughtiness  here harry could contain no longer but burst into a passionate gush of tears and sobs and mr fenton tenderly embracing him and taking him on his knee and clasping him to his bosom gave way to the kindred emotion that swelled in his own breast and mingled his joyful tears with those of his harry  as soon as the passion of these two friends had subsided harry began to take new courage from the caresses of his dear dada who as he sensibly felt would never hate or forsake him however he might condemn and detest himself  well then dada says he since you are so very good i will trust you with my story so far as it has to say to the little that i can remember of my faults in it  you must know that i had no sooner got into your field that you gave me for our plays than a young master came up to us so grandly dressed and attended and with such a saucy air that he seemed to say in his own mind all these are but dirt in comparison of myself  as i looked at him he brought to my mind the story you once told me of hercules who was poisoned by his fine coat so i began to pity him and i believe to despise him too and that you know was not right for you told me that whoever despises another grows worse than the one he despises and falls below him while he thinks to set himself above him but that didnt come into my head at the time  and so sir to show us all that he didnt matter money or that he loved mischief the better of the two he took out a handful of silver and threw it among my companions to set them by the ears and this provoked and began to make me very angry with him and thus one fault brought me into another after it like water my chickens come clock  but this didnt satisfy my young lord for they called him lord but he must take out a crown and offer it to any two of my companions that would box for it so a stranger that was just come offered to box any one in the company for it but i dont repent of my beating him because he was the challenger  but the worst is yet to come dada there was some of my companions who refused to join in the scramble for the money and that pleased me very much and so to reward them i took out a handful of money and gave them a crown a piece but you know i neednt have taken out more money than i meant to give them if it was not partly to show my lord that i had as much money as himself and so i got myself up to the head and ears in the very same fault that i found with him  now comes the worst of all for growing proud and conceited as if i had no one fault in the world and as if the like of me was only fit to reprove others and teach them their duty i desired the fine master to get himself home and since he was a lord to learn also to be a gentleman upon that he gave me a blow which i deserved very well but i didnt matter his blow a phillip if i had not thought it an affront before my companions so my passion begun to rise and i gave him a half stroke but unluckily it hit him full in the nose and i am afraid he is hurted very sadly  besides all dada i know well enough there will come sad complaints against me and so i shall bring trouble and disturbance upon you and that is grief upon grief  dont fear for me harry i shall do well enough says mr fenton but harry you have not told me near as great news as you thought to do i knew all along that you had a very naughty boy within you but i forbore to tell you so because i rather wished you should make the discovery yourself and now god be praised you have found out the secret  and what good will it do me dada to know that i am bad when i dont know how to make myself better for today i thought and meant to be very good and yet found myself in the end to be worse than ever but as you say to be sure i have been very bad though i hardly knew any thing of the matter till now i now remember how i had like to murder poor mr vindex with the sword and a hundred other things if i could bring them to mind what shall i do then dada what shall i do to grow good  i will tell you my harry says mr fenton and as you have generously entrusted me with one secret that of having a very bad boy within you it is but fair that i should entrust you with another secret which is that of having an exceeding good boy within you  what two boys in one dada how can that be it is even so my darling you yourself told me as much did you not say that this very day the one was struggling and fighting within you against the other that the one was proud scornful ostentatious and revengeful the other humble gentle generous loving and forgiving and that when the bad boy got the better the good boy took him to task and reprimanded and severely rebuked him and made him cry bitterly  what you say indeed dada is something very like it only i cannot think how one boy can be two boys do you remember harry what you read last night in the old testament about rebecka the wife of isaac when she was with child yes very well sir as how she was with child of twins and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord very right my love and i now say to you what god then said to rebecka i do not mean that you have two boys within you of the bodily bulk features and shape of yourself but that you have two different spirits or principles within you which like esau and jacob have quite different and adverse natures inclinations and desires the one prompting and hurrying you into all that is evil the other inviting and leading you into all that is good so you see harry and you have felt that like rebecka you have your own esau and your own jacob struggling within your bosom and the war between them shall never cease till the one shall have wholly conquered and subjected the other  to make this matter plainer and clearer to you my darling i will tell you a pretty story out of the book that is in my hand  cyrus was a king and a great conqueror but in his private capacity a very virtuous man on a day some of his captains just returned from an expedition informed him that they had brought him the greatest wonder in the world a young princess called panthea whom they had taken captive and whose charms exceeded all that could be imagined of woman  cyrus as i told you was virtuous he was already married and he dreaded running the risque of being seduced from his honesty by the dangerous allurements of this enchanting beauty he therefore obstinately though reluctantly forbid her approach and denied himself the pleasure he might have taken in beholding her  his own honor however and the respect due to the quality and accomplishments of the lady demanded all possible attention and precaution in her behalf for this purpose he summoned his chief captains and favorites he asked which of them would adventure to take the charge of this young beauty and he promised the highest rewards to those who should honorably discharge their trust but threatened his deepest displeasure to any who should betray it  all of them shrunk at the apprehension of taking upon them the personal custody and care of a beauty whom their great and virtuous monarch had not even dared to look upon and no one had offered to undertake this perilous commission till a valiant and noble youth named araspes stood forth  from my infancy o cyrus said the graceful adventurer i have been educated in the school and brought up at the feet of the divine zoroaster i am accustomed from my childhood to combat conquer and scorn all sensual seducers i hold virtue in mine eye as its only object my heart esteems and affects it as my only good the nature thereof is become one with my nature and i do not remember the time wherein i have been tempted to deviate from rectitude or sink beneath the calls of honor i cannot therefore but smile at the fear of my companions their courage at a breach or in the field is unquestionable i have seen them face a thousand deaths i have seen them rush into dangers and yet they dread the sight of a single and weakly female for me she can have no terrors since i am out of the power and reach of her allurements i will undertake the charge of this formidable creature at the risque of my honor at the risque of my life and more than all at the risque of the favor of cyrus  cyrus had long loved the person and contemplated and admired the virtues of this youth he therefore with joy and confidence committed this precious deposite to his trust in full assurance that the person and honor of panthea could no where be so safe as in the protection of araspes  the young hero had in reality all the virtues that he boasted his education under so beloved and respectable a master his early and long habit of opposing and rejecting the smallest incitement to vice and the delights which he was accustomed to feel in the sentiments and practice of what his judgment approved had in a manner so wholly lulled his naughty self to sleep that he did not so much as dream that he had an enemy within him  this my harry was his heavy misfortune and the sad occasion of his fall for not knowing that his evil esau was still alive in his bosom not knowing that he had any one to oppose or to struggle with he kept neither watch nor guard and so lay naked and open to the mischief that came upon him as i am going to tell you  on his seeing the lady who was committed to his trust he felt no emotion nor sentiment save that of wonder as in beholding the most perfect of the works of his creator and he took a pleasure in providing that she should be treated and accommodated with all possible attention and respect as due to so accomplished and preeminent a being  as the nature of his commission gave him frequent occasions of being near and about the person of his amiable ward new beauties grew daily visible and opened to his eyes but abve all in conversing with her the music of her accents and the elegance of her sentiments fell insensibly on his soul that drank them up as a dry ground drinks up the invisible dew of the evening  his occasions for attending her and doing little offices and services about her now daily increased without seeming to do so when he was called and intended to go elsewhere his feet imperceptibly carried him to the presence of panthea his slumbers were short uneasy and broken and at meals he knew not whether or on what he fed  at length his eyes opened to the calamity of his condition but at the moment wherein he perceived his love he found himself too far gone for the possibility of a return he was as a mariner who had haled his boat up on land and thinking himself secure had fallen asleep therein but while he slept a spring tide came silently on and covered the shore and gained upon the beach and swelled under the boat and heaved it from land and turning bore it farther and farther to sea then awakened the helpless mariner unprovided of sail or oar or of any means to effect or attempt a return he saw his lost estate he stretched his arms toward the land but while he reached it with his eyes he found himself carried by an irresistible power still more and more distant from the sight  thus fared it with the wretched lost fallen away araspes he awakened to his condition he looked around but found himself helpless he would have struggled he wished his return to virtue but his wishes were sickly as feeble as a dream and he felt himself borne away by a secret and subtle force from that honor of which he now barely retained a distant prospect  the imbosomed fire that preyed upon him at length became insufferable and he desperately determined to seek relief he threw himself at the feet of the object of his desires avowed the ardour of his passion and besought her pity  the princess replied in a mild but resolute accent i do pity you araspes i pity you the more as it is all that my power can ever do for you two insurmountable barriers oppose your desires the one is my honor the other my inclination i am already married to a young hero the prince and patron of his people the most accomplished of his sex and an honor to human nature he is my first and last love he possesses my heart wholly but were it emptied of him it would not be emptied of its virtue and the thoughts of any other would be an offense to my soul be advised then araspes depart from temptation and seek in absence a cure for the indiscretion of your love  confused astonished speechless araspes lost at once the little that remained to him of virtue and reason he knew not what he did he would have proceeded to violence when the princess suddenly drew a poniard and pointed it at her bosom whereat araspes strait withdrew overwhelmed with shame disappointment and despair  as soon as he had retired the princess took a little tablet whereon she inscribed the few following words  to cyrus your favorite has betrayed his trust he would have offered violence think what is due to your own honor as well as that of  panthea   this she dispatched to the monarch by one of her faithful mutes  as soon as cyrus had perused it he sighed and dropped a tear as over the departed virtue of his best beloved friend  he instantly sent for araspes araspes durst not disobey he came indeed but then he did not dare to look upward  after a silence on both sides  cyrus cried out whoever thou art account to me for my friend account to me for his virtue a virtue that i deemed to be impassable unassailable whereupon araspes made the following most memorable of answers  as you are but lately entered on your greek my harry i will first read the passage to you and then give you the sense of it word for word    o cyrus it is manifest that i have two souls for if i had but one soul it could not be at once both good and evil not a lover at the same time of what is honest and dishonest it could not at once desire and be averse to the same thing it is therefore most evident that we have two souls and when the good soul has the dominion good works are performed but evil works when the evil soul predominates  here harry you see there was two men in one man which is the same thing as there being two boys in you for the soul is the man harry and the body is but as a sign to give notice to others that such a man dwells within  but sir says harry since as you say and as i find i have two different boys or souls within me pray how came they to be different did the same god that desired to make the one soul good desire also to make the other soul evil  your question my darling is very proper though very deep i will however endeavor to the best of my power to accommodate my answer to the weakness of your capacity  god who is nothing but goodness cannot possibly desire any kind of evil and therefore cannot be immediately the author thereof but he can make or create such poor little insignificant beings as you and i are harry though all that god himself can do in our behalf cannot possibly make us good or excellent or perfect any otherwise than by informing us with his own goodness and perfections  this would lead me my love to the unfolding that capital secret of which you are not yet susceptible a secret upon which this world sun moon and stars with all the worlds upon worlds that lie beyond them depend and hang as your hat would hang upon yonder nail  the angels that are now in heaven are great good perfect and glorious beings because they are filled with the greatness goodness glory and perfection of god for they know that of themselves they are nothing and that in themselves they are no other than empty and dark creatures mere sensible capacities prepared for the reception the feeling and enjoyment of the light virtue and blessedness of their bountiful creator  how the spirit of man came to be in itself so much worse than an empty and dark creature how it came to be filled and polluted with all manner of evil with selfishness pride covetousness abominable lusts envy hatred malice revengefulness and wrathfulness how it further came to have a different spirit begotten within it informing its heart and tuneing the chords thereof to sentiments of humility charity purity love patience and peace this harry is the great secret of which you are not yet capable the secret as i told you whereon the world now hangs whereby it has been changed and whereby it will be renewed  in the mean time let it suffice for you to feel and to know that your dark spirit so filled as i said with evil is yourself my harry is all that you have of the creature within you and that the good spirit which is begotten within your evil spirit is breathed into you by the power and spirit of god himself in order to oppose and conquer the evil and enlighten the darkness and purify the foulness of your selfish or creaturely spirit that you may finally become as the angels that are in heaven filled with the purity glory and blessedness of your god  know therefore from henceforward and let the sense of it sink into your soul my darling that all the evil which is in you belongs to yourself and that all the good which is in you belongs to your god that you cannot in or of yourself so much as think a good thought or form a good wish or oppose a single temptation or evil motion within you from hence learn to be humble and to think meanly of yourself and not to ascribe to yourself any kind of goodness or virtue for that would be sacrilege it would be to rob god of his peculiar property of goodness from hence further learn never to prefer yourself to others or to think better of yourself than of any one living for so far as you are a creature no one can be viler or faultier than you are however god may be pleased through his mercy and bounty to you to be better in you than in others  never exalt yourself my harry neither in company or conversation of any kind say i did this or i did that or i said this or i said that for in exalting yourself you exalt your own proud and evil spirit above the good and meek spirit of god that is in you let all praise mortify and be a reproach to your conscience but take blame with patience and pleasure in so doing you will approve yourself a lover of justice as well as a lover of your own reformation  lastly my love turn your whole will and affections from your own evil spirit to the spirit of god that is in you for that is the utmost that any man can do toward his own salvation reject spurn and detest every motion to evil embrace cherish and take to your heart every motion to good you will thereby acquire the never ending glory of having joined with god in the combat and conquest that he is desirous of obtaining over all the guilt uncleanness and depravity into which your nature is fallen  here andrew came up with notice to his master that the earl of mansfield was below and requested to speak with him at this harry colored up and cried didnt i tell you sir what trouble i should bring upon you dont be alarmed my dear says mr fenton do you stay here if there is a necessity for your appearance i will send you word  the father of young lord bottom was in every respect the reverse of his son he had come on foot without attendants was dressed in a plain napped coat and had the mein and appearance of an honest country grazier  my lord says mr fenton i should think myself greatly honored by this visit if i was not so much concerned at the occasion of it i am truly grieved that my son should have done such great offense to young lord bottom sir says the earl i find you have quite mistaken the intent of my visit i am come to thank your son for the just and noble lesson which he gave to mine and which he has so forcibly impressed upon his memory as will not i trust permit him so forget it in a hurry my lord replied mr fenton my little fellow is very sensible of his misbehaviour in this business he was the first to chide himself and he told me the story very much i assure your lordship to his own disadvantage  mr fenton rejoined the earl after what i have heard of your boy from one jack freeman a very faithful and intelligent servant of mine i am quite impatient to see him and there is nothing generous which i am not willing to believe concerning him my wife indeed is not at all times in my way of thinking she has taken her young lord with her to town to the doctors and i am concerned at the violence of the resentment which she expressed on this occasion as it may be a means of deferring that acquaintance and intimacy which i heartily wish to cultivate with the family of mr fenton but where is this wonderful boy i request to see him  harry hereupon was immediately called down as he apprehended that he was sent for to be severely chidden a little resentful haughtiness arose in his mind and strengthened it against the violence of the reproofs that he expected he therefore entered with an air that no way savoured of mortification and made but a cold though solemn bow to the earl  bless me exclaimed my lord what a striking resemblance i never saw two faces or persons so much alike there is no difference mr fenton between you and your son except what age has made mr fenton smiled and my lord continued i always had a notion that your heroes were huge fellows but here i think we have got heroism quite in miniature can this be the one who as i am told with a trip or a blow overthrows and demolishes all before him come to me my dear and give me leave to salute you  harry respectfully approached and my lord taking him in his arms and warmly kissing him said i thank you my little man for the generous lesson which you gave to my very naughty boy and for the difference with you taught him to make for the future between the sauciness of a lord and the sentiments of a gentleman  harry felt himself at once disconcerted abased and wholly cut down by this compliment from his lordship at length recovering himself he answered you mean to be sure sir to reprove me the more by what you have said but if you are in earnest i am sure it is a very bad lesson which you teach me sir when you praise me for my faults and so encourage me in them faults my dear cried the earl i heard of none such what do you mean by your faults i mean sir that when i told your son as much as that he was not a gentleman it showed that i was still less of the gentleman myself and i very well deserved the blow which he gave me for such an affront and i am ready to ask his pardon whenever you please my lord no no my man cried lord mansfield you shall never disgrace yourself so much as to make any submissions to my naughty boy i shall think it no disgrace quick and affectingly replied harry to make submissions to any one who is son to such a gentleman as my lord mansfield  my lord for some time looked with astonishment at the child when eagerly catching and pressing him to his bosom he cried out on my soul you are the sweetest as well as the noblest fellow i was ever acquainted with and sir i shall think it an honor to be admitted among your friends and that is what i would not say to many in old england mr fenton continued the earl if you will give yourself the trouble to enquire out my little lodge on the hill you will oblige me though i envy your character i shall be glad of your acquaintance so saying lord mansfield got up after his blunt manner and precipitately withdrew  on the following evening mr fenton took harry and mr clement into his study and taking from his pocketbook a number of bank bills mr clement says he i here make my harry a present of fifteen hundred pounds reserving only to myself the privilege of advising how it may be laid out and secured for him to the best advantage  tomorrow morning you and he are to set out on foot for london and there to take lodgings as near to the fleet prison as you can conveniently be accommodated you are then to apply to the keeper and to give him a gratuity for making out a written list of all the prisoners under his custody with their quality and condition annexed as also the sums respectively due and the terms during which they have been in confinement  you are then to enquire from him the several characters distresses and merits of all the prisoners of note and to make an entry thereof in a separate paper but then you are not to depend altogether on his report you are to go from room to room to converse with the prisoners apart and to enquire from each the characters fortunes and disasters of the others  this inquisition in all likelihood will take you up above a fortnight but above all remember that those among them who are most affected by the distresses of their fellows ought to be the principal objects of your own charity and relief  let five hundred pounds of this money be appropriated to the enlargement of such prisoners as are under duress for sums not amounting to ten pounds you will thereby free the captive give means of bread to the hungry and restore to your country many members that are worse than useless that are also a dead weight and encumbrance upon her  let the remaining thousand pounds be applied to the enfranchisment or relief of those prisoners of note whose cases and calamities call for singular compassion and be sure to keep an account where your money may fall short of such valuable purposes and as far as five hundred pounds more will reach we will supply the defect  hereupon harry caught his patron about the neck and repeatedly kissing him cried o dada how happy how very happy you make me o that we had money enough to employ every fortnight the year round like this sweet fortnight  the very next morning our travelers set out on their generous expedition but we forbear to say any thing relative thereto till their return as they themselves are the best qualified and in truth have the best right to give the particulars of their own extraordinary adventures  our harry and his friend clement had not been gone above an hour when mr fenton received a card from the countess of maitland requesting his company to coffee in the evening she was widow to the late earl a very lovely woman had taken the most sumptuous house on the hill and was resorted to by numbers of the first figure from among whom she was perfectly qualified to make an election exceedingly entertaining to herself of the sensible the elegant and the ludicrous  mr fenton attended my lady precisely at the time appointed when he entered she was writing a note at her desk on turning her eye to the door she was suddenly struck with the grace of his figure the sweetness of his aspect and ease of his deportment she was further struck with a recollection as of something very interesting but which had happened at a vast distance or of which she had dreamed her heart was affected she colored up and again turned pale without being yet able to move from her chair at length recovering and rising and advancing toward him mr fenton says she this is a very singular favor a favor for which i have long wished this sir you know is my third time of asking but my two former cards were not so happy as to bring you madam said he carelessly i am but a very poor visiter however i could not refuse myself the honor of attending your ladyships summons at least for once i have been now said the countess three months on the hill within that time i have applied to all my acquaintance in order to get some of them to introduce me to you but none of them were so fortunate as to know any of your name to be known madam replied mr fenton a person must have been in some way considerable indeed it is no way disagreeable to my own inclinations to pass the short remnant of an insignificant life as little noticed as possible i have been just writing a note sir says my lady be so good to amuse yourself for a moment with the books and paintings in my closet there and i will attend you  within a few minutes after mr fenton had withdrawn mr sneer entered what cried he bowing all alone lady maitland that is surprising your sex it seems are grown very careless of improvement when they neglect the model by which they should polish their manners o you wretch exclaimed the countess what brought you here of all things i have a world of company to be with me this evening and if they get but a hint of your coming i shall be left as much alone as the statue in bushypark law madam cries mr sneer is it possible that with all your discernment you should be so much mistaken permit me to assure your ladyship that i am plagued out of my life by the solicitations of numbers of the first quality for my company you you brute cried my lady your company courted it must be by indians then who have a reason of their own for worshipping the devil why you make no more of characters than a reaper does of grass when he is cutting down weeds o madam exclaims mr sneer they like me never the worse for that every one gladly compounds for the maiming of their own character to have the pleasure of seeing those of their neighbors hewn down but pray madam what company do you expect this evening why there is colonel sweetpouder colonel sweetpouder of all things yes sir and a very fine gentleman too in my opinion why madam the man would not want sense it is true if he had not wholly mistaken the manners of his profession he has been as i am told in some trifling engagements but never had the rudeness to attack his enemy without white gloves he had like to have lost his life upon a retreat by the delay which he made in search of his sword knot  here a footman entered saying colonel sweetpouder my lady  lady maitland says the colonel your truly most devoted more yours than you are any ones mr sneer you are extremely happy sir in your tete a tete with her ladyship but people have not always the choice of their company severe colonel very severe upon my honor says mr sneer he who wars on the world replies the colonel should not hope to escape without a scratch mr sneer and i have faults enough to make me angry with all who are censorious colonel said the countess mr sneer has been railing at me through fifty families and is but just come to assist me to rail at my neighbors on my soul madam says mr sneer i am resolved not to spare the least of your failings when i am once so ingenious as to discover where they lie your justice mr sneer to the merits of this lady exclaims the colonel entitles you to say what you will against the rest of womankind  mr fenton just then reentering the countess introduced him to her acquaintance i hope in heaven madam cried mr sneer that the company whom you expect may be wholly the reverse of this gentlemans appearance the mouth of raillery must else learn the language of admiration and that would be an exchange by no means suitable to my taste mr fenton bowed but was silent  here was rap rap rap rap and immediately lady cribbages chariot was announced there now cries mr sneer there is the happiest woman in the universe that is certain she divides her whole time between the two delights of her life cards and scandal she is never tired of either and yet runs from one to the other that variety may give the higher relish to both  lady cribbage here entered in all the hurry imaginable she flew and embraced the countess with transport my dear dearest lady maitland says she how happy am i to have got to you at last heavens what have i endured before i could get free of that odious london what a gauntelope have i run a hundred and fifty visits no less upon rep and through such a sortment too as your mercers say but there is no dispensing with these fopperies they had all dropped cards at my gate and i coudnt but return the visit in good manners to myself you know there was lady gadabout and mrs chataway and mrs tendersides and lady frump and lady dowager gossipper and miss giglett the merry miss of threescore that you know la madam exclaimed the countess why these are all persons of distinguished fashion ay ay my dear friend replied lady cribbage they are the noughts of the great world when such as lady maitland are pleased to figure before them they acquire a kind of value they would not otherwise be picked up should they drop on the highway  colonel sweetpouder ten thousand pardons i really did not observe you  your servant sir  a fine person half whispering to lady maitland  and you here mr sneer you are the man of the world to whom we should pay our first respects if we desire that our caps should sit straight you know  why my lady says mr sneer would you be like the turk and allow no brother slanderer near your throne but the field of folly and ridicule is wide enough for us both besides madam we assail in very different manners i am like the parthian no more than a back stroke and away but your ladyship moves on like time or death and mow down your sex without distinction before you o fie mr sneer said lady cribbage what say you sir can you think so hardly of me no truly madam answered mr fenton i am rather inclined to believe that you only prune for i have often observed that after very keen hands reputation sprouts anew and flourishes the better o lady cribbage lady cribbage exclaimed mr sneer that is the severest thing upon my honor that was said this day what allow a lady the will to do mischief and not allow her the power can any thing be so provoking well supposing it to be so rejoined lady cribbage i would rather be cut by that gentlemans razor than mr sneers hatchet but apropo i wonder what keeps lady philligree i met her on my last visit and she told me she had but half a dozen more to pay and be with us she brings with her a new language for the day i will engage that woman says mr sneer ought to be strung up for minting our english dialect true added the colonel if her coin would pass ah colonel said mr fenton what species of folly or faultiness will not acquire currency when impressed and uttered by persons of fortune and figure  come dearest lady maitland cried lady cribbage while we choice spirits are got together let us know what company you have summoned for the evening i hope in goodness you have laid in a sufficient fund for merriment i should droop to death if the propriety of their manners left no room for laughter fear not said the countess but mark the characters as they pass  first there is sir bumkin toilette most excellent exclaimed lady cribbage the amphibious wretch he that is so like an otter between his country breeding that he cannot get rid of and his court breeding that he cannot assume  again there is lord bottom earl of mansfield lately come to the hill ay added the colonel there is the sample that nature gave us when she intended to show what man ought to be he the bear cries sneer for heavens sake colonel how can you praise a man whose manners are so wholly the reverse of your own i allow that he has talents and learning though he seems to know nothing about the matter and he piques himself solely on the most plebeian of all virtues that of being an honest man do you know him mr fenton just enough sir said mr fenton to make me fear that i should rather afford matter of ridicule to his lordship than hope to be merry at his expense i have been told said sneer that on his return from his travels he was an accomplished cavalier but he suddenly took a disgust to all manner of politeness and i question at this moment if there are five men in england to whom he would say your servant and i am confident added the colonel that there are not five men in england whom he would not serve  talk not of him dear colonel exclaimed lady cribbage he says more shocking things in fewer and simpler words than any cynic that ever breathed because madam rejoined the colonel he is too much our friend to hurt us by flattery and he never reproves but with an intention to reform well well cried sneer i own there is not much matter for laughter in his character let us call another cause who comes next lady maitland  the widow mawkin says the countess the huge kentish fortune she who keeps three marriageable daughters in the nursery for fear people should be so impertinent as to enquire who brought them into the world she is not yet in despair of a third jointure and she would bribe others by her smiles to be as forgetful of her age as she is herself i never see her cries lady cribbage but she puts me in mind of a maymorning when the long pole is awkardly hung with flowers and garlands she has been equally happy adds mr sneer in adorning her mind with the flowers of science and is as ridiculously affected in the parade of her learning as she is of her dress i could pity or pardon all this says the colonel if she were not so merciless in her censures on an article of female virtue to a single breach of which no man living will ever lead mrs mawkin into temptation but have you any more blocks madam for the hewing out of our mercuries  yes yes said the countess there is enough to laugh with and enough to laugh at i warrant you there is our friend billy bustle o lud screamd lady cribbage i wish i had brought another gown this is he who is always so busy where there is nothing to do he is so full of his friendships that you never can escape without some damage and he spoils you a suit of brocade in his hurry to reach you your coffee  then says the countess there is miss trinket o the pretty bauble cries mr sneer whoever marries her will have something to hang to his watch again there is franc faddle whose company is so universally courted that is what amazes me of all things cried the colonel the insensible wretch he is quite callous to the keenest sting of satire the fool is good humoured it must be confessed he is so desirous of promoting merriment that he actually enjoys the laugh that is raised at his own expense it is then no longer said mr fenton any matter of wonder that his company should be sought after since all love to laugh but very few to be laughed at  there was a mystery in the behavior of mr faddle said sneer that no one dreamed of i happened some time since to be in company where he had set himself up as a butt to be shot at the novelty of the thing surprised me i examined him with attention i remarked the cleverness of the address with which he used to turn the joke upon himself and i discerned under his submission to the triumph of others an understanding quite superior to that of his ralliers in a few months after i happened to join him in a private walk mr faddle said i i cannot conceive why you should offer yourself as an object of jest and ridicule to people infinitely your inferiors in every thing except fortune  i am no longer under that necessity answered faddle you see i am in mourning a relation has lately left me seven hundred a year you are the first mr sneer who had the discernment to detect me and are entitled that i should account to you for my behavior  i am a younger brother early in life i was left wholly dependent on my mothers small jointure and experience quickly showed me that the countenances of all about me caught a coldness and disregard from the knowledge of my narrow circumstances  how to remedy this evil how to procure an interest in the golden idol before whom all nations and languages fall prostrate was the question  i found myself in a world where a genius for pimping or a genius for knavery was indispensably necessary to the acquisition of favor i was so unfortunate as to want talents for those valuable purposes i could not even betray an enemy to serve a friend i therefore found myself excluded from the patrons of the present age as i could neither contribute to the modes of their interest or the modes of their pleasure  at length i thought upon the stratagem that surprised you it requires no greater art said i to myself than to be wise and humble wise enough to acquiesce in being deemed a fool and humble enough to submit as a footstool for others to raise themselves in their own opinion and in the eyes of the company  my project succeeded beyond expectation i was admitted to an intimacy with the chiefs of the land my company was coveted and sought by all the great and happy was the peer who could boast to his visitants he should have faddle to supper  mean time i was by no means a jest for all i knew how to turn the ridicule upon such of your middling gentry as presumed to laugh like their betters and i never failed to pull down those from whose interest or favor i had nothing to expect  i had a number of these right honorable patrons each of whom would gladly have engrossed me to himself they all contributed to make me relish the jest independent of very considerable presents they have procured me some pretty sinecures to the amount of about six hundred pounds a year so that you see mr sneer i am now in a fair way of being enabled to fee others to permit me in my turn to laugh at them  i do not feel in myself said mr fenton a thorough approbation of this gentlemans character there is something unamiable in every species of imposition and even the merit of mr faddles humility receives great alloy from its disingenuity his good sense however is laudable since his intention was innocent with respect to the persons upon whom he practiced his stratagem does he bring up the rear of your visitants lady maitland  no said the countess we have lady homespun with an et cetera of no characters yet to come  homespun exclaimed lady cribbage upon my word the best sort of a gammer of quality that i know the good woman would really be sensible company if she was not so utterly void of education could you think how the poor creature exposed her ignorance the other day she popped in where i was engaged at four handed cribbige having peerd over the game with vast sagacity what says she i think your ladyship has got to your old game of quadrille ha ha ha lady homespun i fancy is one of those who think of getting into a fashion exactly at the period that others have got out  madam said the countess if lady homespun had time to spare from the duties of religion and a life of benevolence she would undoubtedly employ it in studying matters more suitable to your ladyships taste her peccadillos however are pardonable on account of her pleasantry for while she laughs with great justice at the follies of high life she laughs at herself also with great good humor for being so sensibly out of the fashion  here again was a loud rapping and the peals were repeated with little intermission till all the company arrived they succeeded so quickly that lady maitland had scarce time to receive each of them with a distinction and manner of address that she judged most agreeable to their humors and characters  in the first place mrs philligree rushed in and cried lady maitland i am most superlatively yours i am yours madam said the countess positively beyond all comparison  such a stranger as miss trinket you have enquired the way at last then i felicitate you miss on your new acquisition i am told that your green monkey is absolutely the greatest beau and the greatest wit within the purlieus of saint james  sir bumkin toilette how happy you make us i hear you have got rid of all your vile countryincumbrances of huge houses and dirty acres and that the court may now hope to have you all to itself  mr faddle this was a favor i ought not to have expected her grace has company this evening and looks for you without question but harkee sir there are some here who have too much discernment to be induced by your arts to make a jest of a certain person who claims their best respects  mrs mawkin you put us under a thousand alarms we were afraid we shoudnt have you dear madam how extremely rich and elegant is all this and how condescending in a lady of your taste to appear to owe any thing to dress and outward ornament o mr bustle thrice welcome our sex may now boast of having a servant for these other mancreatures are so listless or so awkward as not to merit a curtsey in the way of wages  my lord mansfield this is more than an honor it is a benefit if some of us are not improved before you leave us i shall for my own part take great blame to myself  my dear lady homespun how are the sweet babies how are your obliging domestics how are all your cats and dogs believe me i take an interest in the harmony and good humor of every thing about you i think said lady homespun they all begin to droop since your ladyship has ceased to make them happy by your presence  the earl of mansfield looking about perceived mr fenton turned precipitately to him and catching him in his arms mr fenton he cried how glad i am to meet you what an advantage i shall esteem it at all times and in all places how is my harry my little hero mr fenton bowed twice  here william said the countess tea and coffee and order the tables and cards to be laid in the next room lord mansfield what news you are an intimate of all the foreign cabinets  our domestic news answered the earl is by far the most extraordinary it is affirmed that our freeholders throughout the shires and buroughs of england have entered into a resolution against bribery and corruption  our parliament also have this moment in agitation an act for establishing the two virtues of probity and chastity respectively among the sexes to this act they further propose to add several clauses in the nature of a codicil annexed to a will among others it is intended to make a general exchange of the forms of good manners for the offices of good nature and all acts of benevolence are hereafter to pass by an immutable law for proofs of high breeding  it is further to be enacted that every courtier or great man may be sued upon his promise or even on such intimations of nods smiles or whispers or squeezes by the hand as may credibly be supposed to keep people in expectation no advantage is to be taken of ignorance by any trader nor of innocence in the commerce between the sexes the glow of modesty is the only rouge that will be allowed to any fair face of quality in these his majestys dominions  no person of any station will hereafter be permitted to go abroad in search of faults till they can find none at home by the help of a candle and lastly all slander is to be accounted petty treason forasmuch as it has been intimated some how or other that the loss of a good name is more deplorable in its consequences than the loss of any other property or even of life  hey day exclaims the countess at this rate we shall have lady homespun at the very tip top of the mode  ay says miss trinket but what will become of your ladyship who are now accounted the pattern of all elegance and politeness o miss cried mr faddle lady maitland will do well enough i warrant you she has only to drop a few articles that are superfluous to her good sense and her good nature she will thereby as i take it be only undressed and happily restored to all her native loveliness  demme exclaims sir bumkin if matters come to this pass i shall have made a fine kettle of fish on it shall not i to throw away so many thousands of pounds with an immensity of time and pains on delicacy and taste and virtu and the beaumonde and all that  what cries mrs mawkin are our parliament beside themselves here has the world been growing up these six thousand years to its grand climacteric of courtly accomplishments and now they would overthrow the whole building and mix us of the pinnacle with the dust of the vulgar if we of high life are to be laid under restraints with cits and villagers what advantage will fortune give us it will no longer be of any use to its owners  this is preposterously cried mrs philligree the most laughable scheme that ever was conceivable on this side the tropic our parliament would affect to be an heteroclite to all other parliaments but the best on it is that their power is immensely too little for the greatness of the immensity of their undertaking  pardon me madam replied the colonel i know of nothing beyond the ability of our parliament in spirituals alike as temporals their power is the same in england as that of the pope is at rome they can bind or loose at pleasure in heaven as on earth  beside madam adds sneer with respect to our parliament this is very far from being a laughable scheme i rather hold it to be both loveable and laudable they must thereby forego no inconsiderable advantages on their own part they will no longer be interested in the prostitution of their constituents or the sale of their country they have it even in contemplation to decline their capital privilege of maintaining their families at the expense of their neighbors and propose for the future to pay their debts  i hope my lord says mr bustle your new laws are not to be put in force against the offices of friendship and civil manners no sir says lord mansfield only against the parade of them  here mr bustle observed that the coffee was filled out and rose with precipitation to help the ladies  away you wretch keep from me a mile screamed out lady cribbage no nearer dear sir no nearer i beseech you exclaimed mrs philligree and miss trinket  mr bustle says lord mansfield i would advise you to tender your services to lady maitland and lady homespun if you happen to spill your coffee on their clothes you will oblige them with an apology for giving them away to the first poor body  i wish my lord says lady cribbage that you knew how to compliment some with less expense to others but apropos my lord these same compassive acts against slander and going from home in search of faults as you phrase it have they yet passed into a law  they have not madam  o then we may take goodman time by the fetlock pray ladies have ye heard any thing lately of the two miss worthys  nothing new answered the countess nothing more than that they are both very good and very amiable  poor orphans says lady cribbage they are greatly to be pitied the eldest has preferred an intrigue with her guardians footman to the honorable addresses of mr melvin and is retired for a month or so to her aunt in the country while her sister on the other hand preferred lawful marriage with the butler to a settlement of a thousand a year from his grace of a  miss worthy said mr faddle is certainly gone to her aunts as your ladyship intimated for mr melvin and i are to be with her in a few days by her own appointment  and i can vouch added the colonel that her sister has married the butler your ladyship mentions for he is a very particular friend of mine a young gentleman of great merit family and fortune who assumed that disguise like a hero in romance in order to gain the nearer access to his princess  for shame gentlemen says lord mansfield no more of your vindications i beseech ye perhaps there is not a single person present who is not at this moment a subject of raillery mayhap of calumny to some other tea table let us also take up the racket and return the ball of scandal indeed i know few people of whom any good can be said and none who may not be censured without offense to truth beside as evil is now spoken so universally of every body no one is hurt thereby if any in particular should escape detraction it might justly be suspected that they had no one quality that deserved to be envied  o fie my lord cried lady cribbage how can you think so uncharitably of people there are many of my acquaintance who have really valuable qualities it is true there is lady gamelove and mrs situp and miss freak and a hundred others whose heads will fit the cap of scandal turn it which way you will but then there is mrs orderly and miss neighbourly and a few more whose reputations remain almost quite unsullied if mrs orderly has faults she however has the discretion to keep them from view miss neighbourly indeed does not set up for a beauty she knows she will have nothing to repent of for any murders committed by her pinking eyes but then she is the best tempered and pleasantest body breathing she never fails to excite merriment wherever she comes it is a pity it should ever happen at her own expense  have ye heard ladies said mr sneer of the late very facetious affair that happened between mr cornish and his friend lord freelove mrs cornish had expressed to her husband an eager desire of seeing foreign countries and piqued at his want of indulgence she took the opportunity of lord freeloves going abroad to accompany him as far as aix la chapelle from thence lord freelove wrote to his friend a long letter filled with penitential apologies wherein he offered him the disposal of his fortune and interest as a small compensation for having robbed him of so very valuable a treasure to this mr cornish had the candor to reply that he scorned to take an ungenerous advantage of his lordships liberality that he was not sensible of any injury his lordship had done him that on the contrary he looked upon his lordship as the one under heaven to whom he was most obliged to whom he considered himself as singularly indebted and whom he should ever remember in his prayers for having eased him of the capital encumbrance of his life  what surprises me most in this adventure said mr faddle is the conscientiousness of lord freelove in a matter of which nobody else makes a scruple there is sir frederic feeble a man of threescore and of so crazy a constitution that the very first disorder with a little help from the doctor must carry him off and yet within these seven months he has added to his seraglio five lancashire virgins beside three married ladies whom he has taken into keeping and who eloped to him from young and good looking husbands  mr faddles remark on the conscientiousness of libertines said mr fenton reminds me of jack wilding a quondam acquaintance of mine i had the story from himself it is an adventure of which he boasted and the recital in his opinion did by no means detract from his character as a gentleman  mr wilding was of a neighboring country and was educated by pious parents in a scrupulous observance of his duties to god and man when they thought him confirmed in his civil and religious principles they sent him here to study our laws in the middle temple where he speedily learned that pleasure was the only good and that the laws of nature were irreversible by any subsequent appointments however he piqued himself extremely on what is called the punctilio of honor and would run any man through the body who should intimate that he had been guilty of an unjust or ungenerous action  wilding was a young fellow of parts and pleasantry and still preserved a very specious appearance of virtue a considerable london merchant conceived a friendship for him and when he was taken under arrest on account of some debts and a failure of remittances his new friend advanced two hundred pounds in his favor and made him a general invitation to his table  the merchant had lately married a lovely young woman who lost nothing of her luster in the eyes of mr wilding for the sake of the wife he ingratiated himself as much as possible with the husband he spent a large portion of his time at their house and while his friend was abroad or engaged in the counting room he endeavored by a winning address and a thousand assiduities to thieve from him the conjugal affections of a woman on whose virtue he deposited his hopes and delights all the honors of his family and all his peace and prospect in life  wilding in order to establish his credit with the merchant had punctually reimbursed him his two hundred pounds a nobleman to whom the dice had been lately unfavourable made him an offer of a place at court on a preliminary compliment of a thousand pounds wilding consulted his friend on this advantageous proposal the merchant had not the money but promised to procure it and in his eagerness to promote the fortune of this traitor he went directly and solicitously abroad for the purpose this was an opportunity which a man of his gallantry could not neglect the grateful mr wilding accordingly seized upon it to accomplish the fate of his benefactor and the happiest lot he left him was ignorantly to contribute toward the begetting of sons and daughters who like maggots were to be propagated from the bed of pollution  if i didnt fear to be tedious said lady homespun i could give you a recent instance of ingratitude even greater than that which mr fenton has mentioned and attended with circumstances that affected me extremely the company instantly urged her to gratify their curiosity and she began as follows  some weeks ago i sent to the servants office to enquire for a female of some education who might assist me in the instruction of my little girls the day following a young woman came to be hired her appearance was most bespeaking and with a countenance expressive of every virtue she looked a renunciation of the smallest title thereto  i asked for her character but she answered with an air of the deepest humiliation that she never had been at service that she was an unfortunate stranger who deserved no ones good word and that she had nothing to ask but my acceptance of her labor and the shelter of my roof  i had not the heart to reject her and on trial i found that she was mistress of the polite languages and of every female accomplishment though she did not seem to have reached her two and twentieth year  she grew extremely fond of my children she used to look with a melancholy kind of pleasure upon them and frequently during the times of her dressing or instructing them i observed her tears striving to steal away unnoticed  this with the thousand elegancies that accompanied her words and actions made me impatient to know whence and who she was she perceived my curiosity and with a befeeching and mortified air ah madam said she seek not to hate me seek not to know the story of my shame since it cannot be told without reflecting discredit on persons of worth and honor  the day after sir hanmer homespun came in where peggy for so she called herself was chatting with my little girls at the further end of the room i am come my dear said he from a visit to mr grace the new acquaintance in whose praise you heard me speak so largely i enquired out his house and went up without ceremony as i entered his chamber i was struck with a new and very affecting object he sat opposite to a pier glass wherein i observed him unnoticed and on each knee he held an infant over whom he wept plentifully while he caressed them in turns and tenperly pressed them to his bosom  at length he perceived me and rose in confusion you have caught me sir hanmer said he lamenting the loss of a false woman whom yet i cannot cease to love and whose fault has not been able to abate my fondness for these her innocent offspring the misguided wretch while i was lately in the country eloped with lord riot from her own honor and happiness lord riot has since paid his trespass with his life but what is become of my peggy i know not can i depend on your goodness to enquire her out it is a pity that one so lovely should be utterly lost here is a bill for l 00 dispose of it my friend as you think best for her advantage and let not her necessities plunge her deeper in guilt  here the children shrieked out and cried that peggy was dead their peggy was dead we instantly ran to em and found her in a fit in which she continued several hours without sign of life as soon as she opened her eyes she turned them languidly upon me ah madam said she you know me now i am faulty indeed but much more unfortunate and as you were lately desirous to hear my story you shall have it without extenuation or disguise  i am daughter to a poor farmer who was tenant to the father of mr grace when i was about nine years old the young gentleman who was lately returned from the college happened to be out a sporting and called in at my fathers i considered him as a species quite different from all i had seen of man his presence gave me a pleasure till then unfelt and his parting was as the loss of something extremely dear  from that time he chose our part of the country for the scene of his diversions and his visits became longer and more frequent he never failed to bring me some little present and i betrayed my affection by many artless testimonies  in about three years old mr grace died my father got no one knew how into plentiful circumstances and sent me to a boarding school where i was carefully educated in all the becoming matters of which i was capable  i now began to apprehend from whom my advantages flowed and my young heart was penetrated with the most lively and affecting gratitude i grew more reserved however as my sentiments grew more ardent and whenever my benefactor came to visit me we appeared under a mutual restraint from the suppression of passions which i thought it indecent and he unseasonable to express  when i arrived to the age of sixteen years mr grace publicly addressed me for marriage can you think it madam that while my heart embraced the overture with the warmest transport it was yet with the strongest reluctance that i yielded to a happiness which i deemed so injurious to the honor and interest of him whom i loved as i loved my own soul  five years the happiest sure that ever were passed upon earth i lived blessing and blessed by my hearts chosen master and bore him three lovely resemblances of the image that was always present to my soul  one night mr grace returning later than usual brought home a wounded gentleman but entered as privately as possible for fear of alarming me this gentleman was lord riot whose life mr grace had saved at the peril of his own from the resentment of an injured husband who had set upon him with advantage  as it was feared that his wounds were mortal the surgeons advised that he should not be removed and he lay six weeks at our house where induced by hospitality and the desire of my husband i attended him with a care and tenderness that he rewarded with perdition  when he took his leave of us he seemed to labor under a sense of insufferable obligations as soon as his health was established he sent me a diamond necklace of great value but mr grace was then in the country and i directly returned the traitors present the next day he sent up his name and requested to be admitted but i excused myself from receiving the visits of gentlemen in the absence of my husband the day following however having bribed my servants he was permitted to enter my chamber when without addressing a word to his lordship i severely rebuked my maid for such an insolent intrusion and withdrawing hastily to my closet i clapped to the door  after this i heard no more of lord riot for some time but alas he and his diabolical instruments were not idle one evening being seized with an unaccountable drowziness i lay down and was insensible to every thing that passed till i awakened the day following in a strange bed and in the arms of my cruel and accursed undoer  i instantly screamed out and pushing him violently from me sprung into the floor while i huddled on my clothes all the horrors of my condition rose full upon my view i flew to the door but finding it locked i was seized with sudden madness i dashed the piers and jars to shivers i caught whatever came in my way and threw it at the villain who terrified by my fury made his escape through a back door and bolted it after him  some women whom he sent to me recovered me from a fit the dear and tender images of husband and children then came to my mind my rage was drowned in my grief i wept and sobbed without ceasing  for three weeks i continued thus immured and inconsolable my fits of frenzy still returning whenever lord riot presented himself to my view at length i assumed the patience to expostulate with him on the irretrievable ruin he had brought upon me my wreck of fame and honor and what was infinitely worse my loss of husband and children to whose faces i never more should dare to lift an eye  while i continued to reproach my betrayer we heard a bustle below stairs he flew to some pistols that hung in the apartment the door burst open my husband suddenly entered lord riot fired at him and somebody fell but i waited not to enquire into the issue of the scuffle the face of my injured husband was now more dreadful to me than that of my ravisher the doors lay open i hurried to the street i flew along i knew not where and running into a little shop i sat down by the counter and fainted away  the poor woman of that little house behaved herself toward me with much humanity i told her part of my unhappy story and as i determied for ever to hide myself from family and acquaintance and as far as possible from the world she put me in the way of getting into service whereby i have received the only consolation of which i am capable on this side the grave that of your ladyships favor and protection  here mrs grace closed her distressful history as sir hanmer and i greatly pitied and esteemed her we endeavored to give her comfort by observing that there was nothing in this adventure wherewith the most censorious or even a husband of the most delicate sentiments could reproach her ah madam said she when my body was as pure as my spirit i was every way unworthy of mr grace and shall i now bring pollution to his honorable bosom how will the world interpret my residing three weeks in the house and custody of a libertine alas i have no portion save disgrace to bequeath to my dear infants nor any legacy to my kindred but confusion of face but  i feel that i hasten to the end of my sorrows  as she spoke her countenance altered and we persuaded her to lie down and try to take some repose  within an hour or two after a gentleman came and hastily enquired for my husband it was mr grace my dear sir hanmer said he eagerly rejoice with me my peggy is innocent she is virtuous as ever that ruffian lord riot by the promise of a thousand guineas prevailed on her woman to give her a sleeping potion and had her conveyed to his house during her state of insensibility o my peggy might i but behold you once again riot finding it impossible to subdue her to his pleasure refused to pay the woman the price of her perfidy and she in revenge told me where he held my wife secreted o my distressed my shamefaced angel what is become of you i took out a replevin and forced my way into the villains house he aimed a pistol at me but happened to shoot his accomplice he then drew his sword but at the second pass i pierced him to the heart the traitress did not immediately die of her wound she survived till within this hour and in her mortal agonies she revealed to me all the circumstances of this diabolical plot  here we consoled mr grace by informing him that his lady was safe and in the house but that she was something indisposed and had lain down to rest his impatience was too great to be restrained from seeing her i entered her chamber first and apprised her of his coming as he tenderly approached she started up in her bed and her bosom was agitated with agonizing emotions she gazed wildly at him she attempted to speak but could not find utterance when seizing his hand and catching it to her lips she sunk down gently and expired upon the pressure  as some of the company still continued to honor lady homespuns pathetic narration with their tears lady cribbage cried out cards cards here immediately to drive away melancholy  after cards an elegant supper was served up and after supper the conversation happened to turn upon dress  is it not amazing cried sneer with a sarcastical glance at the ladies is it not amazing to think that the nature and reason of things should be so wholly inverted as in some cases to mean and effect the very reverse of their original intention and institution the first use that was made of the figleaf demonstrates that dress was solely appointed for the covering of shame and nakedness and yet woman has been so ingenious in process of time as to turn the loss of her robe of original innocence into matter of pride and ostentation  the covering from cold as well as from shame said faddle may be allowed of some sensible use with respect to dress at least among us who are placed so far north of the tropic  our neighbor lewis last winter had occasion to pass through the streets of paris his traveling palace was drawn by eight white steeds the frost was intensely sharp the glasses were all drawn up and this warm enterprizer for universal monarchy sat shivering amidst the wrappings of his furrs and robeings  as he passed he espied a young man of a portly personage standing at an angle clad in a single silk coat with his hair powdered out and his hat under his arm  lewis instantly pulled the bell his coach stopped he let down a side window he ordered the stranger to be called and as nothing makes a man so mannerly as the sensible want of something from the party to whom he applies the monarque addressed him with the most gracious and affable air and requested to know by what means he could keep himself so warm in such extremity of weather  that sire answered the stranger is a secret which my honor forbids me to reveal and which nothing shall extort from me save the commands of your majesty i promise you sir said the king that i shall not be ungrateful and that you shall have no cause to repent your having entrusted me with your recipe i engage then sire that provided you follow my prescription there shall not be so warm a monarch in the universe i am impatient pray inform me what am i to do as i do so please your majesty put your whole wardrobe upon your back the king laughed himself into a heat and that very hour ordered a commission in his own guards to be made out for his prescriber  your story mr faddle is elegantly facetious said lady maitland i apprehend however that other valuable purposes are answered by dress over and above the mere decency and comfort of clothing were it not for the various distinctions of dress it would be impossible to point out the several orders of men throughout the respective subordinations that are nenessary to society without this useful expedient we should be in utter confusion we should not know who was who we should not know to whom respect or obedience was due nor be able to ascertain the prince from the peasant  o lud cried mrs mawkin as your ladyship says how frightfully humbling and mortifying it would be without the richness of dress how should we of the grand monde show any difference between ourselves and vile plebeians  o madam answered lady cribbage plebeians are not confined to low life alone the great world has its vulgar too i assure you the difference does not lie in the richness i have seen an ass clothed in a very gorgeous sumptercloth the true distinction lies in wearing the qualities of the mind on the outward habit in the peculiarity of fancy and elegance of taste  your ladyship might surely have added said miss trinket that dress is a handmaid to beauty too it serves to adorn and embellish nature with art and to make what was lovely still more attracting however brilliant a diamond may be in itself it wants of its value and luster till suitably set there may be an elegance to be sure in the manner of setting but still it ought to be cased in nothing but gold  i greatly iament the departure of mrs philligree said lord mansfield it is she who would have adorned your ornaments ladies and have dressed out dress itself in a sumptuous outre of terms and new cut of phrase i agree indeed with the countess that some tokens or markings such as those that dress supplies are requisite for distinguishing the several orders and subordinations of people in a community but i am sorry to find that these same markings or tokens should very nearly engross the whole of the things intended to be signified if you take the fullbottomed wig from a judge what will become of his wisdom or lawn and satin from bishops what would become of their sanctity or should monarchs be deprived of their crowns and regalia i doubt it would be a fearful abridgment of majesty  i also agree with lady cribbage that the qualities of the mind are worn on the outward habit but pray ye what sort of internal qualities do those external habits exhibit even every species of affectation folly and vanity that is conceivable the whole futile soul of a female seems to have forsaken its frail mansion and to float upon the surface of her attire in the long labors of the toilette where so much pains time and treasure is expended on an elaborate externity does not a woman as good as confess that the whole of her value lies where the whole of her care is bestowed  now in all these operations female vanity proposes to excite the same sensations in others that it feels in and for itself on the pleasing contemplation of its own image ah misdeeming and pitiable objects while ye pass along or sit exalted in your imaginary preeminence some of your sex behold you with an eye of contempt others with an eye of envy and all with an eye of malevolence inquisitive after your miscarriages and desirous of publishing and magnifying the smallest of your failings  men indeed behold you with an eye of pleasure because they draw an inference from your vanity that flatters their own they contemplate you as dressing at them they consider the labors of your toilette as a confession of desiring to be desired as an advance on your part and a kind of challenge for them to approach and capitulate  i own that beauty as miss trinket has observed may occasionally derive a sort of accession from dress like a diamond encased in precious metal but how much more generally do we observe conceited ugliness and deformity deriving additional darkness from the luster that surrounds it like a turnip or toadstool encircled by gems  whether finery gives additional force to the magnet of beauty for exciting and drawing our affections to it is an article of which i am much in doubt what say you to this question mr fenton  i hold my lord said mr fenton that finery is merely a narcissus that neither loves nor is beloved by any except itself it is much to be questioned whether belle or beau ever engaged the affections of any sensible person of the opposite sex and where they themselves have been susceptible of the delicate passion they from that moment ceased to be belles or beaus paris is the only beau as i remember that ever was capable of loving a woman and yet as you all know she was not a dressed lady to whom he gave the prize  dame iris was the greatest belle in all the heaven of pagan theology she was as we may say the female joseph dressed out in her gay coat of many colors and yet we do not find that she ever attracted the love of a single immortal or even mortal though she duly and daily visits them in all her finery and fails not to shed showers of tears at their disdain  finery may dazzle it may awe but cannot possibly excite the smallest pittance of affection this can alone be done by something more personal by something less superficial even the simplex mundities that ornament of a clean simplicity recommended by horace can operate only by intimation of deeper purity the virtues alone can weave the truly enchanting robe of female influence and the graces alone gird on the caestus or girdle of irresistible beauty  among the infinite variety of female fashions which in turns have been fantastically predominant upon earth i remember but of one so very obsolete as not to have revived in some distant age or climate that the memory of this same fashion should not be wholly lost it is recorded by saint paul in his first epistle to timothy here he recommends it to the ladies to adorn themselves with sobriety and shamefacedness not with broidered hair or gold or pearls or costly array  saint paul however in this piece of advice appears to have spread a net for the hearts of his own sex the haughty reluctant and stubborn spirit of man can reject wealth and titles can look with indifference on the symmetry of shape and features and guard itself against the attacks of female artifice but female bashfulness is an unconscious thief to whom the doors of all hearts are instantly thrown open  in short the maid who would atchieve the whole laurel of conquest must not be obvious or obtrusive like daphne she must fly though pursued by an apollo  here the company breaking up gave distinct and pressing invitations to mr fenton but he politely excused his attendance for the present on account of a multiplicity of indispensable business  on the following morning as he sat in his study some one tapped at the door and on his desiring them to walk in who should enter but lady maitland in an agreeable dishabille  mr fenton said she deeply blushing and hesitating i i  you must think it very odd  i say sir i should not have intruded upon you thus out of all form perhaps indecently unseasonable  please to be seated madam  the business i come upon sir is so very interesting so concerning to my peace that i could not refuse myself this opportunity of breaking in upon you  be assured my dear madam that the greatest pleasure you can do me is to let me know as soon as possible wherein i can serve you  here the countess looking eagerly and inquisitively on him put her hand in her bosom took out a picture and alternately surveying the one and the other yes she cried it is it must certainly be so then reaching out the picture can you tell me sir said she for whom this was drawn or rather do you remember to whom you gave it  mr fenton took the picture looked at it and started when recollecting ideas and passages as from afar off good god he exclaimed is it possible can you be my little fanny goodall yes my dearest cousin answered the countess as surely as you are the still too amiable harry clinton  hereupon they both rose suddenly and mr fenton catching his quondam fanny in his arms pressed her to his bosom with warm and kindred affection but the agitation of the countess was too big for utterance till resuming her chair she gave scope to her passion and burst into a violent flood of tears  after a mutual and affecting silence ah cries mr fenton in a voice expressive of much emotion how am i my lovely cousin to interpret these tears am i to consider them as further proofs of your ancient aversion to me or as kindly and dear instances of your returning affection  the countess answered not and mr fenton continued  you may remember my cousin that i had very few relations my only brother ever continued to behave himself toward me as an alien and an enemy and my only uncle and guardian who in his later years became your father was no way agreeable to my taste or disposition in you therefore from your infancy in you alone my amiable cousin i had centred all my sensations of fatherhood brotherhood all the affections and tender feelings that naturally arise from kindred and consanguinity how have i been delighted with your infantine prattle how have i exulted in your opening charms on the death of my first wife you were my only consolation and in your innocent caresses and attractive endearments i felt a sweetness of emotion that i never felt before  on my return from france with what transports did you receive me we grew as it were in our embracements to each other you were then as i apprehend about ten years of age but on my next visit you refused to be seen by me soon after you were taken ill i daily went with an aching heart to enquire after your health but your mamma peremptorily refused me admission to your presence till on your recovery you were conveyed from me and secreted into the country  though this unkindness went near my heart it did not alter my affections i still continued to enquire after you i still continued to be interested in you and i preferred my ardent wishes and prayers to heaven for your prosperity  mr fenton said lady maitland you have unquestionably your reasons for choosing to be so called i am very sensible sir i say of your extraordinary partiality to me from my earliest years your tenderness as you mentioned was that of the fondest of fathers or brothers you knew the degree and kind of affection that was suitable between such relations and you kept yourself precisely within the limits but alas for my part i knew no such distinctions i was as a piece of virgin wax warmed and willingly yielding to the first kindly impression you made that impression my cousin you made it deep and entire as i had but the one heart so i had but the one love and that love was all your own without distinction or degree  gracious heaven exclaimed mr fenton what is this you tell me madam is it possible that at your years you should actually conceive a passion for one who might almost have been your grandfather ah if that be the case what have i not to answer for indulging you and myself in those innocent caresses which at that time fondly constituted the most pleasing sensations of my life  alas replied the countess if you have any thing to answer for on that account the charge indeed is very weighty which i have to bring against you  i was not eight years old when i begged this picture from you which you generously enriched with this circlet of diamonds soon after you went to france and during your absence this picture was my constant companion whom i caressed whom i talked to and to whom alone i made my complaints in all my little matters of grievance  i know not by what instinct or kind of cunning it was that i endeavored to conceal my affection for this your resemblance and never made my court to it but when i was alone  the morning after your visit on your return from paris as i was carelessly performing the business of my little toilette before the glass i took out your picture and surveyed it with new and increasing delight in the mean time i did not know that my mama stood behind me attentive to all my motions that were reflected to her by the mirror she heard me talk to your picture she saw me kiss it and eagerly press it to my bosom at last i turned my eye to the glass and perceived a piece of her image whereon i started colored and trembled and was thrown i know not why into the utmost confusion  ah fanny cried my mother what is this that i see your young heart my child is certainly affected unquestionably you love your cousin clinton  ought i not to love him madam does he not love me as well as i love him no no my darling said my mother i would to heaven that he did your cousin clinton indeed is worthy of all love but then he has lately given away his heart to another he is married my fanny  and cannot he love me still for all that madam  by no means my sweet innocent when once a man marries he vows and swears and obliges himself to love nobody living but his wife and what is more my fanny it is accounted very naughty in any girl to think of loving such a one afterward  what emotions did i then feel what a conflict of opposing passions but resentment for the time got the upper hand i had yet formed no idea of the relations of sex or matrimony or any conjugal obligation save that of love alone but then it was sufficient to me that i had given you my whole heart that nothing less than your whole heart could satisfy me in return and i felt myself offended and outraged to the last degree by your having imparted a share thereof to another  the day following as i sat languid and much discomposed as well by my passion as want of rest the night before my mama came up to tell me that you were below and enquired for me no no my dearest mama said i it does not signify i will not see him let him go to whomever he loves best  but what shall i say to him my fanny what excuse shall i make  no matter for excuses madam tell him that i never desire to see his face any more  as something informed me that you could not help still loving me a little i laid hold of that little love to pique and disoblige and be revenged of you for your perfidy and as long as you staid the thoughts of the pain and uneasiness i presumed you were under gave me vast delight but as soon as i was told you were gone my heart sunk down as from a mount of triumph into a depth of desolation  my mama came up to console me she highly applauded my spirit and the resentment i had showed and she blamed you for marrying another at a time that you pretended so much fondness to me she further endeavored to set me against your age she told me that you must soon be old and ugly and wrinkled and that you was much fitter to be my father than my lover she also spoke to me of my vast fortune of my beauty and soforth and that i might have my pick and choice of all the young and handsome earls and dukes in the nation she opened to me in a variety of glittering prospects all the pleasures and advantages of wealth title state equipage with the respect and admiration of crowds bending around me as she represented them to my imagination i catched at each of them for comfort but alas i did not find you among them and all to me became empty  that night my tender mama forsook her own bed and came to lie in mine i saw that she had been afflicted so for fear of adding to her trouble i suppressed my own emotions and pretending to be asleep i lay quiet by her side till toward morning when i was seized with a violent fever during my illness i was told that you came daily to enquire about me and that i believe above all things contributed to my recovery one day my mama came and informed me that you sat below in tears and earnestly requested to be permitted to see me o how sweet and comforting did those tears seem to drop upon my heart but mustering all my little pride and remaining dignity no no my mama i cried i will die first if he does not first unmarry himself i will never see him any more  when i had gotten strength enough to walk about the chamber my mama and i being alone i went to my drawer and taking out your picture and turning my head aside i reached it to her saying here madam take this and lock it up from me for while i love it and hate it so much it troubles me to look at it my mama thereupon took it from me and catched me to her bosom but without saying a word she burst into tears and straight quitted the room  as soon as it was judged that i was able to travel my parents by the advice of their doctors took me far into the country my mother in the mean time had unquestionably confided my secret to my father for though he was naturally of a severe and backward temper he became extremely tender and indulgent toward me  as i was the only child they ever had their whole care and solicitude was affectionately employed in procuring me a variety of gratifications and amusements when i was in spirits they were in a kind of triumph but my dejection was to them the most grievous of all oppressions they took down my french mistress and music master with them and they collected from all parts the most agreeable set of misses and masters that they could muster so that my time was portioned out the most happily that could be between business and recreations that were equally pleasing they had taken care that your name should never be mentioned before me and though at times my soul was athirst and my ear opened and turned to hear tidings concerning you yet a certain native bashfulness and fear of offending against decency did not permit me to enquire after you  thus a length of absence and a variety of dissipations by degrees greatly abated the ardour of my passion insomuch that i did not seem to feel any more for you when any occasion however renewed in me the impression of former scenes a thrilling sort of chilness would run through my blood and at other times when alone and thinking of you a swimming kind of stupor would fall sadly upon my soul  on our return to london after five years absence the great number of people with the novelty and variety of objects that crowded upon my view amused and engaged my whole attention but when we entered the old mansion when i turned my eyes on the places where you sat where you walked where you talked and used to caress me you became as it were actually visible to my eyes something seemed to wring my heart and i was seized with a sickness near to fainting i took hold of my maid by the arm and with her help walked into the garden for fresh air but there too you had got before me on the terrace in the walks and alleys where you used to run feigned races with me and to gather fruit for me and to play with me at bob cherry and afterward to press the lips that had gained the prize i then turned away from a place that afforded me no asylum from you my mother met and eagerly asked what ailed me let us go mama i cried let us go some where else i am not able to stay in this place any longer accordingly that very evening we removed to lodgings and in a few days my dada took and furnished a new house  i shall not dwell my dear sir on a trivial detail of the many circumstances and little incidents that happened during the space of four succeeding years an infinity of suitors paid their addresses to me or my fortune i neither knew nor cared to which for i continued alike insensible to all it is true that during such a number of years having neither seen nor heard from you i dropped all thoughts of you and scarce retained the traces or lineaments of your person or aspect from the impression however which you left in my mind i had formed to myself a dear though confused image of the lovely of the desirable and this i looked for every where but could no where find any resemblance thereof  in the mean time my parents urged me strongly to matrimony they affectingly represented that they should not die in peace if i did not afford them the prospect of perpetuating themselves in my offspring such is the fond succedaneum which short lived creatures propose for eking out their existence and supplying the lot of an inevitable mortality by the flattering though poor substitute of a name or bare remembrance  at length i told my parents that as i could not form any choice of my own i would trust wholly to their judgment and take up with whomsoever they should be pleased to appoint hereupon they recommended the earl of maitland to me i kept to my promise and we were consequently married  my husband was comely in his person easy and affable in his temper and a man of singular sense and letters for a lord he loved me with passion and as i could not pay him in specie i endeavored to supply my want of affection to him by my attention and assiduities  on the fifth year of my marriage my father died of a good old age and in four years more my dearest mother left me desolate in her i lost the only object of fond affections that i had upon earth and my looks tacitly reproached my husband for his want of power to console me  i believe it was equally unhappy for my lord as myself that we were not blessed with children the dear and tender attachments that bind parents to their offspring serve also as a subsequent and more affecting nuptial band for uniting those parents more intimately to each other it draws about them a new circle of interests and amities and by creating a mutual confidence forbids the intrusion of those jealousies that must at all times presuppose an alienation of regard this however was not the case between lord maitland and me we never had a child perhaps in some constitutions a union of souls as well as persons may be requisite for such an effect  during the two years succeeding the death of my dear mother i conceived a disgust against company and entertainments i took a religious turn i looked upon this world and all that it contained as quite unworthy the regard of an immortal being the principal part of my time was taken up in books and offices of devotion in which employment i alternately sunk under the most gloomy depression of spirits and again was elevated above myself into a new world of joys and inexpressible openings  at length i was taken exceeding ill of what the physicians called a fever upon the nerves which confined me to my bed above six weeks during my illness my husband was the most constant and assiduous of all my attendants the affectionate sadness the painful distress the tender solicitude that was visible in all his looks and actions made way into my soul with an obliging impression and while i reproached myself for my ungrateful defect of sensibility toward him love or something tender and very like to love took place in my bosom  as soon as i was on the recovery my husband disappeared without taking leave or giving me any notice and for three weeks i knew not what was become of him at length he returned pale and greatly emaciated i had yet lost none of the tenderness which i conceived for him during my illness i took him affectionately by the hand which glowed like a coal of fire ah i cried where have you been what looks are these my lord what is the meaning of all this he answered not but withdrawing his hand and scarce deigning to look toward me i am not well he faintly said i must go to my bed  while his servants undressed him i stood in silent astonishment vainly guessing at the cause of this extraordinary behavior but as soon as he had lain down i took a seat by his side and seizing and pressing one of his hands between mine i broke into tears  after a sad and mutual silence ah madam cried my husband what am i to understand by these tears i am willing to consider them as proofs of your humanity but i cannot consider them as instances of your affection you love me not madam you never did love me all the constancy and complacence of the most ardent passion all my endeavors and assiduities have not been able to procure me the smallest interest in your heart i blame you not madam alas we are not the masters of own affections i am sensible that i never deserved your love that was a blessing reserved for a more amiable object but then the tenderness and truth of my attachment to you might surely have laid claim to a share of your confidence ah how precious had such a confidence been to my heart it had stood to me in the place of your love and i should not have reproached you for irresistible propensities yes madam i say irresistible for i know you are virtuous perhaps it was not in your power to refuse another your love but then you might have admitted your husband to a share of your friendship  you have my friendship i cried my tenderest friendship my most affectionate regards if my love is not so ardent as you could wish you however have all the love of which i am capable and you possess it entire and undivided  what is this you tell me madam i would to heaven you could still deceive me that i had still continued in ignorance but that is past it is over madam my eyes are opened to my wretchedness and i die in the double want of your faith and your affection i have seen your lover lady i saw him four days ago from an opposite window he stood before this house in converse with another i expected every moment that taking advantage of my absence he would have gained admission to you i held my sword ready to follow to pierce his heart and sacrifice him to the claims of my honor and my love but he suddenly disappeared and disappointed my vengeance  gracious heaven i exclaimed what madness is this do you dream or who is it that has thus cruelly imposed upon you you shall see the impostor madam replied my lord so saying he suddenly put his hand back and taking your picture from under the pillow he indignantly demanded do you know the original of this portrait lady ah i screamed i confess it i do know him i did know him indeed he was the idol of my heart i delighted in him i doated upon him you then acknowledge you avow it rejoined my husband and at length you deign to make me the confident of a passion which i suppose in your favor to have been involuntary ah had i been earlier apprised of my unhappiness i might not have sunk under the unexpected and sudden pressure as i do at this day but say who and what is this formidable rival who robs me of my peace who tears my life from me  first tell me my lord said i how you came by this picture i found it in your cabinet during your illness said he when i searched for your essences to relieve you from a fainting fit i flatter myself that i am not of a jealous disposition curiosity first incited me to hurry it into my pocket i afterward surveyed it more at leisure and some starting doubts arose i endeavored to suppress them i argued with myself that it might be a familypicture the representative of a brother or dear relation deceased but then some enemy of my peace again whispered to my spirit that if this had been the case you would not be so solicitous to conceal it from me you would rather have boasted of such an ornament of your lineage you would have been proud to exhibit it before all people this staggered me i confess and additional doubts and suggestions were impelled upon my soul she reserves this said i to myself for her own eye and inspection to revise it to gaze and dwell upon it in secret and to please her sight with the favorite image that is impressed upon her heart at each of these reflections i felt a sting in my bosom and the more i revolved and debated on these uncertainties the greater strength they gained and drew nearer to demonstration ah i cried her real coldness and feigned regards are now equally accounted for she deceives me she imposes upon me and i will counterfeit in my turn till this mystery is detected i then attempted and would have constrained myself to look at you with my accustomed tenderness but i found it impossible i therefore withdrew suddenly and without any notice if she ever had a tincture of friendship for me thought i the apprehension of my loss will awake in her a sense thereof i disguised myself and as a stranger took lodgings over against you i took my station at the window i was on the watch from morn till noon to make a thorough inquisition into your conduct during my absence i shall discover her disposition said i by the visitants whom she receives but during a fortnight of observation i could not perceive that of the numbers who called any one was admitted my jealous passions abated and i began to reproach myself for having ever conceived them when to my utter confusion there stood full to my view in dress aspect mien attitude the distinguished original of the portrait which i had in my pocket  here i passionately broke in upon my husbands narration god be praised i exclaimed he then lives he still lives my most dear and amiable cousin though i never wish to behold his face any more my only relation perhaps now my only friend you are still living and i trust you are happy and that is enough  your relation your only relation madam cried my lord is he so near is he no nearer no dearer to you than consanguinity will warrant proceed my lord i said i will then tell you all without disguise or palliation  i confess to you answered my husband that the sight of him struck my soul with the fullest conviction of my being betrayed my jealous pangs returned with double poignancy i was enkindled i was set on fire my heart was rent several ways a violent fever seized upon me but my fury and thirst of vengeance supported me under it for four days longer i held up in the impatient expectation of once more beholding your lover that i might pierce him in a thousand places in every seducing part about him but nature at length gave way i sunk under the oppression and i returned once for all to behold to reproach and to expire before you  o my husband my friend my true lover i cried how i pity how i feel for you i excuse your suspicions however injurious to my honor since your jealousy perhaps is not wholly without foundation i did indeed love the person for whom that portrait was drawn with tenderness with passion but believe me when i assure you that i have not set my eyes either on the original or picture these twenty years  what is this you tell me exclaimed my lord you are not yet as i take it thirty years of age could you love even to passion at so very early a period  here i found myself under the necessity of discovering to my husband the little adventures impressions and sentiments of my infancy wherewith you are already acquainted when i had finished my short narrative he seized my hand and pressing it passionatly to his lips and then to his burning bosom he melted into tears o my fanny he cried my most noble my adorable creature what a combat have you fought what a conquest have you gained of grace over nature of virtue against passion can you excuse me will you forgive me may i hope that you will restore me to the blessings of your friendship may i flatter myself that you gave me as much as you could of your affections that if you had been able you would have loved me with a love like mine  i will not distress you my cousin by a description of the affecting scenes that ensued my husband left me vastly rich but still more forlorn during the first years of my widowhood i looked upon myself as a friendless and unnecessary burden upon earth though i thought of you at times it was not without a resentment and a tincture of aversion for your never having deigned to enquire or find out whether any such person as your too affectionate fanny goodall was in the land of the living at length my physicians and my friends as they styled themselves prevailed upon me once more to enter into the light and air and amusements of their world i consented i found my advantage in it i gradually got rid of the grievous oppression that lay upon my spirits since all is vanity thought i let us partake of the dissipation and make it as pleasing as we can and accordingly you found me in the engagements which you honored with your inspection yesterday  when you entered i did not know you the strange name of fenton as well as the alteration which years had made in you shut you out almost wholly from my recollection i felt myself however agitated i knew not why something in your person and manner renewed in my heart impressions kindred to those which were once its sole concern i could not look at you i could not speak to you without emotion all night i lay disturbed in vain endeavoring to remember when or where i had seen you at morning a sudden light darted in upon my mind i got up and flew to your picture which at once laid all open and detected your disguise  you are much altered cousin had i first seen you as you now appear i think my young heart would not have been so deeply affected the ruin however is still very noble and endearingly renews in me the idea of what the building once was  your abstracted air and the change of your name seem to intimate some distressing situation but if fifty thousand pounds or that sum doubled will be of use to you i shall for once think that fortune has been of advantage to me  my most dear and generous cousin replied mr fenton i shall never pardon myself those griefs which the excess of my affection inadvertently occasioned you no brother ever loved a sister no parent a child with fonder passion the aversion which i thought you had suddenly taken to me was one of the most sensible afflictions of my life and my ignorance of what laterally became of you can only be accounted for by an abstract of my own story  here mr fenton called for chocolate and after breakfast he gave lady maitland the following affecting history of his own life and adventures  end of the second volume
