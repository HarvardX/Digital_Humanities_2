an elegy on the death of the honorable sir william jones a judge of the supreme court of judicature in bengal and president of the asiatic society  by william hayley esquire  te pietas oblita virum

advertisement in the very moment when i was concluding the notes to this elegy i received an elegiac poem on the same subject by a gentleman whose extensive knowledge of indian literature and whose acquaintance with its lamented patron induced me to peruse his publication with peculiar eagerness there is so much poetical merit in the animated and graceful tribute which mr maurice has paid to the memory of sir william jones that had i seen it before the completion of these stanzas it might have induced me to relinquish a subject preengaged by a writer so peculiarly qualified to treat it with success yet the literary excellence of sir william jones appears to require some kind of homage from every man of letters and by the spirit of mr maurices performance i am persuaded that our common regard for the character we commemorate is so sincere and ingenuous that we must rejoice in a multiplicity of offerings to a name so entitled to universal praise  elegy etc i science of late with

president of the asiatic society delivered in his first address to that assembly a very just and eloquent eulogium on his accomplished predecessor  some lines in the preceding stanza allude to the following passage in the discourse of sir john shore  the pandits who were in the habit of attending him sir wm jones when i saw them after his death at a public durbar could neither suppress their tears for his loss nor find terms to express their admiration at the wonderful progress he had made in their sciences  i shall embrace with pleasure every opportunity of illustrating this poem and of honoring the justly lamented personage whom it aspires to celebrate by unreserved quotation of the manly and graceful panegyric from which i have transcribed the preceding paragraph  note   stanza viii early to thee obedient language brought the erudition of sir william jones was admirable not only from its extraordinary extent but from having been acquired to an astonishing degree at a very early period of life before the expiration of his twentysecond year says his friend and eulogist he had completed his commentaries on the poetry of the asiatics although a considerable time afterward elapsed before their publication sir john proceeds to commend this work very justly as a complete proof of the authors consummate skill in a variety of languages and as a juvenile monument of taste talents and application without example let me add that this early production discovers also a heart full of gentle affections and a mind that already conceived and expressed its ideas with singular energy and freedom i allude particularly to the very pathetic tribute of gratitude and praise which the author paid in his prooemium to his friend and instructor then recently deceased robert sumner the master of harrow school and to the two following passages of the book in the first he is speaking of satire in the second of heroic poetry atqui ut aperte dicam quod sentio valde invitus in poetarum chorum satyricos ut vocantur ascribo nolo mansuetiarum musarum desiderari benevolentiam poeseos asiat comment cap     quid de legibus poeticis sentiam quibusque causis adductus eas pro nihilo

discovery of the east indies after he had weathered the tremendous storms that assailed him near the cape he is said to have exulted in that omen and assurance of success which he found in the odours

sabean odours from the spicy shore of araby the blessed with such delay well pleased they slack their course and many a league cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles paradise lost book iv ver     note iv stanza    a persian casket for a northern prince the life of nader shah an eastern manuscript brought to england by the king of denmark it was translated into french at the request of that monarch by sir william jones who at first declined the task alleging for his excuse the length of the book the dryness of the subject the difficulty of the style etc but he was at last induced to undertake it by the most liberal motives and chiefly by the following consideration expressed in his own words that it would be a reflection upon this country if the king should be obliged to carry the manuscript into france the french version executed by our incomparable linguist was published in    0 when the translator had attained only his   th year  note v stanza    what generous plaints of indignation burst this verse alludes to the following passage toward the close of an admirable preface to the life of nader shah new modelled for the benefit of the english reader and published in       it is a painful consideration that the profession of literature by far the most laborious of any leads to no real benefit or true glory whatsoever poetry science letters when they are not made the sole business of life may become its ornaments in prosperity and its most pleasing consolation in a change of fortune but if a man addicts himself entirely to learning and hopes by that either to raise a family or to acquire what so many wish for and so few ever attain an honorable retirement in his declining age he will find when it is too late that he has mistaken his path that other labors other studies are necessary and that unless he can assert his own independence in active life it will avail him little to be favored by the learned esteemed by the eminent or recommended even by kings these reflections can hardly be suggested too frequently to the consideration of those ingenuous youths who happen to have conceived a very ardent passion for literature it was happy for our great orientalist that his own peculiar energy of mind enabled him to form such reflections at an early period of life before the gates of professional prosperity were barred against his laudable ambition otherwise it is but too probable that with unexampled hoards of erudition united to a most benevolent temper he might have pined in a state of neglect and mortification instead of rising to be one of the most conspicuous and most useful characters in the polished age which his writings have contributed to enlighten and adorn  i cannot close this note without remarking that the preface to the english life of nader shah which gave rise to it contains many excellent remarks on historical writing it was the custom of our universal scholar to delineate in a philosophic and masterly survey the province of literature to which the object of his immediate labor belonged thus to his volume of asiatic poems he has added two admirable essays on poetry and his translation of isaeus is elucidated by a prefatory discourse and a commentary replete with legal and classical information as a writer both of verse and prose his consummate knowledge of languages enabled him to vary and adapt his style to his subject with all the graces of exquisite propriety  note   stanza xviii proclaiming law thy lifes acknowledged queen an allusion to the following elegant latin verses in which sir william jones bade adieu to the muse and devoted himself to his profession  vale camena blandacultrix ingeni virtutis altrix matter eloquentiae linquenda alumno est laurus et chelys tuo at o dearum dulcium dulcissima sea suada mavis sive pitho dicier a to receptus in tua vivam side mihi sit oro non inutilis toga nec indiserta lingua nec turpis manus an interesting address which proved as sir john shore affectionately observes most truly prophetic  note   stanza xix her throne the bosom of her parent god the ideas and language of this stanza are partly borrowed from the sublime panegyric on law with which the celebrated hooker concludes the first book of his ecclesiastical polity  note   stanza xxii with pensive zeal and exultation just these lines allude to the following very pleasing description which sir william jones has given of his approach to india in his first public discourse as president of the asiatic society  when i was at sea last august on my voyage to this country which i had long and ardently desired to visit i found one evening on inspecting the observations of the day that india lay before us and persia on our left while a breeze from arabia blew nearly on our stern a situation so pleasing in itself and to me so new could not fail to awaken a train of reflections in a mind which had early been accustomed to contemplate with delight the eventful histories and agreeable fictions of this eastern world it gave me inexpressible pleasure to find myself in the midst of so noble an amphitheatre almost encircled by the vast regions of asia which has ever been esteemed the nurse of sciences the inventress of delightful and useful arts the scene of glorious actions fertile in the productions of human genius abounding in natural wonders and infinitely diversified in the forms of religion and government in the laws manners customs and languages as well as in the features and complexions of men i could not help remarking how important and extensive a field was yet unexplored and how many solid advantages unimproved  asiatick researches vol i p    these reflections led sir william by degrees to the foundation of the asiatic society and never was a man more happily qualified by nature and education to be the founder and the guide of such a respectable institution since in addition to his own singular talents for the rapid acquisition and ready communication of knowledge he was distinguished by such engaging manners as enabled him most happily to call forth and encourage the faculties of all around him his unrivalled erudition was so far from rendering him dogmatical or repulsive that no man ever spoke with more genuine modesty of his own merit no man could exert more candor and liberality in estimating the merit of others in his writings the rare extent of his knowledge is always accompanied by an equally rare sweetness and generosity of spirit which give a peculiar charm to his composition whenever he has occasion to mention an author distinguished in the branch of literature immediately before him a striking instance of this spirit occurs to my recollection in his essay on the law of bailments where he describes the legal treatises of a venerable french professor and judge m pothier in a strain of applause uncommonly animated and graceful  note   stanza xxviii but from thy toils variety and weight a young student may find a most pleasing incentive to mental exertion in contemplating the very wonderful literary acquisitions and achievements of sir william jones a regular and minute enumeration and estimate of these we may hope to see from the leisure of some accomplished individual among his many asiatic friends whom an intimate acquaintance with his extensive labors and an equal affection for his endearing virtues may engage in the office of his biographer the memorial of sir john shore is an excellent prelude to such a work sir john after mentioning his predecessors most remarkable productions inserts in his discourse a paper entitled desiderata a list of    curious and important projected works relating to india arabia china and tartary on this paper of his departed friend he makes the following observation  we are not authorized to conclude that he had himself formed a determination to complete the works which his genius and knowledge had thus sketched the task seems to require a period beyond the probable duration of any human life but we who had the happiness to know sir william jones who were witnesses of his indefatigable perseverance in the pursuit of knowledge and of his ardour to accomplish whatever he deemed important who saw the extent of his intellectual powers his wonderful seize in literature and science and the facility with which all his compositions were made cannot doubt if it had pleased providence to protract the date of his existence that he would have ably executed much of what he had so extensively planned  it cannot be deemed useless or superfluous to enquire by what arts or method he was enabled to attain to a degree of knowledge almost universal and apparently beyond the powers of man during a lise little exceeding fortyseven years  the faculties of his mind by nature vigorous were improved by constant exercise and his memory by habitual practice had acquired a capacity of retaining whatever had been once impressed upon it to an unextinguished ardour for universal knowledge he joined a perseverance in the pursuit of it which subdued all obstacles his studies began with the dawn and during the intermission of professional duties were continued throughout the day reflection and meditation strengthened and confirmed what industry and investigation had accumulated it was a fixed principle with him from which he never voluntarily deviated not to be deterred by any difficulties that were surmountable from prosecuting to a successful termination what he had once deliberately undertaken  but what appears to me to have enabled him to employ his talents so much to his own and the public advantage was the regular allotment of his time to particular occupations and a scrupulous adherence to the distribution which he had fixed hence all his studies were pursued without interruption or confusion nor can i here omit remarking what may probably have attracted your observation as well as mine the candor and complacency with which he gave his attention to all persons of whatsoever quality talent or education he justly concluded that curious or important information might be gained from the illiterate and wherever it was to be obtained he sought and seized it  in the very brief list of eminent men who have completely united the opposite advantages arising from a life of business and a life of meditation perhaps cicero is the personage who may be most properly compared with sir william jones the great roman has been often considered as without a parallel in the diversity and magnitude of his mental accomplishments yet who will now hesitate to declare that in extent of erudition in elegance and energy of mind and above all in the tenderness and integrity of his private and public life he was far from being superior to our accomplished countryman  note  0 stanza xxxii thine the loud torrent of her epic song the commentaries on asiatic poetry contain a very spirited latin version of a passage from the persian heroic poem of ferdusi whom the poetical commentator describes as a rival of homer nullum est ab europaeis scriptum poema quod ad homeri dignitatem et quasi caelestem ardorem proprius accedat a large portion of ferdusi has since appeared in an english dress but i fear without obtaining in england either for the persian homer or the english poet his translator the admiration due to original genius or the just recompense of elegant labor let me add however that joness specimen of the persian epic poetry attracted the notice and obtained the praise of learned foreigners it is inserted by the abate toderini in his copious and entertaining work entitled letteratura turchesea with the following commendation  ferdusi maraviglioso poeta epico onor della persiana poesia nel suo libro sha nama eroicamente descrive le geste degli eroi  dei re persiani il jones ne tradusse un lungo tratto omeriano  bellissimo in versi latini che sentono della

well trained youth attested all his worth in addressing his noble young friend on the most joyous occasion the high toned spirit of the poet led him to blend indignant sentiments of public virtue with the gaiety of a nuptial song the ode contains a manly strain of freedom united to the elegance and delicacy with which it celebrates the peculiar talents of the lovely bride   each morn reclined on many a rose lavinias pencil shall disclose new forms of dignity and grace the expressive air the empassioned face etc may i be allowed to express a wish that the pencil so justly praised may employ itself in honoring the memory of him who spoke in these friendly verses his perfect sense of its power  note    stanza xlii the daring hand of aeschylus portrayed        aeschili persae ver

their mystic song in the third volume of the asiatic researches the president inserted an admirable dissertation on the mystical poetry of the persians and hindus  note xvi stanza  0 menu and calidasa grace the scene from an ardent and truly noble desire to befriend the natives of that country where he was appointed to administer justice sir william jones was led to suggest to government a work of national utility and importance the compilation of a copious digest of hindu and mahommedan laws from sanscrit and arabic originals with an offer of his services to superintend the compilation and with a promise to translate it  to the superintendance of this work which was immediately undertaken at his suggestion he assiduously devoted those hours which he could spare from his professional duties  during the course of this compilation and as auxiliary to it he was led to study the works of menu reputed by the hindus to be the oldest and holiest of legislators and finding them to comprize a system of religious and civil duties and of law in all its branches so comprehensive and minutely exact that it might be considered as the institutes of hindu law he presented a translation of them to the government of bengal  sir john shores discourse  when sir william jones enquired of a very sensible brahman which of the indian dramas was most universally esteemed he answered without hesitation sacontala supporting his opinion as usual among the pandits by a couplet to this effect  the ring of sacontala in which the  th act and four stanzas of that act are eminently brilliant displays all the rich exuberance of calidasas genius  this circumstance induced our great orientalist to peruse and translate sacontala which he has given to the public to use his own very just expressions as a most pleasing and authentic picture of old hindu manners and one of the greatest curiosities that the literature of asia has yet brought to light i presume most english readers are familiar with the merits of this singular and admirable drama as it has lately been reprinted in a pocket volume  note xvii stanza    soon to its parent shell the gem restored this stanza is a free translation of an asiatic eulogy on a celebrated vizir of whose benevolent and philosophic character the reader may find a pleasing anecdote in pococks edition of abul ferege  in the commentaries on asiatic poetry this little specimen of eastern elegy is thus rendered in latin verse  illustris fuit ille margarita pura luce nitens color puro quam gemmae pretium latere questus conchae restituit deus parenti there is i trust no impropriety in applying to sir william jones an oriental encomium which he particularly admired and which i believe no individual in any quarter of the globe could more truly deserve  note xviii stanza    he drew and fashioned for the public use i have presumed without the knowledge of my friend to allude in this stanza to a monumental drawing of mr flaxman in which he has represented sir william jones collecting information from the pandits to settle the digest of hindu and mahommedan law  note xix stanza    clasped a new science with a levers zeal his last and favorite pursuit says sir john shore was the study of botany which he originally began under the confinement of a severe and lingering disorder which with most minds would have proved a disqualification from any application it constituted the principal amusement of his leisure hours in the arrangement of linnaeus he discovered system truth and science which never failed to captivate and engage his attention and from the proofs which he has exhibited of his progress in botany we may conclude that he would have extended the discoveries in that science the last composition which he read to this society was a description of select indian plants  note xx stanza    on a drear confine betwixt life and death a writer who has experienced great favor from the public may be thought i hope to discover more of gratitude than of vanity in thus touching upon a personal misfortune that condemned him to a long period of mental inactivity  note xxi stanza    i fondly greeted with fraternal praise may i be permitted to remark that the essay on epic poetry first published in      contains the lines relating to the ever esteemed subject of this publication  o thou bright spirit

from poesy thy ardent soul to seek with better hopes persuasions seat blessed be those hopes and happy that retreat which with regret all british bards must see and mourn a brother lost in losing thee note xxii stanza    tempered the judge and dignified the bard a mild and rational piety may be regarded as the crowning excellence of a character completely accomplished this excellence was possessed in a very happy degree by the incomparable personage to whose honor this imperfect memorial is affectionately devoted i cite with peculiar pleasure on this article the testimony of his intelligent and worthy eulogist sir john shore who having mentioned the mavelous variety and extent of his predecessors mental powers observes that from the most renowned poets and philosophers of greece rome and asia he could turn with equal delight and knowledge to the sublime speculations of barrow and newton with them also he professed his conviction of the truth of the christian religion and he justly deemed it no inconsiderable advantage that his researches had corroborated the multiplied evidence of revelation by confirming the mosaic account of the primitive world  let me add that it is possible he may have rendered infinitely greater services to religion by the admirable suggestion in the close of his discourse on the gods of greece italy and india he there points out what occurred to him as the only promising mode of converting the musulmans and hindus to christianity and perhaps the most worthy honor which the asiatic society could pay to the memory of sir william jones would be to resume and realize his idea the experiment is easy and should it succeed in any degree that success will form the noblest eulogy of the beneficent spirit by whom it was suggested  finis new editions
