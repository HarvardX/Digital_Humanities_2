contingere metam multa tulit fecitque puer  hor london printed by w bowyer for bernard lintot between the templegates    0  the twentysecond book of the iliad the argument the death of hector the trojans being safe within the walls hector only stays to oppose achilles priam is struck at his approach and tries to persuade his son to reenter the town hecuba joins her entreaties but in vain hector consults within himself what measures to take but at the advance of achilles his resolution fails him and he flies achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of troy the gods debate concerning the fate of hector at length minerva descends to the aid of achilles she deludes hector in the shape of deiphobus he stands the combat and is slain achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of priam and hecuba their lamentations tears and despair their cries reach the ears of andromache who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of the palace she mounts up to the walls and beholds her dead husband she swoons at the spectacle her excess of grief and lamentation  the thirtieth day still continues the scene lies under the walls and on the battlements of troy  the twentysecond book of the iliad thus to their bulwarks smit with panick fear the herded ilians rush like driven deer there safe they wipe the briny drops away and drown in bowls the labors of the day close to the walls advancing over the fields beneath one roof of wellcompacted shields march bending on the greeks embodied powers farstretching in the shade of trojan towers great hector singly stayed chained down by fate there fixed he stood before the scaean gate still his bold arms determined to employ the guardian still of longdefended troy apollo now to tired achilles turns the power confessed in all his glory burns and what he cries has peleus son in view with mortal speed a godhead to pursue for not to thee to know the gods is given unskilled to trace the latent marks of heaven what boots thee now that troy forsook the plain vain thy past labor and thy present vain safe in their walls are now her troops bestowed while here thy frantic rage attacks a god the chief incensed  too partial god of day to check my conquests in the middle way how few in ilion else had refuge found what gasping numbers now had bit the ground thou robbst me of a glory justly mine powerful of godhead and of fraud divine mean fame alas for one of heavenly strain to cheat a mortal who repines in vain then to the city terrible and strong with high and haughty steps he towrd along so the proud courser victor of the prize to the near goal with doubled ardor flies him as he blazing shot across the field the careful eyes of priam first beheld not half so dreadful rises to the sight through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night orions dog the year when autumn weighs and over the feebler stars exerts his rays terrific glory for his burning breath taints the red air with fevers plagues and death so flamed his fiery mail then wept the sage he strikes his reverend head now white with age he lifts his withered arms obtests the skies he calls his much loved son with feeble cries the son resolved achilles force to dare full at the scaean gates expects the war while the sad father on the rampart stands and thus adjures him with extended hands ah stay not stay not guardless and alone hector my loved my dearest bravest son methinks already i behold thee slain and stretched beneath that fury of the plain implacable achilles might thou be to all the immortals hateful as to me thee vultures wild should scatter round the shore and bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore how many valiant sons i late enjoyed valiant in vain by thy cursed arm destroyed or worse than slaughtered sold in distant isles to shameful bondage and unworthy toils two while i speak my eyes in vain explore two from one mother sprung my polydore and loved lycaon now perhaps no more oh if in yonder hostile camp they live what heaps of gold what treasures would i give their grandsires wealth by right of birth their own consigned his daughter with lelegias throne but if which heaven forbid already lost all pale they wander on the stygian coast what sorrows then must their sad mother know what anguish i unutterable woe yet less that anguish less to her to me less to all troy if not deprived of thee yet shun achilles enter yet the wall and spare thy self thy father spare us all save thy dear life or if a soul so brave neglect that thought thy dearer glory save pity while yet i live these silver hairs while yet thy father feels the woes he bears yet cursed with sense a wretch whom in his rage all trembling on the verge of helpless age great jove has placed sad spectacle of pain the bitter dregs of fortunes cup to drain to fill with scenes of death his closing eyes and number all his days by miseries my heroes slain my bridal bed oerturnd my daughters ravished and my city burned my bleeding infants dashed against the floor these i have yet to see perhaps yet more perhaps even i reserved by angry fate the last sad relick of my ruined state dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness must fall and stain the pavement of my regal hall where famished dogs late guardians of my door shall lick their mangled masters spatterd gore yet for my sons i thank ye gods twas well well have they perished for in fight they fell who dies in youth and vigor dies the best struck through with wounds all honest on the breast but when the fates in fullness of their rage spurn the hoar head of unresisting age in dust the reverend lineaments deform and pour to dogs the lifeblood scarcely warm this this is misery the last the worst that man can feel man fated to be cursed he said and acting what no words could say rent from his head the silver locks away with him the mournful mother bears a part yet all their sorrows turn not hectors heart the zone unbracd her bosom she displayed and thus fastfalling the salt tears she said have mercy on me o my son revere the words of age attend a parents prayer if ever thee in these fond arms i pressed or stilled thy infant clamours at this breast ah do not thus our helpless years foregoe but by our walls secured repel the foe against his rage if singly thou proceed should thou but heaven avert it should thou bleed nor must thy corpse lie honored on the bier nor spouse nor mother grace thee with a tear far from our pious rites those dear remains must feast the vultures on the naked plains so they while down their cheeks the torrents roll but fixed remains the purpose of his soul resolved he stands and with a fiery glance expects the heros terrible advance so rolled up in his den the swelling snake beholds the traveller approach the brake when fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins have gathered half the poisons of the plains he burns he stiffens with collected ire and his red eye balls glare with living fire beneath a turret on his shield reclined he stood and questioned thus his mighty mind where lies my way to enter in the wall honor and shame the ungenrous thought recall shall proud polydamas before the gate proclaim his counsels are obeyed too late which timely followed but the former night what numbers had been saved by hectors flight that wise advice rejected with disdain i feel my folly in my people slain methinks my suffering countrys voice i hear but most her worthless sons insult my ear on my rash courage charge the chance of war and blame those virtues which they cannot share no  if i ever return return i must glorious my countrys terror laid in dust or if i perish let her see me fall in field at least and fighting for her wall and yet suppose these measures i forego approach unarmed and parley with the foe the warriorshield the helm and lance lay down and treat on terms of peace to save the town the wife withheld the treasure ill detained cause of the war and grievance of the land with honorable justice to restore and add half ilions yet remaining store which troy shall sworn produce that injured greece may share our wealth and leave our walls in peace but why this thought unarmed if i should go what hope of mercy from this vengeful foe but womanlike to fall and fall without a blow we greet not here as man conversing man met at an oak or journeying over a plain no season now for calm familiar talk like youths and maidens in an evening walk war is our business but to whom is given to die or triumph that determine heaven thus pondring like a god the greek drew nigh his dreadful plumage nodded from on high the pelian javelin in his better hand shot trembling rays that glittered over the land and on his breast the beamy splendors shone like joves own lightning or the rising sun as hector sees unusual terrors rise struck by some god he fears recedes and flies he leaves the gates he leaves the walls behind achilles follows like the winged wind thus at the panting dove a falcon flies the swiftest racer of the liquid skies just when he holds or thinks he holds his prey obliquely wheeling through the aerial way with open beak and shrilling cries he springs and aims his claws and shoots upon his wings no less foreright the rapid chase they held one urged by fury one by fear impelled now circling round the walls their course maintain where the high watchtowr overlooks the plain now where the fig trees spread their umbrage broad a wider compass smoke along the road next by scamanders double source they bound where two famed fountains burst the parted ground this hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise with exhalations steaming to the skies that the green banks in summers heat overflows like crystal clear and cold as wintersnows each gushing fount a marble cistern fills whose polished bed receives the falling rills where trojan dames ever yet alarmed by greece washed their fair garments in the days of peace by these they past one chasing one in flight the mighty fled pursued by stronger might swift was the course no vulgar prize they play no vulgar victim must reward the day such as in races crown the speedy strife the prize contended was great hectors life as when some heros funrals are decreed in grateful honor of the mighty dead where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame some golden tripod or some lovely dame the panting coursers swiftly turn the goal and with them turns the raised spectators soul thus three times round the trojan wall they fly the gazing gods lean forward from the sky to whom while eager on the chase they look the sire of mortals and immortals spoke unworthy sight the man beloved of heaven behold inglorious round yon city driven my heart partakes the generous hectors pain hector whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy from idas summits and the towers of troy now see him flying to his fears resigned and fate and fierce achilles close behind consult ye powers it is worthy your debate whether to snatch him from impending fate or let him bear by stern pelides slain good as he is the lot imposed on man then pallas thus shall he whose vengeance forms the forky bolt and blackens heaven with storms shall he prolong one trojans forfeit breath a man a mortal preordaind to death and will no murmurs fill the courts above no gods indignant blame their partial jove go then returned the sire without delay exert thy will i give the fates their way swift at the mandate pleased tritonia flies and stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies as through the forest over the vale and lawn the wellbreathed beagle drives the flying fawn in vain he tries the covert of the brakes or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes sure of the vapor in the tainted dews the certain hound his various maze pursues thus step by step wherever the trojan wheeled there swift achilles compassed round the field often as to reach the dardan gates he bends and hopes the assistance of his pitying friends whose showring arrows as he coursd below from the high turrets might oppress the foe so often achilles turns him to the plain he eyes the city but he eyes in vain as men in slumbers seem with speedy pace one to pursue and one to lead the chase their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake nor this can fly nor that can overtake no less the laboring heroes pant and strain while that but flies and this pursues in vain what god o muse assisted hectors force with fate itself so long to hold the course phoebus it was who in his latest hour endud his knees with strength his nerves with power and great achilles lest some greeks advance should snatch the glory from his lifted lance signed to the troops to yield his foe the way and leave untouched the honors of the day jove lifts the golden balances that show the fates of mortal men and things below here each contending heros lot he tries and weighs with equal hand their destinies low sinks the scale surcharged with hectors fate heavy with death it sinks and hell receives the weight then phoebus left him fierce minerva flies to stern pelides and triumphing cries oh loved of jove this day our labors cease and conquest blazes with full beams on greece great hector falls that hector famed so far drunk with renown insatiable of war falls by thy hand and mine nor force nor flight shall more avail him nor his god of light see where in vain he supplicates above rolled at the feet of unrelenting jove rest here my self will lead the trojan on and urge to meet the fate he cannot shun her voice divine the chief with joyful mind obeyed and rested on his lance reclined while like deiphobus the martial dame her face her gesture and her arms the same in show an aid by hapless hectors side approached and greets him thus with voice belied too long o hector have i born the sight of this distress and sorrowd in thy flight it fits us now a noble stand to make and here as brothers equal fates partake then he o prince allied in blood and fame dearer than all that own a brothers name of all that hecuba to priam bore long tried long loved much loved but honored more since you of all our numerous race alone defend my life regardless of your own again the goddess much my fathers prayer and much my mothers pressed me to forbear my friends embraced my knees adjurd my stay but stronger love impelled and i obey come then the glorious conflict let us try let the steel sparkle and the javelin fly or let us stretch achilles on the field or to his arm our bloody trophies yield fraudful she said then swiftly marched before the dardan hero shuns his foe no more sternly they met the silence hector broke his dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke enough o son of peleus troy has viewed her walls thrice circled and her chief pursued but now some god within me bids me try thine or my fate i kill thee or i die yet on the verge of battle let us stay and for a moments space suspend the day let heavens high powers be called to arbitrate the just conditions of this stern debate eternal witnesses of all below and faithful guardians of the treasured vow to them i swear if victor in the strife jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life no vile dishonor shall thy corse pursue stripped of its arms alone the conqurors due the rest to greece uninjurd i will restore now plight thy mutual oath i ask no more talk not of oaths the dreadful chief replies while anger flashed from his disdainful eyes detested as thou art and ought to be nor oath nor pact achilles plights with thee such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine such leagues as men and furious lions join to such i call the gods one constant state of lashing rancour and eternal hate no thought but rage and neverceasing strife till death extinguish rage and thought and life rouse then thy forces this important hour collect thy soul and call forth all thy power no farther subterfuge no farther chance it is pallas pallas gives thee to my lance each grecian ghost by thee deprived of breath now hovers round and calls thee to thy death he spoke and lanchd his javelin at the foe but hector shunned the meditated blow he stooped while over his head the flying spear sung innocent and spent its force in air minerva watched it falling on the land then drew and gave to great achilles hand unseen of hector who elate with joy now shakes his lance and braves the dread of troy the life you boasted to that javelin given prince you have mist my fate depends on heaven to thee presumptuous as thou art unknown or what must prove my fortune or thy own boasting is but an art our fears to blind and with false terrors sink anothers mind but know whatever fate i am to try by no dishonest wound shall hector die i shall not fall a fugitive at least my soul shall bravely issue from my breast but first try thou my arm and may this dart end all my countrys woes deep buried in thy heart the weapon flew its course unerring held unerring but the heavenly shield repelled the mortal dart resulting with a bound from off the ringing orb it struck the ground hector beheld his javelin fall in vain nor other lance nor other hope remain he calls deiphobus demands a spear in vain for no deiphobus was there all comfortless he stands then with a sigh it is so  heaven wills it and my hour is nigh i deemed deiphobus had heard my call but he secure lies guarded in the wall a god deceived me pallas twas thy deed death and black fate approach it is i must bleed no refuge now no succor from above great jove deserts me and the son of jove propitious once and kind then welcome fate it is true i perish yet in perish great yet in a mighty deed i shall expire let future ages hear it and admire fierce at the word his weighty sword he drew and all collected on achilles flew so joves bold bird highbalancd in the air stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare nor less achilles his fierce soul prepares before his breast his flaming shield he bears refulgent orb above his fourfold cone the gilded horsehair sparkled in the sun nodding at every step  vulcanian frame and as he moved his figure seemed on flame as radiant hesper shines with keener light farbeaming over the silver host of night when all the starry train emblaze the sphere so shone the point of great achilles spear in his right hand he waves the weapon round eyes the whole man and meditates the wound but the rich mail patroclus lately wore securely cased the warriors body over one at cealp length he spies to let in fate where twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate gave entrance through that penetrable part furious he drove the welldirected dart nor pierced the windpipe yet nor took the power of speech unhappy from thy dying hour prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies while thus triumphing stern achilles cries at last is hector stretched upon the plain who feared no vengeance for patroclus slain then prince you should have feared what now you feel achilles absent was achilles still yet a short space the great avenger stayed then low in dust thy strength and glory laid peaceful he sleeps with all our rites adorned for ever honored and for ever mourned while cast to all the rage of hostile power thee birds shall mangle and the dogs devour then hector fainting at the approach of death by thy own soul by those who gave thee breath by all the sacred prevalence of prayer ah leave me not for grecian dogs to tear the common rites of sepulture bestow to sooth a fathers and a mothers woe let their large gifts procure an urn at least and hectors ashes in his country rest no wretch accursed relentless he replies flames as he spoke shot flashing from his eyes not those who gave me breath should bid me spare nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer could i my self the bloody banquet join no  to the dogs that carcass i resign should troy to bribe me bring forth all her store and giving thousands offer thousands more should dardan priam and the weeping dame drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame their hector on the pile they should not see nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee then thus the chief his dying accents drew thy rage implacable too well i knew the furies that relentless breast have steeled and cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield yet think a day will come when fates decree and angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee phoebus and paris shall avenge my fate and stretch thee here before this scaean gate he ceased the fates suppressed his laboring breath and his eyes stiffend at the hand of death to the dark realm the spirit wings its way the manly body left a load of clay and plaintive glides along the dreary coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost achilles musing as he rolled his eyes over the dead hero thus unheard replies die thou the first when jove and heaven ordain i follow thee  he said and stripped the slain then forcing backward from the gaping wound the reeking javelin cast it on the ground the thronging greeks behold with wondering eyes his manly beauty and superior size while some ignobler the great dead deface with wounds ungenrous or with taunts disgrace how changed that hector who like jove of late sent lightning on our fleets and scattered fate high over the slain the great achilles stands begirt with heroes and surrounding bands and thus aloud while all the host attends princes and leaders countrymen and friends since now at length the powerful will of heaven the dire destroyer to our arm has given is not troy fallen already haste ye powers see if already their deserted towers are left unmanned or if they yet retain the souls of heroes their great hector slain but what is troy or glory what to me or why reflects my mind on ought but thee divine patroclus death has sealed his eyes unwept unhonourd uninterrd he lies can his dear image from my soul depart long as the vital spirit moves my heart if in the silent shades of hell below the flames of friends and lovers cease to glow yet mine shall sacred last mine undecayd burn on through death and animate my shade meanwhile ye sons of greece in triumph bring the corpse of hector and your paeans sing be this the song slowmoving towered the shore  hector is dead and ilion is no more then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred unworthy of himself and of the dead the nervous ancles bored his feet he bound with thongs inserted through the double wound these fixed up high behind the rolling wain his graceful head was traild along the plain proud on his car the insulting victor stood and bore aloft his arms distilling blood he smites the steeds the rapid chariot flies the sudden clouds of circling dust arise now lost is all that formidable air the face divine and longdescending hair purple the ground and streak the sable sand deformed dishonored in his native land given to the rage of an insulting throng and in his parents sight now dragged along the mother first beheld with sad survey she rent her tresses venerably gray and cast far off the regal veils away with piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans while the sad father answers groans with groans tears after tears his mournful cheeks overflow and the whole city wears one face of woe no less than if the rage of hostile fires from her foundations curling to her spires over the proud citadel at length should rise and the last blaze send ilion to the skies the wretched monarch of the falling state distracted presses to the dardan gate scarce the whole people stop his desperate course while strong affliction gives the feeble force grief tears his heart and drives him to and fro in all the raging impotence of woe at length he rolled in dust and thus begun imploring all and naming one by one ah let me let me go where sorrow calls i only i will issue from your walls guide or companion friends i ask ye none and bow before the murderer of my son my griefs perhaps his pity may engage perhaps at least he may respect my age he has a father too a man like me one not exempt from age and misery vigorous no more as when his young embrace begot this pest of me and all my race how many valiant sons in early bloom has that cursed hand sent headlong to the tomb thee hector last thy loss divinely brave sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave oh had thy gentle spirit past in peace the son expiring in the sires embrace while both thy parents wept thy fatal hour and bending over thee mixed the tender shower some comfort that had been some sad relief to melt in full satiety of grief thus waild the father groveling on the ground and all the eyes of ilion streamed around amidst her matrons hecuba appears a mourning princess and a train in tears ah why has heaven prolonged this hated breath patient of horrors to behold thy death o hector late thy parents pride and joy the boast of nations the defense of troy to whom her safety and her fame she owed her chief her hero and almost her god o fatal change become in one sad day a senseless corpse inanimated clay but not as yet the fatal news had spread to fair andromache of hector dead as yet no messenger had told his fate nor even his stay without the scaean gate far in the close recesses of the dome pensive she plied the melancholy loom a growing work employed her secret hours confusedly gay with intermingled flowrs her fairhaird handmaids heat the brazen urn the bath preparing for her lords return in vain alas her lord returns no more unbathd he lies and bleeds along the shore now from the walls the clamours reach her ear and all her members shake with sudden fear forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls as thus astonished to her maids she calls ah follow me she cried what plaintive noise invades my ear it is sure my mothers voice my faltring knees their trembling frame desert a pulse unusual flutters at my heart some strange disaster some reverse of fate ye gods avert it threats the trojan state far be the omen which my thoughts suggest but much i fear my hectors dauntless breast confronts achilles chased along the plain shut from our walls i fear i fear him slain safe in the crowd he ever scorned to wait and sought for glory in the jaws of fate perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath now quenched for ever in the arms of death she spoke and furious with distracted pace fears in her heart and anguish in her face flies through the dome the maids her steps pursue and mounts the walls and sends around her view too soon her eyes the killing object found the godlike hector dragged along the ground a sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes she faints she falls her breath her color flies her hairs fair ornaments the braids that bound the net that held them and the wreath that crowned the veil and diadem flew far away the gift of venus on her bridal day around a train of weeping sisters stands to raise her sinking with assistant hands scarce from the verge of death recalled again she faints or but recovers to complain o wretched husband of a wretched wife born with one fate to one unhappy life for sure one star its baneful beam displayed on priams roof and hippoplacias shade from different parents different climes we came at different periods yet our fate the same why was my birth to great aetion owed and why was all that tender care bestowed would i had never been  o thou the ghost of my dead husband miserably lost thou to the dismal realms for ever gone and i abandoned desolate alone an only child once comfort of my pains sad product now of hapless love remains no more to smile upon his sire no friend to help him now no father to defend for should he scape the sword the common doom what wrongs attend him and what griefs to come even from his own paternal roof expelled some stranger plows his patrimonial field the day that to the shades the father sends robs the sad orphan of his fathers friends he wretched outcast of mankind appears for ever sad for ever bathed in tears amongst the happy unregarded he hangs on the robe or trembles at the knee while those his fathers former bounty fed nor reach the goblet nor divide the bread the kindest but his present wants allay to leave him wretched the succeeding day frugal compassion heedless they who boast both parents still nor feel what he has lost shall cry begone thy father feasts not here the wretch obeys retiring with a tear thus wretched thus retiring all in tears to my sad soul astyanax appears forced by repeated insults to return and to his widowed mother vainly mourn he who with tender delicacy bred with princes sported and on dainties fed and when still evening gave him up to rest sunk soft in down upon the nurses breast must  ah what must he not whom ilion calls astyanax from her wellguarded walls is now that name no more unhappy boy since now no more the father guards his troy but thou my hector lie exposed in air far from thy parents and thy consorts care whose hand in vain directed by her love the martial scarf and robe of triumph wove now to devouring flames be these a prey useless to thee from this accursed day yet let the sacrifice at least be paid an honor to the living not the dead so spoke the mournful dame her matrons hear sigh back her sighs and answer tear with tear observations on the twentysecond book observations on the twentysecond book i it is impossible but the whole attention of the reader must be awakened in this book the heroes of the two armies are now to encounter all the foregoing battles have been but so many preludes and underactions in order to this great event wherein the whole fate of greece and troy is to be decided by the sword of achilles and hector  this is the book which of the whole iliad appears to me the most charming it assembles in it all that can be imagined of great and important on the one hand and of tender and melancholy on the other terror and pity are here wrought up in perfection and if the reader is not sensible of both in a high degree either he is utterly void of all taste or the translator of all skill in poetry  ii verse    not half so dreadful rises etc with how much dreadful pomp is achilles here introduced how noble and in what bold colors has he drawn the blazing of his arms the rapidity of his advance the terror of his appearance the desolation around him but above all the certain death attending all his motions and his very looks what a crowd of terrible ideas in this one simile  but immediately after this follows the moving image of the two aged parents trembling weeping and imploring their son that is succeeded again by the dreadful gloomy picture of hector all on fire obstinately bent on death and expecting achilles admirably painted in the simile of the snake rolled up in his den and collecting his poisons and indeed through the whole book this wonderful contrast and opposition of the moving and of the terrible is perpetually kept up each heightening the other i cannot find words to express how so great beauties affect me  iii verse    the speech of priam to hector the poet has entertained us all along with various scenes of slaughter and horror he now changes to the pathetick and fills the mind of the reader with tender sorrows eustathius observes that priam preludes to his words by actions expressive of misery the unhappy orator introduces his speech to hector with groans and tears and rending his hoary hair the father and the king plead with hector to preserve his life and his country he represents his own age and the loss of many of his children and adds that if hector falls he should then be inconsolable and the empire of troy at an end  it is a piece of great judgment in homer to make the fall of troy to depend upon the death of hector the poet does not openly tell us that troy was taken by the greeks but that the reader might not be unacquainted with what happened after the period of his poem he gives us to understand in this speech that the city was taken and that priam his wives his sons and daughters were either killed or made slaves  iv verse    enter yet the wall and save etc the argument that priam uses says eustathius to induce hector to secure himself in troy is remarkable he draws it not from hectors fears nor does he tell him that he is to save his own life but he insists upon stronger motives he tells him he may preserve his fellowcitizens his country and his father and farther persuades him not to add glory to his mortal enemy by his fall  v verse  0 my bleeding infants dashed against the floor cruelties which the barbarians usually exercised in the sacking of towns thus isaiah foretells to babylon that her children shall be dashed in pieces before her eyes by the medes infantes eorum allidentur in oculis eorum xii    and david says to the same city happy shall he be that takes and dasheth thy little ones against the stones psalm cxxxvii   and in the prophet hosea xiii    their infants shall be dashed in pieces dacier  vi verse  0  but when the fates etc nothing can be more moving than the image which homer gives here in comparing the different effects produced by the view of a young man and that of an old one both bleeding and extended on the dust the old man it is certain touches us most and several reasons may be given for it the principal is that the young man defended himself and his death is glorious whereas an old man has no defense but his weakness prayers and tears they must be very insensible of what is dreadful and have no taste in poetry who omit this passage in a translation and substitute things of a trivial and insipid nature dacier  vii verse     the speech of hecuba the speech of hecuba opens with as much tenderness as that of priam the circumstance in particular of her showing that breast to her son which had sustained his infancy is highly moving it is a silent kind of oratory and prepares the heart to listen by prepossessing the eye in favor of the speaker  eustathius takes notice of the difference between the speeches of priam and hecuba priam dissuades him from the combat by enumerating not only the loss of his own family but of his whole country hecuba dwells entirely upon his single death this is a great beauty in the poet to make priam a father to his whole country but to describe the fondness of the mother as prevailing over all other considerations and to mention that only which chiefly affects her  this puts me in mind of a judicious stroke in milton with regard to the several characters of adam and eve when the angel is driving them both out of paradise adam grieves that he must leave a place where he had conversed with god and his angels but eve laments that she shall never more behold the fine flowers of eden here adam mourns like a man and eve like a woman  viii verse   0 the soliloquy of hector there is much greatness in the sentiments of this whole soliloquy hector prefers death to an ignominious life he knows how to die with glory but not how to live with dishonor the reproach of polydamas affects him the scandals of the meanest people have an influence on his thoughts  it is remarkable that he does not say he fears the insults of the braver trojans but of the most worthless only men of merit are always the most candid but others are ever for bringing all men to a level with themselves they cannot bear that any one should be so bold as to excel and are ready to pull him down to them upon the least miscarriage this sentiment is perfectly fine and agreeable to the way of thinking natural to a great and sensible mind  there is a very beautiful break in the middle of this speech hectors mind fluctuates every way he is calling a council in his own breast and consulting what method to pursue he doubts if he should not propose terms of peace to achilles and grants him very large concessions but of a sudden he checks himself and leaves the sentence unfinished the paragraph runs thus if says hector i should offer him the largest conditions give all that troy contains  there he stops and immediately subjoins but why do i delude myself etc  it is evident from this speech that the power of making peace was in hectors hands for unless priam had transferred it to him he could not have made these propositions so that it was hector who broke the treaty in the third book where the very same conditions were proposed by agamemnon it is hector therefore that is guilty he is blameable in continuing the war and involving the greeks and trojans in blood this conduct in homer was necessary he observes a poetical justice and shows us that hector is a criminal before he brings him to death eustathius  ix verse     shall proud polydamas etc hector alludes to the counsel given him by polydamas in the eighteenth book which he then neglected to follow it was to withdraw to the city and fortify themselves there before achilles returned to the battle  x verse     we greet not here as man conversing man met at an oak or journeying over a plain etc the words literally are these  there is no talking with achilles  from an oak or from a rock or about an oak or a rock as a young man and a maiden talk together it is thought an obscure passage though i confess i am either too fond of my own explication in the above cited verses or they make it a very clear one there is no conversing with this implacable enemy in the rage of battle as when sauntring people talk at leisure to one another on the road or when young men and women meet in a field i think the exposition of eustathius more farfetchd though it be ingenious and therefore i must do him the justice not to suppress it it was a common practice says he with the heathens to expose such children as they either could not or would not educate the places where they deposited them were usually in the cavities of rocks or the hollow of oaks these children being frequently found and preserved by strangers were said to be the offspring of those oaks or rocks where they were found this gave occasion to the poets to feign that men were born of oaks and there was a famous fable too of deucalion and pyrrhas repairing mankind by casting stones behind them it grew at last into a proverb to signify idle tales so that in the present passage it imports that achilles will not listen to such idle tales as may pass with silly maids and fond lovers for fables and stories and particularly such stories as the preservation strange fortune and adventures of exposed children are the usual conversation of young men and maidens eustathius his explanation may be corroborated by a parallel place in the odyssey where the poet says  the meaning of which passage is plainly this tell me of what race you are for undoubtedly you had a father and mother you are not according to the old story descended from an oak or a rock where the word  shows that this was become an ancient proverb even in homers days  xi verse   0 struck by some god he fears recedes and flies i doubt not most readers are shocked at the flight of hector it is indeed a high exaltation of achilles which was the poets chief care as he was his chief hero that so brave a man as hector durst not stand him while achilles was at a distance he had fortified his heart with noble resolutions but at his approach they all vanish and he flies this as exceptionable as some may think it may yet be allowed to be a true portrait of human nature for distance as it lessens all objects so it does our fears but where inevitable danger approaches the stoutest hearts will feel some apprehensions at certain fate it was the saying of one of the bravest men in this age to one who told him he feared nothing show me but a certain danger and i shall be as much afraid as any of you i dont absolutely pretend to justify this passage in every point but only to have thus much granted me that hector was in this desperate circumstance  first it will not be found in the whole iliad that hector ever thought himself a match for achilles homer to keep this in our minds had just now made priam tell him as a thing known for certainly priam would not insult him at that time that there was no comparison between his own strength and that of his antagonist     secondly we may observe with dacier the degrees by which homer prepares this incident in the   th book the mere sight and voice of achilles unarmed has terrified and put the whole trojan army into disorder in the   th the very sound of the celestial arms given him by vulcan has affrighted his own myrmidons as they stand about him in the  0th he has been upon the point of killing aeneas and hector himself was not saved from him but by apollos interposing in that and the following book he makes an incredible slaughter of all that oppose him he overtakes most of those that fly from him and priam himself opens the gates of troy to receive the rest  thirdly hector stays not that he hopes to overcome achilles but because shame and the dread of reproach forbid him to reenter the city a shame says eustathius which was a fault that betrayed him out of his life and ruined his country nay homer adds farther that he only stayed by the immediate will of heaven intoxicated and irresistibly bound down by fate    fourthly he had just been reflecting on the injustice of the war he maintained his spirits are deprest by heaven he expects certain death he perceives himself abandoned by the gods as he directly says in  00 etc of the greek and     of the translation so that he might say to achilles what turnus does to aeneas dii me terrent and jupiter hostis this indeed is the strongest reason that can be offered for the flight of hector he flies not from achilles as a mortal hero but from one whom he sees clad in impenetrable armor seconded by minerva and one who had put to flight the inferior gods themselves this is not cowardice according to the constant principles of homer who thought it no part of a heros character to be impious or to fancy himself independent on the supreme being  indeed it had been a grievous fault had our author suffered the courage of hector entirely to forsake him even in this extremity a brave mans soul is still capable of rouzing itself and acting honorably in the last struggles accordingly hector though delivered over to his destiny abandoned by the gods and certain of death yet stops and attacks achilles when he loses his spear he draws his sword it was impossible he should conquer it was only in his power to fall gloriously this he did and it was all that man could do  if the reader after all cannot bring himself to like this passage for his own particular yet to induce him to suspend his absolute censure he may consider that virgil had an uncommon esteem for it as he has testified in transferring it almost entirely to the death of turnus where there was no necessity of making use of the like incidents but doubtless he was touched with this episode as with one of those which interest us most of the whole iliad by a spectacle at once so terrible and so deplorable i must also add the suffrage of aristotle who was so far from looking upon this passage as ridiculous or blameable that he esteemed it mavelous and admirable the wonderful says he ought to have place in tragedy but still more in epic poetry which proceeds in this point even to the unreasonable for as in epic poems one sees not the persons acting so whatever passes the bounds of reason is proper to produce the admirable and the mavelous for example what homer says of hector pursued by achilles would appear ridiculous on the stage for the spectators could not forbear laughing to see on one side the greeks standing without any motion and on the other achilles pursuing hector and making signs to the troops not to dart at him but all this does not appear when we read the poem for what is wonderful is always agreeable and as a proof of it we find that they who relate any thing usually add something to the truth that it may the better please those who hear it  the same great critic vindicates this passage in the chapter following a poet says he is inexcusable if he introduces such things as are impossible according to the rules of poetry but this ceases to be a fault if by those means he attains to the end he proposed for he has then brought about what he intended for example if he renders by it any part of his poem more astonishing or admirable such is the place in the iliad where achilles pursues hector arist poet chap        xii verse     where two famed fountains strabo blames homer for saying that one of the sources of scamander was a warm fountain whereas says he there is but one spring and that cold neither is this in the place where homer fixes it but in the mountain it is observed by eustathius that though this was not true in strabos days yet it might in homers greater changes having happened in less time than that which passed between those two authors sandys who was both a geographer and critic of great accuracy as well as a traveller of great veracity affirms as an eye witness that there are yet some hotwater springs in that part of the country opposite to tenedos i cannot but think that gentleman must have been particularly diligent and curious in his enquiries into the remains of a place so celebrated in poetry as he was not only perhaps the most learned but one of the best poets of his time i am glad of this occasion to do his memory so much justice as to say the english versification owes much of its improvement to his translations and especially that admirable one of job what chiefly pleases me in this place is to see the exact landscape of old troy we have a clear idea of the town itself and of the roads and country about it the river the fig trees and every part is set before our eyes  xiii verse     the gazing gods lean forward from the skies we have here an instance of the great judgment of homer the death of hector being the chief action of the poem he assembles the gods and calls a council in heaven concerning it it is for the same reason that he represents jupiter with the greatest solemnity weighing in his scales the fates of the two heroes i have before observed at large upon the last circumstance in a preceding note so that there is no occasion to repeat it  i wonder that none of the commentators have taken notice of this beauty in my opinion it is a very necessary observation and shows the art and judgment of the poet in that he has made the greatest and finishing action of the poem of such importance that it engages the gods in debates  xiv verse     from ida s summits   it was the custom of the pagans to sacrifice to the gods upon the hills and mountains in scripture language upon the high places for they were persuaded that the gods in a particular manner inhabited such eminences wherefore god ordered his people to destroy all those high places which the nations had profaned by their idolatry you shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree deuteronomy xii   it is for this reason that so many kings are reproached in scripture for not taking away the high places  xv verse     thus step by step etc there is some difficulty in this passage and it seems strange that achilles could not overtake hector when he is allowed to excel so much in swiftness especially when the poet describes him as running in a narrower circle than hector eustathius gives us many solutions from the ancients homer has already told us that they run for the life of hector and consequently hector would exert his utmost speed whereas achilles might only endeavor to keep him from entering the city besides achilles could not directly pursue him because he frequently made efforts to shelter himself under the wall and he being obliged to turn him from it he might be forced to take more steps than hector but the poet to take away all grounds of an objection tells us afterward that apollo gave him a supernatural swiftness  xvi verse     as men in slumbers this beautiful comparison has been condemned by some of the ancients even so far as to judge it unworthy of having a place in the iliad they say the diction is mean and the similitude itself absurd because it compares the swiftness of the heroes to men asleep who are in a state of rest and inactivity but surely there cannot be a more groundless criticism the poet is so far from drawing his comparison from the repose of men asleep that he alludes only to their dreams it is a race in fancy that he describes and surely the imagination is nimble enough to illustrate the greatest degree of swiftness besides the verses themselves run with the utmost rapidity and imitate the swiftness they describe eustathius  what sufficiently proves these verses to be genuine is that virgil has imitated them aen    ac veluti in somnis    xvii verse   0 signed to the troops etc the difference which homer here makes between hector and achilles deserves to be taken notice of hector in running away toward the walls to the end that the trojans who are upon them may overwhelm achilles with their darts and achilles in turning hector toward the plain makes a sign to his troops not to attack him this shows the great courage of achilles and yet this action which appears so generous has been very much condemned by the ancients plutarch in the life of pompey gives us to understand that it was looked upon as the action of a fool too greedy of glory indeed this is not a single combat of achilles against hector for in that case achilles would have done very ill not to hinder his troops from assaulting him this was a rencounter in a battle and so achilles might and ought to take all advantage to rid himself the readiest and the surest way of an enemy whose death would procure an entire victory to his party wherefore does he leave this victory to chance why expose himself to the hazard of losing it why does he prefer his private glory to the public weal and the safety of all the greeks which he puts to the venture by delaying to conquer and endangering his own person i grant it is a fault but it must be owned to be the fault of a hero eustathius dacier  xviii verse     then phoebus left him   this is a very beautiful and poetical manner of describing a plain circumstance the hour of hectors death was now come and the poet expresses it by saying that apollo or destiny forsakes him that is the fates no longer protect him eustathius  xix verse id  fierce minerva flies to stern pelides etc the poet may seem to diminish the glory of achilles by ascribing the victory over hector to the assistance of pallas whereas in truth he fell by the hand only of achilles but poetry loves to raise every thing into a wonder it steps out of the common road of narration and aims to surprise and the poet would farther insinuate that it is a greater glory to achilles to be beloved by the gods than to be only excellent in valor for many men have valor but few the favor of heaven eustathius  xx verse     obeyed and rested the whole passage where pallas deceives hector is evidently an allegory achilles perceiving that he cannot overtake hector pretends to be quite spent and wearied in the pursuit the stratagem takes effect and recalls his enemy this the poet expresses by saying that pallas or wisdom came to assist achilles hector observing his enemy stay to rest concludes that he is quite fatigued and immediately takes courage and advances upon him he thinks he has him at an advantage but at last finds himself deceived thus making a wrong judgment he is betrayed into his death so that his own false judgment is the treacherous pallas that deceives him eustathius  xxi verse     the speeches of hector and of achilles there is an opposition between these speeches excellently adapted to the characters of both the heroes that of hector is full of courage but mixed with humanity that of achilles of resentment and arrogance we see the great hector disposing of his own remains and that thirst of glory which has made him live with honor now bids him provide as eustathius observes that what once was hector may not de dishonored thus we see a sedate calm courage with a contempt of death in the speeches of hector but in that of achilles there is a fierte and an insolent air of superiority his magnanimity makes him scorn to steal a victory he bids him prepare to defend himself with all his forces and that valor and resentment which made him desirous that he might revenge himself upon hector with his own hand and forbade the greeks to interpose now directs him not to take any advantage over a brave enemy i think both their characters are admirably sustained and though achilles be drawn with a great violence of features yet the picture is undoubtedly like him and it had been the utmost absurdity to have softened one line upon this occasion when the soul of achilles was all on fire to revenge the death of his friend patroclus i must desire the reader to carry this observation in his memory and particularly in that place where achilles says he could eat the very flesh of hector though i have a little softened it in the translation v      xxii verse     so jove s bold bird etc the poet takes up some time in describing the two great heroes before they close in fight the verses are pompous and magnificent and he illustrates his description with two beautiful similes he makes a double use of this conduct he not only raises our imagination to attend to so momentous an action but by lengthening his narration he keeps the mind in a pleasing suspense and divides it between hopes and fears for the fate of hector or achilles  xxiii verse  0  through that penetrable part furious he drove etc it was necessary that the poet should be very particular in this point because the arms that hector wore were the arms of achilles taken from patroclus and consequently as they were the work of vulcan they would preserve hector from the possibility of a wound the poet therefore to give an air of probability to his story tells us that they were patroclus his arms and as they were not made for hector they might not exactly fit his body so that it is not improbable but there might be some place about the neck of hector so open as to admit the spear of achilles eustathius  xxiv verse     could i my self the bloody banquet join i have before hinted that there is something very fierce and violent in this passage but i fancy that what i there observed will justify homer in his relation though not achilles in his savage sentiments yet the poet softens the expression by saying that achilles only wishes that his heart would permit him to devour him this is much more tolerable than a passage in the thebais of statius where tydeus in the very pangs of death is represented as knawing the head of his enemy  xxv verse   0 should troy to bribe me etc such resolutions as achilles here makes are very natural to men in anger he tells hector that no motives shall ever prevail with him to suffer his body to be ransomed yet when time had cooled his heat and he had somewhat satisfied his revenge by insulting his remains he restores them to priam this perfectly agrees with his conduct in the ninth book where at first he gives a rough denial and afterward softens into an easier temper and this is very agreeable to the nature of achilles his anger abates very slowly it is stubborn yet still it remits had the poet drawn him as never to be pacified he had outragd nature and not represented his hero as a man but as a monster eustathius  xxvi verse   0 a day will come   hector prophesies at his death that achilles shall fall by the hand of paris this confirms an observation made in a former note that the words of dying men were looked upon as prophecies but whether such conjectures are true or false it appears from hence that such opinions have prevailed in the world above three thousand years  xxvii verse     the great dead deface with wounds etc eustathius tells us that homer introduces the soldiers wounding the dead body of hector in order to mitigate the cruelties which achilles exercises upon his body for if every common soldier takes a pride in giving him a wound what insults may we not expect from the inexorable inflamed achilles but i must confess myself unable to vindicate the poet in giving us such an idea of his countrymen i think the former courage of their enemy should have been so far from moving them to revenge that it should have recommended him to their esteem what achilles afterward acts is suitable to his character and consequently the poet is justified but surely all the greeks were not of his temper patroclus was not so dear to them all as he was to achilles it is true the poet represents achilles as eustathius observes enumerating the many ills they had suffered from hector and he seems to endeavor to infect the whole army with his resentment had hector been living they had been acted by a generous indignation against him but these men seem as if they only dared approach him dead in short what they say over his body is a mean insult and the stabs they give it are cowardly and barbarous  xxxi verse     the speech of achilles we have a very fine observation of eustathius on this place that the judgment and address of homer here is extremely worthy of remark he knew and had often said that the gods and fate had not granted achilles the glory of taking troy there was then no reason to make him march against the town after the death of hector since all his efforts must have been ineffectual what has the poet done in this conjuncture it was but reasonable that the first thought of achilles should be to march directly to troy and to profit himself of the general consternation into which the death of hector had thrown the trojans we here see he knows the duty and does not want the ability of a great general but after this on a sudden he changes his design and derives a plausible pretense from the impatience he has to pay the last devoirs to his friend the manners of achilles and what he has already done for patroclus make this very natural at the same time this turning off to the tender and pathetick has a fine effect the reader in the very fury of the heros vengeance perceives that achilles is still a man and capable of softer passions  xxxii verse     hector is dead and ilion is no more i have followed the opinion of eustathius who thought that what achilles says here was the chorus or burden of a song of triumph in which his troops bear a part with him as he returns from this glorious combat dacier observes that this is very correspondent to the manners of those times and instances in that passage of the book of kings when david returns from the conquest of goliath the women there go out to meet him from all the cities of israel and sing a triumphal song the chorus whereof is saul has killed his thousands and david his ten thousands  xxxiii verse     unworthy of himself and of the dead this inhumanity of achilles in dragging the dead body of hector has been severely and i think indeed not without some justice censured by several both ancients and moderns plato in his third book de republica speaks of it with detestation but methinks it is a great injustice to homer to reflect upon the morals of the author himself for things which he only paints as the manners of a vicious hero  it may justly be observed in general of all platos objections against homer that they are still in a view to morality constantly blaming him for representing ill and immoral things as the opinions or actions of his persons to every one of these one general answer will serve which is that homer as often describes ill things in order to make us avoid them as good to induce us to follow them which is the case with all writers whatever but what is extremely remarkable and evidently shows the injustice of platos censure is that many of those very actions for which he blames him are expressly characterized and marked by homer himself as evil and detestable by previous expressions or cautions thus in the present place before he describes this barbarity of achilles he tells us it was a most unworthy action   when achilles sacrifices the twelve young trojans in l    he repeats the same words when pandarus broke the truce in l   he told us it was a mad unjust deed   and so of the rest  xxxiv verse  0  the face divine and longdescending hair it is impossible to read the actions of great men without having our curiosity raised to know the least circumstance that relates to them homer to satisfy it has taken care in the process of his poem to give us the shape of his heroes and the very color of their hair thus he has told us that achilless locks were yellow and here the epithet  shows us that those of hector were of a darker color as to his person he told us a little above that it was so handsome that all the greeks were surpised to see it plutarch recites a remarkable story of the beauty of hector it was reported in lacedaemon that a handsome youth who very much resembled hector was arrived there immediately the whole city run in such numbers to behold him that he was trampled to death by the crowd eustathius  xxxv verse     sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave it is in the greek  it is needless to observe to the reader with what a beautiful pathos the wretched father laments his son hector it is impossible not to join with priam in his sorrows but what i would chiefly point out to my reader is the beauty of this line which is particularly tender and almost word for word the same with that of the patriarch jacob who upon a like occasion breaks out into the same complaint and tells his children that if they deprive him of his son benjamin they will bring down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave  xxxvi verse     etc the grief of andromache which is painted in the following part is far beyond all the praises that can be given it but i must take notice of one particular which shows the great art of the poet in order to make the wife of hector appear yet more afflicted than his parents he has taken care to increase her affliction by surprise it is finely prepared by the circumstances of her being retired to her innermost apartment of her employment in weaving a robe for her husband as may be conjectured from what she says afterward     and of her maids preparing the bath for his return all which as the critics have observed augment the surprise and render this reverse of fortune much more dreadful and afflicting  xxxvi verse  00 her hairs fair ornaments eustathius remarks that in speaking of andromache and hecuba homer expatiates upon the ornaments of dress in andromache because she was a beautiful young princess but is very concise about that of hecuba because she was old and wore a dress rather suitable to her age and gravity than to her state birth and condition i cannot pass over a matter of such importance as a young ladys dress without endeavoring to explain what sort of heads were worn above three thousand years ago  it is difficult to describe particularly every ornament mentioned by the poet but i shall lay before my female readers the bishops explanation the  was used  that is to tie backwards the hair that grew on the forepart of the head the  was a veil of network that covered the hair when it was so tied  was an ornament used  to tie backwards the hair that grew on the temples and the  was a fillet perhaps embroidered with gold from the expression of  that bound the whole and completed the dress  the ladies cannot but be pleased to see so much learning and greek upon this important subject  homer is in nothing more excellent than in that distinction of characters which he maintains through his whole poem what andromache here says can be spoken properly by none but andromache there is nothing general in her sorrows nothing that can be transferred to another character the mother laments the son and the wife weeps over the husband  xxxviii verse     the day that to the shades etc the following verses which so finely describe the condition of an orphan have been rejected by some ancient critics it is a proof there were always critics of no manner of taste it being impossible any where to meet with a more exquisite passage i will venture to say there are not in all homer any lines more worthy of him the beauty of this tender and compassionate image is such that it even makes amends for the many cruel ones with which the iliad is too much stained these censurers imagined this description to be of too abject and mean a nature for one of the quality of astyanax but had they considered says eustathius that these are the words of a fond mother who feared every thing for her son that women are by nature timorous and think all misfortunes will happen because there is a possibility that they may that andromache is in the very height of her sorrows in the instant she is speaking i fancy they would have altered their opinion  it is undoubtedly an aggravation to our misfortunes when they sink us in a moment from the highest flow of prosperity to the lowest adversity the poet judiciously makes use of this circumstance the more to excite our pity and introduces the mother with the utmost tenderness lamenting this reverse of fortune in her son changed all at once into a slave a beggar an orphan have we not examples in our own times of such unhappy princes whose condition renders this of astyanax but too probable  xxxix verse     on dainties fed it is in the greek who upon his fathers knees used to eat marrow and the fat of sheep this would seem gross if it were literally translated but it is a figurative expression and in the style of the orientals marrow and fatness are taken for whatever is best tenderest and most delicious thus in job xxi    viscera ejus plena sunt adipe and medullis ossa ejus rigantur and xxxvi    requies autem mensae tuae erit plena pinguedine in jer xxxi    god says that he will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness inebriabo animam sacerdotum pinguedine dacier  xl verse     the martial scarf and robe of triumph wove this idea very naturally offers itself to a woman who represents to herself the body of her husband dashed to pieces and all his limbs dragged upon the ground uncovered and nothing is more proper to excite pity it is well known that it was anciently the custom among princesses and great ladies to have large quantities of stuffs and movables this provision was more necessary in those times than now because of the great consumption made of them on those occasions of mourning  i am of opinion that homer had a farther view in expatiating thus largely upon the death of hector every word that hecuba priam and andromache speaks shows us the importance of hector every word adds a weight to the concluding action of his poem and at the same time represents the sad effects of the anger of achilles which is the subject of it  the twentythird book of the iliad the argument the funeral of patroclus achilles and the myrmidons do honors to the body of patroclus after the funeral feast he retires to the seashore where falling asleep the ghost of his friend appears to him and demands the rites of burial the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and wagons to fetch wood for the pyre the funeral procession and the offering of their hair to the dead achilles sacrifices several animals and lastly twelve trojan captives at the pile then sets fire to it he pays libations to the winds which at the instance of iris rise and raise the flames when the pile has burned all night they gather the bones place em in an urn of gold and raise the tomb achilles institutes the funeral games the chariot race the fight of the caestus the wrestling the footrace the single combat the discus the shooting with arrows the darting the javelin the various descriptions of which and the various success of the several antagonists make the greatest part of the book  in this book ends the thirtieth day the night following the ghost of patroclus appears to achilles the one and thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile the two and thirtieth in burning it and the three and thirtieth in the games the scene is generally on the seashore  the twentythird book of the iliad thus humbled in the dust the pensive train through the sad city mourned her hero slain the body soiled with dust and black with gore lies on broad hellesponts resounding shore the grecians seek their ships and clear the strand all but the martial myrmidonian band these yet assembled great achilles holds and the stern purpose of his mind unfolds not yet my brave companions of the war release your smoking coursers from the car but with his chariot each in order led perform due honors to patroclus dead ever yet from rest or food we seek relief some rites remain to glut our rage of grief the troops obeyed and thrice in order led  achilles first their coursers round the dead and thrice their sorrows and laments renew tears drop the sands and tears their arms bedew for such a warrior thetis aids their woe melts their strong hearts and bids their eyes to flow but chief pelides thicksucceeding sighs burst from his heart and torrents from his eyes his slaughtring hands yet red with blood he laid on his dead friends cold breast and thus he said all hail patroclus let thy honored ghost hear and rejoice on plutos dreary coast behold achilles promise is complete the bloody hector stretched before thy feet lo to the dogs his carcass i resign and twelve sad victims of the trojan line sacred to vengeance instant shall expire their lives effusd around thy funeral pyre gloomy he said and horrible to view before the bier the bleeding hector threw prone on the dust the myrmidons around unbracd their armor and the steeds unbound all to achilles sable ship repair frequent and full the genial feast to share now from the wellfed swine black smokes aspire the bristly victims hissing over the fire the huge ox bellowing falls with feebler cries expires the goat the sheep in silence dies around the heros prostrate body flowed in one promiscuous stream the reeking blood and now a band of argive monarchs brings the glorious victor to the king of kings from his dead friend the pensive warrior went with steps unwilling to the regal tent the attending heralds as by office bound with kindled flames the tripodvase surround to cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore they urged in vain the chief refused and swore no drop shall touch me by almighty jove the first and greatest of the gods above till on the pyre i place thee till i rear the grassy mound and clip thy sacred hair some ease at least those pious rites may give and sooth my sorrows while i bear to live however reluctant as i am i stay and share your feast but with the dawn of day o king of men it claims thy royal care that greece the warriors funeral pile prepare and bid the forests fall such rites are paid to heroes slumbering in eternal shade then when his earthly part shall mount in fire let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire he spoke they hear him and the word obey the rage of hunger and of thirst allay then ease in sleep the labors of the day but great pelides stretched along the shore where dashed on rocks the broken billows roar lies inly groaning while on either hand the martial myrmidons confusedly stand along the grass his languid members fall tired with his chase around the trojan wall hushed by the murmurs of the rolling deep at length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep when lo the shade before his closing eyes of sad patroclus rose or seemed to rise in the same robe the living wore he came in stature voice and pleasing look the same the form familiar hovered over his head and sleeps achilles thus the phantom said sleeps my achilles his patroclus dead living i seemed his dearest tenderest care but now forgot i wander in the air let my pale corse the rites of burial know and give me entrance in the realms below till then the spirit finds no resting place but here and there the unbodyd specter chase the vagrant dead around the dark abode forbid to cross the irremeable flood now give thy hand for to the farther shore when once we pass the soul returns no more when once the last funereal flames ascend no more shall meet achilles and his friend no more our thoughts to those we loved make known or quit the dearest to converse alone me fate has severed from the sons of earth the fate foredoomd that waited from my birth thee too it waits before the trojan wall even great and godlike thou art doomed to fall hear then and as in fate and love we join ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine together have we lived together bred one house received us and one table fed that golden urn thy goddess mother gave may mix our ashes in one common grave and is it thou he answers to my sight once more returnst thou from the realms of night oh more than brother think each office paid whatever can rest a discontented shade but grant one last embrace unhappy boy afford at least that melancholy joy he said and with his longing arms essayed in vain to grasp the visionary shade like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly and hears a feeble lamentable cry confused he wakes amazement breaks the bands of golden sleep and starting from the sands pensive he muses with uplifted hands it is true it is certain man though dead retains part of himself the immortal mind remains the form subsists without the bodys aid aerial semblance and an empty shade this night my friend so late in battle lost stood at my side a pensive plaintive ghost even now familiar as in life he came alas how different yet how like the same thus while he spoke each eye grew big with tears and now the rosyfingerd morn appears shows every mournful face with tears overspread and glares on the pale visage of the dead but agamemnon as the rites demand with mules and wagons sends a chosen band to load the timber and the pile to rear a charge consigned to merions faithful care with proper instruments they take the road axes to cut and ropes to sling the load first march the heavy mules securely slow over hills over dales over crags over rocks they go jumping high over the shrubs of the rough ground rattle the clattring cars and the shockt axles bound but when arrived at idas spreading woods fair ida watered with descending floods loud sounds the axe redoubling strokes on strokes on all sides round the forest hurles her oaks headlong deepechoing groan the thickets brown then rustling crackling crashing thunder down the wood the grecians cleave prepared to burn and the slow mules the same rough road return the sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore such charge was given em to the sandy shore there on the spot which great achilles showed they eased their shoulders and disposed the load circling around the place where times to come shall view patroclus and achilles tomb the hero bids his martial troops appear high on their cars in all the pomp of war each in refulgent arms his limbs attires all mount their chariots combatants and squires the chariots first proceed a shining train then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain next these a melancholy band appear amidst lay dead patroclus on the bier over all the corse their scattered locks they throw achilles next oppressed with mighty woe supporting with his hands the heros head bends over the extended body of the dead the body decent on the appointed ground they place and heap the sylvan pile around but great achilles stands apart in prayer and from his head divides the yellow hair the curling locks which from his youth he vowed and sacred grew to sperchius honored flood then sighing to the deep his looks he cast and rolled his eyes around the watery waste sperchius whose waves in mazy errors lost delightful roll along my native coast to whom we vainly vowed at our return these locks to fall and hecatombs to burn full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice where to the day thy silver fountains rise and where in shade of consecrated bowers thy altars stand perfumed with native flowers so vowed my father but he vowed in vain no more achilles sees his native plain in that vain hope these hairs no longer grow patroclus bears them to the shades below thus over patroclus while the hero prayed on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid once more afresh the grecian sorrows flow and now the sun had set upon their woe but to the king of men thus spoke the chief enough atrides give the troops relief permit the mourning legions to retire and let the chiefs alone attend the pyre the pious care be ours the dead to burn  he said the people to their ships return while those deputed to inter the slain heap with a rising pyramid the plain a hundred foot in length a hundred wide the growing structure spreads on every side high on the top the manly corse they lay and wellfed sheep and sable oxen slay achilles covered with their fat the dead and the pild victims round the body spread then jars of honey and of fragrant oil suspends around lowbending over the pile four sprightly coursers with a deadly groan pour forth their lives and on the pyre are thrown of nine large dogs domestic at his board fall two selected to attend their lord then last of all and horrible to tell sad sacrifice twelve trojan captives fell on these the rage of fire victorious preys involves and joins them in one common blaze smeared with the bloody rites he stands on high and calls the spirit with a dreadful cry all hail patroclus let thy vengeful ghost hear and exult on plutos dreary coast behold achilles promise fully paid twelve trojan heroes offered to thy shade but heavier fates on hectors corse attend saved from the flames for hungry dogs to rend so spoke he threatening but the gods made vain his threat and guard inviolate the slain celestial venus hovered over his head and roseate unguents heavenly fragrance shed she watched him all the night and all the day and drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey nor sacred phoebus less employed his care he poured around a veil of gathered air and kept the nerves undryd the flesh entire against the solar beam and sirian fire nor yet the pile where dead patroclus lies smokes nor as yet the sullen flames arise but fast beside achilles stood in prayer invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air and victims promised and libations cast to gentle zephyr and the boreal blast he called the aerial powers along the skies to breathe and whisper to the fires to rise the winged iris heard the heros call and instant hastened to their airy hall where in old zephyrs open courts on high sat all the blustering brethren of the sky she shone amidst them on her painted bow the rocky pavement glittered with the show all from the banquet rise and each invites the various goddess to partake the rites not so the dame replied i haste to go to sacred ocean and the floods below even now our solemn hecatombs attend and heaven is feasting on the worlds green end with righteous aethiops uncorrupted train far on the extremest limits of the main but peleus son entreats with sacrifice the western spirit and the north to rise let on patroclus pile your blast be driven and bear the blazing honors high to heaven swift as the word she vanished from their view swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar and heaps on heaps the clouds are tossed before to the wide main then stooping from the skies the heaving deeps in watery mountains rise troy feels the blast along her shaking walls till on the pyle the gathered tempest falls the structure crackles in the roaring fires and all the night the plenteous flame aspires all night achilles hails patroclus soul with large libation from the golden bowl as a poor father helpless and undone mourns over the ashes of an only son takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn and pour in tears ever yet they close the urn so stayed achilles circling round the shore so watched the flames till now they flamed no more twas when emerging through the shades of night the morning planet told the approach of light and fast behind auroras warmer ray over the broad ocean poured the golden day then sunk the blaze the pyle no longer burned and to their caves the whistling winds returned across the thracian seas their course they bore the ruffled seas beneath their passage roar then parting from the pyle he ceased to weep and sunk to quiet in the embrace of sleep exhausted with his grief meanwhile the crowd of thronging grecians round achilles stood the tumult waked him from his eyes he shook unwilling slumber and the chiefs bespoke ye kings and princes of the achaian name first let us quench the yetremaining flame with sable wine then as the rites direct the heros bones with careful view select apart and easy to be known they lie amidst the heap and obvious to the eye the rest around the margins will be seen promiscuous steeds and immolated men these wrapped in double cauls of fat prepare and in the golden vase dispose with care there let them rest with decent honor laid till i shall follow to the infernal shade meantime erect the tomb with pious hands a common structure on the humble sands hereafter greece some nobler work may raise and late posterity record our praise the greeks obey where yet the embers glow wide over the pyle the sable wine they throw and deep subsides the ashy heap below next the white bones his sad companions place with tears collected in the golden vase the sacred relics to the tent they bore the urn a veil of linen covered over that done they bid the sepulcher aspire and cast the deep foundations round the pyre high in the midst they heap the swelling bed of rising earth memorial of the dead the swarming populace the chief detains and leads amidst a wide extent of plains there placed em round then from the ships proceeds a train of oxen mules and stately steeds vases and tripods for the funeral games resplendent brass and more resplendent dames first stood the prizes to reward the force of rapid racers in the dusty course a woman for the first in beautys bloom skilled in the needle and the laboring loom and a large vase where two bright handles rise of twenty measures its capacious size the second victor claims a mare unbroke big with a mule unknowing of the yoke the third a charger yet untouched by flame four ample measures held the shining frame two golden talents for the fourth were placed an ample double bowl contents the last these in fair order ranged upon the plain the hero rising thus addressed the train behold the prizes valiant greeks decreed to the brave rulers of the racing steed prizes which none beside our self could gain should our immortal coursers take the plain a race unrivaled which from oceans god peleus received and on his son bestowed but this no time our vigor to display nor suit with them the games of this sad day lost is patroclus now that wont to deck their flowing manes and sleek their glossy neck sad as they shared in human grief they stand and trail those graceful honors on the sand let others for the noble task prepare who trust the courser and the flying car fired at his word the rival racers rise but far the first eumelus hopes the prize famed through pieria for the fleetest breed and skilled to manage the highbounding steed with equal ardor bold tydides swelled the steeds of tros beneath his yoke compelled which late obeyed the dardan chiefs command when scarce a god redeemed him from his hand then menelaus his podargus brings and the famed courser of the king of kings whom rich echepolus more rich than brave to scape the wars to agamemnon gave  aethe her name at home to end his days base wealth preferring to eternal praise next him antilochus demands the course with beating heart and chears his pylian horse experienced nestor gives the son the reins directs his judgment and his heat restrains nor idly warns the hoary sire nor hears the prudent son with unattending ears my son though youthful ardor fire thy berast the gods have loved thee and with arts have blessed neptune and jove on thee conferred the skill swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel to guide thy conduct little precept needs but slow and past their vigor are my steeds fear not thy rivals though for swiftness known compare those rivals judgment and thy own it is not strength but art obtains the prize and to be swift is less than to be wise it is more by art than force of numerous strokes the dextrous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks by art the pilot through the boiling deep and howling tempest stears the fearless ship and it is the artist wins the glorious course not those who trust in chariots and in horse in vain unskilful to the goal they strive and short or wide thungovernd courser drive while with sure skill though with inferior steeds the knowing racer to his end proceeds fixed on the goal his eye foreruns the course his hand unerring steers the steady horse and now contracts or now extends the rein observing still the foremost on the plain mark then the goal it is easy to be found yon aged trunk a cubit from the ground of some oncestately oak the last remains or hardy fir unperishd with the rains enclosed with stones conspicuous from afar and round a circle for the wheeling car some tomb perhaps of old the dead to grace or then as now the limit of a race bear close to this and warily proceed a little bending to the left hand steed but urge the right and give him all the reins while thy strict hand his fellows head restrains and turns him short till doubling as they roll the wheels round naves appear to brush the goal yet not to break the car or lame the horse clear of the stony heap direct the course lest through incaution failing thou may be a joy to others a reproach to me so shall thou pass the goal secure of mind and leave unskilful swiftness far behind though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed which bore adrastus of celestial breed or the famed race through all the regions known that whirled the car of proud laomedon thus naught unsaid the muchadvising sage concludes then sat stiff with unwieldy age next bold meriones was seen to rise the last but not least ardent for the prize they mount their seats the lots their place dispose rolled in his helmet these achilles throws young nestor leads the race eumelus then and next the brother of the king of men thy lot meriones the fourth was cast and far the bravest diomed was last they stand in order an impatient train pelides points the barrier on the plain and sends before old phoenix to the place to mark the racers and to judge the race at once the coursers from the barrier bound the lifted scourges all at once resound their heart their eyes their voice they send before and up the champain thunder from the shore thick where they drive the dusty clouds arise and the lost courser in the whirlwind flies loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined float in their speed and dance upon the wind the smoking chariots rapid as they bound now seem to touch the sky and now the ground while hot for fame and conquest all their care each over his flying courser hung in air erect with ardour poised upon the rein they pant they stretch they shout along the plain now the last compass fetched around the goal at the near prize each gathers all his soul each burns with double hope with double pain tears up the shore and thunders towered the main first flew eumelus on pheretian steeds with those of tros bold diomed succeeds close on eumelus back they puff the wind and seem just mounting on his car behind full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze and hovering over their stretching shadows sees then had he lost or left a doubtful prize but angry phoebus to tydides flies strikes from his hand the scourge and renders vain his matchless horses labor on the plain rage fills his eye with anguish to survey snatched from his hope the glories of the day the fraud celestial pallas sees with pain springs to her knight and gives the scourge again and fills his steeds with vigor at a stroke she breaks his rivals chariot from the yoke no more their way the startled horses held the car reversed came ratling on the field shot headlong from his seat beside the wheel prone on the dust the unhappy master fell his battered face and elbows strike the ground nose mouth and front one undistinguished wound grief stops his voice a torrent drowns his eyes before him far the glad tydides flies minervas spirit drives his matchless pace and crowns him victor of the labored race the next though distant menelas succeeds while thus young nestor animates his steeds now now my generous pair exert your force not that we hope to match tydides horse since great minerva wings their rapid way and gives their lord the honors of the day but reach atrides shall his mare outgo your swiftness vanquished by a female foe through your neglect if lagging on the plain the last ignoble gift be all we gain no more shall nestors hand your food supply the old mans fury rises and ye die haste then yon narrow road before our sight presents the occasion could we use it right thus he the coursers at their masters threat with quicker steps the sounding champain beat and now antilochus with nice survey observes the compass of the hollow way twas where by force of wintry torrents torn fast by the road a precipice was worn here where but one could pass to shun the throng the spartan heros chariot smoked along close up the venurous youth resolves to keep still edging near and bears him towered the steep atrides trembling casts his eye below and wonders at the rashness of his foe hold stay your steeds  what madness thus to ride this narrow way take larger field he cried or both mull fall  atrides cried in vain he flies more fast and throws up all the rein far as an able arm the disk can send when youthful rivals their full force extend so far antilochus thy chariot flew before the king he cautious backward drew his horse compelled foreboding in his fears the rattling ruin of the clashing cars the floundring coursers rolling on the plain and conquest lost through frantic haste to gain but thus upbraids his rival as he flies go furious youth ungenrous and unwise go but expect not i will the prize resign add perjury to fraud and make it thine  then to his steeds with all his force he cries be swift be vigorous and regain the prize your rivals destitute of youthful force with fainting knees shall labor in the course and yield the glory yours  the steeds obey already at their heels they wing their way and seem already to retrieve the day meantime the grecians in a ring beheld the coursers bounding over the dusty field the first who markd them was the cretan king high on a rising ground above the ring the monarch sat from whence with sure survey he well observed the chief who led the way and heard from far his animating cries and saw the foremost steed with sharpened eyes on whose broad front a blaze of shining white like the full moon stood obvious to the sight he saw and rising to the greeks begun are yonder horse discerned by me alone or can ye all another chief survey and other steeds than lately led the way those though the swiftest by some god withheld lie sure disabled in the middle field for since the goal they doubled round the plain i search to find them but i search in vain perchance the reins forsook the drivers hand and turned too short he tumbled on the strand shot from the chariot while his coursers stray with frantic fury from the destined way rise then some other and inform my sight for these dim eyes perhaps discern not right yet sure he seems to judge by shape and air the great aetolian chief renowned in war old man  oileus rashly thus replies thy tongue too hastily confers the prize of those who view the course not sharpest eyed nor youngest yet the readiest to decide eumelus steeds highbounding in the chase still as at first unrivaled lead the race i well discern him as he shakes the rein and hear his shouts victorious over the plain thus he idomeneus incensed rejoined barbarous of words and arrogant of mind contentious prince of all the greeks beside the last in merit as the first in pride to vile reproach what answer can we make a goblet or a tripod let us stake and be the king the judge the most unwise will learn their rashness when they pay the price he said and ajax by mad passion born stern had replied fierce scorn inhancing scorn to fell extremes but thetis godlike son awful amidst them rose and thus begun forbear ye chiefs reproachful to contend much would ye blame should others thus offend and lo the approaching steeds your contest end no sooner had he spoke but thundering near drives through a stream of dust the charioteer high over his head the circling lash he wields his bounding horses scarcely touch the fields his car amidst the dusty whirlwind rolled bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold refulgent through the cloud no eye could find the track his flying wheels had left behind and the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace so swift it seemed a flight and not a race now victor at the goal tydides stands quits his bright car and springs upon the sands from the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream the wellplyd whip is hung athwart the beam with joy brave sthenelus receives the prize the tripodvase and dame with radiant eyes these to the ships his train triumphant leads the chief himself unyokes the panting steeds young nestor follows who by art not force oerpast atrides second in the course behind atrides urged the race or more near than to the courser in his swift career the following car just touching with his heel and brushing with his tail the whirling wheel such and so narrow now the space between the rivals late so distant on the green so soon swift aethe her lost ground regained one length one moment had the race obtained merion pursued at greater distance still with tardier coursers and inferior skill last came admetus thy unhappy son slow dragged the steeds his battered chariot on achilles saw and pitying thus begun behold the man whose matchless art surpast the sons of greece the ablest yet the last fortune denies but justice bids us pay since great tydides bears the first away to him the second honors of the day the greeks consent with loud applauding cries and then eumelus had received the prize but youthful nestor jealous of his fame the award opposes and asserts his claim think not he cries i tamely will resign o peleus son the mare so justly mine what if the gods the skilful to confound have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice and vows omitted forfeited the prize if yet distinction to thy friend to show and please a soul desirous to bestow some gift must grace eumelus view thy store of beauteous handmaids steeds and shining ore an ample present let him thence receive and greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give but this my prize i never shall forego this who but touches warriors is my foe thus spoke the youth nor did his words offend pleased with the wellturnd flattery of a friend achilles smiled the gift proposed he cried antilochus we shall our self provide with plates of brass the corselet covered over the same renowned asteropaeus wore whose glittering margins raised with silver shine no vulgar gift eumelus shall be thine he said automedon at his command the corselet brought and gave it to his hand distinguished by his friend his bosom glows with generous joy then menelaus rose the herald placed the scepter in his hands and stilled the clamor of the shouting bands not without cause incensed at nestors son and inly grieving thus the king begun the praise of wisdom in thy youth obtained an act so rash  antilochus has stained robbed of my glory and my just reward to you o grecians be my wrong declared so not a leader shall our conduct blame or judge me envious of a rivals fame but shall not we ourselves the truth maintain what needs appealing in a fact so plain what greek shall blame me if i bid thee rise and vindicate by oath thillgotten prize rise if thou dare before thy chariot stand the driving scourge highlifted in thy hand and touch thy steeds and swear thy whole intent was but to conquer not to circumvent swear by that god whose liquid arms surround the globe and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground the prudent chief with calm attention heard then mildly thus excuse if youth have erred superior as thou art forgive the offense nor i thy equal or in years or sense thou know the errors of unripend age weak are its counsels headlong is its rage the prize i quit if thou thy wrath resign the mare or ought thou askst be freely thine ever i become from thy dear friendship torn hateful to thee and to the gods forsworn so spoke antilochus and at the word the mare contested to the king restored joy swells his soul as when the vernal grain lifts the green ear above the springing plain the fields their vegetable life renew and laugh and glitter with the morning dew such joy the spartans shining face overspread and lifted his gay heart while thus he said still may our souls o generous youth agree it is now atrides turn to yield to thee rash heat perhaps a moment might control not break the settled temper of thy soul not but my friend it is still the wiser way to wave contention with superior sway for ah how few who should like thee offend like thee have talents to regain the friend to plead indulgence and thy fault atone suffice thy fathers merits and thy own generous alike for me the sire and son have greatly suffered and have greatly done i yield that all may know my soul can bend nor is my pride preferred before my friend he said and pleased his passion to command resigned the courser to noemons hand friend of the youthful chief himself content the shining charger to his vessel sent the golden talents merion next obtained the fifth reward the double bowl remained achilles this to reverend nestor bears and thus the purpose of his gift declares accept thou this o sacred sire he said in dear memorial of patroclus dead dead and for ever lost patroclus lies for ever snatched from our desiring eyes take thou this token of a grateful heart though it is not thine to hurl the distant dart the quoit to toss the ponderous mace to wield or urge the race or wrestle on the field thy present vigor age has overthrown but left the glory of the past thy own he said and placed the goblet at his side with joy the venerable king replied wisely and well my son thy words have proved a senior honored and a friend beloved too true it is deserted of my strength these withered arms and limbs have failed at length oh had i now that force i felt of yore known through buprasium and the pylian shore victorious then in every solemn game ordained to amarynces mighty name the brave epeians gave my glory way aetolians pylians all resigned the day i quelled clytomedes in fights of hand and backward hurled ancaeus on the sand surpast iphyclus in the swift career phyleus and polydorus with the spear the sons of actor won the prize of horse but won by numbers not by art or force for the famed twins impatient to survey prize after prize by nestor born away sprung to their car and with united pains one lashed the coursers while one ruled the reins such once i was now to these tasks succeeds a younger race that emulate our deeds i yield alas to age who must not yield though once the foremost hero of the field go thou my son by generous friendship led with martial honors decorate the dead while pleased i take the gift thy hands present pledge of benevolence and kind intent rejoiced of all the numerous greeks to see not one but honors sacred age and me those due distinctions thou so well can pay may the just gods return another day proud of the gift thus spoke the full of days achilles heard him prouder of the praise the prizes next are ordered to the field for the bold champions who the caestus wield a stately mule as yet by toils unbroke of six years age unconscious of the yoke is to the circus led and firmly bound next stands a goblet massy large and round achilles rising thus let greece excite two heroes equal to this hardy fight who dares his foe with lifted arms provoke and rush beneath the longdescending stroke on whom apollo shall the palm bestow and whom the greeks supreme by conquest know this mule his dauntless labors shall repay the vanquished bear the massy bowl away this dreadful combat great epaeus chose high over the crowd enormous bulk he rose and seized the beast and thus began to say stand forth some man to bear the bowl away price of his ruin for who dares deny this mule my right thundoubted victor i others it is owned in fields of battle shine but the first honors of this fight are mine for who excells in all then let my foe draw near but first his certain fortune know secure this hand shall his whole frame confound mash all his bones and all his body pound so let his friends be nigh a needful train to heave the battered carcass off the plain the giant spoke and in a stupid gaze the host beheld him silent with amaze twas thou euryalus who durst aspire to meet his might and emulate thy sire the great mecistheus who in days of yore in theban games the noblest trophy bore the games ordained dead oedipus to grace and singly vanquished the cadmaean race him great tydides urges to contend warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend officious with the cincture girds him round and to his wrists the gloves of death are bound amid the circle now each champion stands and poises high in air his iron hands with clashing gantlets now they fiercely close their crackling jaws reechoe to the blows and painful sweat from all their members flows at length epaeus dealt a weighty blow full on the cheek of his unwary foe beneath that ponderous arms resistless sway down dropped he nerveless and extended lay as a large fish when winds and waters roar by some huge billow dashed against the shore lies panting not less battered with his wound the bleeding hero pants upon the ground to rear his fallen foe the victor lends scornful his hand and gives him to his friends whose arms support him reeling through the throng and dragging his disabled legs along nodding his head hangs down his shoulder over his mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore wrapped round in mists he lies and lost to thought his friends receive the bowl too dearly bought the third bold game achilles next demands and calls the wrestlers to the level sands a massy tripod for the victor lies of twice six oxen its reputed price and next the losers spirits to restore a female captive valued but at four scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose when towrlike ajax and ulysses rose amid the ring each nervous rival stands embracing rigid with implicit hands close locked above their heads and arms are mixed below their planted feet at distance fixed like two strong rafters which the builder forms proof to the wintry winds and howling storms their tops connected but at wider space fixed on the center stands their solid base now to the grasp each manly body bends the humid sweat from every pore descends their bones resound with blows sides shoulders thighs swell to each gripe and bloody tumors rise nor could ulysses for his art renowned oerturn the strength of ajax on the ground nor could the strength of ajax overthrow the watchful caution of his artful foe while the long strife even tired the lookerson thus to ulysses spoke great telamon or let me lift thee chief or lift thou me prove we our force and jove the rest decree he said and straining heaved him off the ground with matchless strength that time ulysses found the strength tevade and where the nerves combine his ankle struck the giant fell supine ulysses following on his bosom lies shouts of applause run rattling through the skies ajax to lift ulysses next essays he barely stirred him but he could not raise his knee locked fast the foes attempt denied and grappling close they tumble side by side defiled with honorable dust they roll still breathing strife and unsubdud of soul again they rage again to combat rise when great achilles thus divides the prize your noble vigor oh my friends restrain nor weary out your generous strength in vain ye both have won let others who excel now prove that prowess you have proved so well the heros words the willing chiefs obey from their tired bodies wipe the dust away and clothed anew the following games survey and now succeed the gifts ordained to grace the youths contending in the rapid race a silver urn that full six measures held by none in weight or workmanship excelled sidonian artists taught the frame to shine elaborate with artifice divine whence tyrian sailors did the prize transport and gave to thoas at the lemnian port from him descended good eunaeus heird the glorious gift and for lycaon spared to brave patroclus gave the rich reward now the same heros funeral rites to grace it stands the prize of swiftness in the race a wellfed ox was for the second placed and half a talent must content the last achilles rising then bespoke the train who hopes the palm of swiftness to obtain stand forth and bear these prizes from the plain the hero said and starting from his place oilean ajax rises to the race ulysses next and he whose speed surpast his youthful equals nestors son the last ranged in a line the ready racers stand pelides points the barrier with his hand all start at once oileus led the race the next ulysses measring pace with pace behind him diligently close he sped as closely following as the running thread the spindle follows and displays the charms of the fair spinsters breast and moving arms graceful in motion thus his foe he plies and treads each footstep ever the dust can rise his glowing breath upon his shoulders plays thadmiring greeks loud acclamations raise to him they give their wishes hearts and eyes and send their souls before him as he flies now three times turned in prospect of the goal the panting chief to pallas lifts his soul assist o goddess thus in thought he prayed and present at his thought defcends the maid buoyed by her heavenly force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb all fierce and ready now the prize to gain unhappy ajax stumbles on the plain oerturnd by pallas where the slippery shore was clogged with slimy dung and mingled gore the selfsame place beside patroclus pyre where late the slaughtered victims fed the fire besmeared with filth and blotted over with clay obscene to sight the ruefull racer lay the wellfed bull the second prize he shared and left the urn ulysses rich reward then grasping by the horn the mighty beast the baffled hero thus the greeks addressed accursed fate the conquest i forego a mortal i a goddess was my foe she urged her favorite on the rapid way and pallas not ulysses won the day thus fowrly waild he sputtring dirt and gore a burst of laughter echoed through the shore antilochus more humrous than the rest takes the last prize and takes it with a jest why with our wiser elders should we strive the gods still love them and they always thrive ye see to ajax i must yield the prize he to ulysses still more aged and wise a green old age unconscious of decays that proves the hero born in better days behold his vigor in this active race achilles only boasts a swifter pace for who can match achilles he who can must yet be more than hero or than man the effect succeeds the speech pelides cries thy artful praise deserves a better prize nor greece in vain shall hear thy friend extolled receive a talent of the purest gold the youth departs content the hosts admire the son of nestor worthy of his sire next these a buckler spear and helm he brings cast on the plain the brazen burden rings arms which of late divine sarpedon wore and great patroclus in short triumph bore stand forth the bravest of our host he cries whoever dares deserve so rich a prize now grace the lists before our armys sight and sheathed in steel provoke his foe to fight who first the jointed armor shall explore and stain his rivals mail with issuing gore the sword asteropeus possessed of old a thracian blade distinct with studs of gold shall pay the stroke and grace the strikers side these arms in common let the chief divide for each brave champion when the combat ends a sumptuous banquet at our tent attends fierce at the word uprose great tydeus son and the huge bulk of ajax telamon clad in refulgent steel on either hand the dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand lowering they meet tremendous to the sight each argive bosom beats with fierce delight opposed in arms not long they idly stood but thrice they closed and thrice the charge renewed a furious pass the spear of ajax made through the broad shield but at the corselet stayed not thus the foe his javelin aimed above the bucklers margin at the neck he drove but greece now trembling for her heros life bade share the honors and surcease the strife yet still the victors due tydides gains with him the sword and studded belt remains then hurled the hero thundering on the ground a mass of iron an enormous round whose weight and size the circling greeks admire rude from the furnace and but shaped by fire this mighty quoit aetion wont to rear and from his whirling arm dismiss in air the giant by achilles slain he stowed among his spoils this memorable load for this he bids those nervous artists vie that teach the disk to sound along the sky let him whose might can hurl this bowl arise who farthest hurls it take it as his prize if he be one enriched with large domain of downs for flocks and arable for grain small stock of iron needs that man provide his hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied from hence nor ask the neighboring citys aid for plowshares wheels and all the rural trade stern polyphaetes stepped before the throng and great leonteus more than mortal strong whose force with rival forces to oppose uprose great ajax up epaeus rose each stood in order first epaeus threw high over the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew leonteus next a little space surpast and third the strength of godlike ajax cast over both their marks it flew till fiercely flung from polypaetes arm the discus sung far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws that distant falls among the grazing cows so past them all the rapid circle flies his friends while loud applauses shake the skies with force conjoined heave off the weighty prize those who in skilful archery contend he next invites the twanging bow to bend and twice ten axes casts amidst the round ten doubleedgd and ten that singly wound the mast which late a firstrate galley bore the hero fixes in the sandy shore to the tall top a milkwhite dove they tie the trembling mark at which their arrows fly whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird shall bear these twoedged axes terrible in war the single he whose shaft divides the cord he said experienced merion took the word and skilful teucer in the helm they threw their lots inscribed and forth the latter flew swift from the string the sounding arrow flies but flies unblest no grateful sacrifice no firstling lambs unheedful did thou vow to phoebus patron of the shaft and bow for this thy wellaimd arrow turned aside erred from the dove yet cut the cord that tied adown the mainmast fell the parted string and the free bird to heaven displays her wing seas shores and skies with loud applause resound and merion eager meditates the wound he takes the bow directs the shaft above and following with his eye the soaring dove implores the god to speed it through the skies with vows of firstling lambs and grateful sacrifice the dove in airy circles as she wheels amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels quite through and through the point its passage found and at his feet fell bloody to the ground the wounded bird ever yet she breathed her last with flagging wings alighted on the mast a moment hung and spread her pinions there then sudden dropped and left her life in air from the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise and to the ships brave merion bears the prize to close the

the glittering charger to talthybius hands observations on the twentythird book observations on the twentythird book i this and the following book which contain the description of the funeral of patroclus and other matters relating to hector are undoubtedly superadded to the grand catastrophe of the poem for the story is completely finished with the death of that hero in the   d book many judicious critics have been of opinion that homer is blameable for protracting it virgil closes the whole scene of action with the death of turnus and leaves the rest to be imagined by the mind of the reader he does not draw the picture at full length but delineates it so far that we cannot fail of imagining the whole draught there is however one thing to be said in favor of homer which may perhaps justify him in his method that what he undertook was to paint the anger of achilles and as that anger does not die with hector but persecutes his very remains so the poet still keeps up to his subject nay it seems to require that he should carry down the relation of that resentment which is the foundation of his poem till it is fully satisfied and as this survives hector and gives the poet an opportunity of still showing many sad effects of achilless anger the two following books may be thought not to be excrescencies but essential to the poem  virgil had been inexcusable had he trod in homers footsteps for it is evident that the fall of turnus by giving aeneas a full power over italy answers the whole design and intention of the poem had he gone farther he had overshot his mark and though homer proceeds after hectors death yet the subject is still the anger of achilles  we are now past the war and violence of the ilias the scenes of blood are closed during the rest of the poem we may look back with a pleasing kind of horror upon the anger of achilles and see what dire effects it has wrought in the compass of nineteen days troy and greece are both in mourning for it heaven and earth gods and men have suffered in the conflict the reader seems landed upon the shore after a violent storm and has leisure to survey the consequences of the tempest and the wreck occasioned by the former commotions troy weeping for hector and greece for patroclus our passions have been in an agitation since the opening of the poem wherefore the poet like some great master in music softens his notes and melts his readers into tenderness and pity  ii verse    tears bathe their arms and tears the sands bedew   thetis aids their woe   it is not easy to give a reason why thetis should be said to excite the grief of the myrmidons and of achilles it had seemed more natural for the mother to have composed the sorrows of the son and restored his troubled mind to tranquillity  but such a procedure would have outragd the character of achilles who is all along described to be of such a violence of temper that he is not easy to be pacified at any time much less upon so great an incident as the death of his friend patroclus perhaps the poet made use of this fiction in honor of achilles he makes every passion of his hero considerable his sorrow as well as anger is important and he cannot grieve but a goddess attends him and a whole army weeps  some commentators fancied that homer animates the very sands of the seas and the arms of the myrmidons and makes them sensible of the loss of patroclus the preceding words seem to strengthen that opinion because the poet introduces a goddess to raise the sorrow of the army but eustathius seems not to give into this conjecture and i think very judiciously for what relation is there between the sands of the shores and the arms of the myrmidons it would have been more poetical to have said the sands and the rocks than the sands and the arms but it is very natural to say that the soldiers wept so bitterly that their armor and the very sands were wet with their tears i believe this remark will appear very just by reading the verse with a comma after  thus   then the construction will be natural and easy period will answer period in the greek and the sense in english will be the sands were wet and the arms were wet with the tears of the mourners  but however this be there is a very remarkable beauty in the run of the verse in homer every word has a melancholy cadence and the poet has not only made the sands and the arms but even his very verse to lament with achilles  iii verse    his slaughtring hands yet red with blood he laid on his dead friends cold breast   i could not pass by this passage without observing to my reader the great beauty of this epithet  an ordinary poet would have contented himself with saying he laid his hand upon the breast of patroclus but homer knows how to raise the most trivial circumstance and by adding this one word he laid his deadly hands or his murderous hands on patroclus breast he fills our minds with great ideas and by a single epithet recalls to our thoughts all the noble achievements of achilles through the iliad  iv verse    all hail patroclus etc there is in this apostrophe of achilles to the ghost of patroclus a sort of savageness and a mixture of softness and atrocity which are highly conformable to his character dacier  v verse    to cleanse his conquering hands   the chief refused   this is conformable to the custom of the orientals achilles will not be induced to wash and afterward retires to the seashore and sleeps on the ground it is just thus that david mourns in the scriptures he refuses to wash or to take any repast but retires from company and lies upon the earth  vi verse    the ghost of patroclus homer has introduced into the former parts of the poem the personages of gods and goddesses from heaven and of furies from hell he has embellished it with ornaments from earth sea and air and he here opens a new scene and brings to the view a ghost the shade of the departed friend by these methods he diversifies his poem with new and surprising circumstances and awakens the attention of the reader at the same time he very poetically adapts his language to the circumstances of this imaginary patroclus and teaches us the opinions that prevailed in his time concerning the state of separate souls  vii verse    forbid to pass thirremeable flood it was the common opinion of the ancients that the souls of the departed were not admitted into the number of the happy till their bodies had received the funeral rites they supposed those that wanted them wandered an hundred years before they were wafted over the infernal river virgil perhaps had this passage of homer in his view in the sixth aeneis at least he coincides with his sentiments concerning the state of the departed souls haec omnis quam cernis inops inhumataque turba est nec ripas datur horrendas nec rauca fluenta transportare prius quam sedibus ossa quierunt centum errant annos volitantque haec littora circum tum demum admissi stagna exoptata revisunt it was during this interval between their death and the rites of funeral that they supposed the only time allowed for separate spirits to appear to men therefore patroclus here tells his friend  to the farther shore when once we pass the soul returns no more   for the fuller understanding of homer it is necessary to be acquainted with his notion of the state of the soul after death he followed the philosophy of the egyptians who supposed man to be compounded of three parts an intelligent mind a vehicle for that mind and a body the mind they called  or  the vehicle  image or soul and the gross body  the soul in which the mind was lodged was supposed exactly to resemble the body in shape magnitude and features for this being in the body as the statue in its mold so soon as it goes forth is properly the image of that body in which it was enclosed this it was that appeared to achilles with the full resemblance of his friend patroclus vid dacier on the life of pythagoras p     viii verse  0  may mix our ashes in one common grave there is something very pathetical in this whole speech of patroclus he begins it with kind reproaches and blames achilles with a friendly tenderness he recounts to him the inseparable affection that had been between them in their lives and makes it his last request that they may not be parted even in death but that their bones may rest in the same urn the speech itself is of a due length it ought not to be very short because this apparition is an incident entirely different from any other in the whole poem and consequently the reader would not have been satisfied with a cursory mention of it neither ought it to be long because this would have been contrary to the nature of such apparitions whose stay upon earth has ever been described as very short and consequently they cannot be supposed to use many words  the circumstance of being buried in the same urn is entirely conformable to the eastern custom there are innumerable instances in the scriptures of great personages being buried with their fathers so joseph would not suffer his bones to rest in egypt but commands his brethren to carry them into canaan to the buryingplace of his father jacob  ix verse     the form subsists without the bodys aid aerial semblance and an empty shade the words of homer are  in which there seems to be a great difficulty it being not casy to explain how achilles can say that the ghost of his friend had no understanding when it had but just made such a rational and moving speech especially when the poet introduces the apparition with the very shape air and voice of patroclus  but this passage will be clearly understood by explaining the notion which the ancients entertained of the souls of the departed according to the forecited triple division of mind image and body they imagined that the soul was not only separated from the body at the hour of death but that there was a farther separation of the  or understanding from its  or vehicle so that while the  or image of the body was in hell the  or understanding might be in heaven and that this is a true explication is evident from a passage in the odysseis book     00    now i the strength of hercules behold a towering spectre of gigantick mold a shadowy form for high in heavens abodes himself resides a god among the gods there in the bright assemblies of the skies he nectar quaffs and hebe crowns with joys by this it appears that homer was of opinion that hercules was in heaven while his  or image was in hell so that when this second separation is made the image or vehicle becomes a mere thoughtless form  we have this whole doctrine very distinctly delivered by plutarch in these words man is a compound subject but not of two parts as is commonly believed because the understanding is generally accounted a part of the soul whereas indeed it as far exceeds the soul as the soul is diviner than the body now the soul when compounded with the understanding makes reason and when compounded with the body passion whereof the one is the source or principle of pleasure or pain the other of vice or virtue man therefore properly dies two deaths the first death makes him two of three and the second makes him one of two plutarch of the face in the moon  x verse     over hills over dales over rocks over crags they go  on all sides round the forest hurls her oaks headlong   the numbers in the original of this whole passage are admirably adapted to the images the verses convey to us every ear must have felt the propriety of sound in this line  that other in its kind is no less exact    dionysius of halicarnassus has collected many instances of these sorts of beauties in homer this description of felling the forests so excellent as it is is comprehended in a few lines which has left room for a larger and more particular one in statius one of the best i think in that author  cadit ardua fagus chaoniumque nemus brumaeque illaesa cupressus procumbunt piceae flammis alimenta supremis ornique iliceaeque trabes metuendaque sulco taxus and infandos belli potura cruores fraxinus atque situ non expugnabile robur hinc audax abies and odorae vulnere pinus scinditur acclinant intonsa cacumina terrae alnus amica fretis nec inhospita vitibus ulmus etc i the rather cite this fine passage because i find it copied by two of the greatest poets

round the carver holme the maple seldom inward sound   xi verse     each in refulgent arms etc   it is not to be supposed that this was a general custom used at all funerals but patroclus being a warrior he is buried like a soldier with military honors eustathius  xii verse     over all the corse their scatterd locks they throw the ceremony of cutting off the hair in honor of the dead was practiced not only among the greeks but also among other nations thus statius thebaid vi  tergoque and pectore fusam caesariem ferro minuit sectisque jacentis obnubit tenuia ora comis this custom is taken notice of in holy scripture ezekiel describing a great lamentation says they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee chapter       i believe it was done not only in token of sorrow but perhaps had a concealed meaning that as the hair was cut from the head and was never more to be joined to it so was the dead for ever cut off from the living never more to return  i must just observe that this ceremony of cutting off the hair was not always in token of sorrow lycophron in his cassandra     describing a general lamentation says  a length of unshorn hair adorned their backs and that the ancients sometimes had their hair cut off in token of joy is evident from juvenal sat        gaudent ibi vertice raso garrula securi narrare pericula nautae this seeming contradiction will be solved by having respect to the different practices of different nations if it was the general custom of any country to wear long hair then the cutting it off was a token of sorrow but if it was the custom to wear short hair then the letting it grow long and neglecting it showed that such people were mourners  xiii verse     supporting with his hands the heros head achilles follows the corpse as chief mourner and sustains the head of his friend this last circumstance seems to be neral thus euripides in the funeral of rhesus        what god o king with his hands supports the head of the deceased  xiv verse     and sacred grew to sperchius honored flood it was the custom of the ancients not only to offer their own hair but likewise to consecrate that of their children to the rivergods of their country this is what pausanias shows in his attics before you pass the cephisa says he you find the tomb of theodorus who was the most excellent actor of his time for tragedy and on the banks you see two statues one of mnesimachus and the other of his son who cut off his hair in honor of the rivers for that this was in all ages the custom of the greeks may be inferred from homer s poetry where peleus promises by a solemn vow to consecrate to the river sperchius the hair of his son if he returns safe from the trojan war this custom was likewise in egypt where philostratus tells us that memnon consecrated his hair to the nile this practice of achilles was imitated by alexander at the funeral of hephaestion spondanus  xv veres     celestial venus etc homer has here introduced a series of allegories in the compass of a few lines the body of hector may be supposed to have continued beautiful even after he was slain and venus being the president of beauty the poet by a natural fiction tells us it was preserved by that goddess  apollos covering the body with a cloud is a very natural allegory for the sun says eustathius has a double quality which produces contrary effects the heat of it causes a dryness but at the same time it exhales the vapors of the earth from whence the clouds of heaven are formed this allegory may be founded upon truth there might happen to be a cool season while hector lay unburied and apollo or the sun raising clouds which intercept the heat of his beams by a very easy fiction in poetry may be introduced in person to preserve the body of hector  xvi verse     the allegory of the winds a poet ought to express nothing vulgarly and sure no poet ever trespassed less against this rule than homer the fruitfulness of his invention is continually raising incidents new and surprising take this passage out of its poetical dress and it will be no more than this a strong gale of wind blew and so increased the flame that it soon consumed the pile but homer introduces the gods of the winds in person and iris or the rainbow being as eustathius observes a sign not only of showers but of winds he makes them come at her summons  every circumstance is well adapted as soon as the winds see iris they rise that is when the rainbow appears the the wind rises she refuses to sit and immediately returns that is the rainbow is never seen long at one time but soon appears and soon vanishes she returns over the ocean that is the bow is composed of waters and it would have been an unnatural fiction to have described her as passing by land  the winds are all together in the cave of zephyrus which may imply that they were there as at their general rendezvous or that the nature of all the winds is the same or that the western wind is in that country the most constant and consequently it may be said that at such seasons all the winds are assembled in one corner or rendezvous with zephyrus  iris will not enter the cave it is the nature of the rainbow to be stretched entirely upon the surface and therefore this fiction is agreeable to reason  when iris says that the gods are partaking hecatombs in aethiopia it is to be remembered that the gods are represented there in the first book before the scenes of war were opened and now they are closed they return thither eustathius  thus homer makes the anger of his hero so important that it roused heaven to arms and now when it is almost appeased achilles as it were gives peace to the gods  xvii verse  0  hereafter greece a nobler pyle shall raise we see how achilles consults his own glory the desire of it prevails over his tenderness for patroclus and he will not permit any man not even his beloved patroclus to share an equality of honor with himself even in the grave eustathius  xviii verse   0 the games for patroclus the conduct of homer in enlarging upon the games at the funeral of patroclus is very judicious there had undoubtedly been such honors paid to several heroes during this war as appears from a passage in the ninth book where agamemnon to enhance the value of the horses which he offers achilles says that any person would be rich that had treasures equal to the value of the prizes they had won which races must have been run during the seige for had they been before it the horses would now have been too old to be of any value this being the tenth year of the war but he poet passes all those games over in silence and reserves them for this season not only in honor of patroclus but also of his hero achilles who exhibits games to a whole army great generals are candidates for the prizes and he himself sits the judge and arbitrator thus in peace as well as war the poet maintains the superiority of the character of achilles  but there is another reason why the poet deferred to relate any games that were exhibited at any preceding funerals the death of patroclus was the most eminent period and consequently the most proper time for such games  it is farther observable that he chooses this peculiar time with great judgment when the fury of the war raged the army could not well have found leisure for the games and they might have met with interruption from the enemy but hector being dead all troy is in confusion they are in too great a consternation to make any attempts and therefore the poet could not possibly have chosen a more happy opportunity eustathius  xix verse     lost is patroclus now etc i am not ignorant that homer has frequently been blamed for such little digressions as these in this passage he gives us the genealogy of his horses which he has frequently told us in the preceding part of the poem but eustathius justifies his conduct and says that it was very proper to commend the virtue of these horses upon this occasion when horses were to contend for victory at the same time he takes an opportunity to make an honorable mention of his friend patroclus in whose honor these games were exhibited  it may be added as a farther justification of homer that this last circumstance is very natural achilles while he commends his horses remembers how careful patroclus had been of them his love for his friend is so great that the minutest circumstance recalls him to his mind and such little digressions such avocations of thought as these very naturally proceed from the overflows of love and sorrow  xx verse     whom rich echepolus etc one would think that agamemnon might be accused of avarice in dispensing a man from going to the war for the sake of a horse but aristotle very well observes that this prince is praiseworthy for having preferred a horse to a person so cowardly and so incapable of service it may also be conjectured from this passage that even in those elder times it was the custom that those who were willing to be excused from the war should give either a horse or a man and often both thus scipio going to africa ordered the sicilians either to attend him or to give him horses or men and agesilaus being at ephesus and wanting cavalry made a proclamation that the rich men who would not serve in the war should be dispensed with provided they furnished a man and a horse in their stead in which says plutarch he wisely followed the example of king agamemnon who excused a very rich coward from serving in person for a present of a good mare eustathius dacier  xxi verse     experienced nestor etc the poet omits no opportunity of paying honor to his old favorite nestor and i think he is no where more particularly complemented than in this book his age had disabled him from bearing any share in the games and yet he artfully introduces him not as a mere spectator but as an actor in the sports thus he as it were wins the prize for antilochus antilochus wins not by the swiftness of his horses but by the wisdom of nestor  this fatherly tenderness is wonderfully natural we see him in all imaginable inquietude and concern for his son he comes to the barrier stands beside the chariot animates his son by his praises and directs him by his lessons you think the old mans soul mounts on the chariot with his antilochus to partake the same dangers and run the same career  nothing can be better adapted to the character than this speech he expatiates upon the advantages of wisdom over strength which is a tacit complement to himself and had there been a prize for wisdom undoubtedly the old man would have claimed it as his right eustathius  xxii verse     the lots their place dispose according to these lots the charioteers took their places but to know whether they stood all in an equal front or one behind the other is a difficulty eustathius says the ancients were of opinion that they did not stand in one front because it is evident that he who had the first lot had a great advantage of the other charioteers if he had not why should achilles cast lots madam dacier is of opinion that they all stood abreast at the barrier and that the first would still have a sufficient advantage as he was nearer the bound and stood within the rest whereas the others must take a larger circle and consequently were forced to run a greater compass of ground phoenix was placed as an inspector of the race that is says eustathius he was to make report whether they had observed the laws of the race in their several turnings  sophocles observes the same method with homer in relation to the lots and inspectors in his electra    the constituted judges assigned the places according to the lots the ancients say that the charioteers started at the sigaeum where the ships of achilles lay and ran toward the rhaeteum from the ships toward the shores but aristarchus affirmed that they run in the compass of ground of five stadia which lay between the wall and the tents toward the shore eustathius  xxiii verse     and seem just mounting on his car behind a more natural image than this could not be thought of the poet makes us spectators of the race we see diomed pressing upon eumelus so closely that his chariot seems to climb the chariot of eumelus  xxiv verse     rage fills his eye with anguish to survey etc we have seen diomed surrounded with innumerable dangers acting in the most perilous scenes of blood and death yet never shed one tear and now he weeps on a small occasion for a mere trifle this must be ascribed to the nature of mankind who are often transported with trifles and there are certain unguarded moments in every mans life so that he who could meet the greatest dangers with intrepidity may through anger be betrayed into an indecency eustathius  the reason why apollo is angry at diomed according to eustathius is because he was interested for eumelus whose mares he had fed when he served admetus but i fancy he is under a mistake this indeed is a reason why he should favor eumelus but not why he should be angry at diomed i rather think that the quarrel of apollo with diomed was personal because he offered him a violence in the first book and apollo still resents it  the fiction of minervas assisting diomed is grounded upon his being so wise as to take a couple of whips to prevent any mischance so that wisdom or pallas may be said to lend him one eustathius  xxv verse     the speech of antilochus to his horses i fear antilochus his speech to his horses is blameable eustathius himself seems to think it a fault that he should speak so much in the very heat of the race he commands and sooths counsels and threatens his horses as if they were reasonable creatures the subsequent speech of menelaus is more excusable as it is more short but both of them are spoken in a passion and anger we know makes us speak to every thing and we discharge it upon the most senseless objects  xxvi verse     the dispute between idomeneus and ajax nothing could be more naturally imagined than this contention at a horserace the leaders were divided into parties and each was interested for his friend the poet had a twofold design not only to embellish and diversity his poem by such natural circumstances but also to show us as eustathius observes from the conduct of ajax that passionate men betray themselves into follies and are themselves guilty of the faults of which they accuse others  it is with a particular decency that homer makes achilles the arbitrator between idomeneus and ajax agamemnon was his superior in the army but as achilles exhibited the shows he was the proper judge of any difference that should arise about them had the contest been between ajax and idomeneus considered as soldiers the cause must have been brought before agamemnon but as they are to be considered as spectators of the games they ought to be determined by achilles  it may not be unnecessary just to observe to the reader the judiciousness of homers conduct in making achilles exhibit the games and not agamemnon achilles is the hero of the poem and consequently must be the chief actor in all the great scenes of it he had remained inactive during a great part of the poem yet the poet makes his very inactivity contribute to the carrying on the design of his ilias and to supply his absence from many of the busy scenes of the preceding parts of it he now in the conclusion makes him almost the sole agent by these means he leaves a noble idea of his hero upon the mind of his reader and as he raised our expectations when he brought him upon the stage of action so he makes him go off with the utmost pomp and applause  xxvii verse   0 high over his head the circling lash he wields i am persuaded that the common translation of the word  in the original of this verse is faulty it is rendered he lashed the horses continually over the shoulders whereas i fancy it should be translated thus assidue equos agitabat scutica ab humero ducta this naturally expresses the very action and whirl of the whip over the drivers shoulder in the act of lashing the horses and agrees with the use of the same word in the    st line of this book where  must be translated jactus disci ab humero vibrati  xxviii verse     fortune denies but justice etc achilles here intends to show that it is not just fortune should rule over virtue but that a brave man who had performed his duty and who did not bring upon himself his misfortune ought to have the recompense he has deserved and this principle is just provided we do not reward him at the expense of anothers right eumelus is a thessalian and it is probable achilles has a partiality to his countryman dacier  xxix verse     but this my prize i never shall forego  there is an air of bravery in this discourse of antilochus he speaks with the generosity of a gallant soldier and prefers his honor to his interest he tells achilles if he pleases he may make eumelus a richer present than his prize he is not concerned for the value of it but as it was the reward of victory he would not resign it because that would be an acknowledgment that eumelus deserved it  the character of antilochus is admirably sustained through this whole episode he is a very sensible man but transported with youthful heat and ambitious of glory his rashness in driving so furiously against menelaus must be imputed to this but his passions being gratified by the conquest in the race his reason again returns he owns his error and is full of resignation to menelaus  xxx verse     and touch the steeds and swear   it is evident says eustathius from hence that all fraud was forbid in the chariotrace but it is not very plain what unlawful deceit antilochus used against menelaus perhaps antilochus in his haste had declined from the raceground and avoided some of the uneven places of it and consequently took an unfair advantage of his adversary or perhaps his driving so furiously against menelaus as to endanger both their chariots and their lives might be reckoned foul play and therefore antilochus refuses to take the oath  xxxi verse     joy swells his soul as when the vernal grain etc eustathius is very large in the explication of this similitude which at the first view seems obscure his words are these  as the dew raises the blades of corn that are for want of it weak and depressed and by pervading the pores of the corn animates and makes it flourish so did the behavior of antilochus raise the dejected mind of menelaus exalt his spirits and restore him to a full satisfaction  i have given the reader his interpretation and translated it with the liberty of poetry it is very much in the language of scripture and in the spirit of the orientals  xxxii verse  0  accept thou this o sacred sire the poet in my opinion preserves a great deal of decency toward this old hero and venerable counselor he gives him an honorary reward for his superior wisdom and therefore achilles calls it  and not  a prize and not a present the moral of homer is that princes ought no less to honor and recompense those who excel in wisdom and counsel than those who are capable of actual service  achilles perhaps had a double view in paying him this respect not only out of deference to his age and wisdom but also because he had in a manner won the prize by the advice he gave his son so that nestor may be said to have conquered in the person of antilochus eustathius  xxxiii verse     nestor s speech to achilles this speech is admirably well adapted to the character of nestor he aggrandizes with an infirmity peculiar to age his own exploits and one would think horace had him in his eye  laudatur temporis acti se puero  neither is it any blemish to the character of nestor thus to be a little talkative about his own achievements to have described him otherwise would have been an outrage to human nature in as much as the wisest man living is not free from the infirmities of man and as every stage of life has some imperfection peculiar to it self     the reader may observe that the old man takes abundance of pains to give reasons how his rivals came to be victors in the chariotrace he is very solicitous to make it appear that it was not through any want of skill or power in himself and in my opinion nestor is never more vainglorious than in this recital of his own disappointment  it is for the same reason he repeats the words i have cited above he obtrudes by that repetition the disadvantages under which he labored upon the observation of the reader for fear he should impute the loss of the victory to his want of skill  nestor says that these moliones overpowered him by their number the critics as eustathius remarks have labored hard to explain this difficulty they tell us a formal story that when nestor was ready to enter the lists against these brothers he objected against them as unfair adversaries for it must be remembered that they were monsters that grew together and consequently had four hands to nestors two but the judges would not allow his plea but determined that as they grew together so they ought to be considered as one man  others tell us that they brought several chariots into the lists whose charioteers combined together in favor of eurytus and cteatus these brothermonsters  others say that the multitude of the spectators conspired to disappoint nestor  i thought it necessary to give my reader these several conjectures that he might understand why nestor says he was overpowered by  or numbers and also because it confirms my former observation that nestor is very careful to draw his own picture in the strongest colors and to show it in the fairest light  xxxiv verse   0 a female captive valued but at four i cannot in civility neglect a remark made upon this passage by madam dacier who highly resents the affront put upon her sex by the ancients who set it seems thrice the value upon a tripod as upon a beautiful female slave nay she is afraid the value of women is not raised even in our days for she says there are curious persons now living who had rather have a true antique kettle than the finest woman alive i confess i entirely agree with the lady and must impute such opinions of the fair sex to want of taste in both ancients and moderns the reader may remember that these tripods were of no use but made entirely for show and consequently the most satirical critic could only say the woman and tripod ought to have born an equal value  xxxv verse     like two strong rafters etc i will give the reader the words of eustathius upon this similitude which very happily represents the wrestlers in the posture of wrestling their heads leaned one against the other like the rafters that support the roof of a house at the foot they are disjoined and stand at a greater distance which naturally paints the attitude of body in these two wrestlers while they contend for victory  xxxvi verse   0 he barely stirred him but he could not raise the poet by this circumstance excellently maintains the character of ajax who has all along been described as a strong unweildy warrior he is so heavy that ulysses can scarce lift him the words that follow will bear a different meaning either that ajax locked his leg within that of ulysses or that ulysses did it eustathius observes that if ajax gave ulysses this shock then he may be allowed to have some appearance of an equality in the contest but if ulysses gave it then ajax must be acknowledged to have been foiled but continues he it appeared to be otherwise to achilles who was the judge of the field and therefore he gives them an equal prize because they were equal in the contest  madam dacier misrepresents eustathius on this place in saying he thinks it was ulysses who gave this second stroke to ajax whereas it appears by the foregoing note that he rather determines otherwise in consent with the judgment given by achilles  xxxvii verse  0  assist o goddess thus in thought he prayed nothing could be better adapted to the present circumstance of ulysses than this prayer it is short and ought to be so because the time would not allow him to make a longer nay he prefers this petition mentally  all his faculties are so bent upon the race that he does not call off his attention from it even to speak so short a petition as seven words which comprehend the whole of it such passages as these are instances of great judgment in the poet  xxxviii verse     and takes it with a jest antilochus comes off very well and wittily prevents raillery by attributing the victory of his rivals to the protection which the gods gave to age by this he insinuates that he has something to comfort himself with for youth is better than the prize and that he may pretend hereafter to the same protection since it is a privilege of seniority dacier  xxxix verse     for who can match achilles there is great art in these transient complements to achilles that hero could not possibly show his own superiority in these games by contending for any of the prizes because he was the exhibiter of the sports but homer has found out a way to give him the victory in two of them in the chariotrace achilles is represented as being able to conquer every opponent and though he speaks it himself the poet brings it in so happily that he speaks it without any indecency and in this place antilochus with a very good grace tells achilles that in the footrace no one can dispute the prize with him thus though diomed and ulysses conquer in the chariot and footrace it is only because achilles is not their antagonist  xl verse     who first the jointed armor shall explore some of the ancients have been shocked at this combat thinking it a barbarity that men in sport should thus contend for their lives and therefore aristophanes the grammarian made this alteration in the verses   etc but it is evident that they entirely mistook the meaning and intention of achilles for he that gave the first wound was to be accounted the victor how could achilles promise to entertain them both in his tent after the combat if he intended that one of them should fall in it this duel therefore was only a trial of skill and as such single combats were frequent in the wars of those ages against adversaries so this was proposed only to show the dexterity of the combatants in that exercise eustathius  xli verse     yet still the victors due tydides gains achilles in this place acts the part of a very just arbitrator though the combat did not proceed to a full issue yet diomed had evidently the advantage and consequently ought to be rewarded as victor because he would have been victorious had not the greeks interposed  i could have wished that the poet had given ajax the prize in some of these contests he undoubtedly was a very gallant soldier and has been described as repulsing a whole army yet in all these sports he is foiled but perhaps the poet had a double view in this representation not only to show that strength without conduct is usually unsuccessful but also his design might be to complement the greeks his countrymen by showing that this ajax who had repelled a whole army of trojans was not able to conquer any one of the grecian worthies for we find him overpowered in three of these exercises  xlii verse     if he be one enriched etc the poet in this place speaks in the simplicity of ancient times the prodigious weight and size of the quoit is described with a noble plainness peculiar to the oriental way and agreeable to the manners of those heroic ages he does not set down the quantity of this enormous piece of iron neither as to its bigness nor weight but as to the use it will be of to him who shall gain it we see from hence that the ancients in the prizes they proposed had in view not only the honorable but the useful a captive for work a bull for tillage a quoit for the provision of iron besides it must be remembered that in those times iron was very scarce and a sure sign of this scarcity is that their arms were brass eustath dacier  xliii verse  0   he takes the bow there having been many editions of homer that of marseilles represents these two rivals in archery as using two bows in the contest and reads the verses thus   our common editions follow the better alteration of antimachus with this only difference that he reads it  and they  it is evident that these archers had but one bow as they that threw the quoit had but one quoit by these means the one had no advantage over the other because both of them shot with the same bow so that the common reading is undoubtedly the best where the lines stand thus   eustath this teucer is the most eminent man for archery of any through the whole iliad yet he is here excelled by meriones and the poet ascribes his miscarriage to the neglect of invoking apollo the god of archery whereas meriones who invokes him is crowned with success there is an excellent moral in this passage and the poet would teach us that without addressing to heaven we cannot succeed meriones does not conquer because he is the better archer but because he is the better man  xliv verse  0   nor here disdained the king of men to rise there is an admirable conduct in this passage agamemnon never contended for any of the former prizes though of much greater value so that he is a candidate for this only to honor patroclus and achilles the decency which the poet uses both in the choice of the game in which agamemnon is about to contend and the giving him the prize without a contest is very remarkable the game was a warlike exercise fit for the general of an army the giving him the prize without a contest is a decency judiciously observed because no one ought to be supposed to excel the general in any military art agamemnon does justice to his own character for whereas he had been represented by achilles in the opening of the poem as a covetous person he now puts in for the prize that is of the least value and generously gives even that to talthybius eustathius  as to this last particular of agamemnons presenting the charger to talthybius i cannot but be of a different opinion it had been an affront to achilles not to have accepted of his present on this occasion and i believe the words of homer  mean no more than that he put it into the hands of this herald to carry it to his ships talthybius being by his office an attendant upon agamemnon  xlv it will be expected i should here say something tending to a comparison between the games of homer and those of virgil if i may own my private opinion there is in general more variety of natural incidents and a more lively picture of natural passions in the games and persons of homer on the other hand there seems to me more art contrivance gradation and a greater pomp of verse in those of virgil the chariotrace is that which homer has most labored of which virgil being sensible he judiciously avoided the imitation of what he could not improve and substituted in its place the navalcourse or shiprace it is in this the roman poet has employed all his force as if on set purpose to rival his great master but it is extremely observable how constantly he keeps homer in his eye and is afraid to depart from his very track even when he had varied the subject itself accordingly the accidents of the navalcourse have a strange resemblance with those of homers chariotrace he could not forbear at the very beginning to draw a part of that description into a simile do not we see he has homers chariots in his head by these lines non tam praecipites bijugo certamine campum corripuere ruuntque effusi carcere currus nec sic immissis aurigae undantia lora concussere jugis pronique in verbera pendent aen v     what is the encounter of cloanthus and gyas in the strait between the rocks but the same with that of menelaus and antilochus in the hollow way had the galley of sergestus been broken if the chariot of eumelus had not been demolished or mnestheus been cast from the helm had not the other been thrown from his seat does not mnestheus exhort his rowers in the very words antilochus had used to his horses non jamprima peto mnestheus neque vincere cesto quamquam o sed superent quibus hoc neptune dedisti extremos pudeat rediisse hoc vincite cives etprohibete nefas           upon the whole the description of the searace i think has the more poetry and majesty that of the chariots more nature and lively incidents there is nothing in virgil so picturesque so animated or which so much marks the characters as the episodes of antilochus and menelaus ajax and idomeneus with that beautiful interposition of old nestor so naturally introduced into an affair where one so little expects him on the other side in virgil the description itself is much nobler it has something more ostentatiously grand and seems a spectacle more worthy the presence of princes and great persons  in three other games we find the roman poet contending openly with the grecian that of the caestus is in great part a verbal translation but it must be owned in favor of virgil that he has varied from homer in the event of the combat with admirable judgment and with an improvement of the moral epaeus and dares are described by both poets as vain boasters but virgil with more poetical justice punishes dares for his arrogance whereas the presumption and pride of epaeus is rewarded by homer  on the contrary in the footrace i am of opinion that homer has shown more judgment and morality than virgil nisus in the latter is unjust to his adversary in favor of his friend euryalus so that euryalus wins the race by palpable fraud and yet the poet gives him the first prize whereas homer makes ulysses victorious purely through the mischance of ajax and his own piety in invoking minerva  the shooting is also a direct copy but with the addition of two circumstances which make a beautiful gradation in homer the first archer cuts the string that held the bird and the other shoots him as he is mounting in virgil the first only hits the mast which the bird was fixed upon the second cuts the string the third shoots him and the fourth to vaunt the strength of his arm directs his arrow up to heaven where it kindles into a flame and makes a prodigy this last is certainly superior to homer in what they call the wonderful but what is the intent or effect of this prodigy or whether a reader is not at least as much surprised at it as at the most unreasonable parts in homer i leave to those critics who are more inclined to find faults than i am nor shall i observe upon the many literal imitations in the roman poet to object against which were to derogate from the merit of those fine passages which virgil was so very sensible of that he was resolved to take them at any rate to himself  there remain in homer three games untouched by virgil the wrestling the single combat and the discus in virgil there is only the lusus trojae added which is purely his own and must be confessed to be inimitable i dont know whether i may be allowed to say it is worth all those three of homer  i could not forgive my self if i omitted to mention in this place the funeral games in the sixth thebaid of statius it is by much the most beautiful book of that poem it is very remarkable that he has followed homer through the whole course of his games there is the chariotrace the footrace the discus the caestus the wrestling the single combat which is put off in the same manner as in homer and the shooting which last ends as in virgil with a prodigy yet in the particular descriptions of each of these games this poet has not borrowed from either of his predecessors and his poem is so much the worse for it  the twentyfourth book of the iliad the argument the redemption of the body of hector the gods deliberate about the redemption of hector jupiter sends thetis to achilles to dispose him for the restoring it and iris to priam to encourage him to go in person and treat for it the old king notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen makes ready for the journey to which he is encouraged by an omen from jupiter he sets forth in his chariot with a wagon loaded with presents under the charge of idaeus the herald mercury descends in the shape of a young man and conducts him to the pavilion of achilles their conversation on the way priam finds achilles at his table casts himself at his feet and begs for the body of his son achilles moved with compassion grants his request detains him one night in his tent and the next morning sends him home with the body the trojans run out to meet him the lamentations of andromache hecuba and helen with the solemnities of the funeral  the time of twelve days is employed in this book while the body of hector lies in the tent of achilles and as many more are spent in the truce allowed for his interment the scene is partly in achilless camp and partly in troy  the twentyfourth book of the iliad now from the finished games the grecian band sought their black ships and cleared the crowded strand all stretched at ease the genial banquet share and pleasing slumbers quiet all their care not so achilles he to grief resigned his friends dear image present to his mind takes his sad couch more unobserved to weep nor tastes the gifts of allcomposing sleep restless he rolled around his weary bed and all his soul on his patroclus fed the form so pleasing and the heart so kind that youthful vigor and that manly mind what toils they shared what martial works they wrought what seas they measured and what fields they fought all past before him in remembrance dear thought follows thought and tear succeeds to tear and now supine now prone the hero lay now shifts his side impatient for the day then starting up disconsolate he goes wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes there as the solitary mourner raves the ruddy morning rises over the waves soon as it rose his furious steeds he joined the chariot flies and hector trails behind and thrice patroclus round thy monument was hector dragged then hurried to the tent there sleep at last oercomes the heros eyes while foul in dust thunhonourd carcass lies but not deserted by the pitying skies for phoebus watched it with superior care preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air and ignominious as it swept the field spread over the sacred corse his golden shield all heaven was moved and hermes willed to go by stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe but neptune this and pallas this denies and thunrelenting empress of the skies ever since that day implacable to troy what time young paris simple shepherd boy won by destructive lust reward obscene their charms rejected for the cyprian queen but when the tenth celestial morning broke to heaven assembled thus apollo spoke

pride who hastes to murder with a savage joy invades around and breathes but to destroy shame is not of his soul nor understood the greatest evil and the greatest good still for one loss he rages unresignd repugnant to the lot of all mankind to lose a friend a brother or a son heaven dooms each mortal and its will is done a while they sorrow then dismiss their care fate gives the wound and man is born to bear but this insatiate the commission given by fate exceeds and tempts the wrath of heaven lo how his rage dishonest drags along hectors dead earth insensible of wrong brave though he be yet by no reason awed he violates the laws of man and god if equal honors by the partial skies are doomed both heroes  juno thus replies if thetis son must no distinction know then hear ye gods the

synod round thetis approached with anguish in her face  minerva rising gave the mourner place even juno sought her sorrows to console and offered from her hand the nectar bowl she tasted and resigned it then began the sacred sire of gods and mortal man thou come fair thetis but with grief overcast maternal sorrows long ah long to last suffice we know and we partake thy cares but yield to fate and hear what jove declares nine days are past since all the court above in hectors cause have moved the ear of jove twas voted hermes from his godlike foe by stealth should bear him but we willed not so we will thy son himself the corse restore and to his conquest add this glory more then hye thee to him and our mandate bear tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far nor let him more our anger if he dread vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead but yield to ransom and the fathers prayer the mournful father iris shall prepare with gifts to sue and offer to his hands whatever his honor asks or

throne sat bathed in tears and answered groan with groan and all amidst them lay the hoary sire sad scene of woe his face his wrapped attire concealed from sight with frantic hands he spread a shower of ashes over his neck and head from room to room his pensive daughters roam whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome mindful of those who late their pride and joy lie pale and breathless round the fields of troy before the king joves messenger appears and thus in whispers greets his trembling ears fear not oh father no ill news i bear from jove i come jove makes thee still his care

the impatient monarch sprung the brazen portal in his passage rung the mules preceding draw the loaded wain charged with the gifts idaeus holds the rein the king himself his gentle steeds controuls and through surrounding friends the chariot rolls on his slow wheels the following people wait mourn at each step and give him up to fate with hands uplifted eye him as he past and gaze upon him as they gazed their last now forward fares the father on his way through the lone fields and back to ilion they great jove beheld him as he crossed the plain and felt the woes of miserable man then thus

and over the boundless main then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye thus armed swift hermes steers his airy way and stoops on hellesponts resounding sea a beauteous youth majestic and divine he seemed fair offspring of some princely line now twilight veiled the glaring face of day and clad the dusky fields in sober gray what time the herald and the hoary king their chariots stopping at the silver spring that circling ilus ancient marble flows allowed their mules and steeds a short repose through the dim shade the herald first espies a mans approach and thus to priam cries i mark some foes advance o king beware this hard adventure claims thy utmost care for much i fear destruction hovers nigh our state asks counsel is it best to fly or old and helpless at his feet to fall two wretched suppliants and for mercy call the afflicted monarch shivered with despair pale grew his face and upright stood his hair sunk was his heart his color went and came a sudden trembling shook his aged frame when hermes greeting touched his royal hand and gentle thus accosts with kind demand say whither father when each mortal sight is sealed in sleep thou wanderst through the night why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along through grecian foes so numerous and so strong what could thou hope should these thy treasures view these who with endless hate thy race pursue for what defense alas could thou provide thy self not young a weak old man thy guide yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread from me no harm shall touch thy reverend head from greece i will guard thee too for in those lines the living image of my father shines thy words that speak benevolence of mind are true my son the godlike sire rejoined great are my hazards but the gods survey my steps and send thee guardian of my way hail and be blessed for scarce of mortal kind appears thy form thy feature and thy mind nor true are all thy words nor erring wide the sacred messenger of heaven replied but say conveyst thou through the lonely plains what yet most precious of thy store remains to lodge in safety with some friendly hand prepared perchance to leave thy native land or flyst thou now what hopes can troy retain thy matchless son her guard and glory slain the king alarmed say what and whence thou art who search the sorrows of a parents heart and know so well how godlike hector died thus priam spoke and hermes thus replied you tempt me father and with pity touch on this sad subject you enquire too much often have these eyes that godlike hector viewed in glorious fight with grecian blood embrud i saw him when like jove his flames he tossed on thousand ships and withered half an host i saw but helped not stern achilles ire forbad assistance and enjoyed the fire for him i serve of myrmidonian race one ship conveyed us from our native place polyctor is my sire an honored name old like thy self and not unknown to fame of sevn his sons by whom the lot was cast to serve our prince it fell on me the last to watch this quarter my adventure falls for with the morn the greeks attack your walls sleepless they sit impatient to engage and scarce their rulers check the martial rage if then thou art of stern pelides train the mournful monarch thus rejoined again ah tell me truly where oh where are laid my sons dear relics what befalls him dead have dogs dismembered on the naked plains or yet unmangled rest his cold remains o favored of the skies thus answered then the power that mediates between gods and men nor dogs nor vultures have thy hector rent but whole he lies neglected in the tent this the twelfth evening since he rested there untouched by worms untainted by the air still as auroras ruddy beam is spread round his friends tomb achilles drags the dead yet undisfigurd or in limb or face all fresh he lies with every living grace majestical in death no stains are found over all the corse and closed is every wound though many a wound they gave some heavenly care some hand divine preserves him ever fair or all the host of heaven to whom he led a life so grateful still regard him dead thus spoke to priam the celestial guide and joyful thus the royal sire replied blessed is the man who pays the gods above the constant tribute of respect and love those who inhabit the olympian bower my son forgot not in exalted power and heaven that every virtue bears in mind even to the ashes of the just is kind but thou oh generous youth this goblet take a pledge of gratitude for hectors sake and while the favoring gods our steps survey safe to pelides tent conduct my way to whom the latent god o king forbear to tempt my youth for apt is youth to err but can i absent from my princes sight take gifts in secret that must shun the light what from our masters interest thus we draw is but a licensed theft that escapes the law respecting him my soul abjures the offense and as the crime i dread the consequence thee far as argos pleased i could convey guard of thy life and partner of thy way on thee attend thy safety to maintain over pathless forests or the roaring main he said then took the chariot at a bound and snatched the reins and whirled the lash around before thinspiring god that urged them on the coursers fly with spirit not their own and now they reached the naval walls and found the guards repasting while the bowls go round on these the virtue of his wand he tries and pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes then heaved the massy gates removed the bars and over the trenches led the rolling cars unseen through all the hostile camp they went and now approached pelides lofty tent of fir the roof was raised and covered over with reeds collected from the marshy shore and fenced with palisades a hall of state the work of soldiers where the hero sat large was the door whose wellcompacted strength a solid pine tree barred of wondrous length scarce three strong greeks could lift its mighty weight but great achilles singly closed the gate this hermes such the power of gods set wide then swift alighted the celestial guide and thus revealed  hear prince and understand thou owst thy guidance to no mortal hand hermes i am descended from above the king of arts the messenger of jove farewell to shun achilles sight i fly uncommon are such favors of the sky nor stand confessed to frail mortality now fearless enter and prefer thy prayers adjure him by his fathers silver hairs his son his mother urge him to bestow whatever pity that stern heart can know thus having said he vanished from his eyes and in a moment shot into the skies the king confirmed from heaven alighted there and left his aged herald on the car with solemn pace through various rooms he went and found achilles in his inner tent there sat the hero alcimus the brave and great automedon attendance gave these served his person at the royal feast around at awful distance stood the rest unseen by these the king his entry made and prostrate now before achilles laid sudden a venerable sight appears embraced his knees and bathed his hands in tears those direful hands his kisses pressed embrud even with the best the dearest of his blood as when a wretch who conscious of his crime pursued for murder flies his native clime just gains some frontier breathless pale amazed all gaze all wonder thus

of troy then gave his hand at parting to prevent the old mans fears and turned within the tent where fair briseis bright in blooming charms expects her hero with desiring arms but in the porch the king and herald rest sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake industrious hermes only was awake the kings return revolving in his mind to pass the ramparts and the watch to blind the power descending hovered over his head and sleepst thou father thus the vision said now do thou sleep when hector is restored nor fear the grecian foes nor grecian

trembling sire arose and raised his friend the god before him goes he joins the mules directs them with his hand and moves in silence through the hostile land when now to xanthus yellow stream they drove  xanthus immortal progeny of jove the winged deity forsook their view and in a moment to olympus flew now shed aurora round her saffron ray sprung through the gates of light and gave the day charged with their mournful load to ilion go the sage and king majestically slow cassandra first beholds from ilions spire the sad procession of her hoary sire then as the pensive pomp advanced more near her breathless brother stretched upon the bier a shower of tears overflows her beauteous eyes alarming thus all ilion with her cries turn here your steps and here your eyes employ ye wretched daughters and ye sons of troy if ever ye rushed in crowds with vast delight to hail your hero glorious from the fight now meet him dead and let your sorrows flow your common triumph and your common woe in thronging crowds they issue to the plains nor man nor woman in the walls remains in every face the selfsame grief is shown and troy sends forth one universal groan at scaeas gates they meet the mourning wain hang on the wheels and grovel round the slain the wife and mother frantic with despair kiss his pale cheek and rend their scattered hair thus wildly wailing at the gates they lay and there had sighed and sorrowd out the day but godlike priam from the chariot rose forbear he cried this violence of woes first to the palace let the car proceed then pour your boundless sorrows over the dead the waves of people at his word divide slow rolls the chariot through the following tide even to the palace the sad pomp they wait they weep and place him on the bed of state a melancholy choir attend around with plaintive sighs and musicks solemn sound alternately they sing alternate flow the obedient tears melodious in their woe while deeper sorrows groan from each full heart and nature speaks at every pause of art first to the corse the weeping consort flew around his neck her milkwhite arms she threw and oh my hector oh my lord she cries snatched in thy bloom from these desiring eyes thou to the dismal realms for ever gone and i abandoned desolate alone an only son once comfort of our pains sad product now of hapless love remains never to manly age that son shall rise or with increasing graces glad my eyes for ilion now her great defender slain shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain who now protects her wives with guardian care who saves her infants from the rage of war now hostile fleets must waft those infants over those wives must wait em to a foreign shore thou too my son to barbarous climes shall go the sad companion of thy mothers woe driven hence a slave before the victors sword condemned to toil for some inhuman lord or else some greek whose father pressed the plain or son or brother by great hector slain in hectors blood his vengeance shall enjoy and hurl thee headlong from the towers of troy for thy stern father never spared a foe thence all these tears and all this scene of woe thence many evils his sad parents bore his parents many but his consort more why gavst thou not to me thy dying hand and why received not i thy last command some word thou would have spoke which sadly dear my soul might keep or utter with a tear which never never could be lost in air fixed in my heart and often repeated there thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan the mournful mother next sustains her part oh thou the best the dearest to my heart of all my race thou most by heaven approved and by the immortals even in death beloved while all my other sons in barbarous bands achilles bound and sold to foreign lands this felt no chains but went a glorious ghost free and a hero to the stygian coast sentenced it is true by his inhuman doom thy noble corse was dragged around the tomb the tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain ungenrous insult impotent and vain yet glowst thou fresh with every living grace no mark of pain or violence of face rosy and fair as phoebus silver bow dismissed thee gently to the shades below thus spoke the dame and melted into tears sad helen next in pomp of grief appears fast from the shining sluices of her eyes fall the round crystal drops while thus she cries ah dearest friend in whom the gods had joined the mildest manners with the bravest mind now twice ten years unhappy years are over since paris brought me to the trojan shore oh had i perished ever that form divine seduced this soft this easy heart of mine yet was it never my fate from thee to find a deed ungentle or a word unkind when others cursed the authress of their woe thy pity checked my sorrows in their flow if some proud brother eyed me with disdain or scornful sister with her sweeping train thy gentle accents softened all my pain for thee i mourn and mourn my self in thee the wretched source of all this misery the fate i caused for ever i bemoan sad helen has no friend now thou art gone through troys wide streets abandoned shall i roam in troy deserted as abhorred at home so spoke the fair with sorrowstreaming eye distressful beauty melts each standerby on all around the infectious sorrow grows but priam checked the torrent as it rose perform ye trojans what the rites require and fell the forests for a funeral pyre twelve days nor foes nor secret ambush dread achilles grants these honors to the dead he spoke and at his word the trojan train their mules and oxen harness to the wain pour through the gates and felled from idas crown roll back the gathered forests to the town these toils continue nine succeeding days and high in air a sylvan structure raise but when the tenth fair morn began to shine forth to the pile was born the man divine and placed aloft while all with streaming eyes beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise soon as aurora daughter of the dawn with rosy luster streaked the dewy lawn again the mournful crowds surround the pyre and quench with wine the yet remaining fire the snowy bones his friends and brothers place with tears collected in a golden vase the golden vase in purple palls they rolled of softest texture and inwrought with gold last over the urn the sacred earth they spread and raised the tomb memorial of the dead strong guards and spies till all the rites were done watched from the rising to the setting sun all troy then moves to priams court again a solemn silent melancholy train assembled there from pious toil they rest and sadly shared the last sepulcral feast such honors ilion to her hero paid and peaceful slept the mighty hectors shade the end of the iliad observations on the twentyfourth book observations on the twentyfourth book i verse    what seas they measured etc there is something very noble in these sentiments of achilles he does not recollect any soft moments any tendernesses that had passed between him and patroclus but he revolves the many difficulties the toils by land and the dangers by sea in which they had been companions thus the poet on all occasions admirably sustains the character of achilles when he played upon the harp in the ninth book he sung the achievements of kings and in this place there is an air of greatness in his very sorrows achilles is as much a hero when he weeps as when he fights  this passage in homer has not escaped the censure of plato who thought it a diminution to his character to be thus transported with grief but the objection will vanish if we remember that all the passions of achilles are in the extreme his nature is violent and it would have been an outrage to his general character to have represented him as mourning moderately for his friend plato spoke more like a philosopher than a critic when he blamed the behavior of achilles as unmanly these tears would have illbecome plato but they are graceful in achilles  besides there is something very instructive in this whole representation it shows us the power of a sincere friendship and softens and recommends the character of achilles the violence he used toward his enemy is alleviated by the sincerity he expresses toward his friend he is a terrible enemy but an amiable friend  ii verse  0 for phoebus watched it etc eustathius says that by this shield of apollo are meant the clouds that are drawn up by the beams of the sun which cooling and qualifying the sultriness of the air preserved the body from decay but perhaps the poet had something farther in his eye when he introduced apollo upon this occasion apollo is a physician and the god of medicaments if therefore achilles used any arts to preserve hector from decay that he might be able the longer to insult his remains apollo may properly be said to protect it with his aegis  iii verse    but neptune this and pallas this denies it is with excellent art that the poet carries on this part of his poem he shows that he could have contrived another way to recover the body of hector but as a god is never to be introduced but when human means fail he rejects the interposition of mercury makes use of ordinary methods and priam redeems his son this gives an air of probability to the relation at the same time that it advances the glory of achilles for the greatest of his enemies labors to purchase his favor the gods hold a consultation and a king becomes his suppliant eustathius  those seven lines from  to  have been thought spurious by some of the ancients they judged it an indecency that the goddess of wisdom and achilles should be equally inexorable and that it was below the majesty of the gods to be said at all to steal besides say they had homer been acquainted with the judgment of paris he would undoubtedly have mentioned it before this time in his poem and consequently that story was of a later invention and aristarchus affirms that  is a more modern word and never known before the time of hesiod who uses it when he speaks of the daughters of praetus and adds that it is appropriated to signify the incontinence of women and cannot be at all applied to men therefore others read the last verse  these objections are entirely gathered from eustathius to which we may add that macrobius seems to have been one of those who rejected these verses since he affirms that our author never mentions the judgment of paris it may be answered that the silence of homer in the foregoing part of the poem as to the judgment of paris is no argument that he was ignorant of that story perhaps he might think it most proper to unfold the cause of the destruction of troy in the conclusion of the ilias that the reader seeing the wrong done and the punishment of that wrong immediately following might acknowledge the justice of it  the same reason will be an answer to the objection relating to the anger of pallas wisdom cannot be satisfied without justice and consequently pallas ought not to cease from resentment till troy has suffered the deserts of her crimes  i cannot think that the objection about the word  is of any weight the date of words is utterly uncertain and as no one has been able to determine the ages of homer and hesiod so neither can any person be assured that such words were not in use in homers days  iv verse    a lion not a man etc this is a very formal condemnation of the morals of achilles which homer puts into the mouth of a god one may see from this alone that he was far from designing his hero a virtuous character yet the poet artfully introduces apollo in the midst of his reproaches intermingling the heros praises with his blemishes brave though he be etc thus what is the real merit of achilles is distinguished from what is blameable in his character and we see apollo or the god of wisdom is no less impartial than just in his representation of achilles  v verse     and wept her god like sons approaching doom these words are very artfully inserted by the poet the poem could not proceed to the death of achilles without breaking the action and therefore to satisfy the curiosity of the reader concerning the fate of this great man he takes care to inform us that his life draws to a period and as it were celebrates his funeral before his death  such circumstances as these greatly raise the character of achilles he is so truly valiant that though he knows he must fall before troy yet he does not abstain from the war but courageously meets his death and here i think it proper to insert an observation that ought to have been made before which is that achilles did not know that hector was to fall by his hand if he had known it where would have been the mighty courage in engaging him in a single combat in which he was sure to conquer the contrary of this is evident from the words of achilles to hector just before the combat   etc  i will make no compacts with thee says achilles but one of us shall fall  vi verse     nine days are past since all the court above etc it may be thought that so many interpositions of the gods such messages from heaven to earth and down to the seas are needless machines and it may be imagined that it is an offense against probability that so many deities should be employed to pacify achilles but i am of opinion that the poet conducts this whole affair with admirable judgment the poem is now almost at the conclusion and achilles is to pass from a state of an almost inexorable resentment to a state of perfect tranquillity such a change could not be brought about by human means achilles is too stubborn to obey any thing less than a god this is evident from his rejecting the persuasion of the whole grecian army to return to the battle so that it appears that this machinery was necessary and consequently a beauty to the poem  it may be farther added that these several incidents proceed from jupiter it is by his appointment that so many gods are employed to attend achilles by these means jupiter fulfills the promise mentioned in the first book of honoring the son of thetis and the poet excellently sustains his character by representing the inexorable achilles as not parting with the body of his mortal enemy but by the immediate command of jupiter  if the poet had conducted these incidents merely by human means or supposed achilles to restore the body of hector entirely out of compassion the draught had been unnatural because unlike achilles such a violence of temper was not to be pacified by ordinary methods besides the poet has made use of the properest personages to carry on the affair for who could be supposed to have so great an influence upon achilles as his own mother who is a goddess  vii verse     and thy heart waste with lifeconsuming woe this expression in the original is very particular were it to be translated literally it must be rendered how long will thou eat or prey upon thy own heart by these sorrows and it seems that it was a common way of expressing a deep sorrow and pythagoras uses it in this sense  that is grieve not excessively let not sorrow make too great an impression upon thy heart eustathius  viii verse      indulge the amorous hour the ancients says eustathius rejected these verses because of the indecent idea they convey the goddess in plain terms advises achilles to go to bed to his mistress and tells him a woman will be a comfort the good bishop is of opinion that they ought to be rejected but the reason he gives is as extraordinary as that of thetis soldiers says he have more occasion for something to strengthen themselves with than for women and this is the reason continues he why wrestlers are forbid all commerce with that sex during the whole time of their exercise  dionysius of halicarnassus endeavors to justify homer by observing that this advice of thetis was not given him to induce him to any wantonness but was intended to indulge a nobler passion his desire of glory she advises him to go to that captive who was restored to him in a public manner to satisfy his honor to that captive the detention of whom had been so great a punishment to the whole grecian army and therefore thetis uses a very proper motive to comfort her son by advising him to gratify at once both his love and his glory  plutarch has likewise labored in homers justification he observes that the poet has set the picture of achilles in this place in a very fair and strong point of light though achilles had so lately received his beloved briseis from the hands of agamemnon though he knew that his own life drew to a sudden period yet the hero prevails over the lover and he does not haste to indulge his love he does not lament patroclus like a common man by neglecting the duties of life but he abstains from all pleasures by an excess of sorrow and the love of his mistress is lost in that of his friend  this observation excellently justifies achilles in not indulging himself with the company of his mistress the hero prevails so much over the lover that thetis thinks her self obliged to recall briseis to his memory yet still the indecency remains all that can be said in favor of thetis is that she was mother to achilles and consequently might take the greater freedom with her son  madam dacier disapproves of both the former observations she has recourse to the lawfulness of such a practice between achilles and briseis and because such commerces in those times were reputed honest therefore she thinks the advice was decent the married ladies are obliged to her for this observation and i hope all tender mothers when their sons are afflicted will advise them to comfort themselves in this manner  in short i am of opinion that this passage outrages decency and it is a sign of some weakness to have so much occasion of justification indeed the whole passage is capable of a serious construction and of such a sense as a mother might express to a son with decency and then it will run thus why art thou my son thus afflicted why thus resigned to sorrow can neither sleep nor love divert you short is thy date of life spend it not all in weeping but allow some part of it to love and pleasure but still the indecency lies in the manner of the expression which must be allowed to be almost obscene for such is the word  misceri all that can be said in defense of it is that as we are not competent judges of what ideas words might carry in homers time so we ought not entirely to condemn him because it is possible the expression might not sound so indecently in ancient as in modern ears  ix verse     him hermes to achilles shall convey the intervention of mercury was very necessary at this time and by it the poet not only gives an air of probability to the relation but also pays a complement to his countrymen the grecians they kept so strict a guard that nothing but a god could pass unobserved and this highly recommends their military discipline and priam not being able to carry the ransom without a chariot it would have been an offense against probability to have supposed him able to have passed all the guards of the army in his chariot without the assistance of some deity horace had this passage in his view ode the  0th of the first book iniqua trojae castra fefellit  x verse      achilles self shall spare his age nor touch one venerable hair etc it is observable that every word here is a negative    achilles is still so angry that jupiter cannot say he is wise judicious and merciful he only commends him negatively and barely says he is not a madman nor perversely wicked  it is the observation of the ancients says eustathius that all the causes of the sins of man are included in those three words man offends either out of ignorance and then he is  or through inadvertency then he is  or wilfully and maliciously and then he is  so that this description agrees very well with the present disposition of achilles he is not  because his resentment begins to abate he is not  because his mother has given him instructions nor  because he will not offend against the injunctions of jupiter  xi verse     the winged iris flies etc mons rapin has been very free upon this passage where so many machines are made use of to cause priam to obtain the body of hector from achilles this father says he who has so much tenderness for his son who is so superstitious in observing the funeral ceremonies and saving those precious remains from the dogs and vultures ought not he to have thought of doing this himself without being thus expressly commanded by the gods was there need of a machine to make him remember that he was a father but this critic entirely forgets what rendered such a conduct of absolute necessity namely the extreme danger and in all probability imminent ruin both of the king and state upon priams putting himself into the power of his most inveterate enemy there was no other method of recovering hector and of discharging his funeral rites which were looked upon by the ancients of so high importance and therefore the message from jupiter to encourage priam with the assistance of mercury to conduct him and to prepare achilles to receive him with favor was far from impertinent it was dignus vindice nodus as horace expresses it  xii verse  00 his face his wrapped attire concealed from sight the poet has observed a great decency in this place he was not able to express the grief of this royal mourner and so covers what he could not represent from this passage semanthes the sicyonian painter borrowed his design in the sacrifice of iphigenia and represents his agamemnon as homer does his priam aeschylus has likewise imitated this place and draws his niobe exactly after the manner of homer eustathius  xiii verse     he poured his latest blood in manly fight and fell a hero   this whole discourse of hecuba is exceedingly natural she aggravates the features of achilles and softens those of hector her anger blinds her so much that she can see nothing great in achilles and her fondness so much that she can discern no defects in hector thus she draws achilles in the fiercest colors like a barbarian and calls him  but at the same time forgets that hector ever fled from achilles and in the original directly tells us that he knew not how to fear or how to fly eustathius  xiv verse     lo the sad father etc this behavior of priam is very natural to a person in his circumstances the loss of his favorite son makes so deep an impression upon his spirits that he is incapable of consolation he is displeased with every body he is angry he knows not why the disorder and hurry of his spirits make him break out into passionate expressions and those expressions are contained in short periods very natural to men in anger who give not themselves leisure to express their sentiments at full length it is from the same passion that priam in the second speech treats all his sons with the utmost indignity calls em gluttons dancers and flatterers eustathius very justly remarks that he had paris particularly in his eye but his anger makes him transfer that character to the rest of his children not being calm enough to make a distinction between the innocent and guilty  that passage where he runs out into the praises of hector is particularly natural his concern and fondness makes him as extravagant in the commendation of him as in the disparagement of his other sons they are less than mortals he more than man rapin has censured this anger of priam as a breach of the manners and says he might have shown himself a father otherwise than by this usage of his children but whoever considers his circumstances will judge after another manner priam after having been the most wealthy most powerful and formidable monarch of asia becomes all at once the most miserable of men he loses in less than eight days the best of his army and a great number of virtuous sons he loses the bravest of em all his glory and his defense the gallant hector this last blow sinks him quite and changes him so much that he is no longer the same he becomes impatient frantic unreasonable the terrible effect of ill fortune whoever has the least insight into nature must admire so fine a picture of the force of adversity on an unhappy old man  xv verse     deiphobus and dius it has been a dispute whether  or  in     was a proper name but pherecydes says eustathius determines it and assures us that dios was a spurious son of priam  xvi verse     the sad attendants load the groaning wain it is necessary to observe to the reader to avoid confusion that two cars are here prepared the one drawn by mules to carry the presents and to bring back the body of hector the other drawn by horses in which the herald and priam rode eustathius  xvii verse     oh first and greatest etc eustathius observes that there is not one instance in the whole ilias of any prayer that was justly preferred that failed of success this procedure of homers is very judicious and answers exactly to the true end of poetry which is to please and instruct thus priam prays that achilles may cease his wrath and compassionate his miseries and jupiter grants his request the unfortunate king obtains compassion and in his most inveterate enemy finds a friend  xviii verse     the description of mercury a man must have no taste for poetry that does not admire this sublime description virgil has translated it almost verbatim in the  th book of the aeneis   0  ille patris magni parere parabat imperio and primum pedibus talaria nectit aurea quae sublimem alis sive aequora supra seu terram rapido pariter cum flamine portant tum virgam capit hac animas ille evocat orco pallentes alias sub tristia tartara mittit dat somnos adimitque and lumina morte resignat it is hard to determine which is more excellent the copy or the original mercury appears in both pictures with equal majesty and the roman dress becomes him as well as the grecian virgil has added the latter part of the fifth and the whole sixth line to homer which makes it still more full and majestical  give me leave to produce a passage out of milton of near affinity with the lines above which is not inferior to homer or virgil it is the description of the descent of an angel  down thither prone in flight he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing now on the polar winds then with quick force winnows the buxom air  of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar circled his head nor less his locks behind illustrious on his shoulders fledged with wings lay waving round  etc   xix verse     now twilight veiled the glaring face of day the poet by such intimations as these recalls to our minds the exact time which priam takes up in this journey to achilles he set out in the evening and by the time that he reached the tomb of ilus it was grown somewhat dark which shows that this tomb stood at some distance from the city here mercury meets him and when it was quite dark guides him into the presence of achilles by these methods we may discover how exactly the poet preserves the unities of time and place that he allots space sufficient for the actions which he describes and yet does not crowd more incidents into any interval of time than may be executed in as much as he allows thus it being improbable that so stubborn a man as achilles should relent in a few moments the poet allows a whole night for this affair so that priam has leisure enough to go and return and time enough remaining to persuade achilles  xx verse     etc the speech of mercury to priam i shall not trouble the reader with the dreams of eustathius who tells us that this fiction of mercury is partly true and partly false it is true that his father is old rich and has seven children for jupiter is king of the whole universe was from eternity and created both men and gods in like manner when mercury says he is the seventh child of his father eustathius affirms that he meant that there were six planets besides mercury sure it requires great pains and thought to be so learnedly absurd the supposition which he makes afterward is far more natural priam says he might by chance meet with one of the myrmidons who might conduct him unobserved through the camp into the presence of achilles and as the execution of any wise design is ascribed to pallas so may this clandestine enterprise be said to be managed by the guidance of mercury  but perhaps this whole passage may be better explained by having recourse to the pagan theology it was an opinion that obtained in those early days that jupiter frequently sent some friendly messengers to protect the innocent so that homer might intend to give his readers a lecture of morality by telling us that this unhappy king was under the protection of the gods  madam dacier carries it farther homer says she instructed by tradition knew that god sends his angels to the succor of the afflicted the scripture is full of examples of this truth the story of tobit has a wonderful relation with this of homer tobit sent his son to rages a city of media to receive a considerable sum tobias did not know the way he found at his door a young man clothed with a majestic glory which attracted admiration it was an angel under the form of a man this angel being asked who he was answered as mercury does here by a fiction he said that he was of the children of israel that his name was azarias and that he was son of ananias this angel conducted tobias in safety he gave him instructions and when he was to receive the recompense which the father and son offered him he declared that he was the angel of the lord took his flight toward heaven and disappeared here is a great conformity in the ideas and in the style and the example of our author so long before tobit proves that this opinion of gods sending his angels to the aid of man was very common and much spread amongst the pagans in those former times dacier  xxi verse     blessed is the man etc homer now begins after a beautiful and long fable to give the moral of it and display his poetical justice in rewards and punishments thus hector fought in a bad cause and therefore suffers in the defense of it but because he was a good man and obedient to the gods in other respects his very remains become the care of heaven  i think it necessary to take notice to the reader that nothing is more admirable than the conduct of homer throughout his whole poem in respect to morality he justifies the character of horace  quid pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non before and melius chrysippo and crantore dicit   if the reader does not observe the morality of the ilias he loses half and the nobler part of its beauty he reads it as a common romance and mistakes the chief aim of it which is to instruct  xxii verse     but can i absent etc in the original of this place which i have paraphrased a little the word  is remarkable priam offers mercury whom he looks upon as a soldier of achilles a present which he refuses because his prince is ignorant of it this present he calls a direct theft or robbery which may show us how strict the notions of justice were in the days of homer when if a princes servant received any present without the knowledge of his master he was esteemed a thief and a robber eustathius  xxiii verse     of fir the roof was raised i have in the course of these observations described the method of encamping used by the grecians the reader has here a full and exact description of the tent of achilles this royal pavilion was built with long palisadoes made of firr the top of it covered with reeds and the inside was divided into several apartments thus achilles had his  or large hall and behind it were lodging rooms so in the ninth book phoenix has a bed prepared for him in one apartment patroclus has another for himself and his captive iphis and achilles has a third for himself and his mistress diomeda  but we must not imagine that the other myrmidons had tents of the like dimensions they were as eustathius observes inferior to this royal one of achilles which indeed is no better than an hovel yet agrees very well with the duties of a soldier and the simplicity of those early times  i am of opinion that such fixed tents were not used by the grecians in their common marches but only during the time of sieges when their long stay in one place made it necessary to build such tents as are here described at other times they lay like diomed in the tenth book in the open air their spears standing upright to be ready upon any alarm and with the hides of beasts spread on the ground instead of a bed  it is worthy observation that homer even upon so trivial an occasion as the describing the tent of achilles takes an opportunity to show the superior strength of his hero and tells us that three men could scarce open the door of his pavilion but achilles could open it alone  xxiv verse     nor stand confessed to frail mortality eustathius thinks it was from this maxim that the princes of the east assumed that air of majesty which separates them from the sight of their subjects but i should rather believe that homer copied this after the originals from some kings of his time it not being unlikely that this policy is very ancient dacier  xxv verse     adjure him by his father etc eustathius observes that priam does not entirely follow the instructions of mercury but only calls to his remembrance his aged father peleus and this was judiciously done by priam for what motive to compassion could arise from the mention of thetis who was a goddess and incapable of misfortune or how could neoptolemus be any inducement to make achilles pity priam when at the same time he flourished in the greatest prosperity and therefore priam only mentions his father peleus who like him stood upon the very brink of the grave and was liable to the same misfortunes he then suffered these are the remarks of eustathius but how then shall we justify mercury the god of eloquence who gave him such improper instructions with relation to thetis all that can be said in defense of the poet is that thetis though a goddess has through the whole course of the ilias been described as a partner in all the afflictions of achilles and consequently might be made use of as an inducement to raise the compassion of achilles priam might have said i conjure thee by the love thou bear to thy mother take pity on me for if she who is a goddess would grieve for the loss of her beloved son how greatly must the loss of hector afflict the unfortunate hecuba and priam  xxvii verse     sudden a venerable sight appears i fancy this interview between priam and achilles would furnish an admirable subject for a painter in the surprise of achilles and the other spectators the attitude of priam and the sorrows in the countenance of this unfortunate king  that circumstance of priams kissing the hands of achilles is inimitably fine he kissed says homer the hands of achilles those terrible murderous hands that had robbed him of so many sons by these two words the poet recalls to our mind all the noble actions performed by achilles in the whole ilias and at the same time strikes us with the utmost compassion for this unhappy king who is reduced so low as to be obliged to kiss those hands that had slain his subjects and ruined his kingdom and family  xxviii verse     the speech of priam to achilles the curiosity of the reader must needs be awakened to know how achilles would behave to this unfortunate king it requires all the art of the poet to sustain the violent character of achilles and yet at the same time to soften him into compassion to this end the poet uses no preamble but breaks directly into that circumstance which is most likely to mollify him and the two first words he utters are  see thy father o achilles in me nothing could be more happily imagined than this entrance into his speech achilles has every where been described as bearing a great affection to his father and by two words the poet recalls all the tenderness that love and duty can suggest to an affectionate son  priam tells achilles that hector fell in the defense of his country i am far from thinking that this was inserted accidentally it could not fail of having a very good effect upon achilles not only as one brave man naturally loves another but as it implies that hector had no particular enmity against achilles but that though he fought against him it was in defense of his country  the reader will observe that priam repeats the beginning of his speech and recalls his father to his memory in the conclusion of it this is done with great judgment the poet takes care to enforce his petition with the strongest motive and leaves it fresh upon his memory and possibly priam might perceive that the mention of his father had made a deeper impression upon achilles than any other part of his petition therefore while the mind of achilles dwells upon it he again sets him before his imagination by this repetition and softens him into compassion  xxix verse     these words soft pity etc we are now come almost to the end of the poem and consequently to the end of the anger of achilles and homer has described the abatement of it with excellent judgment we may here observe how necessary the conduct of homer was in sending thetis to prepare her son to use priam with civility it would have ill suited with the violent temper of achilles to have used priam with tenderness without such preadmonition nay the unexpected sight of his enemy might probably have carried him into violence and rage but homer has avoided these absurdities for achilles being already prepared for a reconciliation the misery of this venerable prince naturally melts him into compassion  xxx verse     achilles s speech to priam there is not a more beautiful passage in the whole ilias than this before us homer to show that achilles was not a mere soldier here draws him as a person of excellent sense and sound reason plato himself who condemns this passage could not speak more like a true philosopher and it was a piece of great judgment thus to describe him for the reader would have retained but a very indifferent opinion of the hero of a poem that had no qualification but mere strength it also shows the art of the poet thus to defer this part of his character till the very conclusion of the poem by these means he fixes an idea of his greatness upon our minds and makes his hero go off the stage with applause  neither does he here ascribe more wisdom to achilles than he might really be master of for as eustathius observes he had chiron and phoenix for his tutors and a goddess for his mother  xxxi verse     two urns by jove s high throne etc this is an admirable allegory and very beautifully imagined by the poet plato has accused it as an impiety to say that god gives evil but it seems borrowed from the eastern way of speaking and bears a great resemblance to several expressions in scripture thus in the psalms in the hand of the lord there is a cup and he pours out of the same as for the dregs thereof all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them  it was the custom of the jews to give condemned persons just before execution  wine mixed with myrrh to make them less sensible of pain thus proverbs xxxi   give strong drink to him that is ready to perish this custom was so frequent among the jews that the cup which was given before execution came to denote death itself as in that passage father let this cup pass from me  some have supposed that there were three urns one of good and two of evil thus pindar   but as eustathius observes the word  shows that there were but two for that word is never used when more than two are intended  xxxii verse     extended phrygia etc homer here gives us a piece of geography and shows the full extent of priams kingdom lesbos bounded it on the south phrygia on the east and the hellespont on the north this kingdom according to strabo in the   th book was divided into nine dynasties who all depended upon priam as their king so that what homer here relates of priams power is literally true and confirmed by history eustathius  xxxiii verse  0  while kindling anger sparkled in his eyes i believe every reader must be surpised as i confess i was to see achilles fly out into so sudden a passion without any apparent reason for it it can scarce be imagined that the name of hector as eustathius thinks could throw him into so much violence when he had heard it mentioned with patience and calmness by priam in this very conference especially if we remember that achilles had actually determined to restore the body of hector to priam i was therefore very well pleased to find that the words in the original would bear another interpretation and such a one as naturally solves the difficulty the meaning of the passage i fancy may be this priam perceiving that his address had mollifyd the heart of achilles takes this opportunity to persuade him to give over the war and return home especially since his anger was sufficiently satisfied by the fall of hector immediately achilles takes fire at this proposal and answers is it not enough that i have determined to restore thy son ask no more lest i retract that resolution in this view we see a natural reason for the sudden passion of achilles  what may perhaps strengthen this conjecture is the word  and then the sense will run thus since i have found so much favor in thy sight as first to permit me to live o would thou still enlarge my happiness and return home to thy own country etc  this opinion may be farther established from what follows in the latter end of this interview where achilles asks priam how many days he would request for the interment of hector achilles had refused to give over the war but yet consents to intermit it a few days and then the sense will be this i will not consent to return home but ask a time for a cessation and it shall be granted and what most strongly speaks for this interpretation is the answer of priam i ask says he eleven days to bury my son and then let the war commence again since it must be so  since you necessitate me to it or since you will not be persuaded to leave these shores  xxxiv verse  0  while kindling anger sparkled in his eyes the reader may be pleased to observe that this is the last sally of the resentment of achilles and the poet judiciously describes him moderating it by his own reflection so that his reason now prevails over his anger and the design of the poem is fully executed  xxxv verse  0   0  for know from jove my goddess mother came the injustice of la mottes criticism who blames homer for representing achilles so mercenary as to enquire into the price offered for hectors body before he would restore it will appear plainly from this passage where he makes achilles expressly say it is not for any other reason that he delivers the body but that heaven had directly commanded it the words are very full        xxxvi verse     not thus did niobe etc achilles to comfort priam tells him a known history which was very proper to work this effect niobe had lost all her children priam had some remaining niobes children had been nine days extended on the earth drowned in their blood in the sight of their people without any one presenting himself to interr them hector has likewise been twelve days but in the midst of his enemies therefore it is no wonder that no one has paid him the last duties the gods at last interred niobes children and the gods likewise are concerned to procure honorable funerals for hector eustathius  xxxvii verse     the royal guest the hero eyes etc the poet omits no opportunity of praising his hero achilles and it is observable that he now commends him for his more amiable qualities he softens the terrible idea we have conceived of him as a warrior with several virtues of humanity and the angry vindictive soldier is become calm and compassionate in this place he makes his very enemy admire his personage and be astonished at his manly beauty so that though courage be his most distinguishing character yet achilles is admirable both for the endowments of mind and body   the sense of this word differs in this place from that it usually bears it does not imply  any reproachful asperity of language but  the raising of a false fear in the old man that he might not be concerned at his being lodged in the outermost part of the tent and by this method he gives priam an opportunity of going away in the morning without observation eustathius  xxxviii verse     to ask our counsel or our orders take the poet here shows the importance of achilles in the army though agamemnon be the general yet all the chief commanders apply to him for advice and thus he promises priam a cessation of arms for several days purely by his own authority the method that achilles took to confirm the truth of the cessation agrees with the custom which we use at this day he gave him his hand upon it     eustathius  xxxix verse  00 a melancholy choir etc this was a custom generally received and which passed from the hebrews to the greeks romans and asiaticks there were weepers by profession of both sexes who sung doleful tunes round the dead ecclesiasticus cap      when a man shall go into the house of his eternity there shall encompass him weepers it appears from st matthew xi    that children were likewise employed in this office dacier  xl verse  0  etc the lamentations over hector the poet judiciously makes priam to be silent in this general lamentation he has already born a sufficient share in these sorrows in the tent of achilles and said what grief can dictate to a father and a king upon such a melancholy subject but he introduces three women as chief mourners and speaks only in general of the lamentation of the men of troy an excess of sorrow being unmanly whereas these women might with decency indulge themselves in all the lamentation that fondness and grief could suggest the wife the mother of hector and helen are the three persons introduced and though they all mourn upon the same occasion yet their lamentations are so different that not a sentence that is spoken by the one could be made use of by the other andromache speaks like a tender wife hecuba like a fond mother and helen mourns with a sorrow rising from selfaccusation andromache commends his bravery hecuba his manly beauty and helen his gentleness and humanity  homer is very concise in describing the funeral of hector which was but a necessary piece of conduct after he had been so full in that of patroclus  xli verse     why gavst thou not to me thy dying hand and why received not i thy last command i have taken these two lines from mr congreve whose translation of this part was one of his first essays in poetry he has very justly rendered the sense of  dictum prudens which is meant of the words of a dying man or one in some dangerous exigence at which times what is spoken is usually something of the utmost importance and delivered with the utmost care which is the true signification of the epithet  in this place  xlii we have now past through the iliad and seen the anger of achilles and the terrible effects of it at an end as that only was the subject of the poem and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war it may perhaps be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to troy and the chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it  i need not mention that troy was taken soon after the death of hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse the particulars of which are described by virgil in the second book of the aeneis  achilles fell before troy by the hand of paris by the shot of an arrow in his heel as hector had prophesied at his death lib     the unfortunate priam was killed by pyrrhus the son of achilles  ajax after the death of achilles had a contest with ulysses for the armor of vulcan but being defeated in his aim he slew himself through indignation  helen after the death of paris married deiphobus his brother and at the taking of troy betrayed him in order to reconcile herself to menelaus her first husband who received her again into favor  agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by aegysthus at the instigation of clytaemnestra his wife who in his absence had dishonored his bed with aegysthus  diomed after the fall of troy was expelled his own country and scarce escaped with life from his adulterous wife aegiale but at last was received by daunus in apulia and shared his kingdom it is uncertain how he died  nestor lived in peace with his children in pylos his native country  ulysses also after innumerable troubles by sea and land at last returned in safety to ithaca which is the subject of homers odysses  i must end these notes by discharging my duty to two of my friends which is the more an indispensable piece of justice as the one of them is since dead the merit of their kindness to me will appear infinitely the greater as the task they undertook was in its own nature of much more labor than either pleasure or reputation the larger part of the extracts from eustathius together with several excellent observations were sent me by mr broom and the whole essay upon homer was written upon such memoirs as i had collected by the late dr parnell archdeacon of clogher in ireland how very much that gentlemans friendship prevailed over his genius in detaining a writer of his spirit in the drudgery of removing the rubbish of past pedants will soon appear to the world when they shall see those beautiful pieces of poetry the publication of which he left to my charge almost with his dying breath  for what remains i beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave at the end of my work and from embarassing myself or others with any defenses or apologies about it but instead of endeavoring to raise a vain monument to my self of the merits or difficulties of it which must be left to the world to truth and to posterity let me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable men as well as finest writers of my age and country one who has tried and knows by his own experience how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to homer and one who i am sure sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labors to him therefore having brought this long work to a conclusion i desire to dedicate it and to have the honor and satisfaction of placing together in this manner the names of mr
