definition of a constitution  by thomas pain secretary to the congress of the united states of north america etc etc etc  nor hope to be myself less miserable by what i seek but others to make such as i though thereby worse to me redound miltons paradise lost london printed for j debrett opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly mdccxci  definition etc a constitution is a thing antecedent to government and a government is only the creature of a constitution the constitution of a country is not the act of its government but of the people constituting a government it is the body of elements to which you can refer and quote article by article and which contains the principles upon which the government shall be established the manner in which it shall be organized the powers it shall have the mode of elections the duration of parliaments or by what other name such bodies may be called the powers which the executive part of the government shall have and in fine every thing that relates to the complete organization of a civil government and the principles upon which it shall act and by which it shall be bound a constitution therefore is to a government what the laws made afterward by that government are to a court of judicature the court of judicature does not make the laws neither can it alter them it only acts in conformity to the laws made and the government is in like manner governed by the constitution  rights of man by thomas pain etc etc etc  what a fortunate age is this mr pain when every thing is defined every thing laid open to the meanest capacities every prejudice done away and truth stands blushing before us stripped stark naked i had always had a strange veneration for the word constitution though to say the truth till i had the good fortune to stumble upon the above short clear and precise definition of it i was as little able to have explained its exact meaning as most of those who make use of it every day without asking themselves whether they annex to it any determinate signification  you have told us sir what a constitution is and what it is not i am now instructed that it is a thing both in fact and name aye but what thing sir john what thing why it is a thing that begets government which begets laws which beget judicature etc and so they go on begetting one another to the end of the chapter and who begot the constitution why the people that is every individual of the community who having at some time or other been assembled together before the existence of law and government in a perfect state of independent nature did by themselves or by a select number amongst them chosen for that purpose agree upon a body of elements to which you can refer and quote article by article in a visible form parliaments elections etc etc  that all this is binding upon the community for ever not to be altered in an iota till by what is called a revolution the people think fit to put themselves as they have always a right to do back again into the original state by extinguishing all law and government in order to amuse themselves with making a new constitution  by this definition it is indeed clear that neither france nor england ever had a constitution nor any other country that i ever heard of thus after mankind has been more or less in a state of civil government all over the world for so many thousand years it was reserved for the philosophers of north america and the jacobins enlightened and enlightening to convey to us the definition through your organs of a word to which though it had been so long in every bodys mouth the true sense had never been affixed  a word expressive of a thing that never has had an existence  with due submission sir to your instructive judgment suffer me to doubt at least whether the term in your sense of it can be with more propriety applied to the present state of france since the revolution than it would under the monarchy they have done away i will admit if you please what i believe you would hardly think of assuming as the fact that the elections of the members to the assemblees des etats generaux included the voice of every individual in the community  but pray did the people first place themselves in the original primitive state by declaring an abolition of all existing establishments did they delegate their authority to their deputies in consequence of such a state of things with a formal commission expressly to frame a new constitution as the basis of a new government  surely i must have grossly deceived myself if in many of their instructions they did not expressly declare that they were already in possession of a constitution which they reclaimed from the time of charlemagne a constitution that was dear to them in the extreme and which they recommended to the protection of their attorneys in the strongest terms of anxious solicitude if this was the sentiment expressed in some of the cahiers of instruction was it not implied in every one of them who unanimously declare their attachment to the monarchy with the other three orders of the state which they declare to be the lawful supreme legislature of the kingdom and which they look up to as the redress of all their grievances and the palladium of their liberties i shall suppose now that the representatives are wiser than their constituents that the body of elements they have devised is as much better as you please than those that were committed to their protection nay i will suppose even that the nation enlightened since by the force of eloquence and of the lanthorn are at this moment of the same opinion with the assembly still as the constitution that has been decreed under a commission not only containing no authority from the people for the destruction of all existing establishments and the constituting new ones but containing the most positive commands to protect the existing establishments which were held sacred by them it is submitted to you in all humility whether such innovations come at all within the limits of your definition whether those who accept a trust to one purpose and use it to the direct contrary can avail themselves of the authority they have betrayed whether if added to the breach of trust there happens to be at the same time a breach of the oath their employers exacted from them to abide by their instructions instead of acting in direct opposition to them whether any oath imposed upon others afterward by such an assembly can be conceived even by themselves to have any validity whether in short upon your principle the powers assumed by such a body can be regarded as any thing more than a direct usurpation upon the rights of the people and the force they exercise over all ranks of citizens from the monarch down to the peasant with so free a hand can be considered as any thing but the aristocratical tyranny of an unauthorized though inviolable oppression and perjured senate  the concise clear and explicit definition you have given us sir of a constitution has one great advantage attached to it which every lover of liberty will know how to appreciate as it supposes an extinction of all law and government previous to the establishment of the principles of a future system and as it is the duty of every good citizen to endeavor to procure to his country the best possible situation he can devise it opens a wide field for patriot exertions it is henceforth not only an innocent occupation but a meritorious exercise of the rights of the individual whenever he has a new constitution to propose to begin by removing out of his way the existing establishments that he may convene his fellow citizens for the purpose of considering the new body of elements he has to propound it will therefore be no longer a crime in future legislators such as guy vaux jack cade or ld g  g  to destroy the present system much less to call upon the assistance of the people for that purpose and still less to suggest such arguments through the channel of the press or by word of mouth as may awaken them to the exercise of their indisputable indefeasible rights it is a duty they will fulfill in common with the most respectable authorities a pain a cromwell a franklyn a ravailac and a mirabeau whoever in future shall be arrested in his career by the charge of sedition will answer calmly i am ignorant of the term to incite my fellow citizens to the exercise of a lawful right for their own good can never be imputed as a crime if animated in the cause of freedom he should be transported beyond the bounds of persuasion into some overt act of violence as parricide for example he will say i deserve a crown of laurel not a halter i have a constitution to propose by and by and am only preparing the necessary previous steps to it by bringing about a state of nature through a revolution and the extinction of all law and government  i stand upon the rights of man and i defy you to touch a hair of my head what a field does this open for the generous efforts of active patriotism uncontrouled  luminous however sir as your happy definition cannot but be esteemed the more we reflect upon it and pregnant with all the benefits to mankind which the philantropy of modern philosophy is so eager to impart one regret offers itself upon the perusal of it viz the utter impossibility of applying it to any practical purpose like so many other excellent devices i fear it is only fitted to the speculation of the closet and the regions of metaphysical theory to obtain the actual consent for alas after all the virtual consent through delegates is little better than a mere fiction of law by which millions of individuals equal free and independent bind themselves to abide by a government to be formed upon the constitution they adopt to make a multitude and a multitude so compound capaple of comprehending discussing and determining the nice subtleties of the elements of civil polity without which apprehension and deliberation their consent is that of an infant or an idiot a mockery and mere form to frame these principles of government and legislation upon so broad a basis article by article as to embrace at once all the possible circumstances and situations to be bound by them hereafter any defect in which can have no other remedy but that of an appeal to the people in the state in which alone they are competent to form a new constitution lastly to give efficacy system stability and permanence to a fabric built upon the changeable base of the pupularis aura  such an idea however sublime of the only hold by which mankind are to be cemented rightfully in social relation to each other is in truth a philosophy little framed for useful purposes and worthy only of the elevated contemplations of the doctors of the modern school  less acute and less soaring geniuses whose notions of liberty consist in the secure and peaceable enjoyment of legal establishments transmitted to them by their ancestors with such amendments and renovations from time to time as the infallible test of experience may suggest the necessity of not in forming new establishments upon new principles who prefer the being wisely governed to the governing others who can content themselves with the benefits arising from good laws instead of indulging themselves in the fanciful origin of law and definition of constitutions will carefully keep those theoretical speculations at a distance from the body politic as they will books of physic from the body natural whilst they feel no pressure of bodily infirmity no matter in either case whether the constitution i e the organization of the constituent principle of sound health be known or defined they will think it bad when they suffer and will seek a remedy when they do not suffer they will if they are wise turn their ear from those who try to obtrude upon them their nostrums and medical disquisitions which in one case will make them at least hypocondriac and fantastic and in the other tends to render them dissatisfied turbulent and mischievous citizens  finis
