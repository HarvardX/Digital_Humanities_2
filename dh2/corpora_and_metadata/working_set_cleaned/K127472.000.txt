the case of the surgeons of london the barbers of the city of london were incorporated by king edward the ivth   edw iv      in order to promote and improve the science and faculty of surgery upon consideration of the many public mischiefs which had arisen from the ignorance and unskilfulness of persons practicing that art  to remedy such evils for the time to come which the charter recites to have been owing to the want of a proper oversight correction and punishment of such as were not sufficiently skilled in the faculty of surgery the mystery and commonalty of barbers were created a body corporate with power to make proper statutes and ordinances for their good government  and the masters and governors of that company were to have the oversight correction and government of all persons using the mystery of surgeons within the city of london and suburbs thereof and the punishment of them for their offenses in improperly exercising and practicing their art and likewise the oversight and inspection of all instruments plasters and other medicines by them used  and in order to attain the end of their institution no persons whatsoever were to be admitted or received into their company except persons sufficiently skilled and instructed in the art of surgery  this charter was afterward confirmed by king henry the viith in the   th year of his reign and by king henry the viiith in the  d year of his reign  in the   d year of henry the viiith when persons of better education and greater abilities began to apply themselves to the study and practice of surgery the legislature thought proper to unite this company which were still all surgeons and by the terms of their charter could be composed of no other persons with another body of men likewise practicing surgery but not incorporated  the act recites that there then were within the city of london two several and distinct companies of surgeons occupying and exercising the science and faculty of surgery the one company called the barbers of london the other called the surgeons of london  and the end proposed by the legislature in uniting these two distinct companies of surgeons and making them one body corporate is declared to be that by their union and frequent assembly together the good and due order exercise and knowledge in the science and faculty of surgery should be as well in speculation as in practice obtained both to themselves and their apprentices  the legislature then thought proper likewise to enact for particular reasons mentioned in the act that for the future the same persons should not practice both as surgeons and barbers but that from thenceforth they should be separated professions  the surgeons having since the making of that act been more liberally and regularly educated have directed and applied their whole study and attention toward the advancement and improvement of their art  the barbers have ever since been engaged in a different way of business altogether foreign to the practice of surgery  it is evident therefore that neither the ends which the crown had in view at the original incorporation of this company or those which were afterward proposed to be attained by the legislature can be answered by their continuing united in the same body  as the sole end of their incorporation was that they should oversee and superintend the practice of surgery and as the legislature proposed that by their meeting and assembly together the science of surgery should be promoted as well in speculation as in practice it is plain that their whole union and meeting with the barbers if it were no obstacle cannot in the least be any ways conducive toward attaining those ends  but if the surgeons were incorporated as a distinct body by themselves they would not then be deprived of the help and assistance of many ingenious practisers of their profession who at present decline being members of a company the majority of which being strangers to their art cannot be supposed to have in their views the advancement and improvement of it  the majority of persons practicing surgery would not then be discouraged and prevented as they now are from being members of the company by the inconveniences and expenses which necessarily attend the execution of the several offices of the present company which have no relation to the improvement and profession of surgery by which means those who practice surgery are again divided contrary to the intention of the legislature the number of these at present who are not members of the company being almost double the number of those who are  the public lectures examinations of surgeons and other assemblies instituted for the advancement of surgery would not then meet with any interruption from persons only barbers insisting as they now do that they shall always be present at such meetings  since therefore there are distinct and peculiar privileges and powers lodged with the surgeons which the barbers ought neither to take part or trouble in particularly that important trust of examining surgeons for the royal navy which they have duly executed with the greatest cheerfulness to the great advantage as they hope of the public  and as the desired separation is founded upon reasons of general and public utility  the surgeons of london humbly pray to be separated from the barbers as those of other countries have been each to be made an independent corporation and vested with the same privileges which they now enjoy under their present charters  and as all the members of the present company have an equal interest in the property belonging to the said company and the original members who first acquired that property could only be persons skilled in surgery those practicing as barbers only not having been members of this company till the reign of king henry the viiith they hope that an equitable and proportionable division and distribution of their property shall be made in such manner as the legislature shall think fit  the case of the surgeons of london
