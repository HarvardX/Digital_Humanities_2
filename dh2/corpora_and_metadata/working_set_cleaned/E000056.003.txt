the writings of james madison journal of the constitutional convention of      monday may   th      was the day fixed for the meeting of the deputies in convention for revising the federal system of government on that day a small number only had assembled seven states were not convened till friday    of may when the following members appeared to wit from massachusetts rufus king n york robert yates  alexr hamilton n jersey david brearly william churchill houston william patterson pennsylvania robert morris thomas fitzsimons james   wilson governeur morris delaware george read richard

spaight hugh williamson s carolina john rutlidge charles cotesworth pinckney charles pinckney pierce butler georgia william few  mr robert morris  informed the members assembled a   that by the instruction  in behalf of the deputation of pena he proposed george washington esqr late commander in chief for president of the convention mr jno rutlidge seconded the motion expressing his confidence that the choice would be unanimous and observing that the presence of genl washington forbade any observations on the occasion which might otherwise be proper  general washington  was accordingly unanimously elected by ballot and conducted to the chair by mr r morris and mr rutlidge from which in a very emphatic manner he thanked the convention for the honor they had conferred on him reminded them of the novelty of the scene of business in which he was to act lamented his want of better qualifications and claimed the indulgence of the house   towards the involuntary errors which his inexperience might occasion the nomination came with particular grace from penntildea as docr franklin alone could have been thought of as a competitor the docr was himself to have made the nomination of general washington but the state of the weather and of his health confined him to his house mr wilson  moved that a secretary be appointed and nominated mr temple franklin col hamilton  nominated major jackson   on the ballot majr jackson had   votes  mr franklin   votes on reading the credentials of the deputies it was noticed that those from delaware were prohibited from changing the article in the confederation establishing an equality of votes among the states  the appointment of a committee consisting of messrs wythe hamilton  c pinckney on the motion of mr pinckney to prepare standing rules  orders was the only remaining step taken on this day monday may   — from massts nat gorham  caleb strong from connecticut oliver elseworth from delaware gunning bedford from maryland james mchenry from penna b franklin george clymer ths mifflin  jared ingersol took their seats    mr wythe  from the committee for preparing rules made a report which employed the deliberations of this day mr king  objected to one of the rules in the report authorizing any member to call for the yeas  nays and have them entered on the minutes he urged that as the acts of the convention were not to bind the constituents it was unnecessary to exhibit this evidence of the votes and improper as changes of opinion would be frequent in the course of the business  would fill the minutes with contradictions   col mason  seconded the objection adding that such a record of the opinions of members would be an obstacle to a change of them on conviction and in case of its being hereafter promulged must furnish handles to the adversaries of the result of the meeting the proposed rule was rejected nem contrad certe the standing rules  agreed to were as follows  viz a house to do business shall consist of the deputies of not less than seven states and all questions shall be decided by the greater number of these   which shall be fully represented but a less number than seven may adjourn from day to day immediately after the president shall have taken the chair and the members their seats the minutes of the preceding day shall be read by the secretary every member

two members rising at the same time the president shall name him who shall be first heard a member shall not speak oftener than twice without special leave upon the same question and not the second time before every other who had been silent shall have been heard if he choose to speak upon the subject a motion made and seconded shall be repeated and if written as it shall be when any member shall so require read aloud by the secretary before it shall be debated and may be withdrawn at any time before the vote upon it shall have been declared orders of the day shall be read next after the minutes and either discussed or postponed before any other business shall be introduced when a debate shall arise upon a question no motion other than to amend the question to commit it or to postpone the debate shall be received  a question which is complicated shall at the   request of any member be divided and put separately on the propositions of which it is compounded the determination of a question altho fully debated shall be postponed if the deputies of any state desire it until the next day a writing which contains any matter brought on to be considered shall be read once throughout for information then by paragraphs to be debated and again with the amendments if any made on the second reading and afterwards the question shall be put on the whole amended or approved in its original form as the case shall be committees shall be appointed by ballot and the members who have the greatest number of ballots altho not a majority of the votes present shall be the committee when two or more members have an equal number of votes the member standing first on the list in the order of taking down the ballots shall be preferred a member may be called to order by any other member as well as by the president and may be allowed to explain his conduct or expressions supposed to be reprehensible and all questions of order shall be decided by the president without appeal or debate upon a question to adjourn for the day which may be made at any time if it be seconded the question shall be put without a debate when the house shall adjourn every member shall stand in his place until the president pass him  0 a letter from sundry persons of the state of rho island addressed to the honorable the chairman of the general convention was presented to the chair by mr govr morris  and being read  was    ordered to lie on the table for further consideration    mr butler  moved that the house provide agst interruption of business by absence of members and    against licentious publications of their proceedings—to which was added by—mr spaight —a motion to provide that on the one hand the house might not be precluded by a vote upon any question from revising the subject matter of it when they see cause nor on the other hand be led too hastily to rescind a decision which was the result of mature discussion—whereupon it was ordered that these motions be referred for the consideration of the committee appointed to draw up the standing rules and that the committee make report thereon adjj till tomorrow  0 oclock tuesday may    john dickenson and elbridge gerry the former from delaware the latter from massts took their seats the following rules were added on the report of mr wythe from the committee— that no member be absent from the house so as to interrupt the representation of the state without leave    that committees do not sit whilst the house shall be or ought to be sitting that no copy be taken of any entry on the journal during the sitting of the house without leave of the house that members only be permitted to inspect the journal that nothing spoken in the house be printed or otherwise published or communicated without leave that a motion to reconsider a matter which has been determined by a majority may be made with leave unanimously given on the same day on which the vote passed but otherwise not without one days previous notice in which last case if the house agree to the reconsideration some future day shall be assigned for that purpose mr c pinkney  moved that a committee be appointed to superintend the minutes mr govr morris objected to it the entry of the proceedings of the convention belonged to the secretary as their impartial officer a committee might have an interest  bias in moulding the entry according to their opinions and wishes    the motion was negatived   noes   ays mr randolph  then opened the main business  he expressed his regret that it should fall to him rather than those who were of longer standing in life and political experience to open the great subject of their mission but as the convention had originated from virginia and his colleagues supposed that some proposition was expected from them they had imposed this task on him he then commented on the difficulty of the crisis and the necessity of preventing the fulfilment of the prophecies of the american downfal he observed that in revising the fœderal system we ought to inquire   into the properties which such a government ought to possess   the defects of the confederation   the danger of our situation    the remedy   the character of such a government ought to secure   against foreign invasion   against dissensions between members of the union or seditions in particular states   to procure to the several states various blessings of which an isolated situation was incapable   to be able to defend    itself against encroachment    to be paramount to the state constitutions   in speaking of the defects of the confederation he professed a high respect for its authors and considered them as having done all that patriots could do in the then infancy of the science of constitutions  of confederacies—when the inefficiency of requisitions was unknown—no commercial discord had arisen among any states—no rebellion had appeared as in massts—foreign debts had not become urgent—the havoc of paper money had not been foreseen—treaties had not been violated—and perhaps nothing better could be obtained from the jealousy of the states with regard to their sovereignty he then proceeded to enumerate the defects   that the confederation produced no security against foreign invasion congress not being permitted to prevent a war nor to support it by their own authority—of this he cited many examples most of which tended to shew that they could not cause infractions of treaties or of the law of nations to be punished that particular states might by their conduct provoke war without controul and that neither militia nor draughts being fit for defence on such occasions enlistments only could be successful and these could not be executed without money   that the fœderal government could not check the quarrels between states nor a rebellion in any not having constitutional power nor means to interpose accordingly to the exigency      that there were many advantages which the u s might acquire which were not attainable under the confederation—such as a productive impost—counteraction of the commercial regulations of other nations—pushing of commerce ad libitum—c c   that the fœderal government could not defend itself against encroachments from the states   that it was not even paramount to the state constitutions ratified as it was in many of the states   he next reviewed the danger of our situation appealed to the sense of the best friends of the u s the prospect of anarchy from the laxity of government every where and to other considerations   he then proceeded to the remedy the basis of which he said must be the republican principle he proposed as conformable to his ideas the following resolutions which he explained one by one   resolved that the articles of confederation ought to be so corrected  enlarged as to accomplish the objects proposed by their institution namely common defence security of liberty and general welfare   resd therefore that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought to be proportioned to the quotas of contribution or to the number of free inhabitants as the one or the other rule may seem best in different cases   resd that the national legislature ought to consist of two branches   resd that the members of the first branch of the national legislature ought to be elected by the    people of the several states every — for the term of — to be of the age of — years at least to receive liberal stipends by which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to the public service to be ineligible to any office established by a particular state or under the authority of the united states except those peculiarly belong to the functions of the first branch during the term of service and for the space of — after its expiration to be incapable of reelection for the space of — after the expiration of their term of service and to be subject to recall   resold that the members of the second branch of the national legislature ought to be elected by those of the first out of a proper number of persons nominated by the individual legislatures to be of the age of — years at least to hold their offices for a term sufficient to ensure their independency to receive liberal stipends by which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to the public service and to be ineligible to any office established by a particular state or under the authority of the united states except those peculiarly belonging to the functions of the second branch during the term of service and for the space of — after the expiration thereof   resolved that each branch ought to possess the right of originating acts that the national legislature ought to be empowered to enjoy the legislative rights vested in congress by the confederation  moreover to legislate in all cases to    which the separate states are incompetent or in which the harmony of the united states may be interrupted by the exercise of individual legislation to negative all laws passed by the several states contravening in the opinion of the national legislature the articles of union and to call forth the force of the union agst any member of the union failing to fulfil its duty under the articles thereof   resd that a national executive be instituted to be chosen by the national legislature for the term of — years to receive punctually at stated times a fixed compensation for the services rendered in which no increase or diminution shall be made so as to affect the magistracy existing at the time of increase or diminution and to be ineligible a second time and that besides a general authority to execute the national laws it ought to enjoy the executive rights vested in congress by the confederation   resd that the executive and a convenient number of the national judiciary ought to compose a council of revision with authority to examine every act of the national legislature before it shall operate  every act of a particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final and that the dissent of the said council shall amount to a rejection unless the act of the national legislature be again passed or that of a particular legislature be again negatived by — of the members of each branch   resd that a national judiciary be established to consist of one or more supreme tribunals and of  0 inferior tribunals to be chosen by the national legislature to hold their offices during good behaviour and to receive punctually at stated times fixed compensation for their services in which no increase or diminuation shall be made so as to affect the persons actually in office at the time of such increase or diminution that the jurisdiction of the inferior tribunals shall be to hear  determine in the first instance and of the supreme tribunal to hear and determine in the dernier resort all piracies  felonies on the high seas captures from an enemy cases in which foreigners or citizens of other states applying to such jurisdictions may be interested or which respect the collection of the national revenue impeachments of any national officers and questions which may involve the national peace and harmony  0 resolvd that provision ought to be made for the admission of states lawfully arising within the limits of the united states whether from a voluntary junction of government  territory or otherwise with the consent of a number of voices in the national legislature less than the whole    resd that a republican government  the territory of each state except in the instance of a voluntary junction of government  territory ought to be guarantied by the united states to each state    resd that provision ought to be made for the continuance of congress and their authorities and privileges until a given day after the reform of the articles of union shall be adopted and for the completion of all their engagements       resd that provision ought to be made for the amendment of the articles of union whensoever it shall seem necessary and that the assent of the national legislature ought not to be required thereto    resd that the legislative executive  judiciary powers within the several states ought to be bound by oath to support the articles of union    resd that the amendments which shall be offered to the confederation by the convention ought at a proper time or times after the approbation of congress to be submitted to an assembly or assemblies of representatives recommended by the several legislatures to be expressly chosen by the people to consider  decide thereon he concluded with an exhortation not to suffer the present opportunity of establishing general peace harmony happiness and liberty in the u s to pass away unimproved  it was then resolved—that the house will tomorrow resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to consider of the state of the american union — and that the propositions moved by mr randolph be referred to the said committee mr charles pinkney laid before the house the draft of a federal government which he had prepared to be agreed upon between the free and    independent states of america —mr p plan ordered

roger sherman from connecticut took his seat the house went into committee of the whole on the state of the union mr gorham was elected to the chair by ballot the propositions of mr randolph which had been referred to the com̃ittee being taken up he moved on the suggestion of mr g morris that the first of his propositions to wit resolved that the articles of confederation ought to be so corrected  enlarged as to accomplish the objects proposed by their institution namely common defence security of liberty and general welfare—should be postponed in order to consider the   following   that a union of the states merely federal will not accomplish the objects proposed by the articles of confederation namely common defence security of liberty  genl welfare   that no treaty or treaties among the whole or    part of the states as individual sovereignties would be sufficient   that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative executive  judiciary the motion for postponing was seconded by mr govr morris and unanimously agreed to some verbal criticisms were raised agst the first proposition and it was agreed on motion of mr butler seconded by mr randolph to pass on to the third which underwent a discussion less however on its general merits than on the force and extent of the particular terms national  supreme mr charles pinkney wished to know of mr randolph whether he meant to abolish the state governts altogether mr r replied that he meant by these general propositions merely to introduce the particular ones which explained the outlines of the system he had in view mr butler said he had not made up his mind on the subject and was open to the light which discussion might throw on it after some general observations he concluded with saying that he had opposed the grant of powers to congs heretofore because the whole power was vested in one body the proposed distribution of the powers into different bodies changed the case and would induce him to go great lengths genl pinkney  expressed a doubt whether the act    of congs recom̃ending the convention or the commissions of the deputies to it could authorize a discussion of a system founded on different principles from the federal constitution mr gerry  seemed to entertain the same doubt mr govr morris explained the distinction between a federal and national supreme govt the former being a mere compact resting on the good faith of the parties the latter having a compleat and compulsive operation he contended that in all communities there must be one supreme power and one only mr mason observed that the present confederation was not only deficient in not providing for coercion  punishment agst delinquent states but argued very cogently that punishment could not in the nature of things be executed on the states collectively and therefore that such a govt was necessary as could directly operate on individuals and would punish those only whose guilt required it  0 mr sherman  who took his seat today admitted that the confederation had not given sufficient power to congs and that additional powers were necessary particularly that of raising money which he said would involve many other powers he admitted also that the general  particular jurisdictions ought in no case to be concurrent he seemed however not to be disposed to make too great inroads on the existing system intimating as one reason that it would be wrong to lose every amendment by inserting such as would not be agreed to by the states it was moved by mr read   ded by mr chs    cotesworth pinkney to postpone the  d proposition last offered by mr randolph viz that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative executive and judiciary in order to take up the following—viz resolved that in order to carry into execution the design of the states in forming this convention and to accomplish the objects proposed by the confederation a more effective government consisting of a legislative executive and judiciary ought to be established the motion to postpone for this purpose was lost yeas massachusetts connecticut delaware s carolina—  nays n y pennsylvania virginia north carolina—  on the question as moved by mr butler on the third proposition it was resolved in committee of whole that a national governt ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative executive  judiciary—massts being ay—connect—no n york divided col hamilton ay mr yates no pena ay delaware ay virga ay n c ay s c ay the following resolution being the  d of those proposed by mr randolph was taken up viz—that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought to be proportioned to the quotas of contribution or to the number of free inhabitants as the one or the other rule may seem best in different cases mr madison  observing that the words or to the    number of free inhabitants might occasion debates which would divert the committee from the general question whether the principle of representation should be changed moved that they might be struck out mr king observed that the quotas of contribution which would alone remain as the measure of representation would not answer because waving every other view of the matter the revenue might hereafter be so collected by the general govt that the sums respectively drawn from the states would not appear and would besides be continually varying mr madison admitted the propriety of the observation and that some better rule ought to be found col hamilton moved to alter the resolution so as to read that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought to be proportioned to the number of free inhabitants mr spaight  ded the motion    it was then moved that the resolution be postponed which was agreed to mr randolph and mr madison then moved the following resolution—that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought to be proportioned it was moved and  ded to amend it by adding and not according to the present system—which was agreed to it was then moved   ded to alter the resolution so as to read that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought not to be according to the present system it was then moved   ded to postpone the resolution moved by mr randolph  mr madison which being agreed to mr madison moved in order to get over the difficulties the following resolution—that the equality of suffrage established by the articles of confederation ought not to prevail in the national legislature and that an equitable ratio of representation ought to be substituted this was  ded by mr govr morris and being generally relished would have been agreed to when mr reed moved that the whole clause relating to the point of representation be postponed reminding the come that the deputies from delaware were restrained by their com̃ission from assenting to any change of the rule of suffrage and in case such a change should be fixed on it might become their duty to retire from the convention mr govr morris observed that the valuable assistance    of those members could not be lost without real concern and that so early a proof of discord in the convention as the secession of a state would add much to the regret that the change proposed was however so fundamental an article in a national govt that it could not be dispensed with mr madison observed that whatever reason might have existed for the equality of suffrage when the union was a federal one among sovereign states it must cease when a national governmt should be put into the place in the former case the acts of congs depended so much for their efficacy on the cooperation of the states that these had a weight both within  without congress nearly in proportion to their extent and importance in the latter case as the acts of the genl govt would take effect without the intervention of the state legislatures a vote from a small state wd have the same efficacy  importance as a vote from a large one and there was the same reason for different numbers of representatives from different states as from counties of different extents within particular states he suggested as an expedient for at once taking the sense of the members on this point and saving the delaware deputies from embarrassment that the question should be taken in committee and the clause on report to the house be postponed without a question there this however did not appear to satisfy mr read by several it was observed that no just construction of the act of delaware could require or justify a secession of her deputies even if the resolution were    to be carried thro the house as well as the committee it was finally agreed however that the clause should be postponed it being understood that in the event the proposed change of representation would certainly be agreed to no objection or difficulty being started from any other quarter than from delaware the motion of mr read to postpone being agreed to the committee then rose the chairman reported progress and the house having resolved to resume the subject in committee tomorrow adjourned to  0 o clock thursday may     william pierce from georgia took his seat  in committee of the whole on mr randolphs propositions the  d resolution that the national legislature    ought to consist of two branches was agreed to without debate or dissent except that of pennsylvania given probably from complaisance to docr franklin who was understood to be partial to a single house of legislation resol   first clause that the members of the first branch of the national legislature ought to be elected by the people of the several states being taken up mr sherman opposed the election by the people insisting that it ought to be by the state legislatures the people he said immediately should have as little to do as may be about the government they want information and are constantly liable to be misled mr gerry the evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy the people do not want virtue but are the dupes of pretended patriots in massts it had been fully confirmed by experience that they are daily misled into the most baneful measures and opinions by the false reports circulated by designing men and which no one on the spot can refute one principal evil arises from the want of due provision for those employed in the administration of governmt it would seem to be a maxim of democracy to starve the public servants he mentioned the popular clamour in massts for the reduction of salaries and the attack made on that of the govr though secured by the spirit of the constitution itself he had he said been too republican heretofore he was still however republican    but had been taught by experience the danger of the levelling spirit mr mason argued strongly for an election of the larger branch by the people it was to be the grand depository of the democratic principle of the govt it was so to speak to be our house of commons—it ought to know  sympathize with every part of the community and ought therefore to be taken not only from different parts of the whole republic but also from different districts of the larger members of it which had in several instances particularly in virga different interests and views arising from difference of produce of habits c c he admitted that we had been too democratic but was afraid we sd incautiously run into the opposite extreme we ought to attend to the rights of every class of the people he had often wondered at the indifference of the superior classes of society to this dictate of humanity  policy considering that however affluent their circumstances or elevated their situations might be the course of a few years not only might but certainly would distribute their posterity throughout the lowest classes of society every selfish motive therefore every family attachment ought to recommend such a system of policy as would provide no less carefully for the rights and happiness of the lowest than of the highest orders of citizens mr wilson contended strenuously for drawing the most numerous branch of the legislature immediately from the people he was for raising the federal    pyramid to a considerable altitude and for that reason wished to give it as broad a basis as possible no government could long subsist without the confidence of the people in a republican government this confidence was peculiarly essential he also thought it wrong to increase the weight of the state legislatures by making them the electors of the national legislature all interference between the general and local governmts should be obviated as much as possible on examination it would be found that the opposition of states to federal measures had proceeded much more from the officers of the states than from the people at large mr madison considered the popular election of one branch of the national legislature as essential to every plan of free government he observed that in some of the states one branch of the legislature was composed of men already removed from the people by an intervening body of electors that if the first branch of the general legislature should be elected by the state legislatures the second branch elected by the first—the executive by the second together with the first and other appointments again made for subordinate purposes by the executive the people would be lost sight of altogether and the necessary sympathy between them and their rulers and officers too little felt he was an advocate for the policy of refining the popular appointments by successive filtrations but thought it might be pushed too far he wished the expedient to be    resorted to only in the appointment of the second branch of the legislature and in the executive  judiciary branches of the government he thought too that the great fabric to be raised would be more stable and durable if it should rest on the solid foundation of the people themselves than if it should stand merely on the pillars of the legislatures mr gerry did not like the election by the people the maxims taken from the british constitution were often fallacious when applied to our situation which was extremely different experience he said had shewn that the state legislatures drawn immediately from the people did not always possess their confidence he had no objection however to an election by the people if it were so qualified that men of honor  character might not be unwilling to be joined in the appointments he seemed to think the people might nominate a certain number out of which the state legislatures should be bound to choose  mr butler thought an election by the people an impracticable mode on the question for an election of the first branch of the national legislature by the people massts ay connect divd n york ay n jersey no pena ay

detail for general propositions the committee proceeded to resolution   that the second or senatorial branch of the national legislature ought to be chosen by the first branch out of persons nominated by the state legislatures mr spaight contended that the  d branch ought to be chosen by the state legislatures and moved an amendment to that effect  mr butler apprehended that the taking so many powers out of the hands of the states as was proposed tended to destroy all that balance and security of interests among the states which it was necessary to preserve and called on mr randolph the mover of the propositions to explain the extent of his ideas and particularly the number of members he meant to assign to this second branch mr randf observed that he had at the time of offering his propositions stated his ideas as far as the nature of general propositions required that details made no part of the plan and could not perhaps with propriety have been introduced if he was to give an opinion as to the number of the second branch he should say that it ought to be much smaller than that of the first so small as to be exempt from the passionate proceedings to which    numerous assemblies are liable he observed that the general object was to provide a cure for the evils under which the us laboured that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulance and follies of democracy that some check therefore was to be sought for agst this tendency of our governments and that a good senate seemed most likely to answer the purpose  mr king reminded the committee that the choice of the second branch as proposed by mr spaight viz by the state legislatures would be impracticable unless it was to be very numerous or the idea of proportion among the states was to be disregarded according to this idea there must be  0 or  00 members to entitle delaware to the choice of one of them—mr spaight withdrew his motion mr wilson opposed both a nomination by the state legislatures and an election by the first branch of the national legislature because the second branch of the latter ought to be independent of both he thought both branches of the national legislature ought to be chosen by the people but was not prepared with a specific proposition he suggested the mode of chusing the senate of n york to wit of uniting several election districts for one branch in chusing members for the other branch as a good model mr madison observed that such a mode would    destroy the influence of the smaller states associated with larger ones in the same district as the latter would chuse from within themselves altho better men might be found in the former the election of senators in virga where large  small counties were often formed into one district for the purpose had illustrated this consequence local partiality would often prefer a resident within the county or state to a candidate of superior merit residing out of it less merit also in a resident would be more known throughout his own state  mr sherman favored an election of one member by each of the state legislatures  mr pinkney moved to strike out the nomination by the

the question for transferring all the legislative power of the existing congs to this assembly there was also a silent affirmative nem con on the proposition for giving legislative power in all cases to which the state legislatures were individually incompetent mr pinkney  mr rutledge  objected to the vagueness of the term incompetent and said they could not well decide how to vote until they should    see an exact enumeration of the powers comprehended by this definition  mr butler repeated his fears that we were running into an extreme in taking away the powers of the states and called on mr randolph for the extent of his meaning mr randolph disclaimed any intention to give indefinite powers to the national legislature declaring that he was entirely opposed to such an inroad on the state jurisdictions and that he did not think any considerations whatever could ever change his determination his opinion was fixed on this point mr madison said that he had brought with him    into the convention a strong bias in favor of an enumeration and definition of the powers necessary to be exercised by the national legislature but had also brought doubts concerning its practicability his wishes remained unaltered but his doubts had become stronger what his opinion might ultimately be he could not yet tell but he should shrink from nothing which should be found essential to such a form of govt as would provide for the safety liberty and happiness of the community this being the end of all our deliberations all the necessary means for attaining it must however reluctantly be

dissent the last clause of resolution   authorizing an exertion of the force of the whole agst a delinquent state came next into consideration mr madison observed that the more he reflected    on the use of force the more he doubted the practicability the justice and the efficacy of it when applied to people collectively and not individually—a union of the states containing such an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction the use of force agst a state would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound he hoped that such a system would be framed as might render this resource unnecessary and moved that the clause be postponed this motion was agreed to nem con the committee then rose  the house adjourned  friday june  st      william houston from georgia took his seat the committee of the whole proceeded to resolution      that a national executive be instituted to be chosen by the national legislature for the term of — years c to be ineligible thereafter to possess the executive powers of congress c mr pinkney was for a vigorous executive but was afraid the executive powers of the existing congress might extend to peace  war c which would render the executive a monarchy of the worst kind to wit an elective one mr wilson moved that the executive consist of a single person mr c pinkney seconded the motion so as to read that a national ex to consist of a single person be instituted a considerable pause ensuing and the chairman  asking if he should put the question docr franklin    observed that it was a point of great importance and wished that the gentlemen would deliver their sentiments on it before the question was put mr rutlidge animadverted on the shyness of gentlemen on this and other subjects he said it looked as if they supposed themselves precluded by having frankly disclosed their opinions from afterwards changing them which he did not take to be at all the case he said he was for vesting the executive power in a single person tho he was not for giving him the power of war and peace a single man would feel the greatest responsibility and administer the public affairs best mr sherman said he considered the executive magistracy as nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the legislature into effect that the person or persons ought to be appointed by and accountable to the legislature only which was the depository of the supreme will of the society as they were the best judges of the business which ought to be done by the executive department and consequently of the number necessary from time to time for doing it he wished the number might not be fixed but that the legislature should be at liberty to appoint one or more as experience might dictate mr wilson preferred a single magistrate as giving    most energy dispatch and responsibility to the office he did not consider the prerogatives of the british monarch as a proper guide in defining the executive powers some of these prerogatives were of a legislative nature among others that of war  peace c the only powers he considered strictly executive were those of executing the laws and appointing officers not appertaining to and appointed by the legislature  mr gerry favored the policy of annexing a council to the executive in order to give weight  inspire confidence  mr randolph strenuously opposed a unity in the executive magistracy he regarded it as the fœtus of monarchy we had he said no motive to be governed by the british govenmt as our prototype he did not mean however to throw censure on that excellent fabric if we were in a situation to copy it he did not know that he should be opposed to it  0 but the fixt genius of the people of america required a different form of government he could not see why the great requisites for the executive department vigor dispatch  responsibility could not be found in three men as well as in one man the executive ought to be independent it ought therefore in order to support its independence to consist of more than one mr wilson said that unity in the executive instead of being the fetus of monarchy would be the best safeguard against tyranny he repeated that he was not governed by the british model which was inapplicable to the situation of this country the extent of which was so great and the manners so    republican that nothing but a great confederated republic would do for it mr wilsons motion for a single magistrate was postponed by common consent the committee seeming unprepared for any decision on it and the first part of the clause agreed to viz—that a national executive be instituted  mr madison thought it would be proper before a choice shd be made between a unity and a plurality in the executive to fix the extent of the executive authority that as certain powers were in their nature executive and must be given to that departmt whether administered by one or more persons a definition of their extent would assist the judgment in determining how far they might be safely entrusted to a single officer he accordingly moved that so much of the clause before the committee as related to the powers of the executive shd be struck out  that after the words that a national executive ought to be instituted there be inserted the words following viz with power to carry into effect the national laws to appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for and to execute such other powers not legislative nor judiciary in their nature as may from time to time be delegated by the national legislature the words not legislative nor judiciary in their nature were added to the proposed amendment in consequence    of a suggestion by genl pinkney that improper powers might otherwise be delegated mr wilson seconded this motion mr pinkney moved to amend the amendment by striking out the last member of it viz and to execute such other powers not legislative nor judiciary in their nature as may from time to time be delegated he said they were unnecessary the object of them being included in the power to carry into effect the national laws mr randolph seconded the motion mr madison did not know that the words were absolutely necessary or even the preceding words to appoint to offices c the whole being perhaps included in the first member of the proposition he did not however see any inconveniency in retaining them and cases might happen in which they might serve to prevent doubts and misconstructions in consequence of the motion of mr pinkney the question on mr madisons motion was divided and the words objected to by mr pinkney struck out by the votes of connecticut n y n j pena del n c  geo agst mass virga  s carolina the preceding part of the motion being first agreed to connecticut divided all the other states in the affirmative the next clause in resolution   relating to the mode of appointing  the duration of the executive being under consideration mr wilson said he was almost unwilling to declare the mode which he wished to take place being    apprehensive that it might appear chimerical he would say however at least that in theory he was for an election by the people experience particularly in n york  massts shewed that an election of the first magistrate by the people at large was both a convenient  successful mode the objects of choice in such cases must be persons whose merits have general notoriety mr sherman was for the appointment by the legislature and for making him absolutely dependent on that body as it was the will of that which was to be executed an independence of the executive on the supreme legislature was in his opinion the very essence of tyranny if there was any such thing mr wilson moves that the blank for the term of duration should be filled with three years observing at the same time that he preferred this short period on the supposition that a reeligibility would be provided for mr pinkney moves for seven years mr sherman was for three years and agst the doctrine of rotation as throwing out of office the men best qualified to execute its duties mr mason was for seven years at least and for prohibiting a reeligibility as the best expedient both for preventing the effect of a false complaisance on the side of the legislature towards unfit characters and a temptation on the side of the executive to intrigue with the legislature for a reappointment mr bedford  was strongly opposed to so long a    term as seven years he begged the committee to consider what the situation of the country would be in case the first magistrate should be saddled on it for such a period and it should be found on trial that he did not possess the qualifications ascribed to him or should lose them after his appointment an impeachment he said would be no cure for this evil as an impeachment would reach misfeasance only not incapacity he was for a triennial election and for an ineligibility after a period of nine years on the question for seven years massts dividd cont no n y ay n j ay pena ay

the people without the intervention of the state legislatures but the executive also in order to make them as independent as possible of each other as well as of the states col mason favors the idea but thinks it impracticable    he wishes however that mr wilson might have time to digest it into his own form—the clause to be chosen by the national legislature—was accordingly postponed— mr rutlidge suggests an election of the executive by the second branch only of the national legislature the committee then rose and the house adjourned saturday june  d in committee of whole william saml johnson from connecticut daniel of st thomas jenifer from maryd  john lansing jr from n york took their seats it was movd   ded to postpone ye resol of mr randolph respecting the executive in order to take up the  d branch of the legislature which being negatived by mas con del virg n c s c geo agst n y pena maryd the mode of appointing the executive was resumed mr wilson made the following motion to be substituted for the mode proposed by mr randolphs resolution that the executive magistracy shall be elected in the following manner that the states be divided into — districts  that the persons qualified to vote in each district for members of the first branch of the national legislature elect — members for their respective districts to be electors of the executive magistracy that the said electors of the executive magistracy meet at —    and they or any — of them so met shall proceed to elect by ballot but not out of their own body — person— in whom the executive authority of the national government shall be vested mr wilson repeated his arguments in favor of an election without the intervention of the states he supposed too that this mode would produce more confidence among the people in the first magistrate than an election by the national legislature mr gerry opposed the election by the national legislature there would be a constant intrigue kept up for the appointment the legislature  the candidates wd bargain  play into one anothers hands votes would be given by the former under promises or expectations from the latter of recompensing them by services to members of the legislature or to their friends he liked the principle of mr wilsons motion but fears it would alarm  give a handle to the state partizans as tending to supersede altogether the state authorities he thought the community not yet ripe for stripping the states of their powers even such as might not be requisite for local purposes he was for waiting till the people should feel more the necessity of it he seemed to prefer the taking the suffrages of the states instead of electors or letting the legislatures nominate and the electors appoint he was not clear that the people ought to act directly even in the choice of electors being too little informed of personal characters in large districts and liable to deceptions    mr williamson  could see no advantage in the introduction of electors chosen by the people who would stand in the same relation to them as the state legislatures whilst the expedient would be attended with great trouble and expence on the question for

the executive be postponed in order to substitute—whose necessary expences shall be defrayed but who shall receive no salary stipend fee or reward whatsoever for their services he said that being very sensible of the effect of age on his memory he had been unwilling to trust to that for the observations which seemed to support his motion and had reduced them to writing that he might with the permission of the committee read instead of speaking them mr wilson made an offer to read the paper which was    accepted the following is a literal copy of the paper sir it is with reluctance that i rise to express a disapprobation of any one article of the plan for which we are so much obliged to the honorable gentleman who laid it before us from its first reading i have borne a good will to it and in general wished it success in this particular of salaries to the executive branch i happen to differ and as my opinion may appear new and chimerical it is only from a persuasion that it is right and from a sense of duty that i hazard it the committee will judge of my reasons when they have heard them and their judgment may possibly change mine—i think i see inconveniences in the appointment of salaries i see none in refusing them but on the contrary great advantages sir there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the affairs of men these are ambition and avarice the love of power and the love of money separately each of these has great force in prompting men to action but when united in view of the same object they have in many minds the most violent effects place before the eyes of such men a post of honour that shall be at the same time a place of profit and they will move heaven and earth to obtain it the vast number of such places it is that renders the british government so tempestuous the struggles for them are the true sources of all those factions which are perpetually    dividing the nation distracting its councils hurrying sometimes into fruitless  mischievous wars and often compelling a submission to dishonorable terms of peace and of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable preeminence through all the bustle of cabal the heat of contention the infinite mutual abuse of parties tearing to pieces the best of characters it will not be the wise and moderate the lovers of peace and good order the men fittest for the trust it will be the bold and the violent the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in their selfish pursuits these will thrust themselves into your government and be your rulers—and these too will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their situation for their vanquished competitors of the same spirit and from the same motives will perpetually be endeavouring to distress their administration thwart their measures and render them odious to the people besides these evils sir tho we may set out in the beginning with moderate salaries we shall find that such will not be of long continuance reasons will never be wanting for proposed augmentations and there will always be a party for giving more to the rulers that the rulers may be able in return to give more to them hence as all history informs us there has been in every state  kingdom a constant kind of warfare between the governing  governed the one striving to obtain more for its support and the other to pay less and this has alone occasioned  0 great convulsions actual civil wars ending either in dethroning of the princes or enslaving of the people generally indeed the ruling power carries its point the revenues of princes constantly increasing and we see that they are never satisfied but always in want of more the more the people are discontented with the oppression of taxes the greater need the prince has of money to distribute among his partizans and pay the troops that are to suppress all resistance and enable him to plunder at pleasure there is scarce a king in an hundred who would not if he could follow the example of pharoah get first all the peoples money then all their lands and then make them and their children servants for ever it will be said that we dont propose to establish kings i know it but there is a natural inclination in mankind to kingly government it sometimes relieves them from aristocratic domination they had rather have one tyrant than five hundred it gives more of the appearance of equality among citizens and that they like i am apprehensive therefore perhaps too apprehensive that the government of these states may in future times end in a monarchy but this catastrophe i think may be long delayed if in our proposed system we do not sow the seeds of contention faction  tumult by making our posts of honor places of profit if we do i fear that tho we do employ at first a number and not a single person the number will in time be set aside it will only nourish the fœtus of a king as the honorable gentleman from virginia very aptly    expressed it and a king will the sooner be set over us it may be imagined by some that this is an utopian idea and that we can never find men to serve us in the executive department without paying them well for their services i conceive this to be a mistake some existing facts present themselves to me which incline me to a contrary opinion the high sheriff of a county in england is an honorable office but it is not a profitable one it is rather expensive and therefore not sought for but yet it is executed and well executed and usually by some of the principal gentlemen of the county in france the office of counsellor or member of their judiciary parliaments is more honorable it is therefore purchased at a high price there are indeed fees on the law proceedings which are divided among them but these fees do not amount to more than three per cent on the sum paid for the place therefore as legal interest is there at five perct they in fact pay two perct for being allowed to do the judiciary business of the nation which is at the same time entirely exempt from the burden of paying them any salaries for their services i do not however mean to recommend this as an eligible mode for our judiciary department i only bring the instance to shew that the pleasure of doing good  serving their country and the respect such conduct entitles them to are sufficient motives with some minds to give up a great portion of their time to the public without the mean inducement of pecuniary satisfaction    another instance is that of a respectable society who have made the experiment and practised it with success more than one hundred years i mean the quakers it is an established rule with them that they are not to go to law but in their controversies they must apply to their monthly quarterly and yearly meetings committees of these sit with patience to hear the parties and spend much time in composing their differences in doing this they are supported by a sense of duty and the respect paid to usefulness it is honorable to be so employed but it is never made profitable by salaries fees or perquisites and indeed in all cases of public service the less the profit the greater the honor to bring the matter nearer home have we not seen the great and most important of our offices that of general of our armies executed for eight years together without the smallest salary by a patriot whom i will not now offend by any other praise and this through fatigues and distresses in common with the other brave men his military friends  companions and the constant anxieties peculiar to his station and shall we doubt finding three or four men in all the u states with public spirit enough to bear sitting in peaceful council for perhaps an equal term merely to preside over our civil concerns and see that our laws are duly executed sir i have a better opinion of our country i think we shall never be without a sufficient number of wise and good men to undertake and execute well and faithfully the office in question    sir the saving of the salaries that may at first be proposed is not an object with me the subsequent mischiefs of proposing them are what i apprehend and therefore it is that i move the amendment if it is not seconded or accepted i must be contented with the satisfaction of having delivered my opinion frankly and done my duty the motion was seconded by col hamilton with the view he said merely of bringing so respectable a proposition before the committee and which was besides enforced by arguments that had a certain degree of weight no debate ensued and the proposition was postponed for the consideration of the members it was treated with great respect but rather for the author of it than from any apparent conviction of its expediency or practicability mr dickinson moved  that the executive be made removable by the national legislature on the request of a majority of the legislatures of individual states it was necessary he said to place the power of removing somewhere he did not like the plan of impeaching the great officers of state he did    not know how provision could be made for removal of them in a better mode than that which he had proposed he had no idea of abolishing the state governments as some gentlemen seemed inclined to do the happiness of this country in his opinion required considerable powers to be left in the hands of the states mr bedford seconded the motion mr sherman contended that the national legislature should have power to remove the executive at pleasure mr mason some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose as well as by the corruptibility of the man chosen he opposed decidedly the making the executive the mere creature of the legislature as a violation of the fundamental principle of good government mr madison  mr wilson observed that it would leave an equality of agency in the small with the great states that it would enable a minority of the people to prevent ye removal of an officer who had rendered himself justly criminal in the eyes of a majority that it would open a door for intrigues agst him in states where his administration tho just might be unpopular and might tempt him to pay court to particular states whose leading partizans he might fear or wish to engage as his partizans they both thought it bad policy to introduce such a mixture of the state authorities where their agency could be otherwise supplied    mr dickinson considered the business as so important that no man ought to be silent or reserved he went into a discourse of some length the sum of which was that the legislative executive  judiciary departments ought to be made as independt as possible but that such an executive as some seemed to have in contemplation was not consistent with a republic that a firm executive could only exist in a limited monarchy in the british govt itself the weight of the executive arises from the attachments which the crown draws to itself  not merely from the force of its prerogatives in place of these attachments we must look out for something else one source of stability is the double branch of the legislature the division of the country into distinct states formed the other principal source of stability this division ought therefore to be maintained and considerable powers to be left with the states this was the ground of his consolation for the future fate of his country without this and in case of a consolidation of the states into one great republic we might read its fate in the history of smaller ones a limited monarchy he considered as one of the best governments in the world it was not certain that the same blessings were derivable from any other form it was certain that equal blessings had never yet been derived from any of the republican form a limited monarchy however was out of the question the spirit of the times—the state of our affairs forbade the experiment if it were    desireable was it possible moreover in the nature of things to introduce it even if these obstacles were less insuperable a house of nobles was essential to such a govt could these be created by a breath or by a stroke of the pen no they were the growth of ages and could only arise under a complication of circumstances none of which existed in this country but though a form the most perfect perhaps in itself be unattainable we must not despair if antient republics have been found to flourish for a moment only  then vanish for ever it only proves that they were badly constituted and that we ought to seek for every remedy for their diseases one of these remedies he conceived to be the accidental lucky division of this country into distinct states a division which some seemed desirous to abolish altogether as to the point of representation in the national legislature as it might affect states of different sizes he said it must probably end in mutual concession he hoped that each state would retain an equal voice at least in one branch of the national legislature and supposed the sums paid within each state would form a better ratio for the other branch than either the number of inhabitants or the quantum of property  a motion being made to strike out on request    by a majority of the legislatures of the individual states and rejected connecticut s carol  geo being ay the rest no the question on mr dickinsons motion for making executive removable by natl legislature at request of majority of state legislatures was also rejected all the states being in

of a unity in the executive department he felt an opposition to it which he believed he    should continue to feel as long as he lived he urged   that the permanent temper of the people was adverse to the very semblance of monarchy   that a unity was unnecessary a plurality being equally competent to all the objects of the department   that the necessary confidence would never be reposed in a single magistrate   that the appointments would generally be in favor of some inhabitant near the center of the community and consequently the remote parts would not be on an equal footing he was in favor of three members of the executive to be drawn from different portions of the country mr butler contended strongly for a single magistrate as most likely to answer the purpose of the remote parts if one man should be appointed he would be responsible to the whole and would be impartial to its interests if three or more should be taken from as many districts there would be a constant struggle for local advantages in military matters this would be particularly mischievous he said his opinion on this point had been formed under the opportunity he had had of seeing the manner in which a plurality of military heads distracted holland when threatened with invasion by the imperial troops one man was for directing the force to the defence of this part another to that part of the country just as he happened to be swayed by prejudice or interest the motion was then postpd the committee rose  the house adjd    monday june   in committee of the whole the question was resumed on motion of mr pinkney  ded by mr wilson shall the blank for the number of the executive be filled with a single person mr wilson was in favor of the motion it had been opposed by the gentleman from virga mr randolph but the arguments used had not convinced him he observed that the objections of mr r were levelled not so much agst the measure itself as agst its unpopularity if he could suppose that it would occasion a rejection of the plan of which it should form a part though the part were an important one yet he would give it up rather than lose the whole on examination he could see no evidence of the alledged antipathy of the people on the contrary he was persuaded that it does not exist all know that a single magistrate is not a king one fact has great weight with him all the    states tho agreeing in scarce any other instance agree in placing a single magistrate at the head of the governt the idea of three heads has taken place in none the degree of power is indeed different but there are no coordinate heads in addition to his former reasons for preferring a unity he would mention another the tranquility not less than the vigor of the govt he thought would be favored by it among three equal members he foresaw nothing but uncontrouled continued  violent animosities which would not only interrupt  0 the public administration but diffuse their poison thro the other branches of govt thro the states and at length thro the people at large if the members were to be unequal in power the principle of opposition to the unity was given up if equal the making them an odd number would not be a remedy in courts of justice there are two sides only to a question in the legislative  executive departmts questions have commonly many sides each member therefore might espouse a separate one  no two agree  mr sherman this matter is of great importance and ought to be well considered before it is determined mr wilson he said had observed that in each state a single magistrate was placed at the head of the govt it was so he admitted and properly so and he wished the same policy to prevail in the federal govt but then it should be also remarked that in all the states there was a council of advice without which the first magistrate could not act a council he thought necessary to make the establishment acceptable to the people even in g b the king has a council and though he appoints it himself its advice has its weight with him and attracts the confidence of the people mr williamson asks mr wilson whether he means to annex a council    mr wilson means to have no council which oftener serves to cover than prevent malpractices mr gerry was at a loss to discover the policy of three members for the executive it wd be extremely inconvenient in many instances particularly in military matters whether relating to the militia an army or a navy it would be a general with three heads on the question for a single executive it was agreed to massts ay cont ay n y

relating to a council of revision taken into consideration mr gerry doubts whether the judiciary ought to form a part of it as they will have a sufficient check agst encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality in some states the judges had actually set aside laws as being agst the constitution this was done too with general approbation it was quite foreign from the nature of ye office to make them judges of the policy of public measures he moves to postpone the clause in order to propose that the national executive shall have a right to negative any legislative act which shall not be afterwards passed by — parts of each branch of the national legislature mr king seconds the motion observing that the    judges ought to be able to expound the law as it should come before them free from the bias of having participated in its formation mr wilson thinks neither the original proposition nor the amendment goes far enough if the legislative exetvtilde  judiciary ought to be distinct  independent the executive ought to have an absolute negative without such a selfdefence the legislature can at any moment sink it into nonexistence he was for varying the proposition in such a manner as to give the executive  judiciary jointly an absolute negative on the question to postpone in order to take mr gerrys proposition into consideration it was agreed to masss ay cont no n y ay pa ay del no maryd no virga no n c ay s c ay ga ay mr gerrys proposition being now before committee mr wilson  mr hamilton move that the last part of it viz wch sl not be afterwds passed unless by — parts of each branch of the national legislature be struck out so as to give the executive an absolute negative on the laws there was no danger they thought of such a power being too much exercised it was mentioned by col hamilton that the king of g b had not exerted his negative since the revolution mr gerry sees no necessity for so great a controul over the legislature as the best men in the community would be comprised in the two branches of it docr franklin said he was sorry to differ from his colleague for whom he had a very great respect    on any occasion but he could not help it on this he had had some experience of this check in the executive on the legislature under the proprietary government of pena the negative of the governor was constantly made use of to extort money no good law whatever could be passed without a private bargain with him an increase of his salary or some donation was always made a condition till at last it became the regular practice to have orders in his favor on the treasury presented along with the bills to be signed so that he might actually receive the former before he should sign the latter when the indians were scalping the western people and notice of it arrived the concurrence of the governor in the means of selfdefence could not be got till it was agreed that his estate should be exempted from taxation so that the people were to fight for the security of his property whilst he was to bear no share of the burden this was a mischevous sort of check if the executive was to have a council such a power would be less objectionable it was true the king of g b had not as was said exerted his negative since the revolution but that matter was easily explained the bribes and emoluments now given to the members of parliament rendered it unnecessary every thing being done according to the will of the ministers he was afraid if a negative should be given as proposed that more power and money would be demanded till at last eno would be gotten to influence  bribe the legislature into a compleat subjection to the will of the executive    mr sherman was agst enabling any one man to stop the will of the whole no one man could be found so far above all the rest in wisdom he thought we ought to avail ourselves of his wisdom in revising the laws but not permit him to overrule the decided and cool opinions of the legislature mr madison supposed that if a proper proportion of each branch should be required to overrule the objections of the executive it would answer the same purpose as an absolute negative it would rarely if ever happen that the executive constituted as ours is proposed to be would have firmness eno to resist the legislature unless backed by a certain part of the body itself the king of g b with all his splendid attributes would not be able to withstand ye unanimous and eager wishes of both houses of parliament to give such a prerogative would certainly be obnoxious to the temper of this country its present temper at least mr wilson believed as others did that this power would seldom be used the legislature would know that such a power existed and would refrain from such laws as it would be sure to defeat its silent operation would therefore preserve harmony and prevent mischief the case of pena formerly was very different from its present case the executive was not then as now to be appointed by the people it will not in this case as in the one cited be supported by the head of a great empire actuated by a different  sometimes opposite interest the salary too is now proposed to be fixed by the    constitution or if dr fs idea should be adopted all salary whatever interdicted the requiring a large proportion of each house to overrule the executive check might do in peaceable times but there might be tempestuous moments in which animosities may run high between the executive and legislative branches and in which the former ought to be able to defend itself mr butler had been in favor of a single executive magistrate but could he have entertained an idea that a compleat negative on the laws was to be given him he certainly should have acted very differently it had been observed that in all countries the executive power is in a constant course of increase this was certainly the case in g b gentlemen seemed to think that we had nothing to apprehend from an abuse of the executive power but why might not a cataline or a cromwell arise in this country as well as in others mr bedford was opposed to every check on the legislature even the council of revision first proposed he thought it would be sufficient to mark out in the constitution the boundaries to the legislative authority which would give all the requisite security to the rights of the other departments the representatives of the people were the best judges of what was for their interest and ought to be under no external controul whatever the two branches would produce a sufficient controul within the legislature itself col mason observed that a vote had already passed he found he was out at the time for vesting    the executive powers in a single person among these powers was that of appointing to offices in certain cases the probable abuses of a negative had been well explained by dr f as proved by experience the best of all tests will not the same door be opened here the executive may refuse its assent to necessary measures till new appointments shall be referred to him and having by degrees engrossed these into all his own hands the american executive like the british will by bribery  influence save himself the trouble  odium of exerting his negative afterwards we are mr chairman going very far in this business we are not indeed constituting a british government but a more dangerous monarchy an elective one we are introducing a new principle into our system and not necessary as in the british govt where the executive has greater rights to defend do gentlemen mean to pave the way to hereditary monarchy do they flatter themselves that the people will ever consent to such an innovation if they do i venture to tell them they are mistaken the people never will consent and do gentlemen consider the danger of delay and the still greater danger of a rejection not for a moment but forever of the plan which shall be proposed to them notwithstanding the oppression  injustice experienced among us from democracy the genius of the people is in favor of it and the genius of the people must be consulted he could not but consider the federal system as in effect dissolved by the appointment of this convention to    devise a better one and do gentlemen look forward to the dangerous interval between extinction of an old and the establishment of a new governmt and to the scenes of confusion which may ensue he hoped that nothing like a monarchy would ever be attempted in this country a hatred to its oppressions had carried the people through the late revolution will it not be eno to enable the executive to suspend offensive laws till they shall be coolly revised and the objections to them overruled by a greater majority than was required in the first instance he never could agree to give up all the rights of the people to a single magistrate if more than one had been fixed on greater powers might have been entrusted to the executive he hoped this attempt to give such powers would have its weight hereafter as an argument for increasing the number of the executive docr franklin a gentleman from s c mr butler a day or two ago called our attention to the case of the u netherlands he wished the gentleman had been a little fuller and had gone back to the original of that govt the people being under great obligations to the prince of orange whose wisdom and bravery had saved them chose him for the stadtholder he did very well inconveniences however were felt from his powers which growing more  more oppressive they were at length set aside still however there was a party for the p of orange which descended to his son who excited insurrections spilt a great deal of blood murdered the    de witts and got the powers revested in the stadtholder afterwards another prince had power to excite insurrections  make the stadtholdership hereditary and the present stadthder is ready to wade thro a bloody civil war to the establishment of a monarchy col mason had mentioned the circumstance of appointing officers he knew how that point would be managed no new appointment would be suffered as heretofore in pensa unless it be referred to the executive so that all profitable offices will be at his disposal the first man put at the helm will be a good one no body knows what sort may come afterwards the executive will be always increasing here as elsewhere till it ends in a monarchy on the question for striking out so as to give

first clause of the ninth resolution namely—to consist of one supreme tribunal and of one or more inferior tribunals which passed in the affirmative the comme then rose and the house adjourned tuesday

clause—that the national judiciary be chosen by the national legislature being under consideration mr wilson opposed the appointmt of judges by the national legisl experience shewed the impropriety    of such appointmts by numerous bodies intrigue partiality and concealment were the necessary consequences a principal reason for unity in the executive was that officers might be appointed by a single responsible person mr rutlidge was by no means disposed to grant so great a power to any single person the people will think we are leaning too much towards monarchy he was against establishing any national tribunal except a single supreme one the state tribunals are most proper to decide in all cases in the first instance docr franklin observed that two modes of chusing the judges had been mentioned to wit by the legislature and by the executive he wished such other modes to be suggested as might occur to other gentlemen it being a point of great moment he would mention one which he had understood was practised in scotland he then in a brief and entertaining manner related a scotch mode in which the nomination proceeded from the lawyers who always selected the ablest of the profession in order to get rid of him and share his practice among themselves it was here he said the interest of the electors to make the best choice which should always be made the case if possible mr madison disliked the election of the judges by the legislature or any numerous body besides the danger of intrigue and partiality many of the members were not judges of the requisite qualifications the legislative talents which were very different    from those of a judge commonly recommended men to the favor of legislative assemblies it was known too that the accidental circumstances of presence and absence of being a member or not a member had a very undue influence on the appointment on the other hand he was not satisfied with referring the appointment to the executive he rather inclined to give it to the senatorial branch as numerous eno to be confided in—as not so numerous as to be governed by the motives of the other branch and as being sufficiently stable and independent to follow their deliberate judgments he hinted this only and moved that the appointment by the legislature might be struck out  a blank left to be hereafter filled on maturer reflection mr wilson second it on the question for striking out massts ay cont no n y ay n j ay pena ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo ay mr wilson gave notice that he should at a future day move for a reconsideration of that clause which respects inferior tribunals mr pinkney gave notice that when the clause respecting the appointment of the judiciary should again come before the committee he should move to restore the appointment by the national legislature the following clauses of resol   were agreed to viz to hold their offices during good behaviour and to receive punctually at stated times a fixed compensation for their services in which no increase or diminution shall be made so as to affect the persons    actually in office at the time of such increase or diminution the remaining clause of resolution   was posponed resolution  0 was agreed to—viz—that provision ought to be made for the admission of states lawfully arising within the limits of the u states whether from a voluntary junction of government  territory or otherwise with the consent of a number of voices in the national legislature less than the whole the    propos for guaranteeing to states republican govt  territory c being read mr patterson  wished the point of representation could be decided before this clause should be considered and moved to postpone it which was not opposed and

revision would also give intermediate stability to the govt nothing had yet happened in the states where this provision existed to prove its impropriety—the proposition was postponed for further consideration the votes being mas con n y pa del ma n c ay virga s c geo no propos    requiring oath from the state officers to support national govt was postponed after a short uninteresting conversation the votes con n jersey md virg s c geo ay n y pa del n c no massachusetts divided propos    for recommending conventions under appointment of the people to ratify the new constitution c being taken up mr sherman thought such a popular ratification unnecessary the articles of confederation providing for changes and alterations with the assent of congs and ratification of state legislatures mr madison thought this provision essential the articles of confedn themselves were defective in this respect resting in many of the states on the legislative sanction only hence in conflicts between acts    of the states and of congs especially where the former are of posterior date and the decision is to to be made by state tribunals an uncertainty must necessarily prevail or rather perhaps a certain decision in favor of the state authority he suggested also that as far as the articles of union were to be considered as a treaty only of a particular sort among the governments of independent states the doctrine might be set up that a breach of any one article by any of the parties absolved the other parties from the whole obligation for these reasons as well as others he thought it indispensable that the new constitution should be ratified in the most unexceptionable form and by the supreme authority of the people themselves mr gerry observed that in the eastern states the confedn had been sanctioned by the people themselves he seemed afraid of referring the new system to them the people in that quarter have at this time the wildest ideas of government in the world they were for abolishing the senate in massts and giving all the other powers of govt to the other branch of the legislature mr king supposed that the last article of ye confedn rendered the legislature competent to the ratification the people of the southern states where the federal articles had been ratified by the legislatures only had since impliedly given their sanction to it he thought notwithstanding that there might be policy in varying the mode a convention being a single house the adoption may more easily be    carried thro it than thro the legislatures where there are several branches the legislatures also being to lose power will be most likely to raise objections the people having already parted with the necessary powers it is immaterial to them by which government they are possessed provided they be well employed mr wilson took this occasion to lead the committee by a train of observations to the idea of not suffering a disposition in the plurality of states to confederate anew on better principles to be defeated by the inconsiderate or selfish opposition of a few states he hoped the provision for ratifying would be put on such a footing as to admit of such a partial union with a door open for the accession of the rest  mr pinkney hoped that in case the experiment should not unanimously take place nine states might be authorized to unite under the same governmt the propos    was postponed nem cont mr pinkney  mr rutlidge moved that tomorrow be assigned to reconsider that clause of propos   which respects the

be left in all cases to decide in the first instance the right of appeal to the supreme national tribunal being sufficient to secure the national rights  uniformity of judgmts that it was making an unnecessary encroachment on the jurisdiction of the states and creating unnecessary obstacles to their adoption of the new system mr sherman  ded the motion mr madison observed that unless inferior tribunals were dispersed throughout the republic with final jurisdiction in many cases appeals would be multiplied to a most oppressive degree that besides an appeal would not in many cases be a remedy what was to be done after improper verdicts in state tribunals obtained under the biassed directions of a dependent judge or the local prejudices of an undirected jury to remand the cause for a new trial would answer no purpose to order a new trial at the supreme bar would oblige the parties to bring up their witnesses tho ever so distant from the seat of the court an effective judiciary establishment commensurate to the legislative authority was essential a government without a proper executive  judiciary would be the mere trunk of a body without arms or legs to act or move mr wilson opposed the motion on like grounds he said the admiralty jurisdiction ought to be given wholly to the national government as it related to    cases not within the jurisdiction of particular states  to a scene in which controversies with foreigners would be most likely to happen mr sherman was in favor of the motion he dwelt chiefly on the supposed expensiveness of having a new set of courts when the existing state courts would answer the same purpose mr dickinson contended strongly that if there was to be a national legislature there ought to be a national judiciary and that the former ought to have authority to institute the latter on the question for mr rutlidges motion to strike out inferior tribunals massts divided cont ay n y divd n j ay pa no del no md no va no n c ay s c ay geo ay mr wilson  mr madison then moved in pursuance of the idea expressed above by mr dickinson to add to the resol   the words following that the national legislature be empowered to institute inferior tribunals they observed that there was a distinction between establishing such tribunals absolutely and giving a discretion to the legislature to establish or not establish them they repeated the necessity of some such provision mr butler the people will not bear such innovations the states will revolt at such encroachments supposing such an establishment to be useful we must not venture on it we must follow the example of solon who gave the athenians not the best govt he could devise but the best they wd receive    mr king remarked as to the comparative expence that the establishment of

the national legislature be elected by the state legislatures and not by the people contending that the people were less fit judges in such a case and that the legislatures would be less likely to promote the adoption of the new government if they were to be excluded from all share in it mr rutlidge  ded the motion mr gerry  much depends on the mode of election in england the people will probably lose their liberty from the smallness of the proportion having a right of suffrage our danger arises from  00 the opposite extreme hence in massts the worst men get into the legislature several members of that body had lately been convicted of infamous crimes men of indigence ignorance  baseness spare no pains however dirty to carry their point agst men who are superior to the artifices practised he was not disposed to run into extremes he was as much principled as ever agst aristocracy and monarchy it was necessary on the one hand that the people should appoint one branch of the govt in order to inspire them with the necessary confidence but he wished the election on the other to be so modified as to secure more effectually a just preference of merit his idea was that the people should nominate certain persons in certain districts out of whom the state legislatures shd make the appointment mr wilson he wished for vigor in the govt but he wished that vigorous authority to flow immediately from the legitimate source of all authority the govt ought to possess not only  st the force but  dly the mind or sense of the people at large the legislature ought to be the most exact transcript of the whole society representation is made necessary only because it is impossible for the people to act collectively the opposition was to be expected he said from the governments not from the citizens of the states the latter had parted as was observed by mr king with all the necessary powers and it was immaterial to them by whom they were exercised if well exercised the state officers were to be the losers of power the people he supposed  0  would be rather more attached to the national govt than to the state govts as being more important in itself and more flattering to their pride there is no danger of improper elections if made by large districts bad elections proceed from the smallness of the districts which give an opportunity to bad men to intrigue themselves into office mr sherman if it were in view to abolish the state govts the elections ought to be by the people if the state govts are to be continued it is necessary in order to preserve harmony between the national  state govts that the elections to the former shd be made by the latter the right of participating in the national govt would be sufficiently secured to the people by their election of the state legislatures the objects of the union he thought were few   defence agst foreign danger   agst internal disputes  a resort to force   treaties with foreign nations   regulating foreign commerce  drawing revenue from it these  perhaps a few lesser objects alone rendered a confederation of the states necessary all other matters civil  criminal would be much better in the hands of the states the people are more happy in small than in large states states may indeed be too small as rhode island  thereby be too subject to faction some others were perhaps too large the powers of govt not being able to pervade them he was for giving the general govt power to legislate and execute within a defined province col mason under the existing confederacy  0  congs represent the states and not the people of the states their acts operate on the states not on the individuals the case will be changed in the new plan of govt the people will be represented they ought therefore to choose the representatives the requisites in actual representation are that the reps should sympathize with their constituents shd think as they think  feel as they feel and that for these purposes shd even be residents among them much he sd had been alledged agst democratic elections he admitted that much might be said but it was to be considered that no govt was free from imperfections  evils and that improper elections in many instances were inseparable from republican govts but compare these with the advantage of this form in favor of the rights of the people in favor of human nature he was persuaded there was a better chance for proper elections by the people if divided into large districts than by the state legislatures paper money had been issued by the latter when the former were against it was it to be supposed that the state legislatures then wd not send to the natl legislature patrons of such projects if the choice depended on them mr madison considered an election of one branch at least of the legislature by the people immediately as a clear principle of free govt and that this mode under proper regulations had the additional advantage of securing better representatives as well as of avoiding too great an agency of the state governments in the general one he differed from the  0  member from connecticut mr sherman in thinking the objects mentioned to be all the principal ones that required a national govt those were certainly important and necessary objects but he combined with them the necessity of providing more effectually for the security of private rights and the steady dispensation of justice interferences with these were evils which had more perhaps than anything else produced this convention was it to be supposed that republican liberty could long exist under the abuses of it practised in some of the states the gentleman mr sherman had admitted that in a very small state faction  oppression wd prevail it was to be inferred then that wherever these prevailed the state was too small had they not prevailed in the largest as well as the smallest tho less than in the smallest and were we not thence admonished to enlarge the sphere as far as the nature of the govt would admit this was the only defence agst the inconveniences of democracy consistent with the democratic form of govt all civilized societies would be divided into different sects factions  interests as they happened to consist of rich  poor debtors  creditors the landed the manufacturing the commercial interests the inhabitants of this district or that district the followers of this political leader or that political leader—the disciples of this religious sect or that religious sect in all cases where a majority are united by a common interest or passion the rights of the minority are in danger what motives are to restrain  0  them a prudent regard to the maxim that honesty is the best policy is found by experience to be as little regarded by bodies of men as by individuals respect for character is always diminished in proportion to the number among whom the blame or praise is to be divided conscience the only remaining tie is known to be inadequate in individuals in large numbers little is to be expected from it besides religion itself may become a motive to persecution  oppression these observations are verified by the histories of every country antient  modern in greece  rome the rich  poor the creditors  debtors as well as the patricians  plebeians alternately oppressed each other with equal unmercifulness what a source of oppression was the relation between the parent cities of rome athens  carthage  their respective provinces the former possessing the power  the latter being sufficiently distinguished to be separate objects of it why was america so justly apprehensive of parliamentary injustice because g britain had a separate interest real or supposed  if her authority had been admitted could have pursued that interest at our expence we have seen the mere distinction of colour made in the most enlightened period of time a ground of the most oppressive dominion ever exercised by man over man what has been the source of those unjust laws complained of among ourselves has it not been the real or supposed interest of the major number debtors have defrauded their creditors the landed interest has borne hard on the  0  mercantile interest the holders of one species of property have thrown a disproportion of taxes on the holders of another species the lesson we are to draw from the whole is that where a majority are united by a common sentiment and have an opportunity the rights of the minor party become insecure in a republican govt the majority if united have always an opportunity the only remedy is to enlarge the sphere  thereby divide the community into so great a number of interests  parties that in the  st place a majority will not be likely at the same moment to have a common interest separate from that of the whole or of the minority and in the  d place that in case they shd have such an interest they may not be apt to unite in the pursuit of it it was incumbent on us then to try this remedy and with that view to frame a republican system on such a scale  in such a form as will controul all the evils wch have been experienced mr dickinson considered it essential that one branch of the legislature shd be drawn immediately from the people and as expedient that the other shd be chosen by the legislatures of the states this combination of the state govts with the national govt was as politic as it was unavoidable in the formation of the senate we ought to carry it through such a refining process as will assimilate it as nearly as may be to the house of lords in england he repeated his warm eulogiums on the british constitution he was for a strong national govt but for leaving the states a considerable agency in the  0  system the objection agst making the former dependent on the latter might be obviated by giving to the senate an authority permanent  irrevocable for three five or seven years being thus independent they will check  decide with becoming freedom mr read too much attachment is betrayed to the state governts we must look beyond their continuance a national govt must soon of necessity swallow all of them up they will soon be reduced to the mere office of electing the national senate he was agst patching up the old federal system he hoped the idea wd be dismissed it would be like putting new cloth on an old garment the confederation was founded on temporary principles it cannot last it can not be amended if we do not establish a good govt on new principles we must either go to ruin or have the work to do over again the people at large are wrongly suspected of being averse to a genl govt the aversion lies among interested men who possess their confidence mr pierce  was for an election by the people as to the  st branch  by the states as to the  d branch  0  by which means the citizens of the states wd be represented both individually  collectively general pinkney wished to have a good national govt  at the same time to leave a considerable share of power in the states an election of either branch by the people scattered as they are in many states particularly in s carolina was totally impracticable he differed from gentlemen who thought that a choice by the people wd be a better guard agst bad measures than by the legislatures a majority of the people in s carolina were notoriously for papermoney as a legal tender the legislature had refused to make it a legal tender the reason was that the latter had some sense of character and were restrained by that consideration the state legislatures also he said would be more jealous  more ready to thwart the national govt if excluded from a participation in it the idea of abolishing these legislatures wd never go down mr wilson would not have spoken again but for what had fallen from mr read namely that the idea of preserving the state govts ought to be abandoned he saw no incompatibility between the national  state govts provided the latter were restrained to certain local purposes nor any probability of their being devoured by the former in all confederated systems antient  modern the reverse had happened the generality being destroyed gradually by the usurpations of the parts composing it on the question for electing the  st branch by the  0  state legislatures as moved by mr pinkney it was negatived mass no ct ay n y no n j ay pa no del no md no va no n c no s c ay geo no mr wilson moved to reconsider the vote excluding the judiciary from a share in the revision of the laws and to add after national executive the words with a convenient number of the national judiciary remarking the expediency of reinforcing the executive with the influence of that department mr madison  ded the motion he observed that the great difficulty in rendering the executive competent to its own defence arose from the nature of republican govt which could not give to an individual citizen that settled preeminence in the eyes of the rest that weight of property that personal interest agst betraying the national interest which appertain to an hereditary magistrate in a republic personal merit alone could be the ground of political exaltation but it would rarely happen that this merit would be so preeminent as to produce universal acquiescence the executive magistrate would be envied  assailed by disappointed competitors his firmness therefore wd need support he would not possess those great emoluments from his station nor that permanent stake in the public interest which wd place him out of the reach of foreign corruption he would stand in need therefore of being controuled as well as supported an  0  association of the judges in his revisionary function wd both double the advantage and diminish the danger it wd also enable the judiciary department the better to defend itself agst legislative encroachments two objections had been made  st that the judges ought not to be subject to the bias which a participation in the making of laws might give in the exposition of them  dly that the judiciary departmt ought to be separate  distinct from the other great departments the  st objection had some weight but it was much diminished by reflecting that a small proportion of the laws coming in question before a judge wd be such wherein he had been consulted that a small part of this proportion wd be so ambiguous as to leave room for his prepossessions and that but a few cases wd probably arise in the life of a judge under such ambiguous passages how much good on the other hand wd proceed from the perspicuity the conciseness and the systematic character wch the code of laws wd receive from the judiciary talents as to the  d objection it either had no weight or it applied with equal weight to the executive  to the judiciary revision of the laws the maxim on which the objection was founded required a separation of the executive as well as the judiciary from the legislature  from each other there wd in truth however be no improper mixture of these distinct powers in the present case in england whence the maxim itself had been drawn the executive had an absolute negative on the laws and the supreme tribunal of   0 justice the house of lords formed one of the other branches of the legislature in short whether the object of the revisionary power was to restrain the legislature from encroaching on the other coordinate departments or on the rights of the people at large or from passing laws unwise in their principle or incorrect in their form the utility of annexing the wisdom and weight of the judiciary to the executive seemed incontestable mr gerry thought the executive whilst standing alone wd be more impartial than when he cd be covered by the sanction  seduced by the sophistry of the judges mr king if the unity of the executive was preferred for the sake of responsibility the policy of it is as applicable to the revisionary as to the executive power mr pinkney had been at first in favor of joining the heads of the principal departmts the secretary at war of foreign affairs c—in the council of revision he had however relinquished the idea from a consideration that these could be called on by the executive magistrate whenever he pleased to consult them he was opposed to the introduction of the judges into the business col mason was for giving all possible weight to the revisionary institution the executive power ought to be well secured agst legislative usurpations on it the purse  the sword ought never to get into the same hands whether legislative or executive     mr dickinson secrecy vigor  despatch are not the principal properties reqd in the executive important as these are that of responsibility is more so which can only be preserved by leaving it singly to discharge its functions he thought too a junction of the judiciary to it involved an improper mixture of powers mr wilson remarked that the responsibility required belonged to his executive duties the revisionary duty was an extraneous one calculated for collateral purposes mr williamson was for substituting a clause requiring ⅔ for every effective act of the legislature in place of the revisionary provision on the question for joining the judges to the executive in the revisionary business mass no cont ay n y ay n j no pa no del no md no va ay n c no s c no geo no mr pinkney gave notice that tomorrow he should move for the reconsideration of that clause in the sixth resolution adopted by the comme which vests a negative in the national legislature on the laws of the several states the come rose  the house adjd to    oc thursday june  th     —in committee of the whole mr pinkney according to notice moved to reconsider the clause respecting the negative on state     laws which was agreed to and tomorrow for fixed the purpose the clause providing for ye appointment of the  d branch of the national legislature having lain blank since the last vote on the mode of electing it to wit by the  st branch mr dickinson now moved that the members of the  d branch ought to be chosen by the individual legislatures mr sherman seconded the motion observing that the particular states would thus become interested in supporting the national governmt and that a due harmony between the two governments would be maintained he admitted that the two ought to have separate and distinct jurisdictions but that they ought to have a mutual interest in supporting each other mr pinkney if the small states should be allowed one senator only the number will be too great there will be  0 at least mr dickinson had two reasons for his motion   because the sense of the states would be better collected through their governments than immediately from the people at large   because he wished the senate to consist of the most distinguished characters distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property and bearing as strong a likeness to the british house of lords as possible and he thought such characters more likely to be selected by the state legislatures than in any other mode the greatness of the number was no objection with him he hoped there would     be  0 and twice  0 of them if their number should be small the popular branch could not be balanced by them the legislature of a numerous people ought to be a numerous body mr williamson preferred a small number of senators but wished that each state should have at least one he suggested    as a convenient number the different modes of representation in the different branches will serve as a mutual check mr butler was anxious to know the ratio of representation before he gave any opinion mr wilson if we are to establish a national government that government ought to flow from the people at large if one branch of it should be chosen by the legislatures and the other by the people the two branches will rest on different foundations and dissensions will naturally arise between them he wished the senate to be elected by the people as well as the other branch the people might be divided into proper districts for the purpose  moved to postpone the motion of mr dickinson in order to take up one of that import mr morris  ded him mr read proposed that the senate should be appointed by the executive magistrate out of a proper number of persons to be nominated by the individual legislatures he said he thought it his duty to speak his mind frankly gentlemen he hoped would not be alarmed at the idea nothing short of this approach towards a proper model of government would answer the purpose and he     thought it best to come directly to the point at once—his proposition was not seconded nor supported mr madison if the motion of mr dickinson should be agreed to we must either depart from the doctrine of proportional representation or admit into the senate a very large number of members the first is inadmissible being evidently unjust the second is inexpedient the use of the senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness with more system  with more wisdom than the popular branch enlarge their number and you communicate to them the vices which they are meant to correct he differed from mr d who thought that the additional number would give additional weight to the body on the contrary it appeared to him that their weight would be in an inverse ratio to their number the example of the roman tribunes was applicable they lost their influence and power in proportion as their number was augmented the reason seemed to be obvious they were appointed to take care of the popular interests  pretensions at rome because the people by reason of their numbers could not act in concert were liable to fall into factions among themselves and to become a prey to their aristocratic adversaries the more the representatives of the people therefore were multiplied the more they partook of the infirmities of their constituents the more liable they became to be divided among themselves either from their own indiscretions or the artifices of the opposite faction and of course the less     capable of fulfilling their trust when the weight of a set of men depends merely on their personal characters the greater the number the greater the weight when it depends on the degree of political authority lodged in them the smaller the number the greater the weight these considerations might perhaps be combined in the intended senate but the latter was the material one mr gerry   modes of appointing the senate have been mentioned   by the  st branch of the national legislature this would create a dependance contrary to the end proposed   by the national executive this is a stride towards monarchy that few will think of   by the people the people have two great interests the landed interest and the commercial including the stockholders to draw both branches from the people will leave no security to the latter interest the people being chiefly composed of the landed interest and erroneously supposing that the other interests are adverse to it   by the individual legislatures the elections being carried thro this refinement will be most likely to provide some check in favor of the commercial interest agst the landed without which oppression will take place and no free govt can last long where that is the case he was therefore in favor of this last mr dickenson  the preservation of the states     in a certain degree of agency is indispensable it will produce that collision between the different authorities which should be wished for in order to check each other to attempt to abolish the states altogether would degrade the councils of our country would be impracticable would be ruinous he compared the proposed national system to the solar system in which the states were the planets and ought to be left to move freely in their proper orbits the gentleman from pa mr wilson wished he said to extinguish these planets if the state governments were excluded from all agency in the national one and all power drawn from the people at large the consequence would be that the national govt would move in the same direction as the state govts now do and would run into all the same mischiefs the reform would only unite the    small streams into one great current pursuing the same course without any opposition whatever he adhered to the opinion that the senate ought to be composed of a large number and that their influence from family weight  other causes would be increased thereby he did not admit that the tribunes lost their weight in proportion as their no was augmented and gave a historical sketch of this institution if the reasoning of mr madison was good it would prove that the number of the senate ought to be reduced below ten the highest no of the tribunitial corps     mr wilson the subject it must be owned is surrounded with doubts and difficulties but we must surmount them the british governmt cannot be our model we have no materials for a similar one our manners our laws the abolition of entails and of primogeniture the whole genius of the people are opposed to it he did not see the danger of the states being devoured by the nationl govt on the contrary he wished to keep them from devouring the national govt he was not however for extinguishing these planets as was supposed by mr d—neither did he on the other hand believe that they would warm or enlighten the sun within their proper orbits they must still be suffered to act for subordinate purposes for which their existence is made essential by the great extent of our country he could not comprehend in what manner the landed interest wd be rendered less predominant in the senate by an election through the medium of the legislatures than by the people themselves if the legislatures as was now complained sacrificed the commercial to the landed interest what reason was there to expect such a choice from them as would defeat their own views he was for an election by the people in large districts which wd be most likely to obtain men of intelligence  uprightness subdividing the districts only for the accommodation of voters mr madison could as little comprehend in what manner family weight as desired by mr d would be more certainly conveyed into the senate through     elections by the state legislatures than in some other modes the true question was in what mode the best choice wd be made if an election by the people or thro any other channel than the state legislatures promised as uncorrupt  impartial a preference of merit there could surely be no necessity for an appointment by those legislatures nor was it apparent that a more useful check would be derived thro that channel than from the people thro some other the great evils complained of were that the state legislatures run into schemes of paper money c whenever solicited by the people  sometimes without even the sanction of the people their influence then instead of checking a like propensity in the national legislature may be expected to promote it nothing can be more contradictory than to say that the natl legislature witht a proper check will follow the example of the state legislatures  in the same breath that the state legislatures are the only proper check mr sharman opposed elections by the people in districts as not likely to produce such fit men as elections by the state legislatures mr gerry insisted that the commercial  monied interest wd be more secure in the hands of the state legislatures than of the people at large the former have more sense of character and will be restrained by that from injustice the people are for paper money when the legislatures are agst it in massts the county conventions had declared a wish for a depreciating paper that wd sink itself besides     in some states there are two branches in the legislature one of which is somewhat aristocratic there wd therefore be so far a better chance of refinement in the choice there seemed he thought to be three powerful objections agst elections by districts   it is impracticable the people cannot be brought to one place for the purpose and whether brought to the same place or not numberless frauds wd be unavoidable   small states forming part of the same district with a large one or large part of a large one wd have no chance of gaining an appointment for its citizens of merit   a new source of discord wd be opened between different parts of the same district mr pinkney thought the  d branch ought to be permanent  independent  that the members of it wd be rendered more so by receiving their appointment from the state legislatures this mode wd avoid the rivalships  discontents incident to the election by districts he was for dividing the states into three classes according to their respective sizes  for allowing to the  st class three members to the  d two  to

the natl govt in every other department we have studiously endeavoured to provide for its selfdefence shall we leave the states alone unprovided with the means for this purpose and what better means can we provide than the giving them some share in or rather to make them a constituent part of the natl establishment there is danger on both sides no doubt but we have only seen the evils arising on the side of the state govts those on the other side remain to be displayed the example of congs does not apply congs had no power to carry their acts into execution as the natl govt will have on mr

reconsideration of the mode of appointing the natl executive in order to substitute an appointmt by the state executives the committee rose  the house adjd friday june  th in committee of the whole on a reconsideration of the clause giving the natl legislature a negative on such laws of the states as     might be contrary to the articles of union or treaties with foreign nations mr pinkney moved that the national legislature shd have authority to negative all laws which they shd judge to be improper he urged that such a universality of the power was indispensably necessary to render it effectual that the states must be kept in due subordination to the nation that if the states were left to act of themselves in any case it wd be impossible to defend the national prerogatives however extensive they might be on paper that the acts of congress had been defeated by this means nor had foreign treaties escaped repeated violations that this universal negative was in fact the corner stone of an efficient national govt that under the british govt the negative of the crown had been found beneficial and the states are more one nation now than the colonies were then mr madison seconded the motion he could not but regard an indefinite power to negative legislative acts of the states as absolutely necessary to a perfect system experience had evinced a constant tendency in the states to encroach on the federal authority to violate national treaties to infringe the rights  interests of each other to oppress the weaker party within their respective jurisdictions a negative was the mildest expedient that could be devised for preventing these mischiefs the existence of such a check would prevent attempts to commit them should no such precaution be engrafted the only remedy wd lie in an appeal to coercion was     such a remedy eligible was it practicable could the national resources if exerted to the utmost enforce a national decree agst massts abetted perhaps by several of her neighbours it wd not be possible a small proportion of the community in a compact situation acting on the defensive and at one of its extremities might at any time bid defiance to the national authority any govt for the u states formed on the supposed practicability of using force agst the unconstitutional proceedings of the states wd prove as visionary  fallacious as the govt of congs the negative wd render the use of force unnecessary the states cd of themselves pass no operative act any more than one branch of a legislature where there are two branches can proceed without the other but in order to give the negative this efficacy it must extend to all cases a discrimination wd only be a fresh source of contention between the two authorities in a word to recur to the illustrations borrowed from the planetary system this prerogative of the general govt is the great pervading principle that must controul the centrifugal tendency of the states which without it will continually fly out of their proper orbits and destroy the order  harmony of the political system mr williamson was agst giving a power that might restrain the states from regulating their internal police mr gerry cd not see the extent of such a power and was agst every power that was not necessary he     thought a remonstrance agst unreasonable acts of the states wd reclaim them if it shd not force might be resorted to he had no objection to authorize a negative to paper money and similar measures when the confederation was depending before congress massachusetts was then for inserting the power of emitting paper money amg the exclusive powers of congress he observed that the proposed negative wd extend to the regulations of the militia a matter on which the existence of a state might depend the natl legislature with such a power may enslave the states such an idea as this will never be acceded to it has never been suggested or conceived among the people no speculative projector and there are eno of that character among us in politics as well as in other things has in any pamphlet or newspaper thrown out the idea the states too have different interests and are ignorant of each others interests the negative therefore will be abused new states too having separate views from the old states will never come into the union they may even be under some foreign influence are they in such case to participate in the negative on the will of the other states mr sherman thought the cases in which the negative ought to be exercised might be defined he wished the point might not be decided till a trial at least shd be made for that purpose mr wilson would not say what modifications of the proposed power might be practicable or expedient but however novel it might appear the     principle of it when viewed with a close  steady eye is right there is no instance in which the laws say that the individual shd be bound in one case  at liberty to judge whether he will obey or disobey in another the cases are parallel abuses of the power over the individual person may happen as well as over the individual states federal liberty is to the states what civil liberty is to private individuals and states are not more unwilling to purchase it by the necessary concession of their political sovereignty that the savage is to purchase civil liberty by the surrender of the personal sovereignty which he enjoys in a state of nature a definition of the cases in which the negative should be exercised is impracticable a discretion must be left on one side or the other will it not be most safely lodged on the side of the natl govt among the first sentiments expressed in the first congs one was that virga is no more that massts is no more that pa is no more c we are now one nation of brethren we must bury all local interests  distinctions this language continued for some time the tables at length began to turn no sooner were the state govts formed than their jealousy  ambition began to display themselves each endeavoured to cut a slice from the common loaf to add to its own morsel till at length the confederation became frittered down to the impotent condition in which it now stands review the progress of the articles of confederation thro congress  compare the first  last draught of it to correct its vices is the business of     this convention one of its vices is the want of an effectual controul in the whole over its parts what danger is there that the whole will unnecessarily sacrifice a part but reverse the case and leave the whole at the mercy of each part and will not the general interest be continually sacrificed to local interests mr dickenson deemed it impossible to draw a line between the cases proper  improper for the exercise of the negative we must take our choice of two things we must either subject the states to the danger of being injured by the power of the natl govt or the latter to the danger of being injured by that of the states he thought the danger greater from the states to leave the power doubtful would be opening another spring of discord and he was for shutting as many of them as possible mr bedford in answer to his colleagues question where wd be the danger to the states from this power would refer him to the smallness of his own state which may be injured at pleasure without redress it was meant he found to strip the small states of their equal right of suffrage in this case delaware would have about   0 for its share in the general councils whilst pa  va would possess ⅓ of the whole is there no difference of interests no rivalship of commerce of manufactures will not these large states crush the small ones whenever they stand in the way of their ambitious or interested views this shews the impossibility of adopting such a system as that on the table or any other founded on a change in the     priñple of representation and after all if a state does not obey the law of the new system must not force be resorted to as the only ultimate remedy in this as in any other system it seems as if pa  va by the conduct of their deputies wished to provide a system in which they would have an enormous  monstrous influence besides how can it be thought that the proposed negative can be exercised are the laws of the states to be suspended in the most urgent cases until they can be sent seven or eight hundred miles and undergo the deliberation of a body who may be incapable of judging of them is the national legislature too to sit continually in order to revise the laws of the states mr madison observed that the difficulties which had been started were worthy of attention and ought to be answered before the question was put the case of laws of urgent necessity must be provided for by some emanation of the power from the natl govt into each state so far as to give a temporary assent at least this was the practice in the royal colonies before the revolution and would not have been inconvenient if the supreme power of negativing had been faithful to the american interest and had possessed the necessary information he supposed that the negative might be very properly lodged in the senate alone and that the more numerous  expensive branch therefore might not be obliged to sit constantly he asked mr b what would be the consequence to the small states of a dissolution of the union wch seemed likely to happen if no effectual     substitute was made for the defective system existing and he did not conceive any effectual system could be substituted on any other basis than that of a proportional suffrage if the large states possessed the avarice  ambition with which they were charged would the small ones in their neighbourhood be more secure when all controul of a genl govt was withdrawn mr butler was vehement agst the negative in the proposed extent as cutting off all hope of equal justice to the distant states the people there would not he was sure give it a

national executive the reconsideration being voted for by all the states except connecticut  n carolina mr pinkney and mr rutlidge moved to add to the resoln   agreed to by the come the following viz that the states be divided into three classes the  st class to have   members the  d two  the  d one member each that an estimate be taken of the comparative importance of each state at fixed periods so as to ascertain the number of members they     may from time to time be entitled to the committee then rose and the house adjourned saturday june  th  mr luther martin from maryland took his seat in committee of the whole mr gerry according to previous notice given by     him moved that the national executive should be elected by the executives of the states whose proportion of votes should be the same with that allowed to the states in the election of the senate if the appointmt should be made by the natl legislature it would lessen that independence of the executive which ought to prevail would give birth to intrigue and corruption between the executive  legislature previous to the election and to partiality in the executive afterwards to the friends who promoted him some other mode therefore appeared to him necessary he proposed that of appointing by the state executives as most analogous to the principle observed in electing the other branches of the natl govt the first branch being chosen by the people of the states  the  d by the legislatures of the states he did not see any objection agst letting the executive be appointed by the executives of the states he supposed the executives would be most likely to select the fittest men and that it would be their interest to support the man of their own choice mr randolph urged strongly the inexpediency of mr gerrys mode of appointing the natl executive the confidence of the people would not be secured by it to the natl magistrate the small states would lose all chance of an appointmt from within themselves bad appointments would be made the executives of the states being little conversant with characters not within their own small spheres the state executives too notwithstanding their constitutional independence being in fact dependent on   0 the state legislatures will generally be guided by the views of the latter and prefer either favorites within the states or such as it may be expected will be most partial to the interests of the state a natl executive thus chosen will not be likely to defend with becoming vigilance  firmness the national rights agst state encroachments vacancies also must happen how can these be filled he could not suppose either that the executives would feel the interest in supporting the natl executive which had been imagined they will not cherish the great oak which is to reduce them to paltry shrubs on the question for referring the appointment of the natl executive to the state executives as propd by mr gerry massts no cont no n y no n j no pa no del divd md no va no s c no geo no  mr patterson moves that the committee resume the clause relating to the rule of suffrage in the natl legislature mr brearly  seconds him he was sorry he said that any question on this point was brought into view it had been much agitated in congs at the     time of forming the confederation and was then rightly settled by allowing to each sovereign state an equal vote otherwise the smaller states must have been destroyed instead of being saved the substitution of a ratio he admitted carried fairness on the face of it but on a deeper examination was unfair and unjust judging of the disparity of the states by the quota of congs virga would have    votes and georgia but one a like proportion to the others will make the whole number ninety there will be   large states and  0 small ones the large states by which he meant massts pena  virga will carry every thing before them it had been admitted and was known to him from facts within n jersey that where large  small counties were united into a district for electing representatives for the district the large counties always carried their point and consequently that the large states would do so virga with her sixteen votes will be a solid column indeed a formidable phalanx while georgia with her solitary vote and the other little states will be obliged to throw themselves constantly into the scale of some large one in order to have any weight at all he had come to the convention with a view of being as useful as he could in giving energy and stability to the federal government when the proposition for destroying the equality of votes came forward he was astonished he was alarmed is it fair then it will be asked that georgia should have an equal vote with virga he would not say it was what remedy then one only that a map of the     u s be spread out that all the existing boundaries be erased and that a new partition of the whole be made into    equal parts mr patterson considered the proposition for a proportional representation as striking at the existence of the lesser states he wd premise however to an investigation of this question some remarks on the nature structure and powers of the convention the convention he said was formed in pursuance of an act of congs that this act was recited in several of the commissions particularly that of massts which he required to be read that the amendment of the confederacy was the object of all the laws and commissions on the subject that the articles of the confederation were therefore the proper basis of all the proceedings of the convention we ought to keep within its limits or we should be charged by our constituents with usurpation that the people of america were sharpsighted and not to be deceived but the commissions under which we acted were not only the measure of our power they denoted also the sentiments of the states on the subject of our deliberation the idea of a national govt as contradistinguished from a federal one never entered into the mind of any of them and to the public mind we must accommodate ourselves we have no power to go beyond the federal scheme and if we had the people are not ripe for any other we must follow the people the people will not follow us—the proposition could not be maintained whether considered in reference to us as a nation or as a confederacy     a confederacy supposes sovereignty in the members composing it  sovereignty supposes equality if we are to be considered as a nation all state distinctions must be abolished the whole must be thrown into hotchpot and when an equal division is made then there may be fairly an equality of representation he held up virga massts  pa as the three large states and the other ten as small ones repeating the calculations of mr brearly as to the disparity of votes which wd take place and affirming that the small states would never agree to it he said there was no more reason that a great individual state contributing much should have more votes than a small one contributing little than that a rich individual citizen should have more votes than an indigent one if the rateable property of a was to that of b as  0 to   ought a for that reason to have  0 times as many votes as b such a principle would never be admitted and if it were admitted would put b entirely at the mercy of a as a has more to be protected than b so he ought to contribute more for the common protection the same may be said of a large state wch has more to be protected than a small one give the large states an influence in proportion to their magnitude and what will be the consequence their ambition will be proportionally increased and the small states will have every thing to fear it was once proposed by galloway  some others that america should be represented in the british parlt and then be bound by its laws america could not have been entitled     to more than ⅓ of the no of representatives which would fall to the share of g b would american rights  interests have been safe under an authority thus constituted it has been said that if a natl govt is to be formed so as to operate on the people and not on the states the representatives ought to be drawn from the people but why so may not a legislature filled by the state legislatures operate on the people who chuse the state legislatures or may not a practicable coercion be found he admitted that there was none such in the existing system—he was attached strongly to the plan of the existing confederacy in which the people chuse their legislative representatives and the legislatures their federal representatives no other amendments were wanting than to mark the orbits of the states with due precision and provide for the use of coercion which was the great point he alluded to the hint thrown out heretofore by mr wilson of the necessity to which the large states might be reduced of confederating among themselves by a refusal of the others to concur let them unite if they please but let them remember that they have no authority to compel the others to unite n jersey will never confederate on the plan before the committee she would be swallowed up he had rather submit to a monarch to a despot than to such a fate he would not only oppose the plan here but on his return home do every thing in his power to defeat it there mr wilson hoped if the confederacy should be dissolved that a majority that a minority of the     states would unite for their safety he entered elaborately into the defence of a proportional representation stating for his first position that as all authority was derived from the people equal numbers of people ought to have an equal no of representatives and different numbers of people different numbers of representatives this principle had been improperly violated in the confederation owing to the urgent circumstances of the time as to the case of a  b stated by mr patterson he observed that in districts as large as the states the number of people was the best measure of their comparative wealth whether therefore wealth or numbers were to form the ratio it would be the same mr p admitted persons not property to be the measure of suffrage are not the citizens of pena equal to those of n jersey does it require   0 of the former to balance  0 of the latter representatives of different districts ought clearly to hold the same proportion to each other as their respective constituents hold to each other if the small states will not confederate on this plan pena  he presumed some other states would not confederate on any other we have been told that each state being sovereign all are equal so each man is naturally a sovereign over himself and all men are therefore naturally equal can he retain this equality when he becomes a member of civil government he can not as little can a sovereign state when it becomes a member of a federal governt if n j will not part with her sovereignty it is vain to talk of govt a new     partition of the states is desirable but evidently  totally impracticable mr williamson illustrated the cases by a comparison of the different states to counties of different sizes within the same state observing that proportional representation was admitted to be just in the latter case and could not therefore be fairly contested in the former the question being about to be put mr patterson hoped that as so much depended on it it might be thought best to postpone the decision till tomorrow which was done nem con the come rose  the house adjourned monday june   th mr abraham baldwin from georgia took his seat in committee of the whole the clause concerning the rule of suffrage in the natl legislature postponed on saturday was resumed mr sharman proposed that the proportion of suffrage in the  st branch should be according to the respective numbers of free inhabitants and that in the second branch or senate each state should have one vote and no more he said as the states would remain possessed of certain individual rights each state ought to be able to protect itself otherwise a few large states will rule the rest the house of lords in england he observed had certain particular rights under the constitution and hence they have an equal vote with the house of commons that they may be able to defend their rights     mr rutlidge proposed that the proportion of suffrage in the  st branch should be according to the quotas of contribution the justice of this rule he said could not be contested mr butler urged the same idea adding that money was power and that the states ought to have weight in the govt in proportion to their wealth mr king  mr wilson  in order to bring the question to a point moved that the right of suffrage in the first branch of the national legislature ought not to be according to the rule established in the articles of confederation but according to some equitable ratio of representation the clause so far as it related to suffrage in the first branch was postponed in order to consider this motion mr dickenson contended for the actual contributions of the states as the rule of their representation  suffrage in the first branch by thus connecting the interests of the states with their duty the latter would be sure to be performed mr king remarked that it was uncertain what mode might be used in levying a national revenue but that it was probable imposts would be one source of it if the actual contributions were to be the rule the nonimporting states as cont  n jersey wd be in a bad situation indeed it might so happen that they wd have no representation this situation of particular states had been always one powerful argument in favor of the   per ct impost     the question being abt to be put docr franklin sd he had thrown his ideas of the matter on a paper wch mr wilson read to the committee in the words following—mr chairman it has given me great pleasure to observe that till this point the proportion of representation came before us our debates were carried on with great coolness  temper if any thing of a contrary kind has on this occasion appeared i hope it will not be repeated for we are sent here to consult not to contend with each other and declarations of a fixed opinion and of determined resolution never to change it neither enlighten nor convince us positiveness and warmth on one side naturally beget their like on the other and tend to create and augment discord  division in a great concern wherein harmony  union are extremely necessary to give weight to our councils and render them effectual in promoting  securing the common good i must own that i was originally of opinion it would be better if every member of congress or our national council were to consider himself rather as a representative of the whole than as an agent for the interests of a particular state in which case the proportion of members for each state would be of less consequence  it would not be very material whether they voted by states or individually but as i find this is not to be expected i now think the number of representatives should bear some proportion to the number of the represented and that the decisions shd be by the majority of members not     by the majority of the states this is objected to from an apprehension that the greater states would then swallow up the smaller i do not at present clearly see what advantage the greater states could propose to themselves by swallowing up the smaller and therefore do not apprehend they would attempt it i recollect that in the beginning of this century when the union was proposed of the two kingdoms england  scotland the scotch patriots were full of fears that unless they had an equal number of representatives in parliament they should be ruined by the superiority of the english they finally agreed however that the different proportions of importance in the union of the two nations should be attended to whereby they were to have only forty members in the house of commons and only sixteen in the house of lords a very great inferiority of numbers and yet to this day i do not recollect that any thing has been done in the parliament of great britain to the prejudice of scotland and whoever looks over the lists of public officers civil  military of that nation will find i believe that the north britons enjoy at least their full proportion of emolument but sir in the present mode of voting by states it is equally in the power of the lesser states to swallow up the greater and this is mathematically demonstrable suppose for example that   smaller states had each   members in the house and the   larger to have one with another   members and that upon a question two members of each smaller state   0 should be in the affirmative and one in the negative they would make affirmatives    negatives   and that all the larger states should be unanimously in the negative they would make  negatives    in all      it is then apparent that the    carry the question against the    and the minority overpowers the majority contrary to the common practice of assemblies in all countries and ages the greater states sir are naturally as unwilling to have their property left in the disposition of the smaller as the smaller are to have theirs in the disposition of the greater an honorable gentleman has to avoid this difficulty hinted a proposition of equalizing the states it appears to me an equitable one and i should for my own part not be against such a measure if it might be found practicable formerly indeed when almost every province had a different constitution some with greater others with fewer privileges it was of importance to the borderers when their boundaries were contested whether by running the division lines they were placed on one side or the other at present when such differences are done away it is less material the interest of a state is made up of the interests of its individual members if they are not injured the state is not injured small states are     more easily well  happily governed than large ones if therefore in such an equal division it should be found necessary to diminish pennsylvania i should not be averse to the giving a part of it to n jersey and another to delaware but as there would probably be considerable difficulties in adjusting such a division and however equally made at first it would be continually varying by the augmentation of inhabitants in some states and their fixed proportion in others and thence frequent occasion for new divisions i beg leave to propose for the consideration of the committee another mode which appears to me to be as equitable more easily carried into practice and more permanent in its nature let the weakest state say what proportion of money or force it is able and willing to furnish for the general purposes of the union let all the others oblige themselves to furnish each an equal proportion the whole of these joint supplies to be absolutely in the disposition of congress the congress in this case to be composed of an equal number of delegates from each state and their decisions to be by the majority of individual members voting if these joint and equal supplies should on particular occasions not be sufficient let congress make requisitions on the richer and more powerful states for further aids to be voluntarily afforded leaving to each state the right of considering the necessity     and utility of the aid desired and of giving more or less as it should be found proper this mode is not new it was formerly practised with success by the british government with respect to ireland and the colonies we sometimes gave even more than they expected or thought just to accept and in the last war carried on while we were united they gave us back in   years a million sterling we should probably have continued such voluntary contributions whenever the occasions appeared to require them for the common good of the empire it was not till they chose to force us and to deprive us of the merit and pleasure of voluntary contributions that we refused  resisted those contributions however were to be disposed of at the pleasure of a government in which we had no representative i am therefore persuaded that they will not be refused to one in which the representation shall be equal my learned colleague mr wilson has already mentioned that the present method of voting by states was submitted to originally by congress under a conviction of its impropriety inequality and injustice this appears in the words of their resolution it is of sepr        the words are resolved that in determining questions in this congs each colony or province shall have one vote the congs not being possessed of or at present able to procure materials for ascertaining the importance of each colony     on the

age sex  condition including those bound to servitude for a term of years and three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing description except indians not paying taxes in each state this being the rule in the act of congress agreed to by eleven states for apportioning quotas of revenue on the states and requiring a census only every     or  0 years mr gerry thought property

constitution  its existing laws ought to be guaranteed to each state by the u states the whole was agreed to nem con  resolution    for amending the national constitution hereafter without consent of the natl legislature being considered several members did not see the necessity of the resolution at all nor the propriety of making the consent of the natl legisl unnecessary col mason urged the necessity of such a provision the plan now to be formed will certainly be defective as the confederation has been found on trial to be amendments therefore will be necessary and it will be better to provide for them in an easy regular and constitutional way than to trust to chance and violence it would be improper to require the consent of the natl legislature because they may     abuse their power and refuse their consent on that very account the opportunity for such an abuse may be the fault of the constitution calling for amendmt mr randolph enforced these arguments the words without requiring the consent of the natl legislature were postponed the other provision in the clause passed nem con resolution    requiring oaths from the members of the state govts to observe the natl constitution  laws being considered  mr sharman opposed it as unnecessarily intruding into the state jurisdictions mr randolph considered it necessary to prevent that competition between the national constitution  laws  those of the particular states which had already been felt the officers of the states are already under oath to the states to preserve a due impartiality they ought to be equally bound to the natl govt the natl authority needs every support we can give it the executive  judiciary of the states notwithstanding their nominal independence on the state legislatures are in fact so dependent on them that unless they be brought under some tie to the natl system they will always lean too much to the state systems whenever a contest arises between the two mr gerry did not like the clause he thought     there was as much reason for requiring an oath of fidelity to the states from natl officers as vice versa mr luther martin moved to strike out the words requiring such an oath from the state officers viz within the several states observing that if the new oath should be contrary to that already taken by them it would be improper if coincident the oaths already taken will be

on some question mr rutlidge proposed every two years mr jennifer  propd every three years observing that the too great frequency of elections rendered the people indifferent to them and made the best men unwilling to engage in so precarious a service mr madison seconded the motion for three years instability is one of the great vices of our republics to be remedied three years will be necessary in a government so extensive for members to form any knowledge of the various interests of the states to which they do not belong and of which they can know but little from the situation and affairs of their own one year will be almost consumed in preparing for and travelling to  from the seat of national business mr gerry the people of new england will never give up the point of annual elections they know of the transition made in england from triennial     to septennial elections and will consider such an innovation here as the prelude to a like usurpation he considered annual elections as the only defence of the people agst tyranny he was as much agst a triennial house as agst a hereditary executive mr madison observed that if the opinions of the people were to be our guide it wd be difficult to say what course we ought to take no member of the convention could say what the opinions of his constituents were at this time much less could he say what they would think if possessed of the information  lights possessed by the members here  still less what would be their way of thinking   or    months hence we ought to consider what was right  necessary in itself for the attainment of a proper governmt a plan adjusted to this idea will recommend itself—the respectability of this convention will give weight to their recommendation of it experience will be constantly urging the adoption of it and all the most enlightened  respectable citizens will be its advocates should we fall short of the necessary  proper point this influential class of citizens will be turned against the plan and little support in opposition to them can be gained to it from the unreflecting multitude mr gerry repeated his opinion that it was necessary to consider what the people would approve this had been the policy of all legislators if the reasoning of mr madison were just and we supposed a limited monarchy the best form in itself we ought to recommend it tho the genius of the people   0 was decidedly adverse to it and having no hereditary distinctions among us we were destitute of the essential materials for such an innovation on the question for the triennial election of the  st branch

to be provided for by the state legisls because it would create an improper dependence and to leave them to regulate their own wages was an indecent thing and might in time prove a dangerous one he thought wheat or some other article of which the average price throughout a reasonable period preceding might be settled in some convenient mode would form a proper standard col mason seconded the motion adding that it would be improper for other reasons to leave the wages to be regulated by the states   the different states would make different provision for their representatives and an inequality would be felt among them whereas he thought they ought to be in all respects equal   the parsimony of the states might reduce the provision so low that as had already happened in choosing

mr pierce proposed   years   years would raise an alarm great mischiefs had arisen in england from their septennial act which was reprobated by most of their patriotic statesmen mr randolph was for the term of   years the democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures proved the necessity of a firm senate the object of this  d branch is to controul the democratic branch of the natl legislature if it be not a firm body the other branch being more numerous and coming immediately from the people will overwhelm it the senate of maryland constituted on like principles had been scarcely able to stem the popular torrent no mischief can be apprehended as the concurrence of the other branch and in some measure of the executive will in all cases be necessary a firmness  independence may be the more necessary also in this branch as it ought to guard the constitution agst encroachments of the executive who will be apt to form combinations with the demagogues of the popular branch mr madison considered   years as a term by no     means too long what we wished was to give to the govt that stability which was every where called for and which the enemies of the republican form alledged to be inconsistent with its nature he was not afraid of giving too much stability by the term of seven years his fear was that the popular branch would still be too great an overmatch for it it was to be much lamented that we had so little direct experience to guide us the constitution of maryland was the only one that bore any analogy to this part of the plan in no instance had the senate of maryd created just suspicions of danger from it in some instances perhaps it may have erred by yielding to the h of delegates in every instance of their opposition to the measures of the h of d they had had with them the suffrages of the most enlightened and impartial people of the other states as well as of their own in the states where the senates were chosen in the same manner as the other branches of the legislature and held their seats for   years the institution was found to be no check whatever agst the instabilities of the other branches he conceived it to be of great importance that a stable  firm govt organized in the republican form should be held out to the people if this be not done and the people be left to judge of this species of govt by ye operations of the defective systems under which they now live it is much to be feared the time is not distant when in universal disgust they will renounce the blessing which they have purchased at so

order to leave full room for their organization mr randolph  mr madison then moved the following resolution respecting a national judiciary     viz that the jurisdiction of the national judiciary shall extend to cases which respect the collection of the national revenue impeachments of any national officers and questions which involve the national peace and harmony which was agreed to mr pinkney  mr sherman moved to insert after the words one supreme tribunal the words the judges of which to be appointed by the national legislature mr madison objected to an appt by the whole legislature many of them were incompetent judges of the requisite qualifications they were too much influenced by their partialities the candidate who was present who had displayed a talent for business in the legislative field who had perhaps assisted ignorant members in business of their own     or of their constituents or used other winning means would without any of the essential qualifications for an expositor of the laws prevail over a competitor not having these recommendations but possessed of every necessary accomplishment he proposed that the appointment should be made by the senate which as a less numerous  more select body would be more competent judges and which was sufficiently numerous to justify such a confidence in them mr sharman  mr pinkney withdrew their motion and the appt by the senate was agd to nem con mr gerry moved to restrain the senatorial branch from originating money bills the other branch was more immediately the representatives of the people and it was a maxim that the people ought to hold the pursestrings if the senate should be allowed to originate such bills they wd repeat the experiment till chance should furnish a sett of representatives in the other branch who will fall into their snares mr butler saw no reason for such a discrimination we were always following the british constitution when the reason of it did not apply there was no analogy between the h of lords and the body proposed to be established if the senate should be degraded by any such discriminations the best men would be apt to decline serving in it in favor of the other branch and it will lead the latter into the practice of tacking other clauses to money bills     mr madison observed that the comentators on the brit const had not yet agreed on the reason of the restriction on the h of l in money bills certain it was there could be no similar reason in the case before us the senate would be the representatives of the people as well as the  st branch if they sd have any dangerous influence over it they would easily prevail on some member of the latter to originate the bill they wished to be passed as the senate would be generally a more capable sett of men it wd be wrong to disable them from any preparation of the business especially of that which was most important and in our republics worse prepared than any other the gentleman in pursuance of his principle ought to carry the restraint to the amendment as well as the originating of money bills since an addition of a given sum wd be equivalent to a distinct proposition of it mr king differed from mr gerry and concurred in the objections to the proposition mr read favored the proposition but would not extend the restraint to the case of amendments mr pinkney thinks the question premature if the senate shd be formed on the same proportional representation as it stands at present they sd have equal power otherwise if a different principle sd be introduced mr sherman as both branches must concur there can be no danger whichever way the senate be formed we establish two branches in order to get more wisdom which is particularly needed in   0 the finance business—the senate bear their share of the taxes and are also the representatives of the people what a man does by another he does by himself is a maxim in cont both branches can originate in all cases and it has been found safe  convenient whatever might have been the reason of the rule as to the h of lords it is clear that no good arises from it now even there genl pinkney this distinction prevails in s c and has been a source of pernicious disputes between ye   branches the constitution is now evaded by informal schedules of amendments handed from ye senate to the other house mr williamson wishes for a question chiefly to prevent rediscussion the restriction will have one advantage it will oblige some member in the lower branch to move  people can then mark him on the

order to place the two plans in due comparison the other should be recommitted at the earnest request of mr lansing   some other gentlemen it was also agreed that the convention should not go into

saturday june    in committee of the whole on resolutions proposd by mr p  mr r mr lansing called for the reading of the  st resolution of each plan which he considered as involving principles directly in contrast that of mr patterson says he sustains the sovereignty of the respective states that of mr randolph destroys it the latter requires a negative on all the laws of the particular states the former only certain general powers for the general good the plan of mr r in short absorbs all power except what may be exercised in the little local matters of the states which are not objects worthy of the supreme cognizance he grounded his preference of mr ps plan chiefly on two objections agst that of mr r   want of power in the convention to discuss  propose it   the improbability of its being adopted   he was decidedly of opinion that the power of the convention was restrained to amendments of a federal nature and having for their basis the confederacy in being the act of congress the tenor of the acts of the states the com̃issions produced by the several deputations all proved this and this limitation of the power to an amendment of the confederacy marked the opinion of the states that it was unnecessary  improper to go farther he was sure that this was the case with his state n york     would never have concurred in sending deputies to the convention if she had supposed the deliberations were to turn on a consolidation of the states and a national government   was it probable that the states would adopt  ratify a scheme which they had never authorized us to propose and which so far exceeded what they regarded as sufficient we see by their several acts particularly in relation to the plan of revenue proposed by cong in      not authorized by the articles of confederation what were the ideas they then entertained can so great a change be supposed to have already taken place to rely on any change which is hereafter to take place in the sentiments of the people would be trusting to too great an uncertainty we know only what their present sentiments are and it is in vain to propose what will not accord with these the states will never feel a sufficient confidence in a general government to give it a negative on their laws the scheme is itself totally novel there is no parallel to it to be found the authority of congress is familiar to the people and an augmentation of the powers of congress will be readily approved by them mr patterson said as he had on a former occasion given his sentiments on the plan proposed by mr r he would now avoiding repetition as much as possible give his reasons in favor of that proposed by himself he preferred it because it accorded   with the powers of the convention   with the sentiments of the people if the confederacy was radically     wrong let us return to our states and obtain larger powers not assume them ourselves i came here not to speak my own sentiments but the sentiments of those who sent me our object is not such a governmt as may be best in itself but such a one as our constituents have authorized us to prepare and as they will approve if we argue the matter on the supposition that no confederacy at present exists it can not be denied that all the states stand on the footing of equal sovereignty all therefore must concur before any can be bound if a proportional representation be right why do we not vote so here if we argue on the fact that a federal compact actually exists and consult the articles of it we still find an equal sovereignty to be the basis of it he reads the  th art of confederation giving each state a vote— the   th declaring that no alteration shall be made without unanimous consent this is the nature of all treaties what is unanimously done must be unanimously undone it was observed by mr wilson that the larger state gave up the point not because it was right but because the circumstances of the moment urged the concession be it so are they for that reason at liberty to take it back can the donor resume his gift without the consent of the donee this doctrine may be convenient but it is a doctrine that will sacrifice the lesser states the larger states acceded readily to the confederacy it was the small ones that came in reluctantly and slowly n jersey  maryland were the two last the former     objecting to the want of power in congress over trade both of them to the want of power to appropriate the vacant territory to the benefit of the whole—if the sovereignty of the states is to be maintained the representatives must be drawn immediately from the states not from the people and we have no power to vary the idea of equal sovereignty the only expedient that will cure the difficulty is that of throwing the states into hotchpot to say that this is impracticable will not make it so let it be tried and we shall see whether the citizens of massts pena  va accede to it it will be objected that coercion will be impracticable but will it be more so in one plan than the other its efficacy will depend on the quantum of power collected not on its being drawn from the states or from the individuals and according to his plan it may be exerted on individuals as well as according that of mr r a distinct executive  judiciary also were equally provided by his plan it is urged that two branches in the legislature are necessary why for the purpose of a check but the reason of the precaution is not applicable to this case within a particular state where party heats prevail such a check may be necessary in such a body as congress it is less necessary and besides the delegations of the different states are checks on each other do the people at large complain of congs no what they wish is that congs may have more power if the power now proposed be not eno the people hereafter will make additions to it with     proper powers congs will act with more energy  wisdom than the proposed natl legislature being fewer in number and more secreted  refined by the mode of election the plan of mr r will also be enormously expensive allowing georgia  del two representatives each in the popular branch the aggregate number of that branch will be   0 add to it half as many for the other branch and you have   0 coming once at least a year from the most distant as well as the most central parts of the republic in the present deranged state of our finances can so expensive a system be seriously thought of by enlarging the powers of congs the greatest part of this expence will be saved and all purposes will be answered at least a trial ought to be made mr wilson entered into a contrast of the principal points of the two plans so far he said as there had been time to examine the one last proposed these points were   in the virga plan there are    in some degree   branches in the legislature in the plan from n j there is to be a single legislature only—  representation of the people at large is the basis of one the state legislatures the pillars of the other—  proportional representation prevails in one—equality of suffrage in the other—  a single executive magistrate is at the head of the one—a plurality is held out in the other—  in the one the majority of the people of the u s must prevail—in the other a minority may prevail   the natl legislature is to make laws in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent —in place of     this congs are to have additional power in a few cases only—  a negative on the laws of the states—in place of this coertion to be substituted—  the executive to be removable on impeachment  conviction—in one plan in the other to be removable at the instance of a majority of the executives of the states—  revision of the laws provided for in one—no such check in the other— 0 inferior national tribunals in one—none such in the other    in one ye jurisdiction of natl tribunals to extend c— an appellate jurisdiction only allowed in the other    here the jurisdiction is to extend to all cases affecting the nationl peace  harmony there a few cases only are marked out    finally ye ratification is in this to be by the people themselves—in that by the legislative authorities according to the    art of the confederation with regard to the power of the convention he conceived himself authorized to conclude nothing but to be at liberty to propose any thing in this particular he felt himself perfectly indifferent to the two plans with regard to the sentiments of the people he conceived it difficult to know precisely what they are those of the particular circle in which one moved were commonly mistaken for the general voice he could not persuade himself that the state govts  sovereignties were so much the idols of the people nor a natl govt so obnoxious to them as some supposed why sd a natl govt be unpopular has it less dignity will each citizen enjoy under it less     liberty or protection will a citizen of delaware be degraded by becoming a citizen of the united states where do the people look at present for relief from the evils of which they complain is it from an internal reform of their govts no sir it is from the natl councils that relief is expected for these reasons he did not fear that the people would not follow us into a national govt and it will be a further recommendation of mr rs plan that it is to be submitted to them and not to the legislatures for ratification proceeding now to the  st point on which he had contrasted the two plans he observed that anxious as he was for some augmentation of the federal powers it would be with extreme reluctance indeed that he could ever consent to give powers to congs he had two reasons either of wch was sufficient   congs as a legislative body does not stand on the people   it is a single body  he would not repeat the remarks he had formerly made on the principles of representation he would only say that an inequality in it has ever been a poison contaminating every branch of govt in g britain where this poison has had a full operation the security of private rights is owing entirely to the purity of her tribunals of justice the judges of which are neither appointed nor paid by a venal parliament the political liberty of that nation owing to the inequality of representation is at the mercy of its rulers he means not to insinuate that there is any parallel between the situation of that country  ours at present but     it is a lesson we ought not to disregard that the smallest bodies in g b are notoriously the most corrupt every other source of influence must also be stronger in small that large bodies of men when lord chesterfield had told us that one of the dutch provinces had been seduced into the views of france he need not have added that it was not holland but one of the smallest of them there are facts among ourselves which are known to all passing over others he will only remark that the impost so anxiously wished for by the public was defeated not by any of the larger states in the union   congress is a single legislature despotism comes on mankind in different shapes sometimes in an executive sometimes in a military one is there no danger of a legislative despotism theory  practice both proclaim it if the legislative authority be not restrained there can be neither liberty nor stability and it can only be restrained by dividing it within itself into distinct and independent branches in a single house there is no check but the inadequate one of the virtue  good sense of those who compose it on another great point the contrast was equally favorable to the plan reported by the committee of the whole it vested the executive powers in a single magistrate the plan of n jersey vested them in a plurality in order to controul the legislative authority you must divide it in order to controul the executive you must unite it one man will be more responsible than three three will contend     among themselves till one becomes the master of his colleagues in the triumvirates of rome first cæsar then augustus are witnesses of this truth the kings of sparta  the consuls of rome prove also the factious consequences of dividing the executive magistracy having already taken up so much time he wd not he sd proceed to any of the other points those on which he had dwelt are sufficient of themselves and on the decision of them the fate of the others will depend mr pinkney  the whole comes to this as he conceived give n jersey an equal vote and she will dismiss her scruples and concur in the natl system he thought the convention authorized to go any length in recommending which they found necessary to remedy the evils which produced this convention mr elseworth proposed as a more distinctive form of collecting the mind of the committee on the subject that the legislative power of the u s should remain in congs this was not seconded though it seemed better calculated for the purpose than the  st proposition of mr patterson in place of which mr e wished to substitute it mr randolph was not scrupulous on the point of power when the salvation of the republic was at stake it would be treason to our trust not to propose what we found necessary he painted in strong colours the imbecility of the existing confederacy  the danger of delaying a substantial   0 reform in answer to the objection drawn from the sense of our constituents as denoted by their acts relating to the convention and the objects of their deliberation he observed that as each state acted separately in the case it would have been indecent for it to have charged the existing constitution with all the vices which it might have perceived in it the first state that set on foot this experiment would not have been justified in going so far ignorant as it was of the opinion of others and sensible as it must have been of the uncertainty of a successful issue to the experiment there are certainly reasons of a peculiar nature where the ordinary cautions must be dispensed with and this is certainly one of them he wd not as far as depended on him leave any thing that seemed necessary undone the present moment is favorable and is probably the last that will offer the true question is whether we shall adhere to the federal plan or introduce the national plan the insufficiency of the former has been fully displayed by the trial already made there are but two modes by which the end of a genl govt can be attained the  st is by coercion as proposed by mr ps plan   by real legislation as propd by the other plan coercion he pronounced to be impracticable expensive cruel to individuals it tended also to habituate the instruments of it to shed the blood  riot in the spoils of their fellow citizens and consequently trained them up for the service of ambition we must resort therefore to a national legislation     over individuals for which congs are unfit to vest such power in them would be blending the legislative with the executive contrary to the recd maxim on this subject if the union of these powers heretofore in congs has been safe it has been owing to the general impotency of that body congs are moreover not elected by the people but by the legislatures who retain even a power of recall they have therefore no will of their own they are a mere diplomatic body and are always obsequious to the views of the states who are always encroaching on the authority of the u states a provision for harmony among the states as in trade naturalization —for crushing rebellion whenever it may rear its crest—and for certain other general benefits must be made the powers for these purposes can never be given to a body inadequate as congress are in point of representation elected in the mode in which they are and possessing no more confidence than they do for notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary his own experience satisfied him that a rooted distrust of congress pretty generally prevailed a natl govt alone properly constituted will answer the purpose and he begged it to be considered that the present is the last moment for establitildeng one after this select experiment the people will yield to despair the committee rose  the house adjourned monday june    in committee of the whole on the propositions of mr patterson  mr randolph     on motion of mr dickinson to postpone the  st resolution in mr pattersons plan in order to take up the following viz—that the articles of confederation ought to be revised and amended so as to render the government of the u s adequate to the exigencies the preservation and the prosperity of the union the postponement was agreed to by  0 states pen divided mr hamilton  had been hitherto silent on the business before the convention partly from respect to others whose superior abilities age  experience rendered him unwilling to bring forward ideas dissimilar to theirs and partly from his delicate situation with respect to his own state to whose sentiments as expressed by his colleages he could by no means accede this crisis however which now marked our affairs was too serious to permit any scruples whatever to prevail over the duty imposed on every man to contribute his efforts for the public safety  happiness he was obliged therefore to declare himself unfriendly to both plans he was particularly opposed to that from n jersey being fully convinced that no amendment of the confederation leaving the states in possession of their sovereignty could possibly answer the purpose on the other hand he confessed he was much discouraged     by the amazing extent of country in expecting the desired blessings from any general sovereignty that could be substituted—as to the powers of the convention he thought the doubts started on that subject had arisen from distinctions  reasonings too subtle a federal govt he conceived to mean an association of independent communities into one different confederacies have different powers and exercise them in different ways in some instances the powers are exercised over collective bodies in others over individuals as in the german diet— among ourselves in cases of piracy great latitude therefore must be given to the signification of the term the plan last proposed departs itself from the federal idea as understood by some since it is to operate eventually on individuals he agreed moreover with the honble gentleman from va mr r that we owed it to our country to do on this emergency whatever we should deem essential to its happiness the states sent us here to provide for the exigencies of the union to rely on  propose any plan not adequate to these exigencies merely because it was not clearly within our powers would be to sacrifice the means to the end it may be said that the states cannot ratify a plan not within the purview of the article of the confederation providing for alterations  amendments but may not the states themselves in which no constitutional authority equal to this purpose exists in the legislatures have had in view a reference to the people at large in the senate of n york a proviso was     moved that no act of the convention should be binding untill it should be referred to the people  ratified and the motion was lost by a single voice only the reason assigned agst it being that it might possibly be found an inconvenient shackle the great question is what provision shall we make for the happiness of our country he would first make a comparative examination of the two plans—prove that there were essential defects in both—and point out such changes as might render a national one efficacious—the great  essential principles necessary for the support of government are   an active  constant interest in supporting it this principle does not exist in the states in favor of the federal govt they have evidently in a high degree the esprit de corps they constantly pursue internal interests adverse to those of the whole they have their particular debts—their particular plans of finance c all these when opposed to invariably prevail over the requisitions  plans of congress   the love of power men love power the same remarks are applicable to this principle the states have constantly shewn a disposition rather to regain the powers delegated by them than to part with more or to give effect to what they had parted with the ambition of their demagogues is known to hate the controul of the genl government it may be remarked too that the citizens have not that anxiety to prevent a dissolution of the genl govt as of the particular govts a dissolution of the latter would be fatal of the former would still leave f g     the purposes of govt attainable to a considerable degree consider what such a state as virga will be in a few years a few compared with the life of nations how strongly will it feel its importance and selfsufficiency   an habitual attachment of the people the whole force of this tie is on the side of the state govt its sovereignty is immediately before the eyes of the people its protection is immediately enjoyed by them from its hand distributive justice and all those acts which familiarize  endear a govt to a people are dispensed to them   force by which may be understood a coercion of laws or coercion of arms congs have not the former except in few cases in particular states this coercion is nearly sufficient tho he held it in most cases not entirely so a certain portion of military force is absolutely necessary in large communities massts is now feeling this necessity  making provision for it but how can this force be exerted on the states collectively it is impossible it amounts to a war between the parties foreign powers also will not be idle spectators they will interpose the confusion will increase and a dissolution of the union will ensue   influence he did not mean corruption but a dispensation of those regular honors  emoluments which produce an attachment to the govt almost all the weight of these is on the side of the states and must continue so as long as the states continue to exist all the passions then we see of avarice ambition interest which govern most individuals and all public bodies fall into the     current of the states and do not flow into the stream of the genl govt the former therefore will generally be an overmatch for the genl govt and render any confederacy in its very nature precarious theory is in this case fully confirmed by experience the amphyctionic council had it would seem ample powers for general purposes it had in particular the power of fining and using force agst delinquent members what was the consequence their decrees were mere signals of war the phocian war is a striking example of it philip at length taking advantage of their disunion and insinuating himself into their councils made himself master of their fortunes the german confederacy affords another lesson the authority of charlemagne seemed to be as great as could be necessary the great feudal chiefs however exercising their local sovereignties soon felt the spirit  found the means of encroachments which reduced the imperial authority to a nominal sovereignty the diet has succeeded which tho aided by a prince at its head of great authority independently of his imperial attributes is a striking illustration of the weakness of confederated governments other examples instruct us in the same truth the swiss cantons have scarce any union at all and have been more than once at war with one another—how then are all these evils to be avoided only by such a compleat sovereignty in the general govermt as will turn all the strong principles  passions abovementioned on its side does the scheme of n jersey produce this effect does     it afford any substantial remedy whatever on the contrary it labors under great defects and the defect of some of its provisions will destroy the efficacy of others it gives a direct revenue to congs but this will not be sufficient the balance can only be supplied by requisitions which experience proves cannot be relied on if states are to deliberate on the mode they will also deliberate on the object of the supplies and will grant or not grant as they approve or disapprove of it the delinquency of one will invite and countenance it in others quotas too must in the nature of things be so unequal as to produce the same evil to what standard will you resort land is a fallacious one compare holland with russia france or engd with other countries of europe pena with n carola will the relative pecuniary abilities in those instances correspond with the relative value of land take numbers of inhabitants for the rule and make like comparison of different countries and you will find it to be equally unjust the different degrees of industry and improvement in different countries render the first object a precarious measure of wealth much depends too on situation cont n jersey  n carolina not being commercial states  contributing to the wealth of the commercial ones can never bear quotas assessed by the ordinary rules of proportion they will  must fail in their duty their example will be followed and the union itself be dissolved whence then is the national revenue to be drawn from commerce even from exports which     notwithstanding the com̃on opinion are fit objects of moderate taxation from excise c c these tho not equal are less unequal than quotas another destructive ingredient in the plan is that equality of suffrage which is so much desired by the small states it is not in human nature that va  the large states should consent to it or if they did that they shd long abide by it it shocks too much all ideas of justice and every human feeling bad principles in a govt tho slow are sure in their operation and will gradually destroy it a doubt has been raised whether congs at present have a right to keep ships or troops in time of peace he leans to the negative mr ps plan provides no remedy—if the powers proposed were adequate the organization of congs is such that they could never be properly  effectually exercised the members of congs being chosen by the states  subject to recall represent all the local prejudices should the powers be found effectual they will from time to time be heaped on them till a tyrannic sway shall be established the general power whatever be its form if it preserves itself must swallow up the state powers otherwise it will be swallowed up by them it is agst all the principles of a good government to vest the requisite powers in such a body as congs two sovereignties can not coexist within the same limits giving powers to congs must eventuate in a bad govt or in no govt the plan of n jersey therefore will not do what then is to be done here he was embarrassed the extent of the country to     be governed discouraged him the expence of a general govt was also formidable unless there were such a diminution of expence on the side of the state govts as the case would admit if they were extinguished he was persuaded that great œconomy might be obtained by substituting a general govt he did not mean however to shock the public opinion by proposing such a measure on the other hand he saw no other necessity for declining it they are not necessary for any of the great purposes of commerce revenue or agriculture subordinate authorities he was aware would be necessary there must be district tribunals corporations for local purposes but cui bono the vast  expensive apparatus now appertaining to the states the only difficulty of a serious nature which occurred to him was that of drawing representatives from the extremes to the centre of the community what inducements can be offered that will suffice the moderate wages for the  st branch would only be a bait to little demagogues three dollars or thereabouts he supposed would be the utmost the senate he feared from a similar cause would be filled by certain undertakers who wish for particular offices under the govt this view of the subject almost led him to despair that a republican govt could be established over so great an extent he was sensible at the same time that it would be unwise to propose one of any other form in his private opinion he had no scruple in declaring supported as he was by the opinion of so many of the wise  good   0 that the british govt was the best in the world and that he doubted much whether any thing short of it would do in america he hoped gentlemen of different opinions would bear with him in this and begged them to recollect the change of opinion on this subject which had taken place and was still going on it was once thought that the power of congs was amply sufficient to secure the end of their institution the error was now seen by every one the members most tenacious of republicanism he observed were as loud as any in declaiming agst the vices of democracy this progress of the public mind led him to anticipate the time when others as well as himself would join in the praise bestowed by mr neckar on the british constitution namely that it is the only govt in the world which unites public strength with individual security—in every com̃unity where industry is encouraged there will be a division of it into the few  the many hence separate interests will arise there will be debtors  creditors c give all power to the many they will oppress the few give all power to the few they will oppress the many both therefore ought to have the power that each may defend itself agst the other to the want of this check we owe our paper money instalment laws c to the proper adjustment of it the british owe the excellence of their constitution their house of lords is a most noble institution having nothing to hope for by a change and a sufficient interest by means of their property in being faithful to the national interest     they form a permanent barrier agst every pernicious innovation whether attempted on the part of the crown or of the commons no temporary senate will have firmness eno to answer the purpose the senate of maryland which seems to be so much appealed to has not yet been sufficiently tried had the people been unamimous  eager in the late appeal to them on the subject of a paper emission they would have yielded to the torrent their acquiescing in such an appeal is a proof of it—gentlemen differ in their opinions concerning the necessary checks from the different estimates they form of the human passions they suppose seven years a sufficient period to give the senate an adequate firmness from not duly considering the amazing violence  turbulence of the democratic spirit when a great object of govt is pursued which seizes the popular passions they spread like wild fire and become irresistable he appealed to the gentlemen from the n england states whether experience had not there verified the remark—as to the executive it seemed to be admitted that no good one could be established on republican principles was not this giving up the merits of the question for can there be a good govt without a good executive the english model was the only good one on this subject the hereditary interest of the king was so interwoven with that of the nation and his personal emoluments so great that he was placed above the danger of being corrupted from abroad—and at the same time was both sufficiently independent and sufficiently     controuled to answer the purpose of the institution at home one of the weak sides of republics was their being liable to foreign influence  corruption men of little character acquiring great power become easily the tools of intermeddling neibours sweden was a striking instance the french  english had each their parties during the late revolution which was effected by the predominant influence of the former—what is the inference from all these observations that we ought to go as far in order to attain stability and permanency as republican principles will admit let one branch of the legislature hold their places for life or at least during good behaviour let the executive also be for life he appealed to the feelings of the members present whether a term of seven years would induce the sacrifices of private affairs which an acceptance of public trust would require so as to ensure the services of the best citizens on this plan we should have in the senate a permanent will a weighty interest which would answer essential purposes but is this a republican govt it will be asked yes if all the magistrates are appointed and vacancies are filled by the people or a process of election originating with the people he was sensible that an executive constituted as he proposed would have in fact but little of the power and independence that might be necessary on the other plan of appointing him for   years he thought the executive ought to have but little power he would be ambitious with the means of making creatures and as the     object of his ambition wd be to prolong his power it is probable that in case of a war he would avail himself of the emergence to evade or refuse a degradation from his place an executive for life has not this motive for forgetting his fidelity and will therefore be a safer depository of power it will be objected probably that such an executive will be an elective monarch and will give birth to the tumults which characterize that form of govt he wd reply that monarch is an indefinite term it marks not either the degree or duration of power if this executive magistrate wd be a monarch for life—the other propd by the report from the com̃ittee of the whole wd be a monarch for seven years the circumstance of being elective was also applicable to both it had been observed by judicious writers that elective monarchies wd be the best if they could be guarded agst the tumults excited by the ambition and intrigues of competitors he was not sure that tumults were an inseparable evil he rather thought this character of elective monarchies had been taken rather from particular cases than from general principles the election of roman emperors was made by the army in poland the election is made by great rival princes within dependent power and ample means of raising commotions in the german empire the appointment is made by the electors  princes who have equal motives  means for exciting cabals  parties might not such a mode of election be devised among ourselves as will defend the community agst these effects in any dangerous     degree having made these observations he would read to the committee a sketch of a plan which he shd prefer to either of those under consideration he was aware that it went beyond the ideas of most members but will such a plan be adopted out of doors in return he would ask will the people adopt the other plan at present they will adopt neither but he sees the union dissolving or already dissolved—he sees evils operating in the states which must soon cure the people of their fondness for democracies—he sees that a great progress has been already made  is still going on in the public mind he thinks therefore that the people will in time be unshackled from their prejudices and whenever that happens they will themselves not be satisfied at stopping where the plan of mr r wd place them but be ready to go as far at least as he proposes he did not mean to offer the paper he had sketched as a proposition to the committee it was meant only to give a more correct view of his ideas and to suggest the amendments which he should probably propose to the plan of mr r in the proper stages of its future discussion he read his sketch in the words following to wit  hamiltons principal speech reduced i the supreme legislative power of the united states of america to be vested in two different bodies of men the one to be called the assembly the other the senate who together shall form the legislature of the united states with power to pass all laws whatsoever subject to the negative hereafter mentioned     ii the assembly to consist of persons elected by the people to serve for three years iii the senate to consist of persons elected to serve during good behaviour their election

out of the district from which he came iv the supreme executive authority of the united states to be vested in a governour to be elected to serve during good behaviour—the election to be made by electors chosen by the people in the election districts aforesaid—the authorities  functions of the executive to be as follows to have a negative on all laws about to be passed and the execution of all laws passed to have the direction of war when authorized or begun to have with the advice and approbation of the senate the power of making all treaties to have the sole appointment of the heads or chief officers of the departments of finance war and foreign affairs to have the nomination of all other officers ambassadors to foreign nations included subject to the approbation or rejection of

provided such judge shall hold his place during good behavior and have a permanent salary x all laws of the particular states contrary to the constitution or laws of the united states to be utterly void and the better to prevent such laws being passed the governour or president of each state shall be appointed by the general government and shall have a negative upon the laws about to be passed in the state of which he is the governour or president     xi no state to have any forces land or naval and the militia of all the states to be under the sole and exclusive direction of the united states the officers of which to be appointed and commissioned by them on these several articles he entered into explanatory observations corresponding with the principles of his introductory reasoning  comittee rose  the house adjourned     tuesday june   th in committee of whole on the propositions of mr patterson—  the substitute offered yesterday by mr dickenson     being rejected by a vote now taken on it con n y n j del ay mass pa v n c s c geo no  00 maryd divided mr pattersons plan was again at large before the committee mr madison much stress has been laid by some  0  gentlemen on the want of power in the convention to propose any other than a federal plan to what had been answered by others he would only add  0  that neither of the characteristics attached to a federal plan would support this objection one characteristic was that in a federal government the  0  power was exercised not on the people individually but on the people collectively on the states yet in some instances as in piracies captures c the  0  existing confederacy and in many instances the amendments to it proposed by mr patterson must operate immediately on individuals the other  0  characteristic was that a federal govt derived its appointments not immediately from the people but from the states which they respectively composed  0  here too were facts on the other side in two of the states connectt  rh island the delegates to congs were chosen not by the legislatures but by the  0  people at large and the plan of mr p intended no change in this particular it had been alledged by mr patterson that the confederation having been formed by unanimous  0  consent could be dissolved by unanimous consent only does this doctrine result from the nature of  0  compacts does it arise from any particular stipulation in the articles of confederation if we consider   0 the federal union as analagous to the fundamental compact by which individuals compose one society and which must in its theoretic origin at least have been the unanimous act of the component members it cannot be said that no dissolution of the compact can be effected without unanimous consent a breach of the fundamental principles of the compact by a part of the society would certainly absolve the other part from their obligations to it if the breach of any article by any of the parties does not set the others at liberty it is because the contrary is implied in the compact itself and particularly by that law of it which gives an indefinite authority to the majority to bind the whole in all cases this latter circumstance shews that we are not to consider the federal union as analagous to the social compact of individuals for if it were so a majority would have a right to bind the rest and even to form a new constitution for the whole which the gentln from n jersey would be among the last to admit if we consider the federal union as analagous not to the social compacts among individual men but to the conventions among individual states what is the doctrine resulting from these conventions clearly according to the expositors of the law of nations that a breach of any one article by any one party leaves all the other parties at liberty to consider the whole convention as dissolved unless they choose rather to compel the delinquent party to repair the breach in some treaties indeed it is expressly stipulated     that a violation of particular articles shall not have this consequence and even that particular articles shall remain in force during war which in general is understood to dissolve all subsisting treaties but are there any exceptions of this sort to the articles of confederation so far from it that there is not even an express stipulation that force shall be used to compell an offending member of the union to discharge its duty he observed that the violations of the federal articles had been numerous  notorious among the most notorious was an act of n jersey herself by which she expressly refused to comply with a constitutional requisition of congs and yielded no farther to the expostulations of their deputies than barely to rescind her vote of refusal without passing any positive act of compliance he did not wish to draw any rigid inferences from these observations he thought it proper however that the true nature of the existing confederacy should be investigated and he was not anxious to strengthen the foundations on which it now stands proceeding to the consideration of mr pattersons plan he stated the object of a proper plan to be twofold   to preserve the union   to provide a governmt that will remedy the evils felt by the states both in their united and individual capacities examine mr ps plan  say whether it promises satisfaction in these respects   will it prevent the violations of the law of nations  of treaties which if not prevented must involve us in the calamities of foreign wars the     tendency of the states to these violations has been manifested in sundry instances the files of congs contain complaints already from almost every nation with which treaties have been formed hitherto indulgence has been shewn to us this cannot be the permanent disposition of foreign nations a rupture with other powers is among the greatest of national calamities it ought therefore to be effectually provided that no part of a nation shall have it in its power to bring them on the whole the existing confederacy does not sufficiently provide against this evil the proposed amendment to it does not supply the omission it leaves the will of the states as uncontrouled as ever   will it prevent encroachments on the federal authority a tendency to such encroachments has been sufficiently exemplified among ourselves as well as in every other confederated republic antient and modern by the federal articles transactions with the indians appertain to congs yet in several instances the states have entered into treaties  wars with them in like manner no two or more states can form among themselves any treaties c without the consent of congs yet virga  maryd in one instance—pena  n jersey in another have entered into compacts without previous application or subsequent apology no state again can of right raise troops in time of peace without the like consent of all cases of the league this seems to require the most scrupulous observance has not massts notwithstanding the most powerful member of the     union already raised a body of troops is she not now augmenting them without having even deigned to apprise congs of her intention in fine—have we not seen the public land dealt out to cont to bribe her acquiescence in the decree constitutionally awarded agst her claim on the territory of pena for no other possible motive can account for the policy of congs in that measure—if we recur to the examples of other confederacies we shall find in all of them the same tendency of the parts to encroach on the authority of the whole he then reviewed the amphyctionic  achæan confederacies among the antients and the helvetic germanic  belgic among the moderns tracing their analogy to the u states in the constitution and extent of their federal authorities—in the tendency of the particular members to usurp on these authorities and to bring confusion  ruin on the whole—he observed that the plan of mr paterson besides omitting a controul over the states as a general defence of the federal prerogatives was particularly defective in two of its provisions   its ratification was not to be by the people at large but by the legislatures it could not therefore render the acts of congs in pursuance of their powers even legally paramount to the acts of the states   it gave to the federal tribunal an appellate jurisdiction only—even in the criminal cases enumerated the necessity of any such provision supposed a danger of undue acquittals in the state tribunals of what avail cd an appellate tribunal be after an acquittal besides in most if not     all of the states the executives have by their respective constitutions the right of pardg how could this be taken from them by a legislative ratification only   will it prevent trespasses of the states on each other of these enough has been already seen he instanced acts of virga  maryland which gave a preference to their own citizens in cases where the citizens of other states are entitled to equality of privileges by the articles of confederation he considered the emissions of paper money  other kindred measures as also aggressions the states relatively to one another being each of them either debtor or creditor the creditor states must suffer unjustly from every emission by the debtor states we have seen retaliating acts on the subject which threatened danger not to the harmony only but the tranquility of the union the plan of mr paterson not giving even a negative on the acts of the states left them as much at liberty as ever to execute their unrighteous projects agst each other   will it secure the internal tranquillity of the states themselves the insurrections in massts admonished all the states of the danger to which they were exposed yet the plan of mr p contained no provisions for supplying the defect of the confederation on this point according to the republican theory indeed right  power being both vested in the majority are held to be synonymous according to fact  experience a minority may in an appeal to force be an overmatch for the majority       if the minority happen to include all such as possess the skill  habits of military life with such as possess the great pecuniary resources one third may conquer the remaining two thirds   one third of those who participate in the choice of rulers may be rendered a majority by the accession of those whose poverty disqualifies them from a suffrage  who for obvious reasons may be more ready to join the standard of sedition than that of established government   where slavery exists the republican theory becomes still more fallacious   will it secure a good internal legislation  administration to the particular states in developing the evils which vitiate the political system of the u s it is proper to take into view those which prevail within the states individually as well as those which affect them collectively since the former indirectly affect the whole and there is great reason to believe that the pressure of them had a full share in the motives which produced the present convention under this head he enumerated and animadverted on   the multiplicity of the laws passed by the several states   the mutability of their laws   the injustice of them   the impotence of them observing that mr pattersons plan contained no remedy for this dreadful class of evils and could not therefore be received as an adequate provision for the exigencies of the community   will it secure the union agst the influence of foreign powers over its members he pretended not to say that any such influence had yet been     tried but it was naturally to be expected that occasions would produce it as lessons which claimed particular attention he cited the intrigues practised among the amphyctionic confederates first by the kings of persia and afterwards fatally by philip of macedon among the achæans first by macedon  afterwards no less fatally by rome among the swiss by austria france  the lesser neighbouring powers among the members of the germanic body by france england spain  russia—and in the belgic republic by all the great neighbouring powers the plan of mr patterson not giving to the general councils any negative on the will of the particular states left the door open for the like pernicious machinations among ourselves   he begged the smaller states which were most attached to mr pattersons plan to consider the situation in which it would leave them in the first place they would continue to bear the whole expence of maintaining their delegates in congress it ought not to be said that if they were willing to bear this burthen no others had a right to complain as far as it led the small states to forbear keeping up a representation by which the public business was delayed it was evidently a matter of common concern an examination of the minutes of congress would satisfy every one that the public business had been frequently delayed by this cause and that the states most frequently unrepresented in congs were not the larger states he reminded the convention of another consequence of leaving on a     small state the burden of maintaining a representation in congs during a considerable period of the war one of the representatives of delaware in whom alone before the signing of the confederation the entire vote of that state and after that event one half of its vote frequently resided was a citizen  resident of pena and held an office in his own state incompatible with an appointment from it to congs during another period the same state was represented by three delegates two of whom were citizens of penna and the third a citizen of new jersey these expedients must have been intended to avoid the burden of supporting delegates from their own state but whatever might have been ye cause was not in effect the vote of one state doubled and the influence of another increased by it in the  d place the coercion on which the efficacy of the plan depends can never be exerted but on themselves the larger states will be impregnable the smaller only can feel the vengeance of it he illustrated the position by the history of the amphyctionic confederates and the ban of the german empire it was the cobweb wch could entangle the weak but would be the sport of the strong   he begged them to consider the situation in which they would remain in case their pertinacious adherence to an inadmissible plan should prevent the adoption of any plan the contemplation of such an event was painful but it would be prudent to submit to the task of examining it at a distance that the means of escaping it might be the more     readily embraced let the union of the states be dissolved and one of two consequences must happen either the states must remain individually independent  sovereign or two or more confederacies must be formed among them in the first event would the small states be more secure agst the ambition  power of their larger neighbours than they would be under a general government pervading with equal energy every part of the empire and having an equal interest in protecting every part agst every other part in the second can the smaller expect that their larger neighbours would confederate with them on the principle of the present confederacy which gives to each member an equal suffrage or that they would exact less severe concessions from the smaller states than are proposed in the scheme of mr randolph the great difficulty lies in the affair of representation and if this could be adjusted all others would be surmountable it was admitted by both the gentlemen from n jersey mr brearly and mr patterson that it would not be just to allow virga which was    times as large as delaware an equal vote only their language was that it would not be safe for delaware to allow virga    times as many votes the expedient proposed by them was that all the states should be thrown into one mass and a new partition be made into    equal parts would such a scheme be practicable the dissimilarities existing in the rules of property as well as in the manners habits and prejudices of the different     states amounted to a prohibition of the attempt it had been found impossible for the power of one of the most absolute princes in europe k of france directed by the wisdom of one of the most enlightened and patriotic ministers mr neckar that any age has produced to equalize in some points only the different usages  regulations of the different provinces but admitting a general amalgamation and repartition of the states to be practicable and the danger apprehended by the smaller states from a proportional representation to be real would not a particular and voluntary coalition of these with their neighbours be less inconvenient to the whole community and equally effectual for their own safety if n jersey or delaware conceived that an advantage would accrue to them from an equalization of the states in which case they would necessaryly form a junction with their neighbours why might not this end be attained by leaving them at liberty by the constitution to form such a junction whenever they pleased and why should they wish to obtrude a like arrangement on all the states when it was to say the least extremely difficult would be obnoxious to many of the states and when neither the inconveniency nor the benefit of the expedient to themselves would be lessened by confining it to themselves—the prospect of many new states to the westward was another consideration of importance if they should come into the union at all they would come when they contained but few inhabitants if they shd be entitled to vote according   0 to their proportions of inhabitants all would be right  safe let them have an equal vote and a more objectionable minority than ever might give law to the whole  on a question for postponing generally the  st proposition of mr pattersons plan it was agreed to n y  n j only being no on the question moved by mr king whether the com̃itee should rise  mr randolphs proposition be reported without alteration which was in fact a question whether mr rs should be adhered to as preferable to those of mr patterson massts ay cont ay n y no n j no pa ay del no md divd va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay copy of the resolns of mr r as altered in come and reported to the house of mr randolphs plan as reported from the com̃ittee—the   propos that a natl govt ought to be established consisting c being taken up in the house mr wilson observed that by a natl govt he did not mean one that would swallow up the state govts as seemed to be wished by some gentlemen he was tenacious of the idea of preserving the latter he thought contrary to the opinion of col hamilton that they might not only subsist but subsist on friendly terms with the former they were absolutely     necessary for certain purposes which the former could not reach all large governments must be subdivided into lesser jurisdictions as examples he mentioned persia rome and particularly the divisions  subdivisions of england by alfred col hamilton coincided with the proposition as it stood in the report he had not been understood yesterday by an abolition of the states he meant that no boundary could be drawn between the national  state legislatures that the former must therefore have indefinite authority if it were limited at all the rivalship of the states would gradually subvert it even as corporations the extent of some of them as va massts c would be formidable as states he thought they ought to be abolished but he admitted the necessity of leaving in them subordinate jurisdictions the examples of persia  the roman empire cited by mr wilson were he thought in favor of his doctrine the great powers delegated to the satraps  proconsuls having frequently produced revolts and schemes of independence mr king wished as every thing depended on this proposition that no objections might be improperly indulged agst the phraseology of it he conceived that the import of the term states sovereignty national federal had been often used  applied in the discussions inaccurately  delusively the states were not sovereigns in the sense contended for by some they did not possess the     peculiar features of sovereignty they could not make war nor peace nor alliances nor treaties considering them as political beings they were dumb for they could not speak to any forẽgn sovereign whatever they were deaf for they could not hear any propositions from such sovereign they had not even the organs or faculties of defence or offence for they could not of themselves raise troops or equip vessels for war on the other side if the union of the states comprises the idea of a confederation it comprises that also of consolidation a union of the states is a union of the men composing them from whence a national character results to the whole congs can act alone without the states—they can act  their acts will be binding agst the instructions of the states if they declare war war is de jure declared—captures made in pursuance of it are lawful—no acts of the states can vary the situation or prevent the judicial consequences if the states therefore retained some portion of their sovereignty they had certainly divested themselves of essential portions of it if they formed a confederacy in some respects—they formed a nation in others the convention could clearly deliberate on  propose any alterations that congs could have done under ye federal articles and could not congs propose by virtue of the last article a change in any article whatever and as well that relating to the equality of suffrage as any other he made these remarks to obviate some scruples which had been expressed he doubted much the practicability of annihilating     the states but thought that much of their power ought to be taken from them      mr martin  said he considered that the separation from g b placed the    states in a state of nature towards each other that they would have remained in that state till this time but for the confederation that they entered into the confederation on the footing of equality that they met now to amend it on the same footing and that he could never accede to a plan that would introduce an inequality and lay  0 states at the mercy of va massts and penna mr wilson could not admit the doctrine that when the colonies became independent of g britain they became independent also of each other he read the declaration of independence observing     thereon that the united colonies were declared to be free  independent states and inferring that they were independent not individually but unitedly and that they were confederated as they were independent states col hamilton assented to the doctrine of mr wilson he denied the doctrine that the states were thrown into a state of nature he was not yet prepared to admit the doctrine that the confederacy could be dissolved by partial infractions of it he admitted that the states met now on an equal footing but could see no inference from that against concerting a change of the system in this particular he took this occasion of observing for the purpose of appeasing the fears of the small states that two circumstances would render them secure under a national govt in which they might lose the equality of rank they now held one was the local situation of the   largest states virga massts  pa they were separated from each other by distance of place and equally so by all the peculiarities which distinguish the interests of one state from those of another no combination therefore could be dreaded in the second place as there was a gradation in the states from va the largest down to delaware the smallest it would always happen that ambitious combinations among a few states might  wd be counteracted by defensive combinations of greater extent among the rest no combination has been seen among the large counties merely as such agst lesser counties the more close the union of the states     and the more compleat the authority of the whole the less opportunity will be allowed to the stronger states to injure the weaker adjd wednesday june  0      in convention mr william blount from n carolina took his seat  st propos of the report of come of the whole before the house mr elseworth  ded by mr gorham moves to alter it so as to run that the government of the united states ought to consist of a supreme legislative executive and judiciary this alteration he said would drop the word national and retain the proper title the united states he could not admit the doctrine that a breach of any of the federal articles could dissolve the whole it would be highly dangerous not to consider the confederation as still subsisting he wished also the plan of the convention to go forth as an amendment of the articles of the confederation since under this idea the authority of the legislatures could ratify it if they are unwilling the people will be so too if the plan goes forth to the people for ratification several succeeding conventions within the states would be unavoidable he did not like these conventions they were better fitted to pull down than to build up constitutions mr randolph did not object to the change of expression but apprised the gentleman who wished for it that he did not admit it for the reasons assigned     particularly that of getting rid of a reference to the people for ratification the motion of mr elsewth was acquiesced in nem con the  d resol that the national legislature ought to consist of two branches taken up the word national struck out as of course mr lansing observed that the true question here was whether the convention would adhere to or depart from the foundation of the present confederacy and moved instead of the  d resolution that the powers of legislation be vested in the u states in congress he had already assigned two reasons agst such an innovation as was proposed   the want of competent powers in the convention—  the state of the public mind it had been observed by mr madison in discussing the first point that in two states the delegates to congs were chosen by the people notwithstanding the first appearance of this remark it had in fact no weight as the delegates however chosen did not represent the people merely as so many individuals but as forming a sovereign state mr randolph put it he said on its true footing namely that the public safety superseded the scruple arising from the review of our powers but in order to feel the force of this consideration the same impression must be had of the public danger he had not himself the same impression and could not therefore dismiss his scruple mr wilson contended that as the convention were only to recommend they might recommend what they pleased he differed much from     him any act whatever of so respectable a body must have a great effect and if it does not succeed will be a source of great dissentions he admitted that there was no certain criterion of the public mind on the subject he therefore recurred to the evidence of it given by the opposition in the states to the scheme of an impost it could not be expected that those possessing sovereignty could ever voluntarily part with it it was not to be expected from any one state much less from thirteen he proceeded to make some observations on the plan itself and the argumts urged in support of it the point of representation could receive no elucidation from the case of england the corruption of the boroughs did not proceed from their comparative smallness but from the actual fewness of the inhabitants some of them not having more than one or two a great inequality existed in the counties of england yet the like complaint of peculiar corruption in the small ones had not been made it had been said that congress represent the state prejudices will not any other body whether chosen by the legislatures or people of the states also represent their prejudices it had been asserted by his colleague col hamilton that there was no coincidence of interests among the large states that ought to excite fears of oppression in the smaller if it were true that such a uniformity of interests existed among the states there was equal safety for all of them whether the representation remained as heretofore or were proportioned as now proposed     it is proposed that the genl legislature shall have a negative on the laws of the states is it conceivable that there will be leisure for such a task there will on the most moderate calculation be as many acts sent up from the states as there are days in the year will the members of the general legislature be competent judges will a gentleman from georgia be a judge of the expediency of a law which is to operate in n hampshire such a negative would be more injurious than that of great britain heretofore was it is said that the national govt must have the influence arising from the grant of offices and honors in order to render such a government effectual he believed such an influence to be necessary but if the states will not agree to it it is in vain worse than in vain to make the proposition if this influence is to be attained the states must be entirely abolished will any one say this would ever be agreed to he doubted whether any genl government equally beneficial to all can be attained that now under consideration he is sure must be utterly unattainable he had another objection the system was too novel  complex no man could foresee what its operation will be either with respect to the genl govt or the state govts one or other it has been surmised must absorb the whole col mason did not expect this point would have been reagitated the essential differences between the two plans had been clearly stated the principal objections agst that of mr r were the want of   0 power  the want of practicability there can be no weight in the first as the fiat is not to be here but in the people he thought with his colleague mr r that there were besides certain crisises in which all the ordinary cautions yielded to public necessity he gave as an example the eventual treaty with g b in forming which the com̃srs of the u s had boldly disregarded the improvident shackles of congs had given to their country an honorable  happy peace and instead of being censured for the transgression of their powers had raised to themselves a monument more durable than brass the impracticability of gaining the public concurrence he thought was still more groundless mr lansing had cited the attempts of congress to gain an enlargement of their powers and had inferred from the miscarriage of these attempts the hopelessness of the plan which he mr l opposed he thought a very different inference ought to have been drawn viz that the plan which mr l espoused and which proposed to augment the powers of congress never could be expected to succeed he meant not to throw any reflections on congs as a body much less on any particular members of it he meant however to speak his sentiments without reserve on this subject it was a privilege of age and perhaps the only compensation which nature had given for the privation of so many other enjoyments and he should not scruple to exercise it freely is it to be thought that the people of america so watchful over their interests so jealous of their liberties will give up     their all will surrender both the sword and the purse to the same body and that too not chosen immediately by themselves they never will they never ought will they trust such a body with the regulation of their trade with the regulation of their taxes with all the other great powers which are in contemplation will they give unbounded confidence to a secret journal—to the intrigues—to the factions which in the nature of things appertain to such an assembly if any man doubts the existence of these characters of congress let him consult their journals for the years         0—it will be said that if the people are averse to parting with power why is it hoped that they will part with it to a national legislature the proper answer is that in this case they do not part with power they only transfer it from one sett of immediate representatives to another sett—much has been said of the unsettled state of the mind of the people he believed the mind of the people of america as elsewhere was unsettled as to some points but settled as to others in two points he was sure it was well settled   in an attachment to republican government   in an attachment to more than one branch in the legislature their constitutions accord so generally in both these circumstances that they seem almost to have been preconcerted this must either have been a miracle or have resulted from the genius of the people the only exceptions to the establishmt of two branches in the legislatures are the state of pa  congs and the latter the only     single one not chosen by the people themselves what has been the consequence the people have been constantly averse to giving that body further powers—it was acknowledged by mr patterson that his plan could not be enforced without military coercion does he consider the force of this concession the most jarring elements of nature fire  water themselves are not more incompatible thatn such a mixture of civil liberty and military execution will the militia march from one state to another in order to collect the arrears of taxes from the delinquent members of the republic will they maintain an army for this purpose will not the citizens of the invaded state assist one another till they rise as one man and shake off the union altogether rebellion is the only case in which the military force of the state can be properly exerted agst its citizens in one point of view he was struck with horror at the prospect of recurring to this expedient to punish the nonpayment of taxes with death was a severity not yet adopted by despotism itself yet this unexampled cruelty would be mercy compared to a military collection of revenue in which the bayonet could make no discrimination between the innocent and the guilty he took this occasion to repeat that notwithstanding his solicitude to establish a national government he never would agree to abolish the state govts or render them absolutely insignificant they were as necessary as the genl govt and he would be equally careful to preserve them he was aware of the     difficulty of drawing the line between them but hoped it was not insurmountable the convention tho comprising so many distinguished characters could not be expected to make a faultless govt and he would prefer trusting to posterity the amendment of its defects rather than to push the experiment too far mr luther martin agreed with col mason as to the importance of the state govts he would support them at the expence of the genl govt which was instituted for the purpose of that support he saw no necessity for two branches and if it existed congress might be organized into two he considered congs as representing the people being chosen by the legislatures who were chosen by the people at any rate congress represented the legislatures and it was the legislatures not the people who refused to enlarge their powers nor could the rule of voting have been the ground of objection otherwise ten of the states must always have been ready to place further confidence in congs the causes of repugnance must therefore be looked for elsewhere—at the separation from the british empire the people of america preferred the establishment of themselves into thirteen separate sovereignties instead of incorporating themselves into one to these they look up for the security of their lives liberties  properties to these they must look up the federal govt they formed to defend the whole agst foreign nations in case of war and to defend the lesser states agst the ambition of the larger they are     afraid of granting power unnecessarily lest they should defeat the original end of the union lest the powers should prove dangerous to the sovereignties of the particular states which the union was meant to support and expose the lesser to being swallowed up by the larger he conceived also that the people of the states having already vested their powers in their respective legislatures could not resume them without a dissolution of their governments he was agst conventions in the states was not agst assisting states agst rebellious subjects thought the federal plan of mr patterson did not require coercion more than the national one as the latter must depend for the deficiency of its revenues on requisitions  quotas and that a national judiciary extended into the states would be ineffectual and would be viewed with a jealousy inconsistent with its usefulness mr sherman  ded  supported mr lansings motion he admitted two branches to be necessary in the state legislatures but saw no necessity for them in a confederacy of states the examples were all of a single council congs carried us thro the war and perhaps as well as any govt could have done the complaints at present are not that the views of congs are unwise or unfaithful but that their powers are insufficient for the execution of their views the national debt  the want of power somewhere to draw forth the national resources are the great matters that press all the states were sensible of the defect of power in     congs he thought much might be said in apology for the failure of the state legislatures to comply with the confederation they were afraid of leaning too hard on the people by accumulating taxes no constitutional rule had been or could be observed in the quotas—the accounts also were unsettled  every state supposed itself in advance rather than in arrears for want of a general system taxes to a due amount had not been drawn from trade which was the most convenient resource as almost all the states had agreed to the recommendation of congs on the subject of an impost it appeared clearly that they were willing to trust congs with power to draw a revenue from trade there is no weight therefore in the argument drawn from a distrust of congs for money matters being the most important of all if the people will trust them with power as to them they will trust them with any other necessary powers congs indeed by the confederation have in fact the right of saying how much the people shall pay and to what purpose it shall be applied and this right was granted to them in the expectation that it would in all cases have its effect if another branch were to be added to congs to be chosen by the people it would serve to embarrass the people would not much interest themselves in the elections a few designing men in the large districts would carry their points and the people would have no more confidence in their new representatives than in congs he saw no reason why the state legislatures should be unfriendly as had been     suggested to congs if they appoint congs and approve of their measures they would be rather favourable and partial to them the disparity of the states in point of size he perceived was the main difficulty but the large states had not yet suffered from the equality of votes enjoyed by the small ones in all great and general points the interests of all the states were the same the state of virga notwithstanding the equality of votes ratified the confederation without or even proposing any alteration massts also ratified without any material difficulty c in none of the ratifications is the want of two branches noticed or complained of to consolidate the states as some had proposed would dissolve our treaties with foreign nations which had been formed with us as confederated states he did not however suppose that the creation of two branches in the legislature would have such an effect if the difficulty on the subject of representation can not be otherwise got over he would agree to have two branches and a proportional representation in one of them provided each state had an equal voice in the other this was necessary to secure the rights of the lesser states otherwise three or four of the large states would rule the others as they please each state like each individual had its peculiar habits usages and manners which constituted its happiness it would not therefore give to others a power over this happiness any more than an individual would do when he could avoid it     mr wilson urged the necessity of two branches observed that if a proper model were not to be found in other confederacies it was not to be wondered at the number of them was small  the duration of some at least short the amphyctionic and achæan were formed in the infancy of political science and appear by their history  fate to have contained radical defects the swiss  belgic confederacies were held together not by any vital principle of energy but by the incumbent pressure of formidable neighbouring nations the german owed its continuance to the influence of the h of austria he appealed to our own experience for the defects of our confederacy he had been   years in the    since the commencement of the revolution a member of congress and had felt all its weaknesses he appealed to the recollection of others whether on many important occasions the public interest had not been obstructed by the small members of the union the success of the revolution was owing to other causes than the constitution of congress in many instances it went on even agst the difficulties arising from congs themselves he admitted that the large states did accede as had been stated to the confederation in its present form but it was the effect of necessity not of choice there are other instances of their yielding from the same motive to the unreasonable measures of the small states the situation of things is now a little altered he insisted that a jealousy would exist between the state legislatures  the general legislature     observing that the members of the former would have views  feelings very distinct in this respect from their constituents a private citizen of a state is indifferent whether power be exercised by the genl or state legislatures provided it be exercised most for his happiness his representative has an interest in its being exercised by the body to which he belongs he will therefore view the national legisl with the eye of a jealous rival he observed that the addresses of congs to the people at large had always been better received  produced greater effect than those made to the legislatures on the question for postponing in order to take up mr lansings proposition to vest the powers of legislation in congs massts no cont ay n y ay n j ay pa no del ay md divd va no n c no s c no geo no on motion of the deputies from delaware the question on the  d resolution in the report from the committee of the whole was postponed till tomorrow adjd thursday june    in convention mr jonathan dayton from n jersey took his seat      docr johnson  on a comparison of the two plans which had been proposed from virginia  n jersey it appeared that the peculiarity which characterized the latter was its being calculated to preserve the individuality of the states the plan from va did not profess to destroy this individuality altogether but was charged with such a tendency one gentleman alone col hamilton in his animadversions on the plan of n jersey boldly and decisively contended for an abolition of the state govts mr wilson  the gentleman from virga who also were adversaries of the plan of n jersey held a different language they wished to leave the states in possession of a considerable tho a subordinate jurisdiction they had not yet however shewn how this cd consist with or be secured agst the general sovereignty  jurisdiction which they proposed to give to the national government if this could be shewn in such a manner as to satisfy the patrons of the n   0 jersey propositions that the individuality of the states would not be endangered many of their objections would no doubt be removed if this could not be shewn their objections would have their full force he wished it therefore to be well considered whether in case the states as was proposed shd retain some portion of sovereignty at least this portion could be preserved without allowing them to participate effectually in the genl govt without giving them each a distinct and equal vote for the purpose of defending themselves in the general councils mr wilsons respect for docr johnson added to the importance of the subject led him to attempt unprepared as he was to solve the difficulty which had been started it was asked how the genl govt and individuality of the particular states could be reconciled to each other and how the latter could be secured agst the former might it not on the other side be asked how the former was to be secured agst the latter it was generally admitted that a jealousy  rivalship would be felt between the genl  particular govts as the plan now stood tho indeed contrary to his opinion one branch of the genl govt the senate or second branch was to be appointed by the state legislatures the state legislatures therefore by this participation in the genl govt would have an opportunity of defending their rights ought not a reciprocal opportunity to be given to the genl govt of defending itself by having an appointment of some one constituent branch of the state govts if a security be necessary on one     side it wd seem reasonable to demand it on the other but taking the matter in a more general view he saw no danger to the states from the genl govt in case a combination should be made by the large ones it wd produce a general alarm among the rest and the project wd be frustrated but there was no temptation to such a project the states having in general a similar interest in case of any propositions in the national legislature to encroach on the state legislatures he conceived a general alarm wd take place in the national legislature itself that it would communicate itself to the state legislatures and wd finally spread among the people at large the genl govt will be as ready to preserve the rights of the states as the latter are to preserve the rights of individuals all the members of the former having a common interest as representatives of all the people of the latter to leave the state govts in possession of what the people wish them to retain he could not discover therefore any danger whatever on the side from which it was apprehended on the contrary he conceived that in spite of every precaution the general govt would be in perpetual danger of encroachments from the state govts mr madison was of opinion that there was   less danger of encroachment from the genl govt than from the state govts   that the mischief from encroachments would be less fatal if made by the former than if made by the latter   all the examples of other confederacies prove the greater tendency in such systems to anarchy than to     tyranny to a disobedience of the members than usurpations of the federal head our own experience had fully illustrated this tendency—but it will be said that the proposed change in the principles  form of the union will vary the tendency that the genl govt will have real  greater powers and will be derived in one branch at least from the people not from the govts of the states to give full force to this objection let it be supposed for a moment that indefinite power should be given to the genl legislature and the states reduced to corporations dependent on the genl legislature why shd it follow that the genl govt wd take from the states any branch of their power as far as its operation was beneficial and its continuance desireable to the people in some of the states particularly in connecticut all the townships are incorporated and have a certain limited jurisdiction have the representatives of the people of the townships in the legislature of the state ever endeavoured to despoil the townships of any part of their local authority as far as this local authority is convenient to the people they are attached to it and their representatives chosen by  amenable to them naturally respect their attachment to this as much as their attachment to any other right or interest the relation of a general govt to state govts is parallel   guards were more necessary agst encroachments of the state govts on the genl govt than of the latter on the former the great objection made agst an abolition of the state govts was that the genl     govt could not extend its care to all the minute objects which fall under the cognizance of the local jurisdictions the objection as stated lay not agst the probable abuse of the general power but agst the imperfect use that could be made of it throughout so great an extent of country and over so great a variety of objects as far as its operation would be practicable it could not in this view be improper as far as it would be impracticable the conveniency of the genl govt itself would concur with that of the people in the maintenance of subordinate governments were it practicable for the genl govt to extend its care to every requisite object without the cooperation of the state govts the people would not be less free as members of one great republic than as members of thirteen small ones a citizen of delaware was not more free than a citizen of virginia nor would either be more free than a citizen of america supposing therefore a tendency in the genl government to absorb the state govts no fatal consequence could result taking the reverse as the supposition that a tendency should be left in the state govts towards an independence on the general govt and the gloomy consequences need not be pointed out the imagination of them must have suggested to the states the experiment we are now making to prevent the calamity and must have formed the chief motive with those present to undertake the arduous task on the question for resolving that the legislature ought to consist of two branches     mass ay cont ay n y no n jersey no pa ay del no md divd va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay the third resolution of the report taken into consideration genl pinkney moved that the  st branch instead of being elected by the people shd be elected in such manner as the legislature of each state should direct he urged   that this liberty would give more satisfaction as the legislatures could then accommodate the mode to the conveniency  opinions of the people   that it would avoid the undue influence of large counties which would prevail if the elections were to be made in districts as must be the mode intended by the report of the committee   that otherwise disputed elections must be referred to the general legislature which would be attended with intolerable expence and trouble to the distant parts of the republic mr l martin seconded the motion  col hamilton considered the motion as intended manifestly to transfer the election from the people to the state legislatures which would essentially vitiate the plan it would increase that state influence which could not be too watchfully guarded agst all too must admit the possibility in case the genl govt shd maintain itself that the state govts     might gradually dwindle into nothing the system therefore shd not be engrafted on what might possibly fail mr mason urged the necessity of retaining the election by the people whatever inconveniency may attend the democratic principle it must actuate one part of the govt it is the only security for the rights of the people mr sherman would like an election by the legislatures best but is content with the plan as it stands mr rutlidge could not admit the solidity of the distinction between a mediate  immediate election by the people it was the same thing to act by oneself and to act by another an election by the legislature would be more refined than an election immediately by the people and would be more likely to correspond with the sense of the whole community if this convention had been chosen by the people in districts it is not to be supposed that such proper characters would have been preferred the delegates to congs he thought had also been fitter men than would have been appointed by the people at large mr wilson considered the election of the  st branch by the people not only as the corner stone but as the foundation of the fabric and that the difference between a mediate  immediate election was immense the difference was particularly worthy of notice in this respect that the legislatures are actuated not merely by the sentiment of the people but have an official sentiment opposed to that of the     genl govt and perhaps to that of the people themselves mr king enlarged on the same distinction he supposed the legislatures wd constantly choose men subservient to their own views as contrasted to the general interest and that they might even devise modes of election that wd be subversive of the end in view he remarked several instances in which the views of a state might be at variance with those of the genl govt and mentioned particularly a competition between the national  state debts for the most certain  productive funds genl pinkney was for making the state govts a part of the general system if they were to be abolished or lose their agency s carolina  other states would have but a small share of the benefits of govt on the question for genl pinkney motion to substitute election of the  st

checks agst the popular intemperence as were now proposed that rendered them so mischievous he would have preferred annual to biennial but for the extent of the u s and the inconveniency which would result from them to the representatives of the extreme parts of the empire the people were attached to frequency of elections all the constitutions of the states except that of s carolina had established annual elections mr dickinson the idea of annual elections was borrowed from the antient usage of england a country much less extensive than ours he supposed biennial would be inconvenient he preferred triennial and in order to prevent the inconveniency of an entire change of the whole number at the same moment suggested a rotation by an annual election of one third mr elseworth was opposed to three years supposing that even one year was preferable to two years the people were fond of frequent elections and might be safely indulged in one branch of the legislature he moved for   year     mr strong  seconded  supported the motion mr wilson being for making the  st branch an effectual representation of the people at large preferred an annual election of it this frequency was most familiar  pleasing to the people it would not be more inconvenient to them than triennial elections as the people in all the states have annual meetings with which the election of the national representatives might be made to coincide he did not conceive that it would be necessary for the natl leigsl to sit constantly perhaps not half—perhaps not one fourth of the year mr madison was persuaded that annual elections would be extremely inconvenient and apprehensive that biennial would be too much so he did not mean inconvenient to the electors but to the representatives they would have to travel seven or eight hundred miles from the distant parts of the union and would probably not be allowed even a reimbursement of their expences besides none of those who wished to be reelected would remain at the seat of governmt confiding that their absence would not affect them the members of congs had done this with few instances of disappointment but as the choice was here to be made by the people themselves who would be much less complaisant to individuals and much more susceptible of impressions     from the presence of a rival candidate it must be supposed that the members from the most distant states would travel backwards  forwards at least as often as the elections should be repeated much was to be said also on the time requisite for new members who would always form a large proportion to acquire that knowledge of the affairs of the states in general without which their trust could not be usefully discharged mr sherman preferred annual elections but would be content with biennial he thought the representatives ought to return home and mix with the people by remaining at the seat of govt they would acquire the habits of the place which might differ from those of their constituents col mason observed that the states being differently situated such a rule ought to be formed as would put them as nearly as possible on a level if elections were annual the middle states would have a great advantage over the extreme ones he wished them to be biennial and the rather as in that case they would coincide with the periodical elections of s carolina as well of the other states col hamilton urged the necessity of   years there ought to be neither too much nor too little dependence on the popular sentiments the checks in the other branches of the governt would be but feeble and would need every auxiliary principle that could be interwoven the british house of commons were elected septennially yet the democratic spirit of ye constitution had not ceased frequency of   0 elections tended to make the people listless to them and to facilitate the success of little cabals this evil was complained of in all the states in virga it had been

mr elseworth moved to substitute payment by the states out of their own treasurys observing that the manners of different states were very different in the stile of living and in the profits accruing from the exercise of like talents what would be deemed therefore a reasonable compensation in some states in others would be very unpopular and might impede the system of which it made a part mr williamson favored the idea he reminded the house of the prospect of new states to the westward they would be too poor—would pay little into the common treasury—and would have a different interest from the old states he did not think therefore that the latter ought to pay the     expences of men who would be employed in thwarting their measures  interests mr ghorum  wished not to refer the matter to the state legislatures who were always paring down salaries in such a manner as to keep out of offices men most capable of executing the functions of them he thought also it would be wrong to fix the compensations by the constitution because we could not venture to make it as liberal as it ought to be without exciting an enmity agst the whole plan let the natl legisl provide for their own wages from time to time as the state legislatures do he had not seen this part of their power abused nor did he apprehend an abuse of it mr randolph said he feared we were going too far in consulting popular prejudices whatever respect might be due to them in lesser matters or in cases where they formed the permanent character of the people he thought it neither incumbent on nor honorable for the convention to sacrifice right  justice to that consideration if the states were to pay the members of the natl legislature a dependence would be created that would vitiate the     whole system the whole nation has an interest in the attendance  services of the members the nationl treasury therefore is the proper fund for supporting them mr king urged the danger of creating a dependence on the states by leavg to them the payment of the members of the natl legislature he supposed it wd be best to be explicit as to the compensation to be allowed a reserve on that point or a reference to the natl legislature of the quantum would excite greater opposition than any sum that would be actually necessary or proper mr sherman contended for referring both the quantum and the payment of it to the state legislatures mr wilson was agst fixing the compensation as circumstances would change and call for a change of the amount he thought it of great moment that the members of the natl govt should be left as independent as possible of the state govts in all respects mr madison concurred in the necessity of preserving the compensations for the natl govt independent on the state govts but at the same time approved of fixing them by the constitution which might be done by taking a standard which wd not vary with circumstances he disliked particularly the policy suggested by mr wiliamson of leaving the members from the poor states beyond the mountains to the precarious  parsimonious support of their constituents if the western states hereafter arising should be admitted into the union they ought to be     considered as equals  as brethren if their representatives were to be associated in the common councils it was of common concern that such provisions should be made as would invite the most capable and respectable characters into the service mr hamilton apprehended inconveniency from fixing the wages he was strenuous agst making the national council dependent on the legislative rewards of the states those who pay are the masters of those who are paid payment by the states would be unequal as the distant states would have to pay for the same term of attendance and more days in travelling to  from the seat of the govt he expatiated emphatically on the difference between the feelings  views of the people— the governments of the states arising from the personal interest  official inducements which must render the latter unfriendly to the genl govt mr wilson moved that the salaries of the  st branch be ascertained by the national legislature and be paid out of the natl treasury mr madison thought the members of the legisl too much interested to ascertain their own compensation it wd be indecent to put their hands into the

him in his own experience a scale for measuring the deficiency of young politicians since he would if interrogated be obliged to declare that his political opinions at the age of    were too crude  erroneous to merit an influence on public measures it had been said that congs had proved a good school for our young men it might be so for any thing he knew but if it were he chose that they should bear the expence of their own education mr wilson was agst abridging the rights of election in any shape it was the same thing whether this were done by disqualifying the objects of choice or the persons chusing the motion tended to damp the efforts of genius and of laudable ambition there was no more reason for incapacitating youth than age where the requisite qualifications were found many

was necessary he appealed to the example of g b where men got into parlt that they might get offices for themselves or their friends this was the source of the corruption that ruined their govt mr king thought we were refining too much such a restriction on the members would discourage merit it would also give a pretext to the executive for bad appointments as he might always plead this as a bar to the choice he wished to have made mr wilson was agst fettering elections and discouraging merit he suggested also the fatal consequence in time of war of rendering perhaps the best commanders ineligible appealing to our situation during the late war and indirectly leading to a recollection of the appointment of the com̃ander in chief out of congress      col mason was for shutting the door

ineligible during their term of service  for one year after—to such offices only as should be established or the emoluments thereof augmented by the legislature of the u states during the time of their being members he supposed that the unnecessary creation of offices and increase of salaries were the evils most experienced  that if the door was shut agst them it might properly be left open for the appointt of members to other offices as an encouragemt to the legislative service mr alex martin  seconded the motion mr butler the amendt does not go far eno  wd be easily evaded mr rutlidge was for preserving the legislature as pure as possible by shutting the door against     appointments of its own members to offices which was one source of its corruption mr mason  the motion of my colleague is but a partial remedy for the evil he appealed to him as a witness of the shameful partiality of the legislature of virginia to its own members he enlarged on the     abuses  corruption in the british parliament connected with the appointment of its members he cd not suppose that a sufficient number of citizens could not be found who would be ready without the inducement of eligibility to offices to undertake the legislative service genius  virtue it may be said ought to be encouraged genius for aught he knew might but that virtue should be encouraged by such a species of venality was an idea that at least had the merit of being new mr king remarked that we were refining too much in this business and that the idea of preventing intrigue and solicitation of offices was chimerical you say that no member shall himself be eligible to any office will this restrain him from availing himself of the same means which would gain appointments for himself to gain them for his son his brother or any other object of his partiality we were losing therefore the advantages on one side without avoiding the evils on the other mr wilson supported the motion the proper cure he said for corruption in the legislature was to take from it the power of appointing to offices one branch of corruption would indeed remain that of creating unnecessary offices or granting unnecessary salaries and for that the amendment would be a proper remedy he animadverted on the impropriety of stigmatizing with the name of venality the laudable ambition of rising into the honorable offices of the government an ambition most likely to be felt in the early  most incorrupt period of life      which all wise  free govts had deemed it sound policy to cherish not to check the members of the legislature have perhaps the hardest  least profitable task of any who engage in the service of the state ought this merit to be made a disqualification mr sherman observed that the motion did not go far enough it might be evaded by the creation of a new office the translation to it of a person from another office and the appointment of a member of the legislature to the latter a new embassy might be established to a new court  an ambassador taken from another in order to create a vacancy for a favorite member he admitted that inconveniences lay on both sides he hoped there wd be sufficient inducements to the public service without resorting to the prospect of desirable offices and on the whole was rather agst the motion of mr madison mr gerry  thought there was great weight in the objection of mr sherman he added as another objection agst admitting the eligibility of members in any case that it would produce intrigues of ambitious men for displacing proper officers in order     to create vacancies for themselves in answer to mr king he observed that although members if disqualified themselves might still intrigue  cabal for their sons brothers c yet as their own interests would be dearer to them than those of their nearest connections it might be expected they would go greater lengths to promote it mr madison had been led to this motion as a middle ground between an eligibility in all cases and an absolute disqualification he admitted the probable abuses of an eligibility of the members to offices particularly within the gift of the legislature he had witnessed the partiality of such bodies to their own members as had been remarked of the virginia assembly by his colleague col mason he appealed however to him in turn to vouch another fact not less notorious in virginia that the backwardness of the best citizens to engage in the legislative service gave but too great success to unfit characters the question was not to be viewed on one side only the advantages  disadvantages on both ought to be fairly compared the objects to be aimed at were to fill all offices with the fittest characters  to draw the wisest  most worthy citizens into the legislative service if on one hand public bodies were partial to their own members on the other they were as apt to be misled by taking characters on report or the authority of patrons and dependents all who had been concerned in the appointment of strangers on those recommendations must be sensible of this truth nor wd the partialities of such     bodies be obviated by disqualifying their own members candidates for office would hover round the seat of govt or be found among the residents there and practise all the means of courting the favor of the members a great proportion of the appointments made by the states were evidently brought about in this way in the general govt the evil must be still greater the characters of distant states being much less known throughout the u states than those of the distant parts of the same state the elections by congress had generally turned on men living at the seat of the fedl govt or in its neighbourhood—as to the next object the impulse to the legislative service was evinced by experience to be in general too feeble with those best qualified for it this inconveniency wd also be more felt in the natl govt than in the state govts as the sacrifices reqd from the distant members wd be much greater and the pecuniary provisions probably more disproportionate it wd therefore be impolitic to add fresh objections to the legislative service by an absolute disqualification of its members the point in question was whether this would be an objection with the most capable citizens arguing from experience he concluded that it would the legislature of virga would probably have been without many of its best members if in that situation they had been ineligible to congs to the govt  other honorable offices of the state mr butler thought characters fit for office wd never be unknown     col mason if the members of the legislature are disqualified still the honors of the state will induce those who aspire to them to enter that service as the field in which they can best display  improve their talents  lay the train for their subsequent advancement mr jenifer remarked that in maryland the senators chosen for five

convention resolution   being taken up mr pinkney spoke as follows—  the efficacy of the system will depend on this article in order to form a right judgmt in the case it will be proper to examine the situation of this country more accurately than it has yet been done the people of the u states are perhaps the most singular of any we are acquainted with among them there are fewer distinctions of fortune  less of rank than among the inhabitants of any other nation every freeman has a right to the same protection  security and a very moderate share of property entitles them to the possession of all the honors and privileges the public can bestow hence arises a greater equality than is to be found among the people of any other country and an equality which is     more likely to continue—i say this equality is likely to continue because in a new country possessing immense tracts of uncultivated lands where every temptation is offered to emigration  where industry must be rewarded with competency there will be few poor and few dependent—every member of the society almost will enjoy an equal power of arriving at the supreme offices  consequently of directing the strength  sentiments of the whole community none will be excluded by birth  few by fortune from voting for proper persons to fill the offices of government — the whole community will enjoy in the fullest sense that kind of political liberty which consists in the power the members of the state reserve to themselves of arriving at the public offices or at least of having votes in the nomination of those who fill them if this state of things is true  the prospect of its continuing probable it is perhaps not politic to endeavour too close an imitation of a government calculated for a people whose situation is  whose views ought to be extremely different much has been said of the constitution of g britain i will confess that i believe it to be the best constitution in existence but at the same time i am confident it is one that will not or cannot be introduced into this country for many centuries—if it were proper to go here into a historical dissertation on the british constitution it might easily be shewn that the peculiar excellence the distinguishing feature of that governmt cannot possibly be introduced     into our system—that its balance between the crown  the people cannot be made a part of our constitution—that we neither have nor can have the members to compose it nor the rights privileges  properties of so distinct a class of citizens to guard—that the materials for forming this balance or check do not exist nor is there a necessity for having so permanent a part of our legislative until the executive power is so constituted as to have something fixed  dangerous in its principle—by this i mean a sole hereditary though limited executive that we cannot have a proper body for forming a legislative balance between the inordinate power of the executive and the people is evident from a review of the accidents  circumstances which gave rise to the peerage of great britain—i believe it is well ascertained that the parts which compose the british constitution arose immediately from the forests of germany but the antiquity of the establishment of nobility is by no means clearly defined some authors are of opinion that the dignity denoted by the titles of dux et comes was derived from the old roman to the german empire while others are of the opinion that they existed among the germans long before the romans were acquainted with them the institution however of nobility is immemorial among the nations who may properly be termed the ancestors of britain—at the time they were summoned in england to become a part of the national council the circumstances which contributed to make them a constituent part of that   0 constitution must be well known to all gentlemen who have had industry  curiosity enough to investigate the subject—the nobles with their possessions  dependents composed a body permanent in their nature and formidable in point of power they had a distinct interest both from the king and the people an interest which could only be represented by themselves and the guardianship could not be safely intrusted to others—at the time they were originally called to form a part of the national council necessity perhaps as much as other cause induced the monarch to look up to them it was necessary to demand the aid of his subjects in personal  pecuniary services the power and possessions of the nobility would not permit taxation from any assembly of which they were not a part  the blending the deputies of the commons with them  thus forming what they called their parlerment was perhaps as much the effect of chance as of any thing else the commons were at that time compleatly subordinate to the nobles whose consequence  influence seem to have been the only reasons for their superiority a superiority so degrading to the commons that in the first summons we find the peers are called upon to consult the commons to consent from this time the peers have composed a part of the british legislature and notwithstanding their power and influence have diminished  those of the commons have increased yet still they have always formed an excellent balance agst either the encroachments of the crown or the people     i have said that such a body cannot exist in this country for ages and that untill the situation of our people is exceedingly changed no necessity will exist for so permanent a part of the legislature to illustrate this i have remarked that the people of the united states are more equal in their circumstances than the people of any other country—that they have very few rich men among them—by rich men i mean those whose riches may have a dangerous influence or such as are esteemed rich in europe—perhaps there are not one hundred such on the continent that it is not probable this number will be greatly increased that the genius of the people their mediocrity of situation  the prospects which are afforded their industry in a country which must be a new one for centuries are unfavorable to the rapid distinction of ranks the destruction of the right of primogeniture  the equal division of the property of intestates will also have an effect to preserve this mediocrity for laws invariably affect the manners of a people on the other hand that vast extent of unpeopled territory which opens to the frugal  industrious a sure road to competency  independence will effectually prevent for a considerable time the increase of the poor or discontented and be the means of preserving that equality of condition which so eminently distinguishes us if equality is as i contend the leading feature of the u states where then are the riches  wealth whose representation  protection is the peculiar province of this permanent body are they in the     hands of the few who may be called rich in the possession of less than a hundred citizens certainly not they are in the great body of the people among whom there are no men of wealth and very few of real poverty—is it probable that a change will be created and that a new order of men will arise if under the british government for a century no such change was probable i think it may be fairly concluded it will not take place while even the semblance of republicanism remains—how is this change to be effected where are the sources from whence it is to flow from the landed interest no that is too unproductive  too much divided in most of the states from the monied interest if such exists at present little is to be apprehended from that source is it to spring from commerce i believe it would be the first instance in which a nobility sprang from merchants besides sir i apprehend that on this point the policy of the u states has been much mistaken we have unwisely considered ourselves as the inhabitants of an old instead of a new country we have adopted the maxims of a state full of people  manufactures  established in credit we have deserted our true interest and instead of applying closely to those improvements in domestic policy which would have ensured the future importance of our commerce we have rashly  prematurely engaged in schemes as extensive as they are imprudent this however is an error which daily corrects itself  i have no doubt that a few more severe trials will convince us that very different     commercial principles ought to govern the conduct of these states the people of this country are not only very different from the inhabitants of any state we are acquainted with in the modern world but i assert that their situation is distinct from either the people of greece or rome or of any state we are acquainted with among the antients—can the orders introduced by the institution of solon can they be found in the united states can the military habits  manners of sparta be resembled to our habits  manners are the distinction of patrician  plebeian known among us can the helvetic or belgic confederacies or can the unwieldy unmeaning body called the germanic empire can they be said to possess either the same or a situation like ours i apprehend not—they are perfectly different in their distinctions of rank their constitutions their manners  their policy our true situation appears to me to be this—a new extensive country containing within itself the materials for forming a government capable of extending to its citizens all the blessings of civil  religious liberty—capable of making them happy at home this is the great end of republican establishments we mistake the object of our government if we hope or wish that it is to make us respectable abroad conquest or superiority among other powers is not or ought not ever to be the object of republican systems if they are sufficiently active  energetic to rescue us from contempt      preserve our domestic happiness  security it is all we can expect from them—it is more than almost any other government ensures to its citizens i believe this observation will be found generally true—that no two people are so exactly alike in their situation or circumstances as to admit the exercise of the same government with equal benefit that a system must be suited to the habits  genius of the people it is to govern and must grow out of them the people of the u s may be divided into three classes—professional men who must from their particular pursuits always have a considerable weight in the government while it remains popular—commercial men who may or may not have weight as a wise or injudicious commercial policy is pursued—if that commercial policy is pursued which i conceive to be the true one the merchants of this country will not or ought not for a considerable time to have much weight in the political scale—the third is the landed interest the owners and cultivators of the soil who are and ought ever to be the governing spring in the system—these three classes however distinct in their pursuits are individually equal in the political scale and may be easily proved to have but one interest the dependence of each on the other is mutual the merchant depends on the planter both must in private as well as public affairs be connected with the professional men who in their turn must in some measure depend on them hence it is clear     from this manifest connection  the equality which i before stated exists  must for the reasons then assign continue that after all there is one but one great  equal body of citizens composing the inhabitants of this country among whom there are no distinctions of rank and very few or none of fortune for a people thus circumstanced are we then to form a government  the question is what sort of government is best suited to them will it be the british govt no why because g britain contains three orders of people distinct in their situation their possessions  their principles—these orders combined form the great body of the nation and as in national expences the wealth of the whole community must contribute so ought each component part to be properly  duly represented—no other combination of power could form this due representation but the one that exists—neither the peers or the people could represent the royalty nor could the royalty  the people form a proper representation for the peers—each therefore must of necessity be represented by itself or the sign of itself and this accidental mixture has certainly formed a government admirably well balanced but the u states contain but one order that can be assimilated to the british nation—this is the order of commons they will not surely then attempt to form a government consisting of three branches two of which shall have nothing to     represent they will not have an executive  senate hereditary because the king  lords of england are so the same reasons do not exist and therefore the same provisions are not necessary we must as has been observed suit our governmt to the people it is to direct these are i believe as active intelligent  susceptible of good governmt as any people in the world the confusion which has produced the present relaxed state is not owing to them it is owing to the weakness  defects of a govt incapable of combining the various interests it is intended to unite and destitute of energy—all that we have to do then is to distribute the powers of govt in such a manner and for such limited periods as while it gives a proper degree of permanency to the magistrate will reserve to the people the right of election they will not or ought not frequently to part with—i am of opinion that this may easily be done and that with some amendments the propositions before the committee will fully answer this end no position appears to me more true than this that the general govt cannot effectually exist without reserving to the states the possession of their local rights they are the instruments upon which the union must frequently depend for the support  execution of their powers however immediately operating upon the people and not upon the states much has been said about the propriety of abolishing the distinction of state governments  having     but one general system suffer me for a moment to examine this question  the mode of constituting the  d branch being under consideration the word national was struck out and united states inserted mr ghorum inclined to a compromise as to the rule of proportion he thought there was some weight in the objections of the small states if va should have    votes  delre with several other states together    those from virga would be more likely to unite than the others and would therefore have an undue influence this remark was applicable not only to states but to counties or other districts of the same state accordingly the constitution of massts had provided that the representatives of the larger districts should not be in an exact ratio to their numbers and experience he thought had shewn the provision to be expedient     mr read the states have heretofore been in a sort of partnership they ought to adjust their old affairs before they open a new account he brought into view the appropriation of the com̃on interest in the western lands to the use of particular states let justice be done on this head let the fund be applied fairly  equally to the discharge of the general debt and the smaller states who had been injured would listen then perhaps to those ideas of just representation which had been held out mr ghorum did not see how the convention could interpose in the case errors he allowed had been committed on the subject but congs were now using their endeavours to rectify them the best remedy would be such a government as would have vigor enough to do justice throughout this was certainly the best chance that could be afforded to the smaller states mr wilson the question is shall the members of the  d branch be chosen by the legislatures of the states when he considered the amazing extent of country—the immense population which is to fill it the influence which the govt we are to form will have not only on the present generation of our people  their multiplied posterity but on the whole globe he was lost in the magnitude of the object the project of henry the  th  his statesmen was but the picture in miniature of the great portrait to be exhibited he was opposed to an election by the state legislatures in explaining his reasons it was     necessary to observe the twofold relation in which the people would stand   as citizens of the genl govt   as citizens of their particular state the genl govt was meant for them in the first capacity the state govts in the second both govts were derived from the people—both meant for the people—both therefore ought to be regulated on the same principles the same train of ideas which belonged to the relation of the citizens to their state govts were applicable to their relation to the genl govt and in forming the latter we ought to proceed by abstracting as much as possible from the idea of the state govts with respect to the province  object of the genl govt they should be considered as having no existence the election of the  d branch by the legislatures will introduce  cherish local interests  local prejudices the genl govt is not an assemblage of states but of individuals for certain political purposes—it is not meant for the states but for the individuals composing them the individuals therefore not the states ought to be represented in it a proportion in this representation can be preserved in the  d as well as in the  st branch and the election can be made by electors chosen by the people for that purpose he moved an amendment to that effect which was not seconded mr elseworth saw no reason for departing from the mode contained in the report whoever chooses the member he will be a citizen of the state he is to represent  will feel the same spirit  act the same part whether he be appointed by the people   0 or the legislature every state has its particular views  prejudices which will find their way into the general councils through whatever channel they may flow wisdom was one of the characteristics which it was in contemplation to give the second branch would not more of it issue from the legislatures than from an immediate election by the people he urged the necessity of maintaining the existence  agency of the states without their cooperation it would be impossible to support a republican govt over so great an extent of country an army could scarcely render it practicable the largest states are the worst governed virga is obliged to acknowledge her incapacity to extend her govt to kentuckey massts cannot keep the peace one hundred miles from her capitol and is now forming an army for its support how long pena may be free from a like situation cannot be foreseen if the principles  materials of our govt are not adequate to the extent of these single states how can it be imagined that they can support a single govt throughout the u states the only chance of supporting a genl govt lies in grafting it on that of the individual states docr johnson urged the necessity of preserving the state govts which would be at the mercy of the genl govt on mr wilsons plan mr madison thought it wd obviate difficulty if the present resol were postponed  the  th taken up which is to fix the right of suffrage in the  d branch docr williamson professed himself a friend to such     a system as would secure the existence of the state govts the happiness of the people depended on it he was at a loss to give his vote as to the senate untill he knew the number of its members in order to ascertain this he moved to insert these words after  d branch of the natl legislature—who shall bear such proportion to the no of the  st branch as   to — he was not seconded mr mason it has been agreed on all hands that an efficient govt is necessary that to render it such it ought to have the faculty of self defence that to render its different branches effectual each of them ought to have the same power of self defence he did not wonder that such an agreement should have prevailed in these points he only wondered that there should be any disagreement about the necessity of allowing the state govts the same selfdefence if they are to be preserved as he conceived to be essential they certainly ought to have this power and the only mode left of giving it to them was by allowing them to appoint the  d branch of the natl legislature mr butler observing that we were put to difficulties at every step by the uncertainty whether an equality or a ratio of representation wd prevail finally in the  d branch moved to postpone the  th resol  to proceed to the resol on that point mr madison seconded him on the question massts no

were different from the northern if the senators should be appointed for a long term they wd settle in the state where they exercised their functions and would in a little time be rather the representatives of that than of the state appointg them mr reed movd that the term be nine years this wd admit of a very convenient rotation one third going out triennially he wd still prefer during good behaviour but being little supported in that idea he was willing to take the longest term that could be obtained mr broome  ded the motion mr madison in order to judge of the form to be given to this institution it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by it these were first to protect the people agst their rulers secondly     to protect the people agst the transient impressions into which they themselves might be led a people deliberating in a temperate moment and with the experience of other nations before them on the plan of govt most likely to secure their happiness would first be aware that those chargd with the public happiness might betray their trust an obvious precaution agst this danger wd be to divide the trust between different bodies of men who might watch  check each other in this they wd be governed by the same prudence which has prevailed in organizing the subordinate departments of govt where all business liable to abuses is made to pass thro separate hands the one being a check on the other it wd next occur to such people that they themselves were liable to temporary errors thro want of information as to their true interest and that men chosen for a short term  employed but a small portion of that in public affairs might err from the same cause this reflection wd naturally suggest that the govt be so constituted as that one of its branches might have an oppy of acquiring a competent knowledge of the public interests another reflection equally becoming a people on such an occasion wd be that they themselves as well as a numerous body of representatives were liable to err also from fickleness and passion a necessary fence agst this danger would be to select a portion of enlightened citizens whose limited number and firmness might seasonably interpose agst impetuous councils it ought finally to occur to a people     deliberating on a govt for themselves that as different interests necessarily result from the liberty meant to be secured the major interest might under sudden impulses be tempted to commit injustice on the minority in all civilized countries the people fall into different classes havg a real or supposed difference of interests there will be creditors  debtors farmers merchts  manufacturers there will be particularly the distinction of rich  poor it was true as had been observd by mr pinkney we had not among us those hereditary distinctions of rank which were a great source of the contests in the ancient govts as well as the modern states of europe nor those extremes of wealth or poverty which characterize the latter we cannot however be regarded even at this time as one homogeneous mass in which every thing that affects a part will affect in the same manner the whole in framing a system which we wish to last for ages we shd not lose sight of the changes which ages will produce an increase of population will of necessity increase the proportion of those who will labour under all the hardships of life  secretly sigh for a more equal distribution of its blessings these may in time outnumber those who are placed above the feelings of indigence according to the equal laws of suffrage the power will slide into the hands of the former no agrarian attempts have yet been made in this country but symptoms of a levelling spirit as we have understood have sufficiently appeared in certain quarters to give notice of the future danger     how is this danger to be guarded agst on the republican principles how is the danger in all cases of interested coalitions to oppress the minority to be guarded agst among other means by the establishment of a body in the govt sufficiently respectable for its wisdom  virtue to aid on such emergencies the preponderance of justice by throwing its weight into that scale such being the objects of the second branch in the proposed govt he thought a considerable duration ought to be given to it he did not conceive that the term of nine years could threaten any real danger but in pursuing his particular ideas on the subject he should require that the long term allowed to the  d branch should not commence till such a period of life as would render a perpetual disqualification to be reelected little inconvenient either in a public or private view he observed that as it was more than probable we were now digesting a plan which in its operation wd decide for ever the fate of republican govt we ought not only to provide every guard to liberty that its preservation cd require but be equally careful to supply the defects which our own experience had particularly pointed out mr sherman govt is instituted for those who live under it it ought therefore to be so constituted as not to be dangerous to their liberties the more permanency it has the worse if it be a bad govt frequent elections are necessary to preserve the good behavior of rulers they also tend to give permanency to the government by preserving that good behavior because it ensures their reelection     in connecticut elections have been very frequent yet great stability  uniformity both as to persons  measures have been experienced from its original establishmt to the present time a period of more than a   0 years he wished to have provision made for steadiness  wisdom in the system to be adopted but he thought six or four years would be sufficient he shd be content with either mr read wished it to be considered by the small states that it was their interest that we should become one people as much as possible that state attachments shd be extinguished as much as possible that the senate shd be so constituted as to have the feelings of citizens of the whole mr hamilton he did not mean to enter particularly into the subject he concurred with mr madison in thinking we were now to decide forever the fate of republican government and that if we did not give to that form due stability and wisdom it would be disgraced  lost among ourselves disgraced  lost to mankind forever he acknowledged himself not to think favorably of republican government but addressed his remarks to those who did think favorably of it in order to prevail on them to tone their government as high as possible he professed himself to be as zealous an advocate for liberty as any man whatever and trusted he should be as willing a martyr to it though he differed as to the form in which it was most eligible—he concurred also in the general observations of mr madison on the subject which might be supported     by others if it were necessary it was certainly true that nothing like an equality of property existed that an inequality would exist as long as liberty existed and that it would unavoidably result from that very liberty itself this inequality of property constituted the great  fundamental distinction in society when the tribunitial power had levelled the boundary between the patricians  plebeians what followed the distinction between rich  poor was substituted he meant not however to enlarge on the subject he rose principally to remark that mr sherman seemed not to recollect that one branch of the proposed govt was so formed as to render it particularly the guardians of the poorer orders of citizens nor to have adverted to the true causes of the stability which had been exemplified in cont under the british system as well as the federal many of the great powers appertaining to govt particularly all those relating to foreign nations were not in the hands of the govt there their internal affairs also were extremely simple owing to sundry causes many of which were peculiar to that country of late the governmt had entirely given way to the people and had in fact suspended many of its ordinary functions in order to prevent those turbulent scenes which had appeared elsewhere he asks mr s whether the state at this time dare impose  collect a tax on ye people to these causes  not to the frequency of elections the effect as far as it existed ought to be chiefly ascribed   0 mr gerry wished we could be united in our ideas concerning a permanent govt all aim at the same end but there are great differences as to the means one circumstance he thought should be carefully attended to there was not   000 part of our fellow citizens who were not agst every approach towards monarchy will they ever agree to a plan which seems to make such an approach the convention ought to be extremely cautious in what they hold out to the people whatever plan may be proposed will be espoused with warmth by many out of respect to the quarter it proceeds from as well as from an approbation of the plan itself and if the plan should be of such a nature as to rouse a violent opposition it is easy to foresee that discord  confusion will ensue and it is even possible that we may become a prey to foreign powers he did not deny the position of mr madison that the majority will generally violate justice when they have an interest in so doing but did not think there was any such temptation in this country our situation was different from that of g britain and the great body of lands yet to be parcelled out  settled would very much prolong the difference notwithstanding the symptoms of injustice which had marked many of our public councils they had not proceeded so far as not to leave hopes that there would be a sufficient sense of justice  virtue for the purpose of govt he admitted the evils arising from a frequency of elections and would agree to give the senate a duration of four or five years a longer term would     defeat itself it never would be adopted by the people mr wilson did not mean to repeat what had fallen from others but wd add an observation or two which he believed had not yet been suggested every nation may be regarded in two relations   to its own citizens   to foreign nations it is therefore not only liable to anarchy  tyranny within but has wars to avoid  treaties to obtain from abroad the senate will probably be the depository of the powers concerning the latter objects it ought therefore to be made respectable in the eyes of foreign nations the true reason why g britain has not yet listened to a commercial treaty with us has been because she had no confidence in the stability or efficacy of our government   years with a rotation will provide these desirable qualities and give our govt an advantage in this respect over monarchy itself in a monarchy much must always depend on the temper of the man in such a body the personal character will be lost in the political he wd add another observation the popular objection agst appointing any public body for a long term was that it might by gradual encroachments prolong itself first into a body for life and finally become a hereditary one it would be a satisfactory answer to this objection that as ⅓ would go out triennially there would be always three divisions holding their places for unequal times and consequently acting under the influence of different views and different impulses—on the question for   years ⅓ to go out triennially

doctr franklin seconded the motion he wished the convention to stand fair with the people there were in it a number of young men who would probably be of the senate if lucrative appointments should be recommended we might be chargeable with having carved out places for ourselves on the question—masts connecticut  pa md s carolina ay n y n j del virga n c geo no mr williamson moved to change the expression into these words to wit to receive a compensation     for the devotion of their time to the public service the motion was seconded by mr elseworth and agreed to by all the states except s carola it seemed to be meant only to get rid of the word fixt and leave greater room for modifying the provision on this point mr elseworth moved to strike out to be paid out of the natil treasury and insert to be paid by their respective states if the senate was meant to strengthen the govt it ought to have the confidence of the states the states will have an interest in keeping up a representation and will make such provision for supporting the members as will ensure their attendance mr madison considered this as a departure from a fundamental principle and subverting the end intended by allowing the senate a duration of   years they would if this motion should be agreed to hold their places during pleasure during the pleasure of the state legislatures one great end of the institution was that being a firm wise and impartial body it might not only give stability to the genl govt in its operations on individuals but hold an even balance among different states the motion would make the senate like congress the mere agents  advocates of state interests  views instead of being the impartial umpires  guardians of justice and the general good congs had lately by the establishment of a board with full powers to decide on the mutual claims between the u states  the individual states fairly acknowledged themselves     to be unfit for discharging this part of the business referred to them by the confederation mr dayton  considered the payment of the senate by the states as fatal to their independence he was decided for paying them out of the natl treasury on the question for payment of the senate to be left to the states as moved by mr elseworth massts no cont ay n y ay n j ay pa no del no md no va no n c no s c ay geo ay col mason he did not rise to make

purpose a considerable duration in office was thought necessãy but a longer term than   years would be of no avail in this respect if needy persons should be appointed he suggested therefore the propriety of annexing to the office a qualification of property he thought this would be very practicable as the rules of taxation would supply a scale for measuring the degree of wealth possessed by every man     a question was then taken whether the words to be paid out of the public treasury should stand massts ay cont no n y no n j no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c no s c no geo no mr butler

longer the time he observed allotted to the officer the more compleat will be the dependance if it exists at all  genl pinkney was for making the states as much as could be conveniently done a part of the genl govt if the senate was to be appointed by the states it ought in pursuance of the same idea to be paid by the states and the states ought not to be barred from the opportunity of calling members of it into offices at home such a restriction would also discourage the ablest men from going into the senate mr williamson moved a resolution so penned as to admit of the two following

wednesday june    in convention mr rutlidge moved to postpone the  th resolution defining the powers of congs in order to take up the      which involved the most fundamental points the rules of suffrage in the   branches which was agreed to nem con     a question being proposed on the resol   declaring that the suffrage in the first branch shd be according to an equitable ratio mr l martin  contended at great length and with great eagerness that the general govt was meant merely to preserve the state governts not to govern individuals that its powers ought to be kept within narrow limits that if too little power was given to it more might be added but that if too much it could never be resumed that individuals as such have little to do but with their own states that the genl govt has no more to apprehend from the states composing the union while it pursues proper measures that govt over individuals has to apprehend from its subjects that to resort to the citizens at large for their sanction to a new governt will be throwing them back into a state of nature that the dissolution of the state govts is involved in the nature of the process that the people have no right to do this without the consent of those to whom they have delegated their power for state purposes through their tongues only they can speak through their ears only can hear that the states have shewn a good disposition to comply with the acts of congs weak contemptibly weak as that body has been and have failed through inability alone to comply that the heaviness of the private debts     and the waste of property during the war were the chief causes of this inability that he did not conceive the instances mentioned by mr madison of compacts between va  md between pa  n j or of troops raised by massts for defence against the rebels to be violations of the articles of confederation—that an equal vote in each state was essential to the federal idea and was founded in justice  freedom not merely in policy that tho the states may give up this right of sovereignty yet they had not and ought not that the states like individuals were in a state of nature equally sovereign  free in order to prove that individuals in a state of nature are equally free  independent he read passages from locke vattel lord summers—priestly to prove that the case is the same with states till they surrender their equal sovereignty he read other passages in locke  vattel and also rutherford that the states being equal cannot treat or confederate so as to give up an equality of votes without giving up their liberty that the propositions on the table were a system of slavery for  0 states that as va massts  pa have    0 of the votes they can do as they please without a miraculous union of the other ten that they will have nothing to do but to gain over one of the ten to make them compleat masters of the rest that they can then appoint an execute  judiciary  legislate for them as they please that there was  would continue a natural predilection  partiality in men for their own states that the states particularly the smaller would never allow     a negative to be exercised over their laws that no state in ratifying the confederation had objected to the equality of votes that the complaints at present run not agst this equality but the want of power that    members from va would be more likely to act in concert than a like number formed of members from different states that instead of a junction of the small states as a remedy he thought a division of the large states would be more eligible—this was the substance of a speech which was continued more than three hours he was too much exhausted he said to finish his remarks and reminded the house that he should tomorrow resume them adjd thursday june   th in convention mr l martin resumed his discourse  contending that the genl govt ought to be formed for the states not for individuals that if the states were to have  00 votes in proportion to their numbers of people it would be the same thing whether their representatives were chosen by the legislatures or the people the smaller states would be equally enslaved that if the large states have the same interest with the smaller as was urged there could be no danger in giving them an equal vote they would not injure themselves and they could not injure the large ones on that supposition without injuring themselves and if the interests were not the same the inequality of suffrage wd be dangerous to the smaller states that  0  it will be in vain to propose any plan offensive to the rulers of the states whose influence over the people will certainly prevent their adopting it that the large states were weak at present in proportion to their extent  could only be made formidable to the small ones by the weight of their votes that in case a dissolution of the union should take place the small states would have nothing to fear from their power that if in such a case the three great states should league themselves together the other ten could do so too  that he had rather see partial  0  confederacies take place than the plan on the table this was the substance of the residue of his discourse which was delivered with much diffuseness  considerable vehemence mr lansing  mr dayton moved to strike out not so that the   art might read that the rights of suffrage in the  st branch ought to be according to the rule established by the confederation mr dayton expressed great anxiety that the question might not be put till tomorrow governr livingston being kept away by indisposition and the representation of n jersey thereby suspended mr williamson thought that if any political truth could be grounded on mathematical demonstration it was that if the states were equally sovereign now and parted with equal proportions of sovereignty that they would remain equally sovereign he could not comprehend how the smaller states would be injured in the case and wished some gentleman would vouchsafe a solution of it he observed that the small states if they had a plurality of votes would have an interest in throwing the burdens off their own shoulders on those of the large ones he begged that the expected addition of new states from the westward might be kept in view they would be small states they would be poor states they would be unable to pay in proportion to their numbers their distance from market rendering the produce of their labour less valuable they would consequently be tempted to combine for the purpose of laying burdens on com̃erce  consumption  0  which would fall with greatest weight on the old states mr madison sd he was much disposed to concur in any expedient not inconsistent with fundamental principles that could remove the difficulty concerning the rule of representation but he could neither be convinced that the rule contended for was just nor necessary for the safety of the small states agst the large states that it was not just had been conceded by mr breerly  mr paterson themselves the expedient proposed by them was a new partition of the territory of the u states the fallacy of the reasoning drawn from the equality of sovereign states in the formation of compacts lay in confounding together mere treaties in which were specified certain duties to which the parties were to be bound and certain rules by which their subjects were to be reciprocally governed in their intercourse with a compact by which an authority was created paramount to the parties  making laws for the government of them if france england  spain were to enter into a treaty for the regulation of commerce c with the prince of monacho    or   other of the smallest sovereigns of europe they would not hesitate to treat as equals and to make the regulations perfectly reciprocal wd the case be the same if a council were to be formed of deputies from each with authority and discretion to raise money levy troops determine the value of coin c would  0 or  0 million of people submit their fortunes into the hands of a few thousands  0  if they did it would only prove that they expected more from the terror of their superior force than they feared from the selfishness of their feeble associates why are counties of the same states represented in proportion to their numbers is it because the representatives are chosen by the people themselves so will be the representatives in the nationl legislature is it because the larger have more at stake than the smaller the case will be the same with the larger  smaller states is it because the laws are to operate immediately on their persons  properties the same is the case in some degree as the articles of confederation stand the same will be the case in a far greater degree under the plan proposed to be substituted in the cases of captures of piracies and of offences in a federal army the property  persons of individuals depend on the laws of congs by the plan proposed a compleat power of taxation the highest prerogative of supremacy is proposed to be vested in the national govt many other powers are added which assimilate it to the govt of individual states the negative proposed on the state laws will make it an essential branch of the state legislatures  of course will require that it should be exercised by a body established on like principles with the other branches of those legislatures—that it is not necessãy to secure the small states agst the large ones he conceived to be equally obvious was a combination of the large ones dreaded this must arise either from some interest common to va massts  pa   0  distinguishing them from the other states or from the mere circumstance of similarity of size did any such common interest exist in point of situation they could not have been more effectually separated from each other by the most jealous citizen of the most jealous state in point of manners religion and the other circumstances which sometimes beget affection between different communities they were not more assimilated than the other states—in point of the staple productions they were as dissimilar as any three other states in the union the staple of massts was fish of pa flower of va tobo was a combination to be apprehended from the mere circumstance of equality of size experience suggested no such danger the journals of congs did not present any peculiar association of these states in the votes recorded it had never been seen that different counties in the same state conformable in extent but disagreeing in other circumstances betrayed a propensity to such combinations experience rather taught a contrary lesson among individuals of superior eminence  weight in society rivalships were much more frequent than coalitions among independent nations preeminent over their neighbours the same remark was verified carthage  rome tore one another to pieces instead of uniting their forces to devour the weaker nations of the earth the houses of austria  france were hostile as long as they remained the greatest powers of europe england  france have succeeded to the preeminence  to the enmity to this principle we  0  owe perhaps our liberty a coalition between those powers would have been fatal to us among the principal members of antient  modern confederacies we find the same effect from the same cause the contentions not the coalitions of sparta athens  thebes proved fatal to the smaller members of the amphyctionic confederacy the contentions not the combinations of prussia  austria have distracted  oppressed the german empire were the large states formidable singly to their smaller neighbours on this supposition the latter ought to wish for such a general govt as will operate with equal energy on the former as on themselves the more lax the band the more liberty the larger will have to avail themselves of their superior force here again experience was an instructive monitor what is ye situation of the weak compared with the strong in those stages of civilization in which the violence of individuals is least controuled by an efficient government the heroic period of antient greece the feudal licentiousness of the middle ages of europe the existing condition of the american savages answer this question what is the situation of the minor sovereigns in the great society of independent nations in which the more powerful are under no controul but the nominal authority of the law of nations is not the danger to the former exactly in proportion to their weakness but there are cases still more in point what was the condition of the weaker members of the amphyctionic confederacy plutarch life of themistocles will inform us that it  0  happened but too often that the strongest cities corrupted  awed the weaker and that judgment went in favor of the more powerful party what is the condition of the lesser states in the german confederacy we all know that they are exceedingly trampled upon and that they owe their safety as far as they enjoy it partly to their enlisting themselves under the rival banners of the preeminent members partly to alliances with neighbouring princes which the constitution of the empire does not prohibit what is the state of things in the lax system of the dutch confederacy holland contains about ½ the people supplies about ½ of the money and by her influence silently  indirectly governs the whole republic in a word the two extremes before us are a perfect separation  a perfect incorporation of the    states in the first case they would be independent nations subject to no law but the law of nations in the last they would be mere counties of one entire republic subject to one common law in the first case the smaller states would have every thing to fear from the larger in the last they would have nothing to fear the true policy of the small states therefore lies in promoting those principles  that form of govt which will most approximate the states to the condition of counties another consideration may be added if the genl govt be feeble the large states distrusting its continuance and foreseeing that their importance  security may depend on their own size  strength will never submit to a partition give to the genl  0  govt sufficient energy  permanency  you remove the objection gradual partitions of the large  junctions of the small states will be facilitated and time may effect that equalization which is wished for by the small states now but can never be accomplished at once mr wilson the leading argument of those who contend for equality of votes among the states is that the states as such being equal and being represented not as districts of individuals but in their political  corporate capacities are entitled to an equality of suffrage according to this mode of reasoning the representation of the boroughs in engldtilde which has been allowed on all hands to be the rotten part of the constitution is perfectly right  proper they are like the states represented in their corporate capacity like the states therefore they are entitled to equal voices old sarum to as many as london and instead of the injury supposed hitherto to be done to london the true ground of complaint lies with old sarum for london instead of two which is her proper share sends four representatives to parliament  mr sherman the question is not what rights naturally belong to man but how they may be most  0  equally  effectually guarded in society and if some give up more than others in order to obtain this end there can be no room for complaint to do otherwise to require an equal concession from all if it would create danger to the rights of some would be sacrificing the end to the means the rich man who enters into society along with the poor man gives up more than the poor man yet with an equal vote he is equally safe were he to have more votes than the poor man in proportion to his superior stake the rights of the poor man would immediately cease to be secure this consideration prevailed when the articles of confederation were formed  the determination of the question from striking out the word not was put off till tomorrow at the request of the deputies of n york docr franklin mr president the small progress we have made after   or five weeks close attendance  continual reasonings with each other—our different sentiments on almost every question several of the last producing as many noes as ays is methinks a melancholy proof of the imperfection of the human understanding we indeed seem to feel our own want of political wisdom since we have been running about in search of it we   0 have gone back to ancient history for models of government and examined the different forms of those republics which having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution now no longer exist and we have viewed modern states all round europe but find none of their constitutions suitable to our circumstances in this situation of this assembly groping as it were in the dark to find political truth and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us how has it happened sir that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the father of lights to illuminate our understandings in the beginning of the contest with g britain when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the divine protection—our prayers sir were heard  they were graciously answered all of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending providence in our favor to that kind providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity and have we now forgotten that powerful friend or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance i have lived sir a long time and the longer i live the more convincing proofs i see of this truth—that god governs in the affairs of men and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid we have been assured sir in the sacred writings that except the lord build the house they labour     in vain that build it i firmly believe this and i also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of babel we shall be divided by our little partial local interests our projects will be confounded and we ourselves shall become a reproach and bye word down to future ages and what is worse mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance war and conquest i therefore beg leave to move—that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service— mr sharman seconded the motion mr hamilton  several others expressed their apprehensions that however proper such a resolution might have been at the beginning of the convention it might at this late day   bring on it some disagreeable animadversions    lead the public to believe that the embarrassments and dissensions within the convention had suggested this measure it was answered by docr f mr sherman  others that the past omission of a duty could not justify a further omission—that the rejection of such a proposition would expose the convention to more unpleasant animadversions than the adoption of it and that the alarm out of doors that might be excited for     the state of things within would at least be as likely to do good as ill mr williamson observed that the true cause of the omission could not be mistaken the convention had no funds mr randolph proposed in order to give a favorable aspect to ye measure that a sermon be preached at the request of the convention on  th of july the anniversary of independence  thenceforward prayers be used in ye convention every morning dr frankn  ded this motion after several unsuccessful attempts for silently postponing this matter by adjourng the adjournment was at length carried without any vote on the motion friday june   th in convention docr johnson the controversy must be endless whilst gentlemen differ in the grounds of their arguments those on one side considering the states as districts of people composing one political society those on the other considering them as so many political societies the fact is that the states do exist as political societies and a govt is to be formed for them in their political capacity as well as for the individuals composing them does it not seem to follow that if the states as such are to exist they must be armed with some power of selfdefence this is the idea of col mason who appears to have looked to the bottom of this matter besides the     aristocratic and other interests which ought to have the means of defending themselves the states have their interests as such and are equally entitled to like means on the whole he thought that as in some respects the states are to be considered in their political capacity and in others as districts of individual citizens the two ideas embraced on different sides instead of being opposed to each other ought to be combined that in one branch the people ought to be represented in the other the states mr ghoram the states as now confederated have no doubt a right to refuse to be consolidated or to be formed into any new system but he wished the small states which seemed most ready to object to consider which are to give up most they or the larger ones he conceived that a rupture of the union wd be an event unhappy for all but surely the large states would be least unable to take care of themselves and to make connections with one another the weak therefore were most interested in establishing some general system for maintaining order if among individuals composed partly of weak and partly of strong the former most need the protection of law  government the case is exactly the same with weak  powerful states what would be the situation of delaware for these things he found must be spoken out  it might as well be done at first as last what wd be the situation of delaware in case of a separation of the states would she not be at the mercy of pennsylvania would not her true interest lie in being consolidated with her     and ought she not now to wish for such a union with pa under one govt as will put it out of the power of pena to oppress her nothing can be more ideal than the danger apprehended by the states from their being formed into one nation massts was originally three colonies viz old massts plymouth— the province of mayne these apprehensions existed then an incorporation took place all parties were safe  satisfied and every distinction is now forgotten the case was similar with connecticut  new haven the dread of union was reciprocal the consequence of it equally salutary and satisfactory in like manner n jersey has been made one society out of two parts should a separation of the states take place the fate of n jersey wd be worst of all she has no foreign commerce  can have but little pa  n york will continue to levy taxes on her consumption if she consults her interest she wd beg of all things to be annihilated the apprehensions of the small states ought to be appeased by another reflection massts will be divided the province of maine is already considered as approaching the term of its annexation to it and pa will probably not increase considering the present state of her population  other events that may happen on the whole he considered a union of the states as necessary to their happiness  a firm genl govt as necessary to their union he shd consider it as his duty if his colleagues viewed the matter in the same light he did to stay here as long as any other state would remain with them in order to agree on some     plan that could with propriety be recommended to the people mr elseworth did not despair he still trusted that some good plan of govt wd be devised  adopted mr read he shd have no objection to the system if it were truly national but it has too much of a federal mixture in it the little states he thought had not much to fear he suspected that the large states felt their want of energy  wished for a genl govt to supply the defect massts was evidently labouring under her weakness and he believed delaware wd not be in much danger if in her neighbourhood delaware had enjoyed tranquillity  he flattered himself wd continue to do so he was not however so selfish as not to wish for a good genl govt in order to obtain one the whole states must be incorporated if the states remain the representatives of the large ones will stick together and carry everything before them the executive also will be chosen under the influence of this partiality and will betray it in his administration these jealousies are inseparable from the scheme of leaving the states in existence they must be done away the ungranted lands also which have been assumed by particular states must also be given up he repeated his approbation of the plan of mr hamilton  wished it to be substituted in the place of that on the table mr madison agreed with docr johnson that the mixed nature of the govt ought to be kept in view but thought too much stress was laid on the rank of     the states as political societies there was a gradation he observed from the smallest corporation with the most limited powers to the largest empire with the most perfect sovereignty he pointed out the limitations on the sovereignty of the states as now confederated their laws in relation to the paramount law of the confederacy were analagous to that of bye laws to the supreme law within a state under the proposed govt the powers of the states will be much farther reduced according to the views of every member the genl govt will have powers far beyond those exercised by the british parliament when the states were part of the british empire it will in particular have the power without the consent of the state legislatures to levy money directly on the people themselves and therefore not to divest such unequal portions of the people as composed the several states of an equal voice would subject the system to the reproaches  evils which have resulted from the vicious representation in g b he entreated the gentlemen representing the small states to renounce a principle wch was confessedly unjust which cd never be admitted  if admitted must infuse mortality into a constitution which we wished to last forever he prayed them to ponder well the consequences of suffering the confederacy to go to pieces it had been sd that the want of energy in the large states wd be a security to the small it was forgotten that this want of energy proceeded from the supposed security of the states     agst all external danger let each state depend on itself for its security  let apprehensions arise of danger from distant powers or from neighbouring states  the languishing condition of all the states large as well as small wd soon be transformed into vigorous  high toned govts his great fear was that their govts wd then have too much energy that these might not only be formidable in the large to the small states but fatal to the internal liberty of all the same causes which have rendered the old world the theatre of incessant wars  have banished liberty from the face of it wd soon produce the same effects here the weakness  jealousy of the small states wd quickly introduce some regular military force agst sudden danger from their powerful neighbours the example wd be followed by others and wd soon become universal in time of actual war great discretionary powers are constantly given to the executive magistrate constant apprehension of war has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body a standing military force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe companions to liberty the means of defence agst foreign danger have been always the instruments of tyranny at home among the romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war whenever a revolt was apprehended throughout all europe the armies kept up under the pretext of defending have enslaved the people it is perhaps questionable whether the best concerted system of absolute power in europe cd maintain itself in a situation where no     alarms of external danger cd tame the people to the domestic yoke the insular situation of g britain was the principal cause of her being an exception to the general fate of europe it has rendered less defence necessary and admitted a kind of defence wch cd not be used for the purpose of oppression—these consequences he conceived ought to be apprehended whether the states should run into a total separation from each other or shd enter into partial confederacies either event wd be truly deplorable  those who might be accessary to either could never be forgiven by their country nor by themselves  mr hamilton observed that individuals forming political societies modify their rights differently with regard to suffrage examples of it are found in all the states in all of them some individuals are deprived of the right altogether not having the requisite qualification of property in some of the states the right of suffrage is allowed in some cases and refused in others to vote for a member in one branch a certain quantum of property to vote for a member in another branch of the legislature a higher quantum of property is required in like manner states may modify their right of suffrage differently the larger exercising a larger the smaller a smaller share of it but as states are a collection of individual men which ought we to respect most the rights of the people composing them or of the artificial beings resulting from the composition nothing could be more preposterous or absurd than     to sacrifice the former to the latter it has been sd that if the smaller states renounce their equality they renounce at the same time their liberty the truth is it is a contest for power not for liberty will the men composing the small states be less free than those composing the larger the state of delaware having  0000 souls will lose power if she has   0 only of the votes allowed to pa having  00000 but will the people of del be less free if each citizen has an equal vote with each citizen of pa he admitted that common residence within the same state would produce a certain degree of attachment and that this principle might have a certain influence in public affairs he thought however that this might by some precautions be in a great measure excluded and that no material inconvenience could result from it as there could not be any ground for combination among the states whose influence was most dreaded the only considerable distinction of interests lay between the carrying  noncarrying states which divides instead of uniting the largest states no considerable inconvenience had been found from the division of the state of n york into different districts of different sizes some of the consequences of a dissolution of the union and the establishment of partial confederacies had been pointed out he would add another of a most serious nature alliances will immediately be formed with different rival  hostile nations of europes who will foment disturbances among ourselves and make us parties to all their own quarrels   0 foreign nations having american dominion are  must be jealous of us their representatives betray the utmost anxiety for our fate  for the result of this meeting which must have an essential influence on it—it had been said that respectability in the eyes of foreign nations was not the object at which we aimed that the proper object of republican government was domestic tranquillity  happiness this was an ideal distinction no government could give us tranquillity  happiness at home which did not possess sufficient stability and strength to make us respectable abroad this was the critical moment for forming such a government we should run every risk in trusting to future amendments as yet we retain the habits of union we are weak  sensible of our weakness henceforward the motives will become feebler and the difficulties greater it is a miracle that we were now here exercising our tranquil  free deliberations on the subject it would be madness to trust to future miracles a thousand causes must obstruct a reproduction of them mr pierce considered the equality of votes under the confederation as the great source of the public difficulties the members of congs were advocates for local advantages state distinctions must be sacrificed as far as the general good required but without destroying the states tho from a small state he felt himself a citizen of the u s mr gerry urged that we never were independent states were not such now  never could be even     on the principles of the confederation the states  the advocates for them were intoxicated with the idea of their sovereignty he was a member of congress at the time the federal articles were formed the injustice of allowing each state an equal vote was long insisted on he voted for it but it was agst his judgment and under the pressure of public danger and the obstinacy of the lesser states the present confederation he considered as dissolving the fate of the union will be decided by the convention if they do not agree on something few delegates will probably be appointed to congs if they do congs will probably be kept up till the new system should be adopted he lamented that instead of coming here like a band of brothers belonging to the same family we seemed to have brought with us the spirit of political negotiators mr l martin remarked that the language of the states being sovereign  independent was once familiar  understood though it seemed now so strange  obscure he read those passages in the articles of confederation which describe them in that language on the question as moved by mr lansing shall the word not be struck out massts no cont ay n y ay n j ay pa no del ay md divd va no n c no s c no geo no on the motion to agree to the clause as reported that the rule of suffrage in the  st branch ought not to be according to that established by the articles of the confederation     mass ay cont no n y no n j no pa ay del no md divd va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay docr johnson  mr elseworth moved to postpone the residue of the clause  take up ye   resol on question mas no cont ay n y ay n j ay pa ay del no md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr elseworth moved that the rule of suffrage in the  d branch be the same with that established by the articles of confederation he was not sorry on the whole he said that the vote just passed had determined against this rule in the first branch he hoped it would become a ground of compromise with regard to the  d branch we were partly national partly federal the proportional representation in the first branch was conformable to the national principle  would secure the large states agst the small an equality of voices was conformable to the federal principle and was necessary to secure the small states agst the large he trusted that on this middle ground a compromise would take place he did not see that it could on any other and if no compromise should take place our meeting would not only be in vain but worse than in vain to the eastward he was sure massts was the only state that would listen to a proposition for excluding the states as equal political societies from an equal voice in both branches the others would risk every consequence rather than part with so dear a right     an attempt to deprive them of it was at once cutting the body of america in two and as he supposed would be the case somewhere about this part of it the large states he conceived would notwithstanding the equality of votes have an influence that would maintain their superiority holland as had been admitted by mr madison had notwithstanding a like equality in the dutch confederacy a prevailing influence in the public measures the power of self defence was essential to the small states nature had given it to the smallest insect of the creation he could never admit that there was no danger of combinations among the large states they will like individuals find out and avail themselves of the advantage to be gained by it it was true the danger would be greater if they were contiguous and had a more immediate common interest a defensive combination of the small states was rendered more difficult by their great number he would mention another consideration of great weight the existing confederation was founded on the equality of the states in the article of suffrage was it meant to pay no regard to this antecedent plighted faith let a strong executive a judiciary  legislative power be created but let not too much be attempted by which all may be lost he was not in general a halfway man yet he preferred doing half the good we could rather than do nothing at all the other half may be added when the necessity shall be more fully experienced      mr baldwin  could have wished that the powers of the general legislature had been defined before the mode of constituting it had been agitated he should vote against the motion of mr elseworth tho he did not like the resolution as it stood in the report of the comittee of the whole he thought the second branch ought to be the representation of property and that in forming it therefore some reference ought to be had to the relative wealth of their constituents and to the principles on which the senate of massts was constituted he concurred with those who thought it wd be impossible for the genl legislature to extend its cares to the local matters of the states  adjd     saturday june  0      in convention mr brearly moved that the presidt write to the executive of n hampshire informing it that the business depending before the convention was of such a nature as to require the immediate attendance of the deputies of that state in support of his motion he observed that the difficulties of the subject and the diversity of opinions called for all the assistance we could possibly obtain it was well understood that the object was to add n hampshire to the no of states opposed to the doctrine of proportional representation which it was presumed from her relative size she must be adverse to mr patterson seconded the motion     mr rutlidge could see neither the necessity nor propriety of such a measure they are not unapprized of the meeting and can attend if they choose rho island might as well be urged to appoint  send deputies are we to suspend the business until the deputies arrive if we proceed he hoped all the great points would be adjusted before the letter could produce its effect mr king said he had written more than once as a private correspondent  the answers gave him every reason to expect that state would be represented very shortly if it shd be so at all circumstances of a personal nature had hitherto prevented it a letter cd have no effect mr wilson wished to know whether it would be consistent with the rule or reason of secrecy to communicate to n hampshire that the business was of such a nature as the motion described it wd spread a great alarm besides he doubted the propriety of soliciting any state on the subject the meeting being merely voluntary—on motion of mr brearly masts no cont no n y ay n j ay pa not on ye floor del not on floor md divd va no n c no s c no geo not on floor the motion of mr elseworth resumed for allowing each state an equal vote in ye  d branch mr wilson did not expect such a motion after the establishment of ye contrary principle in the  st branch and considering the reasons which would oppose it even if an equal vote had been allowed in the  st branch the gentleman from connecticut     mr elseworth had pronounced that if the motion should not be acceded to of all the states north of pena one only would agree to any genl government he entertained more favorable hopes of connt and of the other northern states he hoped the alarms exceeded their cause and that they would not abandon a country to which they were bound by so many strong and endearing ties but should the deplored event happen it would neither stagger his sentiments nor his duty if the minority of the people of america refuse to coalesce with the majority on just and proper principles if a separation must take place it could never happen on better grounds the votes of yesterday agst the just principle of representation were as    to  0 of the people of america taking the opinions to be the same on this point and he was sure if there was any room for change it could not be on the side of the majority the question will be shall less than ¼ of the u states withdraw themselves from the union or shall more than ¾ renounce the inherent indisputable and unalienable rights of men in favor of the artificial systems of states if issue must be joined it was on this point he would chuse to join it the gentleman from connecticut in supposing that the prepondenancy secured to the majority in the  st branch had removed the objections to an equality of votes in the  d branch for the security of the minority narrowed the case extremely such an equality will enable the minority to controul in all cases whatsoever the sentiments and interests of the majority seven     states will controul six seven states according to the estimates that had been used composed    0 of the whole people it would be in the power then of less than ⅓ to overrule ⅔ whenever a question should happen to divide the states in that manner can we forget for whom we are forming a government is it for men or for the imaginary beings called states will our honest constituents be satisfied with metaphysical distinctions will they ought they to be satisfied with being told that the onethird compose the greater number of states the rule of suffrage ought on every principle to be the same in the  d as in the  st branch if the government be not laid on this foundation it can be neither solid nor lasting any other principle will be local confined  temporary this will expand with the expansion and grow with the growth of the u states—much has been said of an imaginary combination of three states sometimes a danger of monarchy sometimes of aristocrary has been charged on it no explanation however of the danger has been vouchsafed it would be easy to prove both from reason  history that rivalships would be more probable than coalitions and that there are no coinciding interests that could produce the latter no answer has yet been given to the observations of mr madison on this subject should the executive magistrate be taken from one of the large states would not the other two be thereby thrown into the scale with the other states whence then the danger of monarchy are the people of the three large     states more aristocratic than those of the small ones whence then the danger of aristocracy from their influence it is all a mere illusion of names we talk of states till we forget what they are composed of is a real  fair majority the natural hotbed of aristocracy it is a part of the definition of this species of govt or rather of tyranny that the smaller number governs the greater it is true that a majority of states in the  d branch cannot carry a law agst a majority of the people in the  st but this removes half only of the objection bad governts are of two sorts   that which does too little   that which does too much that which fails thro weakness and that which destroys thro oppression under which of these evils do the u states at present groan under the weakness and inefficiency of its governt to remedy this weakness we have been sent to this convention if the motion should be agreed to we shall leave the u s fettered precisely as heretofore with the additional mortification of seeing the good purposes of ye fair representation of the people in the  st branch defeated in the  d twenty four will still controul sixty six he lamented that such a disagreement should prevail on the point of representation as he did not foresee that it would happen on the other point most contested the boundary between the genl  the local authorities he thought the states necessary  valuable parts of a good system mr elseworth the capital objection of mr wilson that the minority will rule the majority is not   0 true the power is given to the few to save them from being destroyed by the many if an equality of votes had been given to them in both branches the objection might have had weight is it a novel thing that the few should have a check on the many is it not the case in the british constitution the wisdom of which so many gentlemen have united in applauding have not the house of lords who form so small a proportion of the nation a negative on the laws as a necessary defence of their peculiar rights agst the encroachmts of the commons no instance of a confederacy has existed in which an equality of voices has not been exercised by the members of it we are running from one extreme to another we are razing the foundations of the building when we need only repair the roof no salutary measure has been lost for want of a majority of the states to favor it if security be all that the great states wish for the  st branch secures them the danger of combinations among them is not imaginary altho no particular abuses could be foreseen by him the possibility of them would be sufficient to alarm him but he could easily conceive cases in which they might result from such combinations suppose that in pursuance of some commercial treaty or arrangement three or four free ports  no more were to be established would not combinations be formed in favor of boston—philada  some port of the chesapeak a like concert might be formed in the appointment of the great officers he appealed again to the obligations     of the federal pact which was still in force and which had been entered into with so much solemnity persuading himself that some regard would still be paid to the plighted faith under which each state small as well as great held an equal right of suffrage in the general councils his remarks were not the result of partial or local views the state he represented connecticut held a middle rank mr madison did justice to the able and close reasoning of mr e but must observe that it did not always accord with itself on another occasion the large states were described by him as the aristocratic states ready to oppress the small now the small are the house of lords requiring a negative to defend them agst the more numerous commons mr e had also erred in saying that no instance had existed in which confederated states had not retained to themselves a perfect equality of suffrage passing over the german system in which the k of prussia has nine voices he reminded mr e of the lycian confederacy in which the component members had votes proportioned to their importance and which montesquieu recommends as the fittest model for that form of government had the fact been as stated by mr e it would have been of little avail to him or rather would have strengthened the arguments agst him the history  fate of the several confederacies modern as well as antient demonstrating some radical vice in their structure in reply to the appeal of mr e to the faith plighted in the existing federal compact he remarked that the     party claiming from others an adherence to a common engagement ought at least to be guiltless itself of a violation of all the states however connecticut was perhaps least able to urge this plea besides the various omissions to perform the stipulated acts from which no state was free the legislature of that state had by a pretty recent vote positively refused to pass a law for complying with the requisitions of congs and had transmitted a copy of the vote to congs it was urged he said continually that an equality of votes in the  d branch was not only necessary to secure the small but would be perfectly safe to the large ones whose majority in the  st branch was an effectual bulwark but notwithstanding this apparent defence the majority of states might still injure the majority of people   they could obstruct the wishes and interests of the majority   they could extort measures repugnant to the wishes  interest of the majority   they could impose measures adverse thereto as the  d branch will probl̃y exercise some great powers in which the  st will not participate he admitted that every peculiar interest whether in any class of citizens or any description of states ought to be secured as far as possible wherever there is danger of attack there ought to be given a constitutional power of defence but he contended that the states were divided into different interests not by their difference of size but by other circumstances the most material of which resulted partly from climate but principally from the effects of their having     or not having slaves these two causes concurred in forming the great division of interests in the u states it did not lie between the large  small states it lay between the northern  southern and if any defensive power were necessary it ought to be mutually given to these two interests he was so strongly impressed with this important truth that he had been casting about in his mind for some expedient that would answer the purpose the one which had occurred was that instead of proportioning the votes of the states in both branches to their respective numbers of inhabitants computing the slaves in the ratio of   to   they should be represented in one branch according to the number of free inhabitants only and in the other according to the whole no counting the slaves as free by this arrangement the southern scale would have the advantage in one house and the northern in the other he had been restrained from proposing this expedient by two considerations one was his unwillingness to urge any diversity of interests on an occasion where it is but too apt to arise of itself—the other was the inequality of powers that must be vested in the two branches and which wd destroy the equilibrium of interests mr elseworth assured the house that whatever might be thought of the representatives of connecticut the state was entirely federal in her disposition he appealed to her great exertions during the war in supplying both men  money the muster rolls would show she had more troops in the     field than virga if she had been delinquent it had been from inability and not more so than other states mr sherman mr madison had animadverted on the delinquency of the states when his object required him to prove that the constitution of congs was faulty congs is not to blame for the faults of the states their measures have been right and the only thing wanting has been a further power in congs to render them effectual mr davy was much embarrassed and wished for explanations the report of the committee allowing the legislatures to choose the senate and establishing a proportional representation in it seemed to be impracticable there will according to this rule be ninety members in the outset and the number will increase as new states are added it was impossible that so numerous a body could possess the activity and other qualities required in it were he to vote on the comparative merits of the report as it stood and the amendment he should be constrained to prefer the latter the appointment of the senate by electors chosen by the people for that purpose was he conceived liable to an insuperable difficulty the larger counties or districts thrown into a general district would certainly prevail over the smaller counties or districts and merit in the latter would be excluded altogether the report therefore seemed to be right in referring the appointment to the legislatures whose agency in the general system did not appear to him objectionable     as it did to some others the fact was that the local prejudices  interests which could not be denied to exist would find their way into the national councils whether the representatives should be chosen by the legislatures or by the people themselves on the other hand if a proportional representation was attended with insuperable difficulties the making the senate the representative of the states looked like bringing us back to congs again and shutting out all the advantages expected from it under this view of the subject he could not vote for any plan for the senate yet proposed he thought that in general there were extremes on both sides we were partly federal partly national in our union and he did not see why the govt might not in some respects operate on the states in others on the people mr wilson admitted the question concerning the number of senators to be embarrassing if the smallest states be allowed one and the others in proportion the senate will certainly be too numerous he looked forward to the time when the smallest states will contain  00000 souls at least let there be then one senator in each for every  00000 souls and let the states not having that no of inhabitants be allowed one he was willing himself to submit to this temporary concession to the small states and threw out the idea as a ground of compromise docr franklin the diversity of opinions turns on two points if a proportional representation takes     place the small states contend that their liberties will be in danger if an equality of votes is to be put in its place the large states say their money will be in danger when a broad table is to be made and the edges of planks do not fit the artist takes a little from both and makes a good joint in like manner here both sides must part with some of their demands in order that they may join in some accommodating proposition he had prepared one which he would read that it might lie on the table for consideration the proposition was in the words following that the legislatures of the several states shall choose  send an equal number of delegates namely — who are to compose the  d branch of the general legislature— that in all cases or questions wherein the sovereignty of individual states may be affected or whereby their authority over their own citizens may be diminished or the authority of the general government within the several states augmented each state shall have equal suffrage that in the appointment of all civil officers of ye genl govt in the election of whom the  d branch may by the constitution have part each state shall have equal suffrage that in fixing the salaries of such officers and in all allowances for public services and generally in all appropriations  dispositions of money to be drawn out of the general treasury and in all laws for supplying that treasury the delegates of the several states shall have suffrage in proportion to     the sums which their respective states do actually contribute to the treasury where a ship had many owners this was the rule of deciding on her expedition he had been one of the ministers from this country to france during the joint war and wd have been very glad if allowed a vote in distributing the money to carry it on mr king observed that the simple question was whether each state should have an equal vote in the  d branch that it must be apparent to those gentlemen who liked neither the motion for this equality nor the report as it stood that the report was as susceptible of melioration as the motion that a reform would be nugatory  nominal only if we should make another congress of the proposed senate that if the adherence to an equality of votes was fixed  unalterable there could not be less obstinacy on the other side  that we were in fact cut asunder already and it was in vain to shut our eyes against it that he was however filled with astonishment that if we were convinced that every man in america was secured in all his rights we should be ready to sacrifice this substantial good to the phantom of state sovereignty that his feelings were more harrowed  his fears more agitated for his country than he could express that he conceived this to be the last opportunity of providing for its liberty  happiness that he could not therefore but repeat his amazement that when a just governt founded on a fair representation of the people of america was within our reach we should     renounce the blessing from an attachment to the ideal freedom  importance of states that should this wonderful illusion continue to prevail his mind was prepared for every event rather than to sit down under a govt founded in a vicious principle of representation and which must be as short lived as it would be unjust he might prevail on himself to accede to some such expedient as had been hinted by mr wilson but he never could listen to an equality of votes as proposed in the motion mr dayton when assertion is given for proof and terror substituted for argument he presumed they would have no effect however eloquently spoken it should have been shewn that the evils we have experienced have proceeded from the equality now objected to and that the seeds of dissolution for the state governments are not sown in the genl government he considered the system on the table as a novelty an amphibious monster and was persuaded that it never would be recd by the people mr martin wd never confederate if it could not be done on just principles mr madison would acquiesce in the concession hinted by mr wilson on condition that a due independence should be given to the senate the plan in its present shape makes the senate absolutely dependent on the states the senate therefore is only another edition of congs he knew the faults of that body  had used a bold language agst it still he would preserve the state rights as carefully as the trials by jury     mr bedford contended that there was no middle way between a perfect consolidation and a mere confederacy of the states the first is out of the question and in the latter they must continue if not perfectly yet equally sovereign if political societies possess ambition avarice and all the other passions which render them formidable to each other ought we not to view them in this light here will not the same motives operate in america as elsewhere if any gentleman doubts it let him look at the votes have they not been dictated by interest by ambition are not the large states evidently seeking to aggrandize themselves at the expense of the small they think no doubt that they have right on their side but interest had blinded their eyes look at georgia though a small state at present she is actuated by the prospect of soon being a great one s carolina is actuated both by present interest  future prospects she hopes too to see the other states cut down to her own dimensions n carolina has the same motives of present  future interest virga follows maryd is not on that side of the question pena has a direct and future interest massts has a decided and palpable interest in the part she takes can it be expected that the small states will act from pure disinterestedness look at g britain is the representation there less unequal but we shall be told again that that is the rotten part of the constitution have not the boroughs however held fast their constitutional rights and are we to act with greater purity than the rest   0 of mankind an exact proportion in the representation is not preserved in any one of the states will it be said that an inequality of power will not result from an inequality of votes give the opportunity and ambition will not fail to abuse it the whole history of mankind proves it the three large states have a common interest to bind them together in commerce but whether a combination as we suppose or a competition as others suppose shall take place among them in either case the small states must be ruined we must like solon make such a governt as the people will approve will the smaller states ever agree to the proposed degradation of them it is not true that the people will not agree to enlarge the powers of the present congs the language of the people has been that congs ought to have the power of collecting an impost and of coercing the states where it may be necessary on the first point they have been explicit  in a manner unanimous in their declarations and must they not agree to this  similar measures if they ever mean to discharge their engagements the little states are willing to observe their engagements but will meet the large ones on no ground but that of the confederation we have been told with a dictatorial air that this is the last moment for a fair trial in favor of a good governmt it will be the last indeed if the propositions reported from the committee go forth to the people he was under no apprehensions the large states dare not dissolve the confederation if they do the small ones     will find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith who will take them by the hand and do them justice he did not mean by this to intimidate or alarm it was a natural consequence which ought to be avoided by enlarging the federal powers not annihilating the federal system this is what the people expect all agree in the necessity of a more efficient govt and why not make such an one as they desire mr elseworth under a national govt he should participate in the national security as remarked by mr king but that was all what he wanted was domestic happiness the natl govt could not descend to the local objects on which this depended it could only embrace objects of a general nature he turned his eyes therefore for the preservation of his rights to the state govts from these alone he could derive the greatest happiness he expects in this life his happiness depends on their existence as much as a new born infant on its mother for nourishment if this reasoning was not satisfactory he had nothing to add that could be so mr king was for preserving the states in a subordinate degree and as far as they could be necessary for the purposes stated by mr elsewttildeh he did not think a full answer had been given to those who apprehended a dangerous encroachment on their jurisdictions expedients might be devised as he conceived that would give them all the security the nature of things would admit of in the establishmt of societies the contstitution was to the legislature     what the laws were to individuals as the fundamental rights of individuals are secured by express provisions in the state constitutions why may not a like security be provided for the rights of states in the national constitution the articles of union between engld  scotland furnish an example of such a provision in favor of sundry rights of scotland when that union was in agitation the same language of apprehension which has been heard from the smaller states was in the mouths of the scotch patriots the articles however have not been violated and the scotch have found an increase of prosperity  happiness he was aware that this will be called a mere paper security he thought it a sufficient answer to say that if fundamental articles of compact are no sufficient defence against physical power neither will there be any safety agst it if there be no compact he could not sit down without taking some notice of the language of the honorable gentleman from delaware mr bedford it was not he that had uttered a dictatorial language this intemperance had marked the honorabltilde gentleman himself it was not he who with a vehemence unprecedented in that house had declared himself ready to turn his hopes from our common country and court the protection of some foreign hand this too was the language of the honbltilde member himself he was grieved that such a thought had entered into his heart he was more grieved that such an expression had dropped from his lips the gentleman cd only excuse it to himself on the score of passion for     himself whatever might be his distress he wd never court relief from a foreign power adjourned monday july  d in convention on the question for allowing each state one vote in the second branch as moved by mr elseworth massts no cont ay n y ay n j ay pa no del ay md ay mr jenifer being not present mr martin alone voted va no n c no s c no geo divd mr houston no mr baldwin ay mr pinkney thought an equality of votes in the  d branch inadmissible at the same time candor obliged him to admit that the large states would feel a partiality for their own citizens  give them a preference in appointments that they might also find some common points in their commercial interests and promote treaties favorable to them there is a real distinction between the northern  southn interests n carola s carol  geo in their rice  indigo had a peculiar interest which might be sacrificed how then shall the larger states be prevented from administering the genl govt as they please without being themselves unduly subjected to the will of the smaller by allowing them some but not a full proportion he was extremely anxious that something should be done considering this as the last appeal to a regular experiment congs have failed in almost every effort for an amendment of the federal system nothing has     prevented a dissolution of it but the appointmt of this convention  he could not express his alarms for the consequence of such an event he read his motion to form the states into classes with an apportionment of senators among them see art   of his plan general pinkney was willing the motion might be considered he did not entirely approve it he liked better the motion of docr franklin which see saturday june  0 some compromise seemed to be necessary the states being exactly divided on the question for an equality of votes in the  d branch he proposed that a committee consisting of a member from each state should be appointed to devise  report some compromise mr l martin had no objection to a commitment but no modifications whatever could reconcile the smaller states to the least diminution of their equal sovereignty mr sharman we are now at a full stop and nobody he supposed meant that we shd break up without doing something a committee he thought most likely to hit on some expedient  mr govr morris thought a come adviseable as the convention had been equally divided he had a stronger reason also the mode of appointing the  d branch tended he was sure to defeat the object of it what is this object to check the precipitation changeableness and excesses of the first branch     every man of observation had seen in the democratic branches of the state legislatures precipitation—in congress changeableness in every department excesses agst personal liberty private property  personal safety what qualities are necessary to constitute a check in this case abilities and virtue are equally necessary in both branches something more then is now wanted   the checking branch must have a personal interest in checking the other branch one interest must be opposed to another interest vices as they exist must be turned agst each other   it must have great personal property it must have the aristocratic spirit it must love to lord it thro pride pride is indeed the great principle that actuates both the poor  the rich it is this principle which in the former resists in the latter abuses authority   it should be independent in religion the creature is apt to forget its creator that it is otherwise in political affairs the late debates here are an unhappy proof the aristocratic body should be as independent  as firm as the democratic if the members of it are to revert to a dependence on the democratic choice the democratic scale will preponderate all the guards contrived by america have not restrained the senatorial branches of the legislatures from a servile complaisance to the democratic if the  d branch is to be dependent we are better without it to make it independent it should be for life it will then do wrong it will be said he believed so he hoped so the rich will strive to establish their     dominion  enslave the rest they always did they always will the proper security agst them is to form them into a separate interest the two forces will then controul each other let the rich mix with the poor and in a commercial country they will establish an oligarchy take away commerce and the democracy will triumph thus it has been all the world over so it will be among us reason tells us we are but men and we are not to expect any particular interference of heaven in our favor by thus combining  setting apart the aristocratic interest the popular interest will be combined agst it there will be a mutual check and mutual security   an independence for life involves the necessary permanency if we change our measures nobody will trust us and how avoid a change of measures but by avoiding a change of men ask any man if he confides in congs if he confides in the state of pena if he will lend his money or enter into contract he will tell you no he sees no stability he can repose no confidence if g b were to explain her refusal to treat with us the same reasoning would be employed—he disliked the exclusion of the  d branch from holding offices it is dangerous it is like the imprudent exclusion of the military officers during the war from civil appointments it deprives the executive of the principal source of influence if danger be apprehended from the executive what a lefthanded way is this of obviating it if the son the brother or the friend can be appointed the danger may be     even increased as the disqualified father c can then boast of a disinterestedness which he does not possess besides shall the best the most able the most virtuous citizens not be permitted to hold offices who then are to hold them he was also agst paying the senators they will pay themselves if they can if they can not they will be rich and can do without it of such the  d branch ought to consist and none but such can compose it if they are not to be paid—he contended that the executive should appoint the senate  fill up vacancies this gets rid of the difficulty in the present question you may begin with any ratio you please it will come to the same thing the members being independt  for life may be taken as well from one place as from another—it should be considered too how the scheme could be carried through the states he hoped there was strength of mind eno in this house to look truth in the face he did not hesitate therefore to say that loaves  fishes must bribe the demagogues they must be made to expect higher offices under the general than the state govts a senate for life will be a noble bait without such captivating prospects the popular leaders will oppose  defeat the plan he perceived that the  st branch was to be chosen by the people of the states the  d by those chosen by the people is not here a govt by the states a governt by compact between virga in the  st   d branch massts in the  st   d branch c this is going back to mere treaty it it no govt at all it is altogether dependent on the     states and will act over again the part which congs has acted a firm governt alone can protect our liberties he fears the influence of the rich they will have the same effect here as elsewhere if we do not by such a govt keep them within their proper sphere we should remember that the people never act from reason alone the rich will take the advantage of their passions  make these the instruments for oppressing them the result of the contest will be a violent aristocracy or a more violent despotism the schemes of the rich will be favored by the extent of the country the people in such distant parts cannot communicate  act in concert they will be the dupes of those who have more knowledge  intercourse the only security agst encroachments will be a select  sagacious body of men instituted to watch agst them on all sides he meant only to hint these observations without grounding any motion on them mr randolph favored the commitment though he did not expect much benefit from the expedient he animadverted on the warm  rash language of mr bedford on saturday reminded the small states that if the large states should combine some danger of which he did not deny there would be a check in the revisionary power of the executive and intimated that in order to render this still more effectual he would agree that in the choice of an executive each state should have an equal vote he was persuaded that two such opposite bodies as mr morris had planned could never long coexist dissentions     would arise as has been seen even between the senate and h of delegates in maryland appeals would be made to the people and in a little time commotions would be the result—he was far from thinking the large states could subsist of themselves any more than the small an avulsion would involve the whole in ruin and he was determined to pursue such a scheme of government as would secure us agst such a calamity mr strong was for the com̃itment and hoped the mode of constituting both branches would be referred if they should be established on different principles contentions would prevail and there would never be a concurrence in necessary measures docr williamson if we do not concede on both sides our business must soon be at an end he approved of the com̃itment supposing that as the come wd be a smaller body a compromise would be pursued with more coolness mr wilson objected to the committee because it would decide according to that very rule of voting which was opposed on one side experience in congs had also proved the inutility of committees consisting of members from each state mr lansing wd not oppose the commitment though expecting little advantage from it mr madison opposed the com̃itment he had rarely seen any other effect than delay from such committees in congs any scheme of compromise that could be proposed in the committee   0 might as easily be proposed in the house and the report of the committee where it contained merely the opinion of the come would neither shorten the discussion nor influence the decision of the house mr gerry was for the commitmt something must be done or we shall disappoint not only america but the whole world he suggested a consideration of the state we should be thrown into by the failure of the union we should be without an umpire to decide controversies and must be at the mercy of events what too is to become of our treaties—what of our foreign debts what of our domestic we must make concessions on both sides without these the constitutions of the several states would never have been formed on the question for com̃iting generally massts ay cont ay n y ay n j no p ay del no md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay on the question for com̃iting it to a member from each state massts ay cont ay n y ay n j ay pa no del

might be given to the com̃ittee and to such as chose to attend to the celebrations on the     anniversary of independence the convention adjourned till thursday      thursday july  th in convention mr gerry delivered in from the committee appointed on monday last the following report the committee to whom was referred the  th resol of the report from the committee of the whole house and so much of the  th as has not been     decided on submit the following report that the subsequent propositions be recommended to the convention on condition that both shall be generally adopted i that in the  st branch of the legislature each of the states now in the union shall be allowed   member for every  0000 inhabitants of the description reported in the  th resolution of the come of the whole house that each state not containing that number shall be allowed   member that all bills for raising or appropriating money and for fixing the salaries of the officers of the governt of the u states shall originate in the  st branch of the legislature and shall not be altered or amended by the  d branch and that no money shall be drawn from the public treasury but in pursuance of appropriations to be originated in the  st branch ii that in the  d branch each state shall have an equal vote  mr ghoram observed that as the report consisted of propositions mutually conditional he wished to     hear some explanations touching the grounds on which the conditions were estimated mr gerry the committee were of different opinions as well as the deputations from which the come were taken and agreed to the report merely in order that some ground of accommodation might be proposed those opposed to the equality of votes have only assented conditionally and if the other side do not generally agree will not be under any obligation to support the report mr wilson thought the committee had exceeded their powers mr martin was for taking the question on the whole report mr wilson was for a division of the question otherwise it wd be a leap in the dark mr madison could not regard the privilege of originating money bills as any concession on the side of the small states experience proved that it had no effect if seven states in the upper branch wished a bill to be originated they might surely find some member from some of the same states in the lower branch who would originate it the restriction as to amendments was of as little consequence amendments could be handed privately by the senate to members in the other house bills could be negatived that they might be sent up in the desired shape if the senate should yield to the obstinacy of the  st branch the use of that body as a check would be lost if the  st branch should yield to that of the senate the privilege would be nugatory experience had     also shewn both in g b and the states having a similar regulation that it was a source of frequent  obstinate altercations these considerations had produced a rejection of a like motion on a former occasion when judged by its own merits it could not therefore be deemed any concession on the present and left in force all the objections which had prevailed agst allowing each state an equal voice he conceived that the convention was reduced to the alternative of either departing from justice in order to conciliate the smaller states and the minority of the people of the u s or of displeasing these by justly gratifying the larger states and the majority of the people he could not himself hesitate as to the option he ought to make the convention with justice  the majority of the people on their side had nothing to fear with injustice and the minority on their side they had every thing to fear it was in vain to purchase concord in the convention on terms which would perpetuate discord among their constituents the convention ought to pursue a plan which would bear the test of examination which would be espoused  supported by the enlightened and impartial part of america  which they could themselves vindicate and urge it should be considered that altho at first many may judge of the system recom̃ended by their opinion of the convention yet finally all will judge of the convention by the system the merits of the system alone can finally  effectually obtain the public suffrage he was not apprehensive that the people     of the small states would obstinately refuse to accede to a govt founded on just principles and promising them substantial protection he could not suspect that delaware would brave the consequences of seeking her fortunes apart from the other states rather than submit to such a govt much less could he suspect that she would pursue the rash policy of courting foreign support which the warmth of one of her representatives mr bedford had suggested or if she shd that any foreign nation wd be so rash as to hearken to the overture as little could he suspect that the people of n jersey notwithstanding the decided tone of the gentlemen from that state would choose rather to stand on their own legs and bid defiance to events than to acquiesce under an establishment founded on principles the justice of which they could not dispute and absolutely necessary to redeem them from the exactions levied on them by the com̃erce of the neighbouring states a review of other states would prove that there was as little reason to apprehend an inflexible opposition elsewhere harmony in the convention was no doubt much to be desired satisfaction to all the states in the first instance still more so but if the principal states comprehending a majority of the people of the u s should concur in a just  judicious plan he had the firmest hopes that all the other states would by degrees accede to it      mr butler said he could not let down his idea of the people of america so far as to believe they would from mere respect to the convention adopt a plan evidently unjust he did not consider the privilege concerning money bills as of any consequence he urged that the  d branch ought to represent the states according to their property mr govr morris thought the form as well as the matter of the report objectionable it seemed in the first place to render amendments impracticable in the next place it seemed to involve a pledge to agree to the  d part if the  st shd be agreed to he conceived the whole aspect of it to be wrong he came here as a representative of america he flattered himself he came here in some degree as a representative of the whole human race for the whole human race will be affected by the proceedings of this convention he wished gentlemen to extend their views beyond the present moment of time beyond the narrow limits of place from which they derive their political origin if he were to believe some things which he had heard he should suppose that we were assembled to truck and bargain for our particular states he can not descend to think that any gentlemen are really actuated by these views we must look forward to the effects of what we do these alone ought to guide us much has been said of the sentiments of the people they were unknown they could not be known all that we can infer is that if the plan we recommend be reasonable  right all who have reasonable minds and sound     intentions will embrace it notwithstanding what had been said by some gentlemen let us suppose that the larger states shall agree and that the smaller refuse and let us trace the consequences the opponents of the system in the smaller states will no doubt make a party and a noise for a time but the ties of interest of kindred  of common habits which connect them with other states will be too strong to be easily broken in n jersey particularly he was sure a great many would follow the sentiments of pena  n york this country must be united if persuasion does not unite it the sword will he begged that this consideration might have its due weight the scenes of horror attending civil commotion cannot be described and the conclusion of them will be worse than the term of their continuance the stronger party will then make traytors of the weaker and the gallows  halter will finish the work of the sword how far foreign powers would be ready to take part in the confusions he would not say threats that they will be invited have it seems been thrown out he drew the melancholy picture of foreign intrusions as exhibited in the history of germany  urged it as a standing lesson to other nations he trusted that the gentlemen who may have hazarded such expressions did not entertain them till they reached their own lips but returning to the report he could not think it in any respect calculated for the public good as the  d branch is now constituted there will be constant disputes  appeals to the states which will undermine     the genl government  controul  annihilate the  st branch suppose that the delegates from massts  rho i in the upper house disagree and that the former are outvoted what results they will immediately declare that their state will not abide by the decision and make such representations as will produce that effect the same may happen as to virga  other states of what avail then will be what is on paper state attachments and state importance have been the bane of this country we can not annihilate but we may perhaps take out the teeth of the serpents he wished our ideas to be enlarged to the true interest of man instead of being circumscribed within the narrow compass of a particular spot and after all how little can be the motive yielded by selfishness for such a policy who can say whether he himself much less whether his children will the next year be an inhabitant of this or that state mr bedford he found that what he had said as to the small states being taken by the hand had been misunderstood and he rose to explain he did not mean that the small states would court the aid  interposition of foreign powers he meant that they would not consider the federal compact as dissolved untill it should be so by the acts of the large states in this case the consequences of the breach of faith on their part and the readiness of the small states to fulfill their engagements would be that foreign nations having demands on this country would find it their interest to take the small   0 states by the hand in order to do themselves justice this was what he meant but no man can foresee to what extremities the small states may be driven by oppression he observed also in apology that some allowance ought to be made for the habits of his profession in which warmth was natural  sometimes necessary but is there not an apology in what was said by mr govr morris that the sword is to unite by mr ghorum that delaware must be annexed to penna and n jersey divided between pena and n york to hear such language without emotion would be to renounce the feelings of a man and the duty of a citizen—as to the propositions of the committee the lesser states have thought it necessary to have a security somewhere this has been thought necessary for the executive magistrate of the proposed govt who has a sort of negative on the laws and is it not of more importance that the states should be protected than that the executive branch of the govt shd be protected in order to obtain this the smaller states have conceded as to the constitution of the first branch and as to money bills if they be not gratified by correspondent concessions as to the  d branch is it to be supposed they will ever accede to the plan and what will be the consequence if nothing should be done the condition of the u states requires that something should be immediately done it will be better that a defective plan should be adopted than that none should be recommended he saw no reason why     defects might not be supplied with meetings  0    or  0 years hence mr elseworth said he had not attended the proceedings of the committee but was ready to accede to the compromise they had reported some compromise was necessary and he saw none more convenient or reasonable mr williamson hoped that the expressions of individuals would not be taken for the sense of their colleagues much less of their states which was not  could not be known he hoped also that the meaning of those expressions would not be misconstrued or exaggerated he did not conceive that mr govr morris meant that the sword ought to be drawn agst the smaller states he only pointed out the probable consequences of anarchy in the u s a similar exposition ought to be given of the expressions of mr ghorum he was ready to hear the report discussed but thought the propositions contained in it the most objectionable of any he had yet heard mr patterson said that he had when the report was agreed to in the come reserved to himself the right of freely discussing it he acknowledged that the warmth complained of was improper but he thought the sword  the gallows little calculated to produce conviction he complained of the manner in which mr m and mr govr morris had treated the small states mr gerry tho he had assented to the report in the committee he had very material objections to     it we were however in a peculiar situation we were neither the same nation nor different nations we ought not therefore to pursue the one or the other of these ideas too closely if no compromise should take place what will be the consequence a secession he foresaw would take place for some gentlemen seem decided on it two different plans will be proposed and the result no man could foresee if we do not come to some agreement among ourselves some foreign sword will probably do the work for us mr mason the report was meant not as specific propositions to be adopted but merely as a general ground of accommodation there must be some accommodation on this point or we shall make little further progress in the work accommodation was the object of the house in the appointment of the committee and of the committee in the report they had made and however liable the report might be to objections he thought it preferable to an appeal to the world by the different sides as had been talked of by some gentlemen it could not be more inconvenient to any gentleman to remain absent from his private affairs than it was for him but he would bury his bones in this city rather than expose his country to the consequences of a dissolution of the convention without any thing being done the  st proposition in the report for fixing the representation in the  st branch one member for every  0000 inhabitants being taken up mr govr morris objected to that scale of apportionment     he thought property ought to be taken into the estimate as well as the number of inhabitants life  liberty were generally said to be of more value than property an accurate view of the matter would nevertheless prove that property was the main object of society the savage state was more favorable to liberty than the civilized and sufficiently so to life it was preferred by all men who had not acquired a taste for property it was only renounced for the sake of property which could only be secured by the restraints of regular government these ideas might appear to some new but they were nevertheless just if property then was the main object of govt certainly it ought to be one measure of the influence due to those who were to be affected by the governt he looked forward also to that range of new states which wd soon be formed in the west he thought the rule of representation ought to be so fixed as to secure to the atlantic states a prevalence in the national councils the new states will know less of the public interest than these will have an interest in many respects different in particular will be little scrupulous of involving the community in wars the burdens  operations of which would fall chiefly on the maritime states provision ought therefore to be made to prevent the maritime states from being hereafter outvoted by them he thought this might be easily done by irrevocably fixing the number of representatives which the atlantic states should respectively have and the number which each new state will have     this wd not be unjust as the western settlers wd previously know the conditions on which they were to possess their lands it would be politic as it would recom̃end the plan to the present as well as future interest of the states which must decide the fate of it mr rutlidge the gentleman last up had spoken some of his sentiments precisely property was certainly the principal object of society if numbers should be made the rule of representation the atlantic states will be subjected to the western he moved that the first proposition in the report be postponed in order to take up the following viz that the suffrages of the several states be regulated and proportioned according to the sums to be paid towards the general revenue by the inhabitants of each state respectively that an apportionment of suffrages according to the ratio aforesaid shall be made and regulated at the end of — years from the  st meeting of the legislature of the u s and at the end of every — years but that for the present and until the period above mentioned the suffrages shall be for n hampshire — for massachts — c col mason said the case of new states was not unnoticed in the committee but it was thought and he was himself decidedly of opinion that if they made a part of the union they ought to be subject to no unfavorable discriminations obvious considerations required it mr randolph concurred with col mason on question on mr rutlidges motion     masts no cont no n y no n j no pa no del no maryd no va no n c no s c ay geo not on floor friday july  th in convention mr govr morris moved to commit so much of the report as relates to   member for every  0000 inhabitants his view was that they might absolutely fix the number for each state in the first instance leaving the legislature at liberty to provide for changes in the relative importance of the states and for the case of new states mr wilson  ded the motion but with a view of leaving the committee under no implied shackles mr ghorum apprehended great inconveniency from fixing directly the number of representatives to be allowed to each state he thought the number of inhabitants the true guide tho perhaps some departure might be expedient from the full proportion the states also would vary in their relative extent by separations of parts of the largest states a part of virga is now on the point of a separation in the province of mayne a convention is at this time deliberating on a separation from masts in such events the number of representatives ought certainly to be reduced he hoped to see all the states made small by proper divisions instead of their becoming formidable as was apprehended to the small states he conceived that let the genl government be modified as it might there would     be a constant tendency in the state governmts to encroach upon it it was of importance therefore that the extent of the states shd be reduced as much  as fast as possible the stronger the govt shall be made in the first instance the more easily will these divisions be effected as it will be of less consequence in the opinion of the states whether they be of great or small extent mr gerry did not think with his colleague that the large states ought to be cut up this policy has been inculcated by the middling and smaller states ungenerously  contrary to the spirit of the confederation ambitious men will be apt to solicit needless divisions till the states be reduced to the size of counties if this policy should still actuate the small states the large ones coud not confederate safely with them but would be obliged to consult their safety by confederating only with one another he favored the commitment and thought that representation ought to be in the combined ratio of numbers of inhabitants and of wealth and not of either singly mr king wished the clause to be committed chiefly in order to detach it from the report with which it had no connection he thought also that the ratio of representation proposed could not be safely fixed since in a century  a half our computed increase of population would carry the number of representatives to an enormous excess that ye number of inhabitants was not the proper index of ability  wealth that property was the     primary object of society and that in fixing a ratio this ought not to be excluded from the estimate—with regard to new states he observed that there was something peculiar in the business which had not been noticed the u s were now admitted to be proprietors of the country n west of the ohio congs by one of their ordinances have impoliticly laid it out into ten states and have made it a fundamental article of compact with those who may become settlers that as soon as the number in any one state shall equal that of the smallest of the    original states it may claim admission into the union delaware does not contain it is computed more than   000 souls and for obvious reasons will not increase much for a considerable time it is possible then that if this plan be persisted in by congs  0 new votes may be added without a greater addition of inhabitants than are represented by the single vote of pena the plan as it respects one of the new states is already irrevocable the sale of the lands having commenced and the purchasers  settlers will immediately become entitled to all the privileges of the compact mr butler agreed to the commitment if the committee were to be left at liberty he was persuaded that the more the subject was examined the less it would appear that the number of inhabitants would be a proper rule of proportion if there were no other objection the changeableness of the standard would be sufficient he concurred with those who thought some balance was necessary between the old      the new states he contended strenuously that property was the only just measure of representation this was the great object of governt the great cause of war the great means of carrying it on mr pinkney saw no good reason for committing the value of land had been found on full investigation to be an impracticable rule the contributions of revenue including imports  exports must be too changeable in their amount too difficult to be adjusted and too injurious to the noncommercial states the number of inhabitants appeared to him the only just  practicable rule he thought the blacks ought to stand on an equality with the whites but wd agree to the ratio settled by congs he contended that congs had no right under the articles of confederation to authorize the admission of new states no such case having been provided for mr davy was for committing the clause in order to get at the merits of the question arising on the report he seemed to think that wealth or property ought to be represented in the  d branch and numbers in the  st branch on the motion for committing as made by mr govr morris massts ay cont ay n y no n j no pa ay del no md divd va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay the members appd by ballot were mr govr morris mr gorham mr randolph mr rutlidge mr king mr wilson signified that his view in agreeing to     the com̃itmt was that the come might consider the propriety of adopting a scale similar to that established by the constitution of massts which wd give an advantage to ye small states without substantially departing from the rule of proportion mr wilson  mr mason moved to postpone the clause relating to money bills in order to take up the clause relating to an equality of votes in the second branch on the question massts no cont no n y ay n j ay pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c no s c ay geo ay the clause relating to equality of votes being under consideration docr franklin observed that this question could not be properly put by itself the com̃ittee having reported several propositions as mutual conditions of each other he could not vote for it if separately taken but should vote for the whole together col mason perceived the difficulty  suggested a reference of the rest of the report to ye committee just appointed that the whole might be brought into one view mr randolph disliked ye reference to that committee as it consisted of members from states opposed to the wishes of the smaller states and could not therefore be acceptable to the latter mr martin  mr jenifer moved to postpone the clause till the come last appointed shd report mr madison observed that if the uncommitted part of the report was connected with the part just   0 committed it ought also to be committed if not connected it need not be postponed till report should be made on the question for postponing moved by mr martin  mr jenifer—cont n j del md va geo ay pa n c s c no mass n y divided the  st clause relating to the originating of money bills was then resumed mr governr morris was opposed to a restriction of this right in either branch considered merely in itself and as unconnected with the point of representation in the  d branch it will disable the  d branch from proposing its own money plans and giving the people an opportunity of judging by comparison of the merits of those proposed by the  st branch mr wilson could see nothing like a concession here on the part of the smaller states if both branches were to say yes or no it was of little consequence which should say yes or no first which last if either was indiscriminately to have the right of originating the reverse of the report would he thought be most proper since it was a maxim that the least numerous body was the fittest for deliberation the most numerous for decision he observed that this discrimination had been transcribed from the british into several american constitutions but he was persuaded that on examination of the american experiments it would be found to be a trifle light as air nor could he ever discover the advantage of it in the parliamentary history of g     britain he hoped if there was any advantage in the privilege that it would be pointed out mr williamson thought that if the privilege were not common to both branches it ought rather to be confined to the  d as the bills in that case would be more narrowly watched than if they originated with the branch having most of the popular confidence mr mason the consideration which weighed with the committee was that the  st branch would be the immediate representatives of the people the  d would not should the latter have the power of giving away the peoples money they might soon forget the source from whence they received it we might soon have an aristocracy he had been much concerned at the principles which had been advanced by some gentlemen but had the satisfaction to find they did not generally prevail he was a friend to proportional representation in both branches but supposed that some points must be yielded for the sake of accomodation mr wilson if he had proposed that the  d branch should have an independent disposal of public money the observations of col mason would have been a satisfactory answer but nothing could be farther from what he had said his question was how is the power of the  st branch increased or that of the  d diminished by giving the proposed privilege to the former where is the difference in which branch it begins if both must concur in the end mr gerry would not say that the concession was a sufficient one on the part of the small states but     he could not but regard it in the light of a concession it wd make it a constitutional principle that the  d branch were not possessed of the confidence of the people in money matters which wd lessen their weight  influence in the next place if the  d branch were dispossessed of the privilege they wd be deprived of the opportunity which their continuance in office   times as long as the  st branch would give them of making three successive essays in favor of a particular point mr pinkney thought it evident that the concession was wholly on one side that of the large states the privilege of originating money bills being of no account mr govr morris had waited to hear the good effects of the restriction as to the alarm sounded of an aristocracy his creed was that there never was nor ever will be a civilized society without an aristocracy his endeavor was to keep it as much as possible from doing mischief the restriction if it has any real operation will deprive us of the services of the  d branch in digesting  proposing money bills of which it will be more capable than the  st branch it will take away the responsibility of the  d branch the great security for good behavior it will always leave a plea as to an obnoxious money bill that it was disliked but could not be constitutionally amended nor safely rejected it will be a dangerous source of disputes between the two houses we should either take the british constitution altogether or make one for ourselves the executive there     has dissolved two houses as the only cure for such disputes will our executive be able to apply such a remedy every law directly or indirectly takes money out of the pockets of the people again what use may be made of such a privilege in case of great emergency suppose an enemy at the door and money instantly  absolutely necessary for repelling him may not the popular branch avail itself of this duress to extort concessions from the senate destructive of the constitution itself he illustrated this danger by the example of the long parliaments expedts for subverting the h of lords concluding on the whole that the restriction would be either useless or pernicious docr franklin did not mean to go into a justification of the report but as it had been asked what would be the use of restraining the  d branch from medling with money bills he could not but remark that it was always of importance that the people should know who had disposed of their money  how it had been disposed of it was a maxim that those who feel can best judge this end would he thought be best attained if money affairs were to be confined to the immediate representatives of the people this was his inducement to concur in the report as to the danger or difficulty that might arise from a negative in the  d where the people wd not be proportionately represented it might easily be got over by declaring that there should be no such negative or if that will not do by declaring that there shall be no such branch at all     mr martin said that it was understood in the committee that the difficulties and disputes which had been apprehended should be guarded agst in the detailing of the plan mr wilson the difficulties  disputes will increase with the attempts to define  obviate them queen anne was obliged to dissolve her parliamt in order to terminate one of these obstinate disputes between the two houses had it not been for the mediation of the crown no one can say what the result would have been the point is still sub judice in england he approved of the principles laid down by the honbletilde president doctr franklin his colleague as to the expediency of keeping the people informed of their money affairs but thought they would know as much and be as well satisfied in one way as in the other genl pinkney was astonished that this point should have been considered as a concession he remarked that the restriction to money bills had been rejected on the merits singly considered by   states agst   and that the very states which now called it a concession were then agst it as nugatory or improper in itself on the question whether the clause relating to money bills in the report of the come consisting of a member from each state shd stand as part of the report massts dividd cont ay n y divd n j ay pa no del ay md ay va no n c ay s c no geo divd     a question

geo ay n y va no in several preceding instances like votes had sub silentio been entered as decided in the affirmative adjourned saturday july   in convention shall the clause allowing each state one vote in the  d branch stand as part of the report being taken up— mr gerry this is the critical question he had rather agree to it than have no accommodation a governt short of a proper national plan if generally acceptable would be preferable to a proper one which if it could be carried at all would operate on discontented states he thought it would be best to suspend the question till the comme yesterday appointed should make report mr sherman supposed that it was the wish of every one that some genl govt should be established an equal vote in the  d branch would he thought be most likely to give it the necessary vigor the small states have more vigor in their govts than the large ones the more influence therefore the large ones have the weaker will be the govt in the     large states it will be most difficult to collect the real  fair sense of the people fallacy  undue influence will be practised with most success and improper men will most easily get into office if they vote by states in the  d branch and each state has an equal vote there must be always a majority of states as well as a majority of the people on the side of public measures  the govt will have decision and efficacy if this be not the case in the  d branch there may be a majority of states agst public measures and the difficulty of compelling them to abide by the public determination will render the government feebler than it has ever yet been mr wilson was not deficient in a conciliating temper but firmness was sometimes a duty of higher obligation conciliation was also misapplied in this instance it was pursued here rather among the representatives than among the constituents and it wd be of little consequence if not established among the latter and there could be little hope of its being established among them if the foundation should not be laid in justice and right on question shall the words stand as part of the report massts divd cont ay n y ay n j ay pa no del ay md ay va no n c ay s c no geo divd note several votes were given here in the affirmative or were divd because another final question was to be taken on the whole report     mr gerry  thought it would be proper to proceed to enumerate  define the powers to be vested in the genl govt before a question on the report should be taken as to the rule of representation in the  d branch mr madison observed that it wd be impossible to say what powers could be safely  properly vested     in the govt before it was known in what manner the states were to be represented in it he was apprehensive that if a just representation were not the basis of the govt is would happen as it did when the articles of confederation were depending that every effectual prerogative would be withdrawn or withheld and the new govt wd be rendered as impotent and as shortlived as the old mr patterson would not decide whether the privilege concerning money bills were a valuable consideration or not but he considered the mode  rule of representation in the  st branch as fully so and that after the establishment of that point the small states would never be able to defend themselves without an equality of votes in the  d branch there was no other ground of accommodation his resolution was fixt he would meet the large states on that ground and no other for himself he should vote agst the report because it yielded too much mr govr morris he had no resolution unalterably fixed except to do what should finally appear to him right he was agst the report because it maintained the improper constitution of the  d branch it made it another congress a mere whisp of straw it had been sd by mr gerry that the new governt would be partly national partly federal that it ought in the first quality to protect individuals in the second the states but in what quality was it to protect the aggregate interest of the whole among the many provisions which had been urged he had seen none for supporting the dignity and     splendor of the american empire it had been one of our greatest misfortunes that the great objects of the nation had been sacrificed constantly to local views in like manner as the general interests of states had been sacrificed to those of the counties what is to be the check in the senate none unless it be to keep the majority of the people from injuring particular states but particular states ought to be injured for the sake of a majority of the people in case their conduct should deserve it suppose they should insist on claims evidently unjust and pursue them in a manner detrimental to the whole body suppose they should give themselves up to foreign influence ought they to be protected in such cases they were originally nothing more than colonial corporations on the declaration of independence a governmt was to be formed the small states aware of the necessity of preventing anarchy and taking advantage of the moment extorted from the large ones an equality of votes standing now on that ground they demand under the new system greater rights as men than their fellow citizens of the large states the proper answer to them is that the same necessity of which they formerly took advantage does not now exist and that the large states are at liberty now to consider what is right rather than what may be expedient we must have an efficient govt and if there be an efficiency in the local govts the former is impossible germany alone proves it notwithstanding their common diet notwithstanding the   0 great prerogatives of the emperor as head of the empire and his vast resources as sovereign of his particular dominions no union is maintained foreign influence disturbs every internal operation  there is no energy whatever in the general governmt whence does this proceed from the energy of the local authorities from its being considered of more consequence to support the prince of hesse than the happiness of the people of germany do gentlemen wish this to be ye case here good god sir is it possible they can so delude themselves what if all the charters  constitutions of the states were thrown into the fire and all their demagogues into the ocean what would it be to the happiness of america and will not this be the case here if we pursue the train in wch the business lies we shall establish an aulic council without an emperor to execute its decrees the same circumstances which unite the people here unite them in germany they have there a common language a common law common usages and manners and a common interest in being united yet their local jurisdictions destroy every tie the case was the same in the grecian states the united netherlands are at this time torn in factions with these examples before our eyes shall we form establishments which must necessarily produce the same effects it is of no consequence from what districts the  d branch shall be drawn if it be so constituted as to yield an asylum agst these evils as it is now constituted he must be agst its being drawn from the states     in equal portions but still he was ready to join in devising such an amendment of the plan as will be most likely to secure our liberty  happiness mr sherman  mr elseworth moved to postpone the question on the report from the committee of a member from each state in order to wait for the report from the come of   last appointed massts ay cont ay n y no n j ay pa ay del ay maryland ay va no n c no s c no geo no adjd monday july  th in convention mr daniel carroll from maryland took his seat mr govr morris delivered a report from the come of   members to whom was committed the clause in the report of the come consisting of a member from each state stating the proper ratio of representatives in the  st branch to be as   to every  0000 inhabitants as follows viz the committee to whom was referred the  st clause of the  st proposition reported from the grand committee beg leave to report i that in the  st meeting of the legislature the  st branch thereof consist of    members of which number n hampshire shall have   massts   r id   cont   n y   n j   pa   del   md   va   n c   s c   geo   ii but as the present situation of the states may probably alter as well in point of wealth as in the     number of their inhabitants that the legislature be authorized from time to time to augment ye number of representatives and in case any of the states shall hereafter be divided or any two or more states united or any new states created within the limits of the united states the legislature shall possess authority to regulate the number of representatives in any of the foregoing cases upon the principles of their wealth and number of inhabitants mr sherman wished to know on what principles or calculations the report was founded it did not appear to correspond with any rule of numbers or of any requisition hitherto adopted by congs mr gorham some provision of this sort was necessary in the outset the number of blacks  whites with some regard to supposed wealth was the general guide fractions could not be observed the legislre is to make alterations from time to time as justice  propriety may require two objections prevailed agst the rate of   member for every  0000 inhts the  st was that the representation would soon be too numerous the  d that the westn states who may have a different interest might if admitted on that principle by degrees outvote the atlantic both these objections are removed the number will be small in the first instance and may be continued so and the atlantic states having ye govt in their own hands may take care of their own interest by dealing out the right of representation in safe proportions to the western states these were the views of the committee     mr l martin wished to know whether the come were guided in the ratio by the wealth or number of inhabitants of the states or by both noting its variations from former apportionments by congs mr govr morris  mr rutlidge moved to postpone the  st paragraph relating to the number of members to be allowed each state in the first instance and to take up the  d paragraph authorizing the legislre to alter the number from time to time according to wealth  inhabitants the motion was agreed to nem con on question on the  d paragh taken without any debate massts ay cont ay n y no n j

observing that this was the only case in which such committees were useful mr williamson thought it would be necessary to return to the rule of numbers but that the western states stood on different footing if their property shall be rated as high as that of the atlantic states then their representation ought to hold a like proportion otherwise if their property was not to be equally rated mr govr morris the report is little more than a guess wealth was not altogether disregarded by     the come where it was apparently in favor of one state whose nos were superior to the numbers of another by a fraction only a member extraordinary was allowed to the former and so vice versa the committee meant little more than to bring the matter to a point for the consideration of the house mr reed asked why georgia was allowed   members when her number of inhabitants had stood below that of delaware mr govr morris such is the rapidity of the population of that state that before the plan takes effect it will probably be entitled to   representatives mr randolph disliked the report of the come but had been unwilling to object to it he was apprehensive that as the number was not be changed till the natl legislature should please a pretext would never be wanting to postpone alterations and keep the power in the hands of those possessed of it he was in favor of the commitmt to a member from each state mr patterson considered the proposed estimate for the future according to the combined rules of numbers and wealth as too vague for this reason n jersey was agst it he could regard negroes slaves in no light but as property they are no free agents have no personal liberty no faculty of acquiring property but on the contrary are themselves property  like other property entirely at the will of the master has a man in virga a number of votes in proportion to the number of his slaves     and if negroes are not represented in the states to which they belong why should they be represented in the genl govt what is the true principle of representation it is an expedient by which an assembly of certain individls chosen by the people is substituted in place of the inconvenient meeting of the people themselves if such a meeting of the people was actually to take place would the slaves vote they would not why then shd they be represented he was also agst such an indirect encouragemt of the slave trade observing that congs in their act relating to the change of the   art of confedn had been ashamed to use the term slaves  had substituted a description mr madison reminded mr patterson that his doctrine of representation which was in its principle the genuine one must forever silence the pretensions of the small states to an equality of votes with the large ones they ought to vote in the same proportion in which their citizens would do if the people of all the states were collectively met he suggested as a proper ground of compromise that in the first branch the states should be represented according to their number of free inhabitants and in the  d which had for one of its primary objects the guardianship of property according to the whole number including slaves mr butler urged warmly the justice  necessity of regarding wealth in the apportionment of representation mr king had always expected that as the southern     states are the richest they would not league themselves with the northn unless some respect were paid to their superior wealth if the latter expect those preferential distinctions in commerce  other advantages which they will derive from the connexion they must not expect to receive them without allowing some advantages in return eleven out of    of the states had agreed to consider slaves in the apportionment of

and it was a poor state genl pinkney seconds the motion mr king n hamshire has probably more than   0000 inhabts and has an extensive country of tolerable fertility its inhabtstilde therefore may be expected to increase fast he remarked that the four eastern states having  00000 souls have ⅓ fewer representatives than the four southern states having not more than  00000 souls rating the blacks as   for   the eastern people will advert to these circumstances and be dissatisfied he believed them to be very desirous of uniting with their southern brethern but did not think it prudent to rely so far on that disposition as to subject them to any gross inequality he was fully convinced that the question concerning a difference of interests did not lie where it had hitherto been discussed between the great  small states but between the southern  eastern for this reason he had been ready to yield something in the proportion of representatives for the security of the southern no principle would justify the giving them a majority they were brought as near an equality as was possible he was not averse to giving them a still greater security but did not see how it could be done genl pinkney the report before it was committed was more favorable to the s states than as it now stands if they are to form so considerable a minority and the regulation of trade is to be given to the genl government they will be nothing more     than overseers for the northern states he did not expect the s states to be raised to a majority of representatives but wished them to have something like an equality at present by the alterations of the come in favor of the n states they are removed farther from it than they were before one member indeed had been added to virga which he was glad of as he considered her as a southern state he was glad also that the members of georgia were increased mr williamson was not for reducing n hampshire from   to   but for reducing some others the southn interest must be extremely endangered by the present arrangement the northn states are to have a majority in the first instance and the means of perpetuating it mr dayton observed that the line between northn  southern interest had been improperly drawn that pa was the dividing state there being six on each side of her genl pinkney urged the reduction dwelt on the superior wealth of the southern states and insisted on its having its due weight in the government mr govr morris regretted the turn of the debate the states he found had many representatives on the floor few he fears were to be deemed the representatives of america he thought the southern states have by the report more than their share of representation property ought to have its weight but not all the weight if the southn states are to supply money the northn states are to spill     their blood besides the probable revenue to be expected from the s states has been greatly overrated he was agst reducing n hampshire mr randolph was opposed to a reduction of n hampshire not because she had a full title to three members but because it was in his contemplation   to make it the duty instead of leaving it in the discretion of the legislature to regulate the representation by a periodical census   to require more than a bare majority of votes in the legislature in certain cases  particularly in commercial

not possess enough of the confidence of the people and wd be too sparsely taken from the people to bring with them all the local information which would be frequently wanted double the number will not be too great even with the future additions from new states the additional expence was too inconsiderable to be regarded in so important a case and as far as the augmentation might be unpopular on that score the objection was overbalanced by its effect on the hopes of a greater number of the popular candidates mr elseworth urged the objection of expence  that the greater the number the more slowly would the business proceed and the less probably be decided as it ought at last he thought the number of representatives too great in most of the state legislatures and that a large number was less necessary in the genl legislature than in those of the states as its business would relate to a few great national objects only mr sherman would have preferred  0 to    the great distance they will have to travel will render their attendance precarious and will make it difficult to prevail on a sufficient number of fit men to     undertake the service he observed that the expected increase from new states also deserved consideration mr gerry was for increasing the number beyond    the larger the number the less the danger of their being corrupted the people are accustomed to  fond of a numerous representation and will consider their rights as better secured by it the danger of excess in the number may be guarded agst by fixing a point within which the number shall always be kept col mason admitted that the objection drawn from the consideration of expence had weight both in itself and as the people might be affected by it but he thought it outweighed by the objections agst the smallness of the number    will he supposes as being a majority of    form a quorum  0 will be a majority of    this was certainly too small a number to make laws for america they would neither bring with them all the necessary information relative to various local interests nor possess the necessary confidence of the people after doubling the number the laws might still be made by so few as almost to be objectionable on that account mr read was in favor of the motion two of the states del  r i would have but a single member if the aggregate number should remain at    and in case of accident to either of these one state wd have no representative present to give explanations or informations of its interests or wishes the people     would not place their confidence in so small a number he hoped the objects of the genl govt would be much more numerous than seemed to be expected by some gentlemen and that they would become more  more so as to new states the highest number of reps for the whole might be limited and all danger of excess thereby prevented mr rutlidge opposed the motion the representatives were too numerous in all the states the full number allotted to the states may be expected to attend  the lowest possible quorum shd not therefore be considered the interests of their constituents will urge their attendance too strongly for it to be omitted and he supposed the genl legislature would not sit more than   or   weeks in the year on the question for doubling the number it passed in the negative masts no cont no n y no n j no pa no del ay md no va ay

denied after this concession of the small states as to the first branch     mr randolph moved as an amendment to the report of the comme of five that in order to ascertain the alterations in the population  wealth of the several states the legislature should be required to cause a census and estimate to be taken within one year after its first meeting and every — years thereafter and that the legislre arrange the representation accordingly mr govr morris opposed it as fettering the legislature too much advantage may be taken of it in time of war or the apprehension of it by new states to extort particular favors if the mode was to be fixed for taking a census it might certainly be extremely inconvenient if unfixt the legislature may use such a mode as will defeat the object and perpetuate the inequality he was always agst such shackles on the legislre they had been found very pernicious in most of the state constitutions he dwelt much on the danger of throwing such a preponderancy into the western scale suggesting that in time the western people wd outnumber the atlantic states he wished therefore to put it in the power of the latter to keep a majority of votes in their own hands it was objected he said that if the legislre are left at liberty they will never readjust the representation he admitted that this was possible but he did not think it probable unless the reasons agst a revision of it were very urgent  in this case it ought not to be done it was moved to postpone the proposition of mr randolph in order to take up the following viz     that the committee of eleven to whom was referred the report of the committee of five on the subject of representation be requested to furnish the convention with the principles on which they grounded the report which was disagreed to s c alone voting in the affirmative adjourned wednesday july    in convention mr randolphs motion requiring the legislre to take a periodical census for the purpose of redressing inequalities in the representation was resumed mr sherman was agst shackling the legislature too much we ought to choose wise  good men and then confide in them mr mason the greater the difficulty we find in fixing a proper rule of representation the more unwilling ought we to be to throw the task from ourselves on the genl legislre he did not object to the conjectural ratio which was to prevail in the outset but considered a revision from time to time according to some permanent  precise standard as essential to ye fair representation required in the  st branch according to the present population of america the northn part of it had a right to preponderate and he could not deny it but he wished it not to preponderate hereafter when the reason no longer continued from the nature of man we may be sure that those who have power in their hands will not give it up while they can retain it     on the contrary we know that they will always when they can rather increase it if the s states therefore should have ¾ of the people of america within their limits the northern will hold fast the majority of representatives ¼ will govern the ¾ the s states will complain but they may complain from generation to generation without redress unless some principle therefore which will do justice to them hereafter shall be inserted in the constitution disagreable as the declaration was to him he must declare he could neither vote for the system here nor support it in his state strong objections had been drawn from the danger to the atlantic interests from new western states ought we to sacrifice what we know to be right in itself lest it should prove favorable to states which are not yet in existence if the western states are to be admitted into the union as they arise they must he wd repeat be treated as equals and subjected to no degrading discriminations they will have the same pride  other passions which we have and will either not unite with or will speedily revolt from the union if they are not in all respects placed on an equal footing with their brethern it has been said they will be poor and unable to make equal contributions to the general treasury he did not know but that in time they would be both more numerous  more wealthy than their atlantic brethren the extent  fertility of their soil made this probable and though spain might for a time deprive them of the natural outlet for their     productions yet she will because she must finally yield to their demands he urged that numbers of inhabitants though not always a precise standard of wealth was sufficiently so for every substantial purpose mr williamson was for making it a duty of the legislature to do what was right  not leaving it at liberty to do or not to do it he moved that mr randolphs propositions be postpond in order to consider the following that in order to ascertain the alterations that may happen in the population  wealth of the several states a census shall be taken of the free white inhabitants and ⅗ths of those of other descriptions on the  st year after this government shall have been adopted and every — year thereafter and that the representation be regulated accordingly mr randolph agreed that mr williamsons proposition should stand in the place of his he observed that the ratio fixt for the  st meeting was a mere conjecture that it placed the power in the hands of that part of america which could not always be entitled to it that this power would not be voluntarily renounced and that it was consequently the duty of the convention to secure its renunciation when justice might so require by some constitutional provisions if equality between great  small states be inadmissible because in that case unequal numbers of constituents wd be represented by equal number of votes was it not equally inadmissible that a larger  more populous district of america should hereafter     have less representation than a smaller  less populous district if a fair representation of the people be not secured the injustice of the govt will shake it to its foundations what relates to suffrage is justly stated by the celebrated montesquieu as a fundamental article in republican govt if the danger suggested by mr govr morris be real of advantage being taken of the legislature in pressing moments it was an additional reason for tying their hands in such a manner that they could not sacrifice their trust to momentary considerations congs have pledged the public faith to new states that they shall be admitted on equal terms they never would or ought to accede on any other the census must be taken under the direction of the general legislature the states will be too much interested to take an impartial one for themselves mr butler  genl pinkney insisted that blacks be included in the rule of representation equally with the whites and for that purpose moved that the words threefifths be struck out mr gerry thought that ⅗ of them was to say the least the full proportion that could be admitted mr ghorum this ratio was fixed by congs as a rule of taxation then it was urged by the delegates representing the states having slaves that the blacks were still more inferior to freemen at present when the ratio of representation is to be established we are assured that they are equal to freemen the arguments on ye former occasion convinced him that ⅗ was pretty near the just     proportion and he should vote according to the same opinion now mr butler insisted that the labour of a slave in s carola was as productive  valuable as that of a freeman in massts that as wealth was the great means of defence and utility to the nation they were equally valuable to it with freemen and that consequently an equal representation ought to be allowed for them in a government which was instituted principally for the protection of property and was itself to be supported by property mr mason could not agree to the motion notwithstanding it was favorable to virga because he thought it unjust it was certain that the slaves were valuable as they raised the value of land increased the exports  imports and of course the revenue would supply the means of feeding  supporting an army and might in cases of emergency become themselves soldiers as in these important respects they were useful to the community at large they ought not to be excluded from the estimate of representation he could not however regard them as equal to freemen and could not vote for them as such he added as worthy of remark that the southern states have this peculiar species of property over  above the other species of property common to all the states mr williamson reminded mr ghorum that if the southn states contended for the inferiority of blacks to whites when taxation was in view the eastern states on the same occasion contended for their     equality he did not however either then or now concur in either extreme but approved of the ratio of ⅗ on mr butlers motion for considering blacks as equal to whites in the apportionmt of representation massts no cont no n y not on floor n j no pa no del ay md no va no n c no s c ay geo ay mr govr morris said he had several objections to the proposition of mr williamson   it fettered the legislature too much   it would exclude some states altogether who would not have a sufficient number to entitle them to a single representative   it will not consist with the resolution passed on saturday last authorizing the legislature to adjust the representation from time to time on the principles of population  wealth or with the principles of equity if slaves were to be considered as inhabitants not as wealth then the sd resolution would not be pursued if as wealth then why is no other wealth but slaves included these objections may perhaps be removed by amendments his great objection was that the number of inhabitants was not a proper standard of wealth the amazing difference between the comparative numbers  wealth of different countries rendered all reasoning superfluous on the subject numbers might with greater propriety be deemed a measure of strength than of wealth yet the late defence made by g britain agst her numerous enemies proved in  00 the clearest manner that it is entirely fallacious even in this respect mr king thought there was great force in the objections of mr govr morris he would however accede to the proposition for the sake of doing something mr rutlidge contended for the admission of wealth in the estimate by which representation should be regulated the western states will not be able to contribute in proportion to their numbers they shd not therefore be represented in that proportion the atlantic states will not concur in such a plan he moved that at the end of — years after the  st meeting of the legislature and of every — years thereafter the legislature shall proportion the representation according to the principles of wealth  population mr sherman thought the number of people alone the best rule for measuring wealth as well as representation and that if the legislature were to be governed by wealth they would be obliged to estimate it by numbers he was at first for leaving the matter wholly to the discretion of the legislature but he had been convinced by the observation of mr randolph  mr mason that the periods  the rule of revising the representation ought to be fixt by the constitution mr reed thought the legislature ought not to be too much shackled it would make the constitution like religious creeds embarrassing to those bound to conform to them  more likely to produce dissatisfaction and scism than harmony and union  0  mr mason objected to mr rutlidges motion as requiring of the legislature something too indefinite  impracticable and leaving them a pretext for doing nothing mr wilson had himself no objection to leaving the legislature entirely at liberty but considered wealth as an impracticable rule mr ghorum if the convention who are comparatively so little biassed by local views are so much perplexed how can it be expected that the legislature hereafter under the full biass of those views will be able to settle a standard he was convinced by the arguments of others  his own reflections that the convention ought to fix some standard or other mr govr morris the argts of others  his own reflections had led him to a very different conclusion if we cant agree on a rule that will be just at this time how can we expect to find one that will be just in all times to come surely those who come after us will judge better of things present than we can of things future he could not persuade himself that numbers would be a just rule at any time the remarks of mr mason relative to the western country had not changed his opinion on that head among other objections it must be apparent they would not be able to furnish men equally enlightened to share in the administration of our common interests the busy haunts of men not the remote wilderness was the proper school of political talents if the western people get the power into  0  their hands they will ruin the atlantic interests the back members are always most averse to the best measures he mentioned the case of pena formerly the lower part of the state had ye power in the first instance they kept it in yr own hands  the country was ye better for it another objection with him agst admitting the blacks into the census was that the people of pena would revolt at the idea of being put on a footing with slaves they would reject any plan that was to have such an effect two objections had been raised agst leaving the adjustment of the representation from time to time to the discretion of the legislature the   was they would be unwilling to revise it at all the   that by referring to wealth they would be bound by a rule which if willing they would be unable to execute the  st objn distrusts their fidelity but if their duty their honor  their oaths will not bind them let us not put into their hands our liberty and all our other great interests let us have no govt at all   if these ties will bind them we need not distrust the practicability of the rule it was followed in part by the come in the apportionment of representatives yesterday reported to the house the best course that could be taken would be to leave the interests of the people to the representatives of the people mr madison was not a little surprised to hear this implicit confidence urged by a member who on all occasions had inculcated so strongly the political depravity of men and the necessity of checking one  0  vice and interest by opposing to them another vice  interest if the representatives of the people would be bound by the ties he had mentioned what need was there of a senate what of a revisionary power but his reasoning was not only inconsistent with his former reasoning but with itself at the same time that he recommended this implicit confidence to the southern states in the northern majority he was still more zealous in exhorting all to a jealousy of a western majority to reconcile the gentln with himself it must be imagined that he determined the human character by the points of the compass the truth was that all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree the case of pena had been mentioned where it was admitted that those who were possessed of the power in the original settlement never admitted the new settlemts to a due share of it england was a still more striking example the power there had long been in the hands of the boroughs of the minority who had opposed  defeated every reform which had been attempted virga was in a lesser degree another example with regard to the western states he was clear  firm in opinion that no unfavorable distinctions were admissible either in point of justice or policy he thought also that the hope of contributions to the treasy from them had been much underrated future contributions it seemed to be understood on all hands would be principally levied on imports  exports the extent and fertility of the western  0  soil would for a long time give to agriculture a preference over manufactures trials would be repeated till some articles could be raised from it that would bear a transportation to places where they could be exchanged for imported manufactures whenever the mississpitilde should be opened to them which would of necessity be ye case as soon as their population would subject them to any considerable share of the public burden imposts on their trade could be collected with less expence  greater certainty than on that of the atlantic states in the mean time as their supplies must pass through the atlantic states their contributions would be levied in the same manner with those of the atlantic states he could not agree that any substantial objection lay agst fixg numbers for the perpetual standard of representation it was said that representation  taxation were to go together that taxation and wealth ought to go together that population  wealth were not measures of each other he admitted that in different climates under different forms of govt and in different stages of civilization the inference was perfectly just he would admit that in no situation numbers of inhabitants were an accurate measure of wealth he contended however that in the u states it was sufficiently so for the object in contemplation altho their climate varied considerably yet as the govts the laws and the manners of all were nearly the same and the intercourse between different parts perfectly free population industry arts and the value of  0  labour would constantly tend to equalize themselves the value of labour might be considered as the principal criterion of wealth and ability to support taxes and this would find its level in different places where the intercourse should be easy  free with as much certainty as the value of money or any other thing wherever labour would yield most people would resort till the competition should destroy the inequality hence it is that the people are constantly swarming from the more to the less populous places—from europe to ama—from the northn  middle parts of the u s to the southern  western they go where land is cheaper because there labour is dearer if it be true that the same quantity of produce raised on the banks of the ohio is of less value than on the delaware it is also true that the same labor will raise twice or thrice the quantity in the former that it will raise in the latter situation col mason agreed with mr govr morris that we ought to leave the interests of the people to the representatives of the people but the objection was that the legislature would cease to be the representatives of the people it would continue so no longer than the states now containing a majority of the people should retain that majority as soon as the southern  western population should predominate which must happen in a few years the power wd be in the hands of the minority and would never be yielded to the majority unless provided for by

the admission of them along with whites at all would excite great discontents among the states having no slaves he had never said as to any particular point that he would in no event acquiesce in  support it but he wd say that if any in case such a declaration was to be made by him it would be in this he remarked that in the temporary allotment of representatives made by the committee the southern states had received more than the number of their white  three fifths of their black inhabitants entitled them to mr sherman s carola had not more beyond her proportion than n york  n hampshire nor either of them more than was necessary in order to avoid fractions or reducing them below their proportions georgia had more but the rapid growth of that state seemed to justify it in general the  0  allotment might not be just but considering all circumstances he was satisfied with it mr ghorum supported the propriety of establishing numbers as the rule he said that in massts estimates had been taken in the different towns and that persons had been curious enough to compare these estimates with the respective numbers of people and it had been found even including boston that the most exact proportion prevailed between numbers  property he was aware that there might be some weight in what had fallen from his colleague as to the umbrage which might be taken by the people of the eastern states but he recollected that when the proposition of congs for changing the  th art of the confedn was before the legislature of massts the only difficulty then was to satisfy them that the negroes ought not to have been counted equally with whites instead of being counted in ratio of threefifths only  mr wilson did not well see on what principle the admission of blacks in the proportion of three fifths could be explained are they admitted as citizens then why are they not admitted on an equality with white citizens are they admitted as property then why is not other property admitted into the computation these were difficulties however which he thought must be overruled by the necessity of compromise he had some apprehensions also from the tendency of the blending of the blacks with  0  the whites to give disgust to the people of pena as had been intimated by his colleague mr govr morris but he differed from him in thinking numbers of inhabts so incorrect a measure of wealth he had seen the western settlemts of pa and on a comparison of them with the city of philada could discover little other difference than that property was more unequally divided among individuals here than there taking the same number in the aggregate in the two situations he believed there would be little difference in their wealth and ability to contribute to the public wants mr govr morris was compelled to declare himself reduced to the dilemma of doing injustice to the southern states or to human nature and he must therefore do it to the former for he could never agree to give such encouragement to the slave trade as would be given by allowing them a representation for their negroes and he did not believe those states would ever confederate on terms that would deprive them of that trade on question for agreeing to include ⅗ of the blacks massts no cont ay n j no pa no del no mard  no va ay n c ay s c no geo ay on the question as to taking census the

the justice of mr govr morriss motion mr mason also admitted the justice of the principle   0 but was afraid embarrassments might be occasioned to the legislature by it it might drive the legislature to the plan of requisitions mr govr morris admitted that some objections lay agst his motion but supposed they would be removed by restraining the rule to direct taxation with regard to indirect taxes on exports  imports  on consumption the rule would be inapplicable notwithstanding what had been said to the contrary he was persuaded that the imports  consumption were pretty nearly equal throughout the union general pinkney liked the idea he thought it so just that it could not be objected to but foresaw that if the revision of the census was left to the discretion of the legislature it would never be carried into execution the rule must be fixed and the execution of it enforced by the constitution he was alarmed at what was said  yesterday concerning the negroes he was now again alarmed at what had been thrown out concerning the taxing of exports s carola has in one year exported to the amount of £ 00000 sterling all which was the fruit of the labor of her blacks will she be represented in proportion to this amount she will not neither ought she then to be subject to a tax on it he hoped a clause would be inserted in the system restraining the legislature from taxing exports mr wilson approved the principle but could not     see how it could be carried into execution unless restrained to direct taxation mr govr morris having so varied his motion by inserting the word direct it passd nem con as follows—provided always that direct taxation ought to be proportioned to representation mr davie said it was high time now to speak out he saw that it was meant by some gentlemen to deprive the southern states of any share of representation for their blacks he was sure that n carola would never confederate on any terms that did not rate them at least as ⅗ if the eastern states meant therefore to exclude them altogether the business was at an end dr johnson thought that wealth and population were the true equitable rule of representation but he conceived that these two principles resolved themselves into one population being the best measure of wealth he concluded therefore that ye number of people ought to be established as the rule and that all descriptions including blacks equally with the whites ought to fall within the computation as various opinions had been expressed on the subject he would move that a committee might be appointed to take them into consideration and report thereon mr govr morris it has been said that it is high time to speak out as one member he would candidly do so he came here to form a compact for the good of america he was ready to do so with all the states he hoped  believed that all would     enter into such a compact if they would not he was ready to join with any states that would but as the compact was to be voluntary it is in vain for the eastern states to insist on what the southn states will never agree to it is equally vain for the latter to require what the other states can never admit and he verily believed the people of pena will never agree to a representation of negroes what can be desired by these states more than has been already proposed that the legislature shall from time to time regulate representation according to population  wealth genl pinkney desired that the rule of wealth should be ascertained and not left to the pleasure of the legislature and that property in slaves should not be exposed to danger under a govt instituted for the protection of property the first clause in the report of the first grand committee was postponed mr elseworth in order to carry into effect the principle established moved that to add to the last clause adopted by the house the words following and that the rule of contribution by direct taxation for the support of the government of the u states shall be the number of white inhabitants and three fifths of every other description in the several states until some other rule that shall more accurately ascertain the wealth of the several states can be devised and adopted by the legislature mr butler seconded the motion in order that it might be committed     mr randolph was not satisfied with the motion the danger will be revived that the ingenuity of the legislature may evade or pervert the rule so as to perpetuate the power where it shall be lodged in the first instance he proposed in lieu of mr elseworths motion that in order to ascertain the alterations in representation that may be required from time to time by changes in the relative circumstances of the states a census shall be taken within two years from the  st meeting of the genl legislature of the u s and once within the term of every — year afterwards of all the inhabitants in the manner  according to the ratio recommended by congress in their resolution of the   th day of apl      rating the blacks at ⅗ of their number and that the legislature of the u s shall arrange the representation accordingly he urged strenuously that express security ought to be provided for including slaves in the ratio of representation he lamented that such a species of property existed but as it did exist the holders of it would require this security it was perceived that the design was entertained by some of excluding slaves altogether the legislature therefore ought not to be left at liberty mr elseworth withdraws his motion  seconds that of mr randolph mr wilson observed that less umbrage would perhaps be taken agst an admission of the slaves into the rule of representation if it should be so expressed as to make them indirectly only an ingredient in the rule by saying that they should enter into the rule     of taxation and as representation was to be according to taxation the end would be equally attained he accordingly moved  was  ded so to alter the last clause adopted by the house that together with the amendment proposed the whole should read as follows—provided always that the representation ought to be proportioned according to direct taxation and in order to ascertain the alterations in the direct taxation which may be required from time to time by the changes in the relative circumstances of the states resolved that a census be taken within two years from the first meeting of the legislature of the u states and once within the term of every — years afterwards of all the inhabitants of the u s in the manner and according to the ratio recommended by congress in their resolution of april         and that the legislature of the u s shall proportion the direct taxation accordingly mr king altho this amendment varies the aspect somewhat he had still two powerful objections agst tying down the legislature to the rule of numbers   they were at this time an uncertain index of the relative wealth of the states   if they were a just index at this time it can not be supposed always to continue so he was far from wishing to retain any unjust advantage whatever in one part of the republic if justice was not the basis of the connection it could not be of long duration he must be shortsighted indeed who does not foresee that whenever the southern states shall be more numerous     than the northern they can  will hold a language that will awe them into justice if they threaten to separate now in case injury shall be done them will their threats be less urgent or effectual when force shall back their demands even in the intervening period there will be no point of time at which they will not be able to say do us justice or we will separate he urged the necessity of placing confidence to a certain degree in every govt and did not conceive that the proposed confidence as to a periodical readjustment of the representation exceeded that degree mr pinkney moved to amend mr randolphs motion so as to make blacks equal to the whites in the ratio of representation this he urged was nothing more than justice the blacks are the labourers the peasants of the southern states they are as productive of pecuniary resources as those of the northern states they add equally to the wealth and considering money as the sinew of war to the strength of the nation it will also be politic with regard to the northern states as taxation is to keep pace with representation genl pinkney moves to insert   years instead of two as the period computing from the  st meeting of ye legise

slaves than where there were the consumption being greater— mr elseworth in case of a poll tax there wd be no difficulty but there wd probably be none the sum allotted to a state may be levied without

be raised for supplying the public treasury by direct taxation shall be assessed on the inhabitants of the several states according to the number of their representatives respectively in the  st branch he said this would be as just before as after the census according to the general principle that taxation  representation ought to go together mr williamson feared that n hamshire will have reason to complain   members were allotted to her as a liberal allowance for this reason among others that she might not suppose any advantage to have been taken of her absence as she was still absent and had no opportunity of deciding whether she would chuse to retain the number on the condition of her being taxed in proportion to it he thought the number ought to be reduced from three to two before the question was taken on mr gs motion     mr read could not approve of the proposition he had observed he said in the committee a backwardness in some of the members from the large states to take their full proportion of representatives he did not then see the motive he now suspects it was to avoid their due share of taxation he had no objection to a just  accurate adjustment of representation  taxation to each other mr govr morris  mr madison answered that the charge itself involved an acquittal since notwithstanding the augmentation of the number of members allotted to massts  va the motion for proportioning the burdens thereto was made by a member from the former state  was approved by mr m from the latter who was on the come mr govr morris said that he thought pa had her due share in   members and he could not in candor ask for more mr m said that having always conceived that the difference of interest in the u states lay not between the large  small but the n  southn states and finding that the number of members allotted to the n states was greatly superior he should have preferred an addition of two members to the s states to wit one to n    to s carla rather than of one member to virga he liked the present motion because it tended to moderate the views both of the opponents  advocates for rating very high the negroes mr elseworth hoped the proposition would be withdrawn it entered too much into detail the general principle was already sufficiently settled     as fractions can not be regarded in apportioning the no of representatives the rule will be unjust until an actual census shall be made after that taxation may be precisely proportioned according to the principle established to the number of inhabitants mr wilson hoped the motion would not be withdrawn if it shd it will be made from another quarter the rule will be as reasonable  just before as after a census as to fractional numbers the census will not destroy but ascertain them and they will have the same effect after as before the census for as he understands the rule it is to be adjusted not to the number of inhabitants but of representatives mr sherman opposed the motion he thought the legislature ought to be left at liberty in which case they would probably conform to the principles observed by congs mr mason did not know that virga would be a loser by the proposed regulation but had some scruple as to the justice of it he doubted much whether the conjectural rule which was to precede the census would be as just as it would be rendered by

again but so varied as to authorize the assessment on the states which leaves the mode to the legislature viz that from the  st meeting of the legislature of the u s untill a census shall be taken all

periodical revisions according to the number of whites  three fifths of the blacks the motion was in the words following—but as the present situation of the states may probably alter in the number of their inhabitants that the legislature of the u s be authorized from time to time to apportion the number     of representatives and in case any of the states shall hereafter be divided or any two or more states united or new states created within the limits of the u s the legislature of u s shall possess authority to regulate the number of representatives in any of the foregoing cases upon the principle of their number of inhabitants according to the provisions hereafter mentioned mr govr morris opposed the alteration as leaving still incoherence if negroes were to be viewed as inhabitants and the revision was to proceed on the principle of numbers of inhabts they ought to be added in their entire number and not in the proportion of ⅗ if as property the word wealth was right and striking it out would produce the very inconsistency which it was meant to get rid of—the train of business  the late turn which it had taken had led him he said into deep meditation on it and he wd candidly state the result a distinction had been set up  urged between the nn and southn states he had hitherto considered this doctrine as heretical he still thought the distinction groundless he sees however that it is persisted in and the southn gentlemen will not be satisfied unless they see the way open to their gaining a majority in the public councils the consequence of such a transfer of power from the maritime to the interior  landed interest will he foresees be such an oppression of commerce that he shall be obliged to vote for ye vicious principle of equality in the  d branch in order to provide some defence for the n states agst it but to come     more to the point either this distinction is fictitious or real if fictitious let it be dismissed  let us proceed with due confidence if it be real instead of attempting to blend incompatible things let us at once take a friendly leave of each other there can be no end of demands for security if every particular interest is to be entitled to it the eastern states may claim it for their fishery and for other objects as the southn states claim it for their peculiar objects in this struggle between the two ends of the union what part ought the middle states in point of policy to take to join their eastern brethren according to his ideas if the southn states get the power into their hands and be joined as they will be with the interior country they will inevitably bring on a war with spain for the mississippi this language is already held the interior country having no property nor interest exposed on the sea will be little affected by such a war he wished to know what security the northn  middle states will have agst this danger it has been said that n c s c and georgia only will in a little time have a majority of the people of america they must in that case include the great interior country and every thing was to be apprehended from their getting the power into their hands mr butler the security the southn states want is that their negroes may not be taken from them which some gentlemen within or without doors have a very good mind to do it was not supposed that n c s c  geo would have more people than all     the other states but many more relatively to the other states than they now have the people  strength of america are evidently bearing southwardly  s westwdly mr wilson if a general declaration would satisfy any gentleman he had no indisposition to declare his sentiments conceiving that all men wherever placed have equal rights and are equally entitled to confidence he viewed without apprehension the period when a few states should contain the superior number of people the majority of people wherever found ought in all questions to govern the minority if the interior country should acquire this majority it will not only have the right but will avail itself of it whether we will or no this jealousy misled the policy of g britain with regard to america the fatal maxims espoused by her were that the colonies were growing too fast and that their growth must be stinted in time what were the consequences first enmity on our part then actual separation like consequences will result on the part of the interior settlements if like jealousy  policy be pursued on ours further if numbers be not a proper rule why is not some better rule pointed out no one has yet ventured to attempt it congs have never been able to discover a better no state as far as he had heard had suggested any other in      after elaborate discussion of a measure of wealth all were satisfied then as they are now that the rule of numbers does not differ much from the combined rule of numbers  wealth again he     could not agree that property was the sole or primary object of govt  society the cultivation  improvement of the human mind was the most noble object with respect to this object as well as to other personal rights numbers were surely the natural  precise measure of representation and with respect to property they could not vary much from the precise measure in no point of view however could the establishmt of numbers as the rule of representation in the  st branch vary his opinion as to the impropriety of letting a vicious principle into the  d branch—on the question to strike out wealth  to make the change as moved by mr randolph it passed in the

for the question on the whole report including the parts relating to the origination of money bills and the equality of votes in the  d branch mr gerry wished before the question should be     put that the attention of the house might be turned to the dangers apprehended from western states he was for admitting them on liberal terms but not for putting ourselves in their hands they will if they acquire power like all men abuse it they will oppress commerce and drain our wealth into the western country to guard agst these consequences he thought it necessary to limit the number of new states to be admitted into the union in such a manner that they should never be able to outnumber the atlantic states he accordingly moved that in order to secure the liberties of the states already confederated the number of representatives in the  st branch of the states which shall hereafter be established shall never exceed in number the representatives from such of the states as shall accede to this confederation mr king seconded the motion mr sherman thought there was no probability that the number of future states would exceed that of the existing states if the event should ever happen it was too remote to be taken into consideration at this time besides we are providing for our posterity for our children  our grand children who would be as likely to be citizens of new western states as of the old states on this consideration alone we ought to make no such discrimination as was proposed by the motion mr gerry if some of our children should remove others will stay behind and he thought it incumbent on us to provide for their interests there was a     rage for emigration from the eastern states to the western country and he did not wish those remaining behind to be at the mercy of the emigrants besides foreigners are resorting to that country and it is uncertain what turn things may take there—on the question for agreeing to the motion of mr gerry it passed in the negative mass ay cont ay n j no pa divd del ay md ay va no n c no s c no geo no mr rutlidge proposed to reconsider the two propositions touching the originating of money bills in the first  the equality of votes in the second branch mr sherman was for the question on the whole at once it was he said a conciliatory plan it had been considered in all its parts a great deal of time had been spent upon it and if any part should now be altered it would be necessary to go over the whole ground again mr l martin urged the question on the whole he did not like many parts of it he did not like having two branches nor the inequality of votes in the  st branch he was willing however to make trial of the plan rather than do nothing mr wilson traced the progress of the report through its several stages remarking yt when on the question concerning an equality of votes the house was divided our constituents had they voted as their representatives did would have stood as ⅔ agst the equality and ⅓ only in favor of it this fact would ere long be known and it will appear that this fundamental point has been carried by ⅓ agst ⅔     what hopes will our constituents entertain when they find that the essential principles of justice have been violated in the outset of the governmt as to the privilege of originating money bills it was not considered by any as of much moment and by many as improper in itself he hoped both clauses wd be reconsidered the equality of votes was a point of such critical importance that every opportunity ought to be allowed for discussing and collecting the mind of the convention upon it mr l martin denies that there were ⅔ agst the equality of votes the states that please to call themselves large are the weekest in the union look at masts look at virga are they efficient states he was for letting a separation take place if they desired it he had rather there should be two confederacies than one founded on any other principle than an equality of votes in the  d branch at least mr wilson was not surprised that those who say that a minority is more than a majority should say the minority is stronger than the majority he supposed the next assertion will be that they are richer also though he hardly expected it would be persisted in when the states shall be called on for taxes  troops mr gerry also animadverted on mr l martins remarks on the weakness of masts he favored the reconsideration with a view not of destroying the equality of votes but of providing that the states should vote per capita which he said would prevent the delays  inconveniences that had been experienced     in congs and would give a national aspect  spirit to the management of business he did not approve of a reconsideration of the clause relating to money bills it was of great consequence it was the corner stone of the accommodation if any member of the convention had the exclusive privilege of making propositions would any one say that it would give him no advantage over other members the report was not altogether to his mind but he would agree to it as it stood rather than throw it out altogether the reconsideration being tacitly agreed to mr pinkney moved that instead of an equality of votes the states should be represented in the  d branch as follows n h by   members mass   r i   cont   n y   n j   pa   del   md   virga   n c   s c   geo   making in the whole    mr wilson seconds the motion mr dayton the smaller states can never give up their equality for himself he would in no event yield that security for their rights mr sherman urged the equality of votes not so much as a security for the small states as for the state govts which could not be preserved unless they were represented  had a negative in the genl government he had no objection to the members in the  d b voting per capita as had been suggested by mr gerry mr madison concurred in this motion of mr pinkney as a reasonable compromise     mr gerry said he should like the motion but could see no hope of success an accommodation must take place and it was apparent from what had been seen that it could not do so on the ground of the motion he was utterly against a partial confederacy leaving other states to accede or not accede as had been intimated mr king said it was always with regret that he differed from his colleagues but it was his duty to differ from mr gerry on this occasion he considered the proposed government as substantially and formally a general and national government over the people of america there never will be a case in which it will act as a federal government on the states and not on the individual citizens and is it not a clear principle that in a free govt those who are to be the objects of a govt ought to influence the operations of it what reason can be assigned why the same rule of representation sd not prevail in the  d branch as in the  st he could conceive none on the contrary every view of the subject that presented itself seemed to require it two objections had been raised agst it drawn   from the terms of the existing compact   from a supposed danger to the smaller states—as to the first objection he thought it inapplicable according to the existing confederation the rule by which the public burdens is to be apportioned is fixed and must be pursued in the proposed governt it cannot be fixed because indirect taxation is to be substituted the legislature therefore will have full discretion to impose taxes in   0 such modes  proportions as they may judge expedient as to the  d objection he thought it of as little weight the genl governt can never wish to intrude on the state governts there could be no temptation none had been pointed out in order to prevent the interference of measures which seemed most likely to happen he would have no objection to throwing all the state debts into the federal debt making one aggregate debt of about  0000000 of dollars and leaving it to be discharged by the genl govt according to the idea of securing the state govts there ought to be three distinct legislative branches the  d was admitted to be necessary and was actually meant to check the  st branch to give more wisdom system  stability to the govt and ought clearly as it was to operate on the people to be proportioned to them for the third purpose of securing the states there ought then to be a  d branch representing the states as such and guarding by equal votes their rights  dignities he would not pretend to be as thoroughly acquainted with his immediate constituents as his colleagues but it was his firm belief that masts would never be prevailed on to yield to an equality of votes in n york he was sorry to be obliged to say any thing relative to that state in the absence of its representatives but the occasion required it in n york he had seen that the most powerful argument used by the considerate opponents to the grant of the impost to congress was pointed agst the vicious constitution of congs with regard to representation  suffrage he was sure     that no govt could last that was not founded on just principles he preferred the doing of nothing to an allowance of an equal vote to all the states it would be better he thought to submit to a little more confusion  convulsion than to submit to such an evil it was difficult to say what the views of different gentlemen might be perhaps there might be some who thought no governmt coextensive with the u states could be established with a hope of its answering the purpose perhaps there might be other fixed opinions incompatible with the object we are pursuing if there were he thought it but candid that gentlemen should speak out that we might understand one another mr strong the convention had been much divided in opinion in order to avoid the consequences of it an accommodation had been proposed a committee had been appointed and though some of the members of it were averse to an equality of votes a report had been made in favor of it it is agreed on all hands that congress are nearly at an end if no accommodation takes place the union itself must soon be dissolved it has been suggested that if we cannot come to any general agreement the principal states may form  recommend a scheme of government but will the small states in that case ever accede it is it probable that the large states themselves will under such circumstances embrace and ratify it he thought the small states had made a considerable concession in the article of money bills and that they might naturally expect     some concessions on the other side from this view of the matter he was compelled to give his vote for the report taken altogether mr madison expressed his apprehensions that if the proper foundation of governmt was destroyed by substituting an equality in place of a proportional representation no proper superstructure would be raised if the small states really wish for a government armed with the powers necessary to secure their liberties and to enforce obedience on the larger members as well as themselves he could not help thinking them extremely mistaken in their means he reminded them of the consequences of laying the existing confederation on improper principles all the principal parties to its compilation joined immediately in mutilating  fettering the governmt in such a manner that it has disappointed every hope placed in it he appealed to the doctrine  arguments used by themselves on a former occasion it had been very properly observed by mr patterson that representation was an expedient by which the meeting of the people themselves was rendered unnecessary and that the representatives ought therefore to bear a proportion to the votes which their constituents if convened would respectively have was not this remark as applicable to one branch of the representation as to the other but it had been said that the governt would in its operation be partly federal partly national that altho in the latter respect the representatives of the people ought to be in proportion to the people yet in the     former it ought to be according to the number of states if there was any solidity in this distinction he was ready to abide by it if there was none it ought to be abandoned in all cases where the genl governmt is to act on the people let the people be represented and the votes be proportional in all cases where the governt is to act on the states as such in like manner as congs now acts on them let the states be represented  the votes be equal this was the true ground of compromise if there was any ground at all but he denied that there was any ground he called for a single instance in which the genl govt was not to operate on the people individually the practicability of making laws with coercive sanctions for the states as political bodies had been exploded on all hands he observed that the people of the large states would in some way or other secure to themselves a weight proportioned to the importance accruing from their superior numbers if they could not effect it by a proportional representation in the govt they would probably accede to no govt which did not in a great measure depend for its efficacy on their voluntary cooperation in which case they would indirectly secure their object the existing confederacy proved that where the acts of the genl govt were to be executed by the particular govts the latter had a weight in proportion to their importance no one would say that either in congs or out of congs delaware had equal weight with pennsylva if the latter was to supply ten times as much money as the former and no compulsion could     be used it was of ten times more importance that she should voluntarily furnish the supply in the dutch confederacy the votes of the provinces were equal but holland which supplies about half the money governed the whole republic he enumerated the objections agst an equality of votes in the  d branch notwithstanding the proportional representation in the first   the minority could negative the will of the majority of the people   they could extort measures by making them a condition of their assent to other necessary measures   they could obtrude measures on the majority by virtue of the peculiar powers which would be vested in the senate   the evil instead of being cured by time would increase with every new state that should be admitted as they must all be admitted on the principle of equality   the perpetuity it would give to the preponderance of the northn agst the southn scale was a serious consideration it seemed now to be pretty well understood that the real difference of interests lay not between the large  small but between the n  southn states the institution of slavery  its consequences formed the line of discrimination there were   states on the south   on the northn side of this line should a proportl representation take place it was true the n side would still outnumber the other but not in the same degree at this time and every day would tend towards an equilibrium mr wilson would add a few words only if equality in the  d branch was an error that time would     correct he should be less anxious to exclude it being sensible that perfection was unattainable in any plan but being a fundamental and a perpetual error it ought by all means to be avoided a vice in the representation like an error in the first concoction must be followed by disease convulsions and finally death itself the justice of the general principle of proportional representation has not in argument at least been yet contradicted but it is said that a departure from it so far as to give the states an equal vote in one branch of the legislature is essential to their preservation he had considered this position maturely but could not see its application that the states ought to be preserved he admitted but does it follow that an equality of votes is necessary for the purpose is there any reason to suppose that if their preservation should depend more on the large than on the small states the security of the states agst the genl government would be diminished are the large states less attached to their existence more likely to commit suicide than the small an equal vote then is not necessary as far as he can conceive and is liable among other objections to this insuperable one the great fault of the existing confederacy is its inactivity it has never been a complaint agst congs that they governed over much the complaint has been that they have governed too little to remedy this defect we were sent here shall we effect the cure by establishing an equality of votes as is proposed no this very equality carries us directly to congress to the     system which it is our duty to rectify the small states cannot indeed act by virtue of this equality but they may controul the govt as they have done in congs this very measure is here prosecuted by a minority of the people of america is then the object of the convention likely to be accomplished in this way will not our constituents say we sent you to form an efficient govt and you have given us one more complex indeed but having all the weakness of the former governt he was anxious for uniting all the states under one governt he knew there were some respectable men who preferred three confederacies united by offensive  defensive alliances many things may be plausibly said some things may be justly said in favor of such a project he could not however concur in it himself but he thought nothing so pernicious as bad first principles mr elseworth asked two questions one of mr wilson whether he had ever seen a good measure fail in congs for want of a majority of states in its favor he had himself never known such an instance the other of mr madison whether a negative lodged with the majority of the states even the smallest could be more dangerous than the qualified negative proposed to be lodged in a single executive magistrate who must be taken from some one state mr sherman signified that his expectation was that the genl legislature would in some cases act on the federal principle of requiring quotas but he thought it ought to be empowered to carry their own     plans into execution if the states should fail to supply their respective quotas on the question for agreeing to mr pinkneys motion for allowing n h   mas   c—it passed in the negative mass no mr king ay mr ghorum absent cont no n j no pa ay del no

but in pursuance of appropriations to be originated in the  st branch resolvd that in the  d branch of the legislature of the u s each state shall have an equal vote the  th resol in the report from the come of the whole house which had been postponed in order to consider the     th resolns was now resumed see the resoln the  st member that the natl legislature ought to possess the legislative rights vested in congs by the confederation was agreed to nem con the next and moreover to legislate in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent or in which the harmony of the u s may be interrupted   0 by the exercise of individual legislation being read for a question mr butler calls for some explanation of the extent of this power particularly of the word incompetent the vagueness of the terms rendered it impossible for any precise judgment to be formed mr ghorum the vagueness of the terms constitutes the propriety of them we are now establishing general principles to be extended hereafter into details which will be precise  explicit mr rutlidge urged the objection started by mr butler and moved that the clause should be committed to the end that a specification of the powers comprised in the general terms might be reported on the question for commitment the states were equally divided mas no cont ay n j no pa no del no md ay va ay n c no s c ay geo ay so it was lost mr randolph the vote of this morning involving an equality of suffrage in  d branch had embarrassed the business extremely all the powers given in the report from the come of the whole were founded on the supposition that a proportional representation was to prevail in both branches of the legislature when he came here this morning his purpose was to have offered some propositions that might if possible have united a great majority of votes and particularly might provide agst the danger suspected on the part of the smaller states by enumerating the cases in which it might lie and allowing     an equality of votes in such cases  but finding from the preceding vote that they persist in demanding an equal vote in all cases that they have succeeded in obtaining it and that n york if present would probably be on the same side he could not but think we were unprepared to discuss this subject further it will probably be in vain to come to any final decision with a bare majority on either side for these reasons he wished the convention might adjourn that the large states might consider the steps proper to be taken in the present solemn crisis of the business and that the small states might also deliberate on the means of conciliation mr patterson thought with mr r that it was high time for the convention to adjourn that the rule of secrecy ought to be rescinded and that our constituents should be consulted no conciliation could be admissible on the part of the smaller states on any other ground than that of an equality of votes in the  d branch if mr randolph would reduce to form his motion for an adjournment sine die he would second it with all his heart genl pinkney wished to know of mr r whether he meant an adjournment sine die or only an adjournment for the day if the former was meant it differed much from his idea he could not think of going to s carolina and returning again to this place besides it was chimerical to suppose that the states if consulted would ever accord separately and beforehand     mr randolph had never entertained an idea of an adjournment sine die  was sorry that his meaning had been so readily  strangely misinterpreted he had in view merely an adjournment till tomorrow in order that some conciliatory experiment might if possible be devised and that in case the smaller states should continue to hold back the larger might then take such measures he would not say what as might be necessary mr patterson seconded the adjournment till tomorrow as an opportunity seemed to be wished by the larger states to deliberate further on conciliatory expedients on the question for adjourning till tomorrow the states were equally divided mas no cont no n j ay pa ay del no md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo no so it was lost mr broome thought it his duty to declare his opinion agst an adjournment sine die as had been urged by mr patterson such a measure he thought would be fatal something must be done by the convention tho it should be by a bare majority mr gerry observed that masts was opposed to an adjournment because they saw no new ground of compromise but as it seemed to be the opinion of so many states that a trial shd be made the state would now concur in the adjournmt mr rutlidge could see no need of an adjournt because he could see no chance of a compromise the little states were fixt they had repeatedly      solemnly declared themselves to be so all that the large states then had to do was to decide whether they would yield or not for his part he conceived that altho we could not do what we thought best in itself we ought to do something had we not better keep the govt up a little longer hoping that another convention will supply our omissions than abandon every thing to hazard our constituents will be very little satisfied with us if we take the latter course mr randolph  mr king renewed the motion to adjourn till tomorrow on the question mas ay cont no n j ay pa ay del no md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo divd adjourned on the morning following before the hour of the convention a number of the members from the larger states by common agreement met for the purpose of consulting on the proper steps to be taken in consequence of the vote in favor of an equal representation in the  d branch and the apparent inflexibility of the smaller states on that point several members from the latter states also attended the time was wasted in vague conversation on the subject without any specific proposition or agreement it appeared indeed that the opinions of the members who disliked the equality of votes differed much as to the importance of that point and as to the policy of risking a failure of any general act of the convention by inflexibly opposing it several of them     supposing that no good governmt could or would be built on that foundation and that as a division of the convention into two opinions was unavoidable it would be better that the side comprising the principal states and a majority of the people of america should propose a scheme of govt to the states than that a scheme should be proposed on the other side would have concurred in a firm opposition to the smaller states and in a separate recommendation if eventually necessary others seemed inclined to yield to the smaller states and to concur in such an act however imperfect  exceptionable as might be agreed on by the convention as a body tho decided by a bare majority of states and by a minority of the people of the u states it is probable that the result of this consultation satisfied the smaller states that they had nothing to apprehend from a union of the larger in any plan whatever agst the equality of votes in the  d branch tuesday july    in convention mr governr morris moved to reconsider the whole resolution agreed to yesterday concerning the constitution of the   branches of the legislature his object was to bring the house to a consideration in the abstract of the powers necessary to be vested in the general government it had been said let us know how the govt is to be modelled and then we can determine what powers can be properly given to it he thought the most eligible course was first     to determine on the necessary powers and then so to modify the governt as that it might be justly  properly enabled to administer them he feared if we proceeded to a consideration of the powers whilst the vote of yesterday including an equality of the states in the  d branch remained in force a reference to it either mental or expressed would mix itself with the merits of every question concerning the powers—this motion was not seconded it was probably approved by several members who either despaired of success or were apprehensive that the attempt would inflame the jealousies of the smaller states the  th resoln in the report of the come of the whole relating to the powers which had been postponed in order to consider the     th relating to the constitution of the natl legislature was now resumed mr sherman observed that it would be difficult to draw the line between the powers of the genl legislature and those to be left with the states that he did not like the definition contained in the resolution and proposed in place of the words individual legislation line   inclusive to insert to make laws binding on the people of the united states in all cases which may concern the common interests of the union but not to interfere with the government of the individual states in any matters of internal police which respect the govt of such states only and wherein the general welfare of the u states is not concerned     mr wilson  ded the amendment as better expressing the general principle mr govr morris opposed it the internal police as it would be called  understood by the states ought to be infringed in many cases as in the case of paper money  other tricks by which citizens of other states may be affected mr sherman in explanation of his idea read an enumeration of powers including the power of levying taxes on trade but not the power of direct taxation mr govr morris remarked the omission and inferred that for the deficiencies of taxes on consumption it must have been the meaning of mr sherman that the genl govt should recur to quotas  requisitions which are subversive of the idea of govt mr sherman acknowledged that his enumeration did not include direct taxation some provision he supposed must be made for supplying the deficiency of other taxation but he had not formed any on question on mr shermans motion it passed in the negative mas no cont ay n j no pa no del no md ay va no n c no s c no geo no mr bedford moved that the  d member of resolution   be so altered as to read and moreover to legislate in all cases for the general interests of the union and also in those to which the states are severally incompetent or in which the harmony of the u states may be interrupted by the exercise of individual legislation     mr govr morris  ds the motion mr randolph this is a formidable idea indeed it involves the power of violating all the laws and constitutions of the states and of intermeddling with their police the last member of the sentence is also superfluous being included in the first mr bedford it is not more extensive or formidable than the clause as it stands no state being separately competent to legislate for the general interest of the union on question for agreeing to mr bedfords motion it passed in the affirmative mas ay cont no n j ay pa ay del ay md ay va no n c ay s c no geo no on the sentence as amended it passed in the affirmative mas ay cont ay n j ay pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo no the next to negative all laws passed by the several states contravening in the opinion of the nat legislature the articles of union or any treaties subsisting under the authority of ye union mr govr morris opposed this power as likely to be terrible to the states and not necessary if sufficient legislative authority should be given to the genl government mr sherman thought it unnecessary as the courts of the states would not consider as valid any law contravening the authority of the union and which the legislature would wish to be negatived mr l martin considered the power as improper      inadmissible shall all the laws of the states be sent up to the genl legislature before they shall be permitted to operate mr madison considered the negative on the laws of the states as essential to the efficacy  security of the genl govt the necessity of a general govt proceeds from the propensity of the states to pursue their particular interests in opposition to the general interest this propensity will continue to disturb the system unless effectually controuled nothing short of a negative on their laws will controul it they will pass laws which will accomplish their injurious objects before they can be repealed by the genl legislre or be set aside by the national tribunals confidence can not be put in the state tribunals as guardians of the national authority and interests in all the states these are more or less dependt on the legislatures in georgia they are appointed annually by the legislature in r island the judges who refused to execute an unconstitutional law were displaced and others substituted by the legislature who would be the willing instruments of the wicked  arbitrary plans of their masters a power of negativing the improper laws of the states is at once the most mild  certain means of preserving the harmony of the system its utility is sufficiently displayed in the british system nothing could maintain the harmony  subordination of the various parts of the empire but the prerogative by which the crown stifles in the birth every act of every part tending to discord or encroachment it     is true the prerogative is sometimes misapplied thro ignorance or a partiality to one particular part of ye empire but we have not the same reason to fear such misapplications in our system as to the sending all laws up to the natl legisl that might be rendered unnecessary by some emanation of the power into the states so far at least as to give a temporary effect to laws of immediate necessity mr govr morris was more  more opposed to the negative the proposal of it would disgust all the states a law that ought to be negatived will be set aside in the judiciary departmt and if that security should fail may be repealed by a nationl law mr sherman such a power involves a wrong principle to wit that a law of a state contrary to the articles of the union would if not negatived be valid  operative mr pinkney urged the necessity of the negative on the question for agreeing to the power of negativing laws of states c it passed in the negative mas ay ct no n j no pa no del no md no va ay n c ay s c no geo no mr luther martin moved the following resolution that the legislative acts of the u s made by virtue  in pursuance of the articles of union and all treaties made  ratified under the authority of the u s shall be the supreme law of the respective states as far as those acts or treaties shall relate to the said states or their citizens and inhabitants— that the judiciaries of the several states shall be bound thereby in their decisions any thing in the   0 respective laws of the individual states to the contrary notwithstanding which was agreed to nem con  th resol that natl executive consist of a single person agd to nem con to be chosen by the national legisl mr governr morris was pointedly agst his being so chosen he will be the mere creature of the legisl if appointed  impeachable by that body he ought to be elected by the people at large by the freeholders of the country that difficulties attend this mode he admits but they have been found superable in n y  in cont and would he believed be found so in the case of an executive for the u states if the people should elect they will never fail to prefer some man of distinguished character or services some man if he might so speak of continental reputation if the legislature elect it will be the work of intrigue of cabal and of faction it will be like the election of a pope by a conclave of cardinals real merit will rarely be the title to the appointment he moved to strike out national legislature  insert citizens of the u s mr sherman thought that the sense of the nation would be better expressed by the legislature than by the people at large the latter will never be sufficiently informed of characters and besides will never give a majority of votes to any one man they will generally vote for some man in their own state and the largest state will have the best chance for the appointment if the choice be made by the     legislre a majority of voices may be made necessary to constitute an election mr wilson two arguments have been urged agst an election of the executive magistrate by the people   the example of poland where an election of the supreme magistrate is attended with the most dangerous commotions the cases he observed were totally dissimilar the polish nobles have resources  dependants which enable them to appear in force and to threaten the republic as well as each other in the next place the electors all assemble in one place which would not be the case with us the  d argt is that a majority of the people would never concur it might be answered that the concurrence of a majority of the people is not a necessary principle of election nor required as such in any of the states but allowing the objection all its force it may be obviated by the expedient used in massts where the legislature by majority of voices decide in case a majority of people do not concur in favor of one of the candidates this would restrain the choice to a good nomination at least and prevent in a great degree intrigue  cabal a particular objection with him agst an absolute election by the legislre was that the exec in that case would be too dependent to stand the mediator between the intrigues  sinister views of the representatives and the general liberties  interests of the people mr pinkney did not expect this question would again have been brought forward an election by the people being liable to the most obvious  striking     objections they will be led by a few active  designing men the most populous states by combining in favor of the same individual will be able to carry their points the natl legislature being most immediately interested in the laws made by themselves will be most attentive to the choice of a fit man to carry them properly into execution mr govr morris it is said that in case of an election by the people the populous states will combine  elect whom they please just the reverse the people of such states cannot combine if there be any combination it must be among their representatives in the legislature it is said the people will be led by a few designing men this might happen in a small district it can never happen throughout the continent in the election of a govr of n york it sometimes is the case in particular spots that the activity  intrigues of little partizans are successful but the general voice of the state is never influenced by such artifices it is said the multitude will be uninformed it is true they would be uninformed of what passed in the legislative conclave if the election were to be made there but they will not be uninformed of those great  illustrious characters which have merited their esteem  confidence if the executive be chosen by the natl legislature he will not be independent on it and if not independent usurpation  tyranny on the part of the legislature will be the consequence this was the case in england in the last century it has been the case in holland where their senates have engrossed all     power it has been the case every where he was surprised that an election by the people at large should ever have been likened to the polish election of the first magistrate an election by the legislature will bear a real likeness to the election by the diet of poland the great must be the electors in both cases and the corruption  cabal wch are known to characterize the one would soon find their way into the other appointments made by numerous bodies are always worse than those made by single responsible individuals or by the people at large col mason it is curious to remark the different language held at different times at one moment we are told that the legislature is entitled to thorough confidence and to indefinite power at another that it will be governed by intrigue  corruption and cannot be trusted at all but not to dwell on this inconsistency he would observe that a government which is to last ought at least to be practicable would this be the case if the proposed election should be left to the people at large he conceived it would be as unnatural to refer the choice of a proper character for chief magistrate to the people as it would to refer a trial of colours to a blind man the extent of the country renders it impossible that the people can have the requisite capacity to judge of the respective pretensions of the candidates mr wilson could not see the contrariety stated by col mason the legislre might deserve confidence     in some respects and distrust in others in acts which were to affect them  yr constituents precisely alike confidence was due in others jealousy was warranted the appointment to great offices where the legislre might feel many motives not common to the public confidence was surely misplaced this branch of business it was notorious was the most corruptly managed of any that had been committed to legislative bodies mr williamson conceived that there was the same difference between an election in this case by the people and by the legislature as between an appt by lot and by choice there are at present distinguished characters who are known perhaps to almost every man this will not always be the case the people will be sure to vote for some man in their own state and the largest state will be sure to succeed this will not be virga however her slaves will have no suffrage as the salary of the executive will be fixed and he will not be eligible a  d time there will not be such a dependence on the legislature as has been imagined question on an election by the people instead of the legislature which passed in the negative mas no cont no n j no pa ay

provided for—agreed to nem con to be ineligible a second time—mr houston moved to strike out this clause mr sherman  ds the motion mr govr morris espoused the motion the ineligibility proposed by the clause as it stood tended to destroy the great motive to good behavior the hope of being rewarded by a reappointment it was saying to him make hay while the sun shines on the question for striking out as moved by mr houston it passed in the affirmative mas ay cont ay n j ay pa ay del no md ay va no n c no s c no geo ay for the term of   years resumed mr broom was for a shorter term since the executive magistrate was now to be reeligible had he remained ineligible a  d time he should have preferred a longer term docr mcclurg moved  to strike out   years and     insert during good behavior by striking out the words declaring him not reeligible he was put into a situation that would keep him dependent forever on the legislature and he conceived the independence of the executive to be equally essential with that of the judiciary department mr govr morris  ded the motion he expressed great pleasure in hearing it this was the way to get a good government his fear that so valuable an ingredient would not be attained had led him to take the part he had done he was indifferent how the executive should be chosen provided he held his place by this tenure mr broome highly approved the motion it obviated all his difficulties mr sherman considered such a tenure as by no means safe or admissible as the executive magistrate is now reeligible he will be on good behavior as far as will be necessary if he behaves well he will be continued if otherwise displaced on a succeeding election mr madison  if it be essential to the preservation of liberty that the legisl execut  judiciary powers be separate it is essential to a maintenance of the separation that they should be independent of     each other the executive could not be independent of the legislutildere if dependent on the pleasure of that branch for a reappointment why was it determined that the judges should not hold their places by such a tenure because they might be tempted to cultivate the legislature by an undue complaisance and thus render the legislature the virtual expositor as well as the maker of the laws in like manner a dependence of the executive on the legislature would render it the executor as well as the maker of laws  then according to the observation of montesquieu tyrannical laws may be made that they may be executed in a tyrannical manner there was an analogy between the executive  judiciary departments in several respects the latter executed the laws in certain cases as the former did in others the former expounded  applied them for certain purposes as the latter did for others the difference between them seemed to consist chiefly in two circumstances—  the collective interest  security were much more in the power belonging to the executive than to the judiciary department   in the administration of the former much greater latitude is left to opinion and discretion than in the administration of the latter but if the  d consideration proves that it will be more difficult to establish a rule sufficiently precise for trying the execut than the judges  forms an objection to the same tenure of office both considerations prove that it might be more dangerous to suffer a union between the executive  legisl powers     than between the judiciary  legislative powers he conceived it to be absolutely necessary to a well constituted republic that the two first shd be kept distinct  independent of each other whether the plan proposed by the motion was a proper one was another question as it depended on the practicability of instituting a tribunal for impeachmts as certain  as adequate in the one case as in the other on the other hand respect for the mover entitled his proposition to a fair hearing  discussion until a less objectionable expedient should be applied for guarding agst a dangerous union of the legislative  executive departments col mason this motion was made some time ago  negatived by a very large majority he trusted that it wd be again negatived it wd be impossible to define the misbehaviour in such a manner as to subject it to a proper trial and perhaps still more impossible to compel so high an offender holding his office by such a tenure to submit to a trial he considered an executive during good behavior as a softer name only for an executive for life and that the next would be an easy step to hereditary monarchy if the motion should finally succeed he might himself live to see such a revolution if he did not it was probable his children or grand children would he trusted there were few men in that house who wished for it no state he was sure had so far revolted from republican principles as to have the least bias in its favor mr madison was not apprehensive of being thought     to favor any step towards monarchy the real object with him was to prevent its introduction experience had proved a tendency in our governments to throw all power into the legislative vortex the executives of the states are in general little more than cyphers the legislatures omnipotent if no effectual check be devised for restraining the instability  encroachments of the latter a revolution of some kind or other would be inevitable the preservation of republican govt therefore required some expedient for the purpose but required evidently at the same time that in devising it the genuine principles of that form should be kept in view mr govr morris was as little a friend to monarchy as any gentleman he concurred in the opinion that the way to keep out monarchical govt was to establish such a repub govt as wd make the people happy and prevent a desire of change docr mcclurg was not so much afraid of the shadow of monarchy as to be unwilling to approach it nor so wedded to republican govt as not to be sensible of the tyrannies that had been  may be exercised under that form it was an essential object with him to make the executive independent of the legislature and the only mode left for effecting it after the vote destroying his ineligibility a second time was to appoint him during good behavior on the question for inserting during good behavior in place of   years with a reeligibility it passed in the

ghorum wd prefer an appointment by the  d branch to an appointmt by the whole legislature but he thought even that branch too numerous and too little personally responsible to ensure a good choice he suggested that the judges be appointed by the execuve with the advice  consent of the  d branch in the mode prescribed by the constitution of masts this mode had been long practised in that country  was found to answer perfectly well mr wilson still wd prefer an appointmt by the executive but if that could not be attained wd prefer in the next place the mode suggested by mr ghorum he thought it his duty however to move in the first instance that the judges be appointed by the executive mr govr morris  ded the motion mr l martin was strenuous for an appt by the  d branch being taken from all the states it wd be best informed of characters  most capable of making a fit choice mr sherman concurred in the observations of mr     martin adding that the judges ought to be diffused which would be more likely to be attended to by the  d branch than by the executive mr mason the mode of appointing the judges may depend in some degree on the mode of trying impeachments of the executive if the judges were to form a tribunal for that purpose they surely ought not to be appointed by the executive there were insuperable objections besides agst referring the appointment to the executive he mentioned as one that as the seat of govt must be in some one state and as the executive would remain in office for a considerable time for     or   years at least he would insensibly form local  personal attachments within the particular state that would deprive equal merit elsewhere of an equal chance of promotion mr ghorum as the executive will be responsible in point of character at least for a judicious and faithful discharge of his trust he will be careful to look through all the states for proper characters the senators will be as likely to form their attachments at the seat of govt where they reside as the executive if they cannot get the man of the particular state to which they may respectively belong they will be indifferent to the rest public bodies feel no personal responsibility and give full play to intrigue  cabal rh island is a full illustration of the insensibility to character produced by a participation of numbers in dishonorable measures and of the length to which a public body may carry wickedness  cabal     mr govr morris supposed it would be improper for an impeachmt of the executive to be tried before the judges the latter would in such case be drawn into intrigues with the legislature and an impartial trial would be frustrated as they wd be much about the seat of govt they might even be previously consulted  arrangements might be made for a prosecution of the executive he thought therefore that no argument could be drawn from the probability of such a plan of impeachments agst the motion before the house mr madison suggested that the judges might be appointed by the executive with the concurrence of ⅓ at least of the  d branch this would unite the advantage of responsibility in the executive with the security afforded in the  d branch agst any incautious or corrupt nomination by the executive mr sherman was clearly for an election by the senate it would be composed of men nearly equal to the executive and would of course have on the whole more wisdom they would bring into their deliberations a more diffusive knowledge of characters it would be less easy for candidates to intrigue with them than with the executive magistrate for these reasons he thought there would be a better security for a proper choice in the senate than in the executive mr randolph it is true that when the appt of the judges was vested in the  d branch an equality of votes had not been given to it yet he had rather leave the appointmt there than give it to the executive he thought the advantage of personal     responsibility might be gained in the senate by requiring the respective votes of the members to be entered on the journal he thought too that the hope of receiving appts would be more diffusive if they depended on the senate the members of which wd be diffusively known than if they depended on a single man who could not be personally known to a very great extent and consequently that opposition to the system would be so far weakened mr bedford thought there were solid reasons agst leaving the appointment to the executive he must trust more to information than the senate it would put it in his power to gain over the larger states by gratifying them with a preference of their citizens the responsibility of the executive so much talked of was chimerical he could not be punished for mistakes mr ghorum remarked that the senate could have no better information than the executive they must like him trust to information from the members belonging to the particular state where the candidate resided the executive would certainly be more answerable for a good appointment as the whole blame of a bad one would fall on him alone he did not mean that he would be answerable under any other penalty than that of public censure which with honorable minds was a sufficient one on the question for referring the appointment of the judges to the executive instead of the  d branch mas ay cont no pa ay del no md no

good behavior  to receive fixed salaries agreed to nem con in which salaries of judges no increase or diminution shall be made so as to affect the persons at the time in office mr govr morris moved to strike out or increase he thought the legislature ought to be at liberty to increase salaries as circumstances might require and that this would not create any improper dependence in the judges     docr franklin was in favor of the motion money may not only become plentier but the business of the department may increase as the country becomes more populous mr madison the dependence will be less if the increase alone should be permitted but it will be improper even so far to permit a dependence whenever an increase is wished by the judges or may be in agitation in the legislature an undue complaisance in the former may be felt towards the latter if at such a crisis there should be in court suits to which leading members of the legislature may be parties the judges will be in a situation which ought not to be suffered if it can be prevented the variations in the value of money may be guarded agst by taking for a standard wheat or some other thing of permanent value the increase of business will be provided for by an increase of the number who are to do it an increase of salaries may easily be so contrived as not to affect persons in office mr govr morris the value of money may not only alter but the state of society may alter in this event the same quantity of wheat the same value would not be the same compensation the amount of salaries must always be regulated by the manners  the style of living in a country the increase of business can not be provided for in the supreme tribunal in the way that has been mentioned all the business of a certain description whether more or less must be done in that single tribunal additional labor alone in the judges can provide for     additional business additional compensation therefore ought not to be prohibited on the question for striking out or increase mas ay cont ay pa ay del ay md ay va no n c no s c ay geo absent the whole clause as amended was then agreed to nem con    resol that natl

oppositions in the state tribunals with the jurisdiction of which they will interfere mr ghorum there are in the states already federal courts with jurisdiction for trial of piracies c committed on the seas no complaints have been made by the states or the courts of the states inferior tribunals are essential to render the authority of the natl legislature effectual mr randolph observed that the courts of the states can not be trusted with the administration of the national laws the objects of jurisdiction are such as will often place the general  local policy at variance mr govr morris urged also the necessity of such a provision mr sherman was willing to give the power to the legislature but wished them to make use of the state tribunals whenever it could be done with safety to the

ought to be made for preventing an interregnum which must exist in the interval between the adoption of the new govt and the commencement of its operation if the old govt should cease on the first of these events     mr wilson did not entirely approve of the manner in which the clause relating to the engagements of congs was expressed but he thought some provision on the subject would be proper in

the states that of georgia was a very bad one and he hoped would be revised  amended it may also be difficult for the genl govt to decide between contending parties each of which claim the sanction of the constitution mr l martin was for leaving the states to suppress rebellions themselves mr ghorum thought it strange that a rebellion should be known to exist in the empire and the genl govt shd be restrained from interposing to subdue it at this rate an enterprising citizen might erect the standard of monarchy in a particular state might gather together partizans from all quarters might extend his views from state to state and threaten to establish a tyranny over the whole  the genl govt be compelled to remain an inactive witness of its own destruction with regard to different parties in a state as long as they confine their disputes to words they will be harmless to the genl govt  to each other if they appeal to the sword it will then be necessary for the genl govt however difficult it

mr madison seconded the motion mr rutlidge thought it unnecessary to insert any guarantee no doubt could be entertained but that congs had the authority if they had the means to cooperate with any state in subduing a rebellion it was  would be involved in the nature of the thing mr wilson moved as a better expression of the idea that a republican form of governmt shall be guaranteed to each

was returned to me from new york after my arrival in this state i flattered myself that our legislature which convened on monday last would have receded from the resolution therein referd to and have complied with the recommendation of congress in sending deligates to the federal convention the upper house or governor  council embraced the measure but it was negatived in the house of assembly by a large majority notwithstanding the greatest exertions were made to support it being disappointed in their expectations the minority in the administration and all the worthy citizens of this state whose minds are well informd regreting the peculiarities of their situation place their fullest confidence in the wisdom  moderation of the national council and indulge the warmest hopes of being favorably considerd in their deliberations from these deliberations they anticipate a political system which must finally be adopted  from which will result the safety the honour  the happiness of the united states permit me sir to observe that the measures of our present legislature do not exhibit the real character of the state they are equally reprobated  abhored by gentlemen of the learned professions by the whole mercantile body  by most of the respectable farmers and mechanicks the majority of the administration is composed of a licentious number of men destitute of education and many of them void of principle from anarchy and confusion they derive their temporary consequence and this they endeavor to prolong by debauching the minds of the common people whose attention is wholly directed to the abolition of debts both public  private with these are associated the disaffected of every description particularly those who were unfriendly during the war their paper money system founded in oppression  fraud they are determined to support at every hazard and rather than relinquish their favorite pursuit they trample upon the most sacred obligations as a proof of this they refused to comply with a requisition of congress for repealing all laws repugnant to the treaty of peace with great britain and urged as their principal reason that it would be calling in question the propriety of their former measures these evils may be attributed partly to the extreme freedom of our own constitution and partly to the want of energy in the federal union and it is greatly to be apprehended that they cannot speedily be removed but by uncommon and very serious exertions it is fortunate however that the wealth and resources of this state are chiefly in possion of the well

referred to the same committee with great respect  esteem c —dept of state mss miscellaneous letters three weeks later he wrote again charles pinckney sir on my return to this city as i promised i examined carefully all the numerous notes  papers which i had retained relating to the federal convention—among them i found several rough draughts of the constitution i proposed to the convention—although they differed in some measure from each other in the wording  arrangement of the articles—yet they were all substantially the same—they all proceeded upon the idea of throwing out of view the attempt to amend the existing confederation then a very favorite idea of a number  proceeding de novo—of a division of the powers of government into legislative executive  judicial  of making the government to operate directly upon the people  not upon the states my plan was substantially adopted in the sequel except as to the senate  giving more power to the executive than i intended—the force of vote which the small  middling states had in the convention prevented our obtaining a proportional representation in more than one branch  the great powers given to the president were never intended to have been given to him while the convention continued in that patient  coolly deliberative situation in which they had been for nearly the whole of the preceding five months of their session nor was it until within the last week or ten days that almost the whole of the executive department was altered—i can assure you as a fact that for more than four months  a half out of five the power of exclusively making treaties appointing for the ministers  judges of the supreme court was given to the senate after numerous debates  consideration of the subject both in committee of the whole  in the house—this i not only aver but can prove by printed documents in my possession to have been the case— should i ever have the pleasure to see you  converse on the subject will state to you some things relative to this business that may be new  perhaps surprising to you—the veil of secrecy from the proceedings of the convention being removed by congress  but very few of the members alive would make disclosures now of the secrets there acted less improper than before—with the aid of the journal  the numerous notes  memorandums i have preserved should now be in my power to give a view of the almost insuperable difficulties the convention had to encounter  of the conflicting opinions of the members i believe should have attempted it had i not always understood mr madison intended it—he alone i believe possessed  retained more numerous  particular notes of their proceedings than myself i will thank you sir to do me the honour to send me or to get the president to direct a copy of the journal of the convention to be sent me as also of the secret journals of congress should it be considered not improper in me to make the request i have already informed you i have several rough draughts of the constitution i proposed  that they are all substantially the same differing only in words  the arrangement of the articles—at the distance of nearly thirty two years it is impossible for me now to say which of the   or   draughts i have was the one but enclosed i send you the one i believe was it—i repeat however that they are substantially the same differing only in form  unessentials—it may be necessary to remark that very soon after the convention met i changed  avowed candidly the change of my opinion on giving the power to congress to revise the state laws in certain cases  in giving the exclusive power to the senate to declare war thinking it safer to refuse the first altogether  to vest the latter in congress—i will thank you to acknowledge by a line

secretary of state and contained in the journal of the convention published in      on comparing the paper with the constitution in its final form or in some of its stages and with the propositions and speeches of mr pinckney in the convention it would seem that considerable errour must have crept into the paper occasioned possibly by the loss of the document laid before the convention neither that nor the resolutions offered by mr patterson being among the preserved papers and by a consequent resort for a copy to the rough draught in which erasures and interlineations following what passed in the convention might be confounded with the original text and after a lapse of more than thirty years confounded also in the memory of the author there is in the paper a similarity in some cases and an identity in others with details expressions and definitions the results of critical discussions and modifications that can not be ascribed to accident or anticipation examples may be noticed in article viii of the paper which is remarkable also for the circumstance that whilst it specifies the functions of the president no provision is contained in the paper for the election of such an officer nor indeed for the appointment of any executive magistracy notwithstanding the evident purpose of the author to provide an entire plan of a federal government again in several instances where the paper corresponds with the constitution it is at variance with the ideas of m pinckney as decidedly expressed in his propositions and in his arguments the former in the journal of the convention the latter in the report of its debates thus in art viii of the paper provision is made for removing the president by impeachment when it appears that in the convention july  0 he was opposed to any impeachability of the executive magistrate in art iii it is required that all moneybills shall originate in the first branch of the legislature which he strenuously opposed aug   and again aug    in art v members of each house are made ineligible to as well as incapable of holding any office under the union c as was the case at one stage of the constitution a disqualification highly disapproved and opposed by him aug    a still more conclusive evidence of errour in the paper is seen in art iii which provides as the constitution does that the first branch of the legislature shall be chosen by the people of the several states whilst it appears that on the  th of june a few days only after the draft was laid before the convention its author opposed that mode of choice urging  proposing in place of it an election by the legislatures of the several states the remarks here made tho not material in themselves were due to the authenticity and accuracy aimed at in this record of the

knowledge of of any man in the union he has been twice a member of congress and was always thought one of the ablest members that ever sat in that council mr maddison is about    years of age a gentleman of great modesty—with a remarkable sweet temper he is easy and unreserved among his acquaintance and has a most agreeable style of conversation—pierces notes am hist rev iii       this day

jersey is entered as present may   th on may  0 two votes are recorded by madison and in the journal without new jersey it is probable that an error was made in the journal and that madison followed it   rufus king kept a few notes of the proceedings of the convention from may   st to august  th they are meagre but corroborate madisons report see kings life and correspondence of rufus king i     pierce also kept a few rough notes of the proceedings which were printed in the savannah georgian april                      and         and reprinted in the american historical review iii     et seq they throw little additional light on the debates but wherever they do are quoted here as are kings   mr strong would agree to the principle provided it would undergo a certain modification but pointed out nothing—pierces notes am hist rev iii       mrking observed that the question called for was premature and out of order—that unless we go on regularly from one principle to the other we shall draw out our proceedings to an endless length—pierces notes am hist rev iii       butler said that until the number of the senate could be known it would be impossible for him to give a vote on it—pierces notes am hist rev iii       mr butler moved to have the proposition relating to the first branch postponed in order to take up another—which was that the second branch of the legislature consist of blank mr king objected to the postponement for the reasons which he had offered before—pierces notes am hist rev iii       according to pierce mason spoke after sherman and pinckneys motion is given more fully by pierce than by madison mr mason was of opinion that it would be highly improper to draw the senate out of the first branch that it would occasion vacancies which would cost much time trouble and expense to have filled up—besides which it would make the members too dependent on the first branch mr chs pinckney said he meant to propose to divide the continent into four divisions out of which a certain number of persons shd be nominated and out of that nomination to appoint a senate—pierces notes id iii       this question is omitted in the printed journal  the votes applied to the succeeding one instead of the votes as here stated—madisons note   mr rutledge is one of those characters who was highly mounted at the commencement of the late revolution—his reputation in the first congress gave him a distinguished rank among the american worthies he was bred to the law and now acts as one of the chancellors of south carolina this gentleman is much famed in his own state as an orator but in my opinion he is too rapid in his public speaking to be denominated an agreeable orator he is undobotedly a man of abilities and a gentleman of distinction and fortune mr rutledge was once governor of south carolina he is about    years of age—pierces notes amer hist rev iii       according to pierce mr sherman was of opinion that it would be too indefinitely expressed—and yet it would be hard to define all the powers by detail it appeared to him that it would be improper for the national legislature to negative all the laws that were connected with the states themselves mr maddison said it was necessary to adopt some general principles on which we should act—that we were wandering from one thing to another without seeming to be settled in any one principle mr wythe observed that it would be right to establish general principles before we go into detail or very shortly gentlemen would find themselves in confusion and would be obliged to have recurrence to the point from whence they sat out mr king was of opinion that the principles ought first to be established before we proceed to the framing of the act he apprehends that the principles only go so far as to embrace all the power that is given up by the people to the legislature and to the federal government but no farther mr randolph was of opinion that it would be impossible to define the powers and the length to which the federal legislature ought to extend just at this time mr wilson observed that it would be impossible to enumerate the powers which the federal legislature ought to have—pierces notes amer hist rev iii       0   when the convention first opened at philadelphia there were a number of propositions brought forward as great leading principles for the new government to be established for the united states a copy of these propositions was given to each member with an injunction to keep everything a profound secret one morning by accident one of the members dropt his copy of the propositions which being luckily picked up by general mifflin was presented to general washington our president who put it in his pocket after the debates of the day were over and the question for adjournment was called for the general arose from his seat and previous to his putting the question addressed the convention in the following manner—  gentlemen  i am sorry to find that some one member of this body has been so neglectful of the secrets of the convention as to drop in the state house a copy of their proceedings which by accident was picked up and delivered to me this morning i must entreat gentlemen to be more careful lest our transactions get into the news papers and disturb the public repose by premature speculations i know not whose paper it is but there it is throwing it down on the table let him who owns it take it at the same time he bowed picked up his hat and quitted the room with a dignity so severe that every person seemed alarmed for my part i was extremely so for putting my hand in my pocket i missed my copy of the same paper but advancing up to the table my fears soon dissipated i found it to be in the hand writing of another person when i went to my lodgings at the indian queen i found my copy in a coat pocket which i had pulled off that morning it is something remarkable that no person ever owned the paper—pierces notes am hist rev iii       dr franklin is well known to be the greatest phylosopher of the present age—all the operations of nature he seems to understand—the very heavens obey him and the clouds yield up their lightning to be imprisoned in his rod but what claim he has to the politician posterity must determine it is certain that he does not shine much in public council—he is no speaker nor does he seem to let politics engage his attention he is however a most extraordinary man and he tells a story in a style more engaging than anything i ever heard let his biographer finish his character he is    years old and possesses an activity of mind equal to a youth of    years of age—pierces notes amer hist rev iii       according to king madison followed wilson madison agreed with wilson in the definition of executive power ex vi termini executive power does not include the power of war and peace executive power shd be limited and defined if large we shall have the evils of elective monarchies perhaps the best plan will be a single executive of long duration with a council and with liberty to dissent on his personal responsibility—kings life and correspondence of rufus king i     according to pierce mr maddison was of opinion that an executive formed of one man would answer the purpose when aided by a council who should have the right to advise and record their proceedings but not to control his authority—pierces notes am hist rev iii   0   king gives gerrys remarks gerry i am in favor of a council to advise the executive they will be organs of information respecting persons qualified for various offices their opinions may be recorded so as to be liable to be called to account  impeached—in this way their responsibility will be certain and for misconduct their punishment sure dickinson followed gerry dickinson a limited yet vigorous executive is not republican but peculiar to monarchy—the royal executive has vigour not only by power but by popular attachment  report—an equivalent to popular attachment may be derived from the veto on the legislative acts we cannot have a limited monarchy—our condition does not permit it republics are in the beginning and for a time industrious but they finally destroy themselves because they are badly constituted i dread the consolidation of the states  hope for a good national govt from the present division of the states with a feeble executive we are to have a legislature of two branches or two legislatures as the sovereign of the nation—this will work a change unless you provide that the judiciary shall aid and correct the executive the first branch of the legislature the h of representatives must be on another plan the second branch or senate may be on the present scheme of representing the states—the representatives to be apportioned according to the quotas of the states paid into the general treasury the executive to be removed from office by the national legislature on the petition of seven states—kings life and correspondence of rufus king i     et seq   williamson followed wilson according to king williamson—there is no true difference between an executive composed of a single person with a council and an executive composed of three or more persons—kings life and correspondence of rufus king i   0   mr bedford was educated for the bar and in his profession i am told has merit he is a bold and nervous speaker and has a very commanding and striking manner—but he is warm and impetuous in his temper and precipitate in his judgment mr bedford is about    years old and very corpulent—pierces notes am hist rev iii   0   mr williamsonis a gentleman of education and talents he enters freely into public debate from his close attention to most subjects but he is no orator there is a great degree of good humour and pleasantry in his character and in his manners there is a strong trait of the gentleman he is about    years of age—pierces notes amer hist rev iii       new york in the printed journal divided —madisons note   mr dickinson has been famed through all america for his farmers letters he is a scholar and said to be a man of very extensive information when i saw him in the convention i was induced to pay the greatest attention to him whenever he spoke i had often heard that he was a great orator but i found him an indifferent speaker with an affected air of wisdom he labors to produce a trifle—his language is irregular and incorrect—his flourishes for he sometimes attempts them are like expiring flames they just shew themselves and go out—no traces of them are left on the mind to chear or animate it he is however a good writer and will be ever considered one of the most important characters in the united states he is about    years old and was bred a quaker—pierces notes am hist rev iii       according to pierce mr maddison said it was far from being his wish that every executive officer should remain in office without being amenable to some body for his conduct—pierces notes am hist rev iii       in printed journal geo ay —madisons note   mr davey is a lawyer of some eminence in his state he is said to have a good classical education and is a gentleman of considerable literary talents he was silent in the convention but his opinion was always respected mr davy is about  0 years of age—pierces notes id iii       according to pierce king followed wilson mr king was of opinion that the judicial ought not to join in the negative of a law because the judges will have the expounding of those laws when they come before them and they will no doubt stop the operation of such as shall appear repugnant to the constitution—pierces notes am hist rev iii       before the motion according to kings notes madison—the judiciary ought to be introduced in the business of legislation—they will protect their department and united with the executive make its negatives more strong there is weight in the objections to this measure—but a check on the legislature is necessary experience proves it to be so and teaches us that what has been thought a calumny on a republican govt is nevertheless true—in all countries are diversity of interests the rich  the poor the dr  cr the followers of different demagogues the diversity of religious sects—the effects of these divisions in ancient govts are well known and the like causes will now produce like effects we must therefore introduce in our system provisions against the measures of an interested majority—a check is not only necessary to protect the executive power but the minority in the legislature the independence of the executive having the eyes of all upon him will make him an impartial judge—add the judiciary and you greatly increase his respectability after the motion dickinson opposed — you shd separate the departments—you have given the executive a share in legislation and it is asked why not give a share to the judicial power because the judges are to interpret the laws and therefore shd have no share in making them—not so with the executive whose causing the laws to be executed is a ministerial office only besides we have experienced in the br constitution which confers the power of a negative on the executive—kings life and correspondence of rufus king        mr patterson is one of those kind of men whose powers break in upon you and create wonder and astonishment he is a man of great modesty with looks that bespeak talents of no great extent—but he is a classic a lawyer and an orator—and of a disposition so favorable to his advancement that every one seemed ready to exalt him with their praises he is very happy in the choice of time and manner of engaging in a debate and never speaks but when he understands his subject well this gentleman is about    y of age of a very low stature—pierces notes amer hist rev iii       note in madisons writing new jersey omitted in

mr gerry—if the national legislature are appointed by the state legislatures demagogues and corrupt members will creep in—yatess secret debates in forming the constitution  0    my own character i shall not attempt to draw but leave those who may choose to speculate on it to consider it in any light that their fancy or imagination may depict i am conscious of having discharged my duty as a soldier through the course of the late revolution with honor and propriety and my services in congress and the convention were bestowed with the best intention towards the interest of georgia and towards the general welfare of the confederacy i possess ambition and it was that and the flattering opinion which some of my friends had of me that gave me a seat in the wisest council in the world and furnished me with an opportunity of giving these short sketches of the characters who composed it—pierces notes amer hist rev iii       it will throw light on this discussion to remark that an election by the state legislatures involved a surrender of the principle insisted on by the large states  dreaded by the small ones namely that of a proportional representation in the senate such a rule wd make the body too numerous as the smallest state must elect one member at least—madisons note   edward carrington wrote to jefferson from new york june        the debates and proceedings of the convention are kept in profound secrecy—opinions of the probable result of their deliberations can only be formed from the prevailing impressions of men of reflection and understanding—these are reducible to two schemes—the first a consolidation of the whole empire into one republic leaving in the states nothing more than subordinate courts for facilitating the administration of the laws—the second an investiture of the foederal sovereignty with full and independent authority as to the trade revenues and forces of the union and the rights of peace and war together with a negative upon all the acts of the state legislatures the first idea i apprehend would be impracticable and therefore do not suppose it can be adopted—general laws through a country embracing so many climates productions and manners as the united states would operate many oppressions  a general legislature would be found incompetent to the formation of local ones as a majority would in every instance be ignorant of and unaffected by the objects of legislation    something like the second will probably be formed—indeed i am certain that nothing less than what will give the foederal sovereignty a compleat controul over the state governments will be thought worthy of discussion—such a scheme constructed upon well adjusted principles would certainly give us stability and importance as a nation and if the executive powers can be sufficiently checked must be eligible—unless the whole has a decided influence over the parts the constant effort will be to resume the delegated powers and there cannot be an inducement in the foederal sovereignty to refuse its assent to an innocent act of a state    the eastern opinions are for a total surrender of the state sovereignties and indeed some amongst them go to a monarchy at once—they have verged to anarchy while to the southward we have only felt an inconvenience and their proportionate disposition to an opposite extreme is a natural consequence—jeff mss   carried against the motion  0 noes and delaware divided—yates secret proceedings etc     the journal also includes north carolina among the noes—journal of the federal

is now on the point of a favourable turn to the objects of your meeting and being fairly met with the result will i am persuaded eventually embrace it—being calculated for the permanent fitness and not the momentary habits of the country it may at first be viewed with hesitation but derived and patronized as it will be its influence must extend into an adoption as the present fabric gives way—the work once well done will be done forever but patched up in accommodation to the whim of the day it will soon require the hand of the cobbler again and in every unfortunate experiment the materials are rendered the less fit for that monument of civil liberty which we wish to erect—constitute a federal government invigorate  check it well—give it then independent powers over the trade the revenues and force of the union and all things that involve any relationship to foreign powers—give it also the revisal of all state acts—unless it possesses a compleat controul over the state governments the constant effort will be to resume the delegated powers—nor do i see what inducement the federal sovereignty can have to negative an innocent act of a state—constitute it in such shape that its first principles being preserved it will be a good republic—i wish to see that system have a fair experiment—but let the liability to encroachment be rather from the federal than the state governments—in the first case we shall insensibly glide into a monarchy in the latter nothing but anarchy can be the consequence some gentlemen think of a total surrender of the state sovereignty—i see not the necessity of that measure for giving us national stability in consequence—the negative of the federal sovereignty will effectually prevent the existence of any licentious or inconsiderate act—and i believe that even under a new monarchy it would be found necessary thus to continue the local administration—general laws would operate many particular undecipherable and a general legislature would be found incompetent to the formation of local ones—the interest of the united states may be well combined for the common good—but the affairs of so extensive a country are not to be thrown into one mass—an attempt to confederate upon terms materially opposed to the particular interests would in all probability occasion a dismemberment and in that event within a long time yet to come the prospects of commerce will be at an end as to any degree of national importance let her fate be what it may as to freedom or vassalage—mad mss   according to the journal     pennsylvania was among the noes   mr lansing is a practising attorney at albany and mayor of that corporation he has a hisitation in his speech that will prevent his being an orator of any eminence—his legal knowledge i am told is not extensive nor his education a good one he is however a man of good sense plain in his manners and sincere in his friendships he is about    years of age—pierces notes am hist rev iii       this plan had been concerted among the deputations or members thereof from cont n y n j del and perhaps mr martin from maryd who made with them a common cause though on different principles cont  n y were agst a departure from the principle of the confederation wishing rather to add a few new powers to congs than to substitute a national govt the states of n j  del were opposed to a national govt because its patrons considered a proportional representation of the states as the basis of it the eagerness displayed by the members opposed to a natl govt from these different motives began now to produce serious anxiety for the result of the convention mr dickenson said to mr madison you see the consequence of pushing things too far some of the members from the small states wish for two branches in the general legislature and are friends to a good national government but we would sooner submit to foreign power than submit to be deprived of an equality of suffrage in both branches of the legislature and thereby be thrown under the domination of the large states—madison note mr madison moved for the report of the committee and the question may then come on whether the convention will postpone it in order to take into consideration the system now offered mr lansing is of opinion that the two systems are fairly contrasted the one now offered is on the basis of amending the federal government and the other to be reported as a national government on propositions which exclude the propriety of amendment considering therefore its importance and that justice may be done to its weighty consideration he is for postponing it a day col hamilton cannot say he is in sentiment with either plan—supposes both might again be considered as federal plans and by this means they will be fairly in committee and be contrasted so as to make a comparative estimate of the two—yates secret proceedings etc           this copy of mr pattersons propositions varies in a few clauses from that in the printed journal furnished from the papers of mr brearley a colleague of mr patterson a confidence is felt notwithstanding in its accuracy that the copy in the journal is not entirely correct is shewn by the ensuing speech of mr wilson june    in which he refers to the mode of removing the executive by impeachment  conviction as a feature in the virga plan forming one of its contrasts to that of mr patterson which proposed a removal on the application of a majority of the executives of the states in the copy printed in the journal the two modes are combined in the same clause whether through inadvertence or as a contemplated amendment does not appear—madisons note the journal contains   resolved that the legislative executive and judiciary powers within the several states ought to be bound by oath to support the articles of union and   resolved that provision ought to be made for hearing and deciding upon all disputes arising between the united states and an individual state respecting territory—journal of the federal convention       yates states it was c c pinckney who said this—secret proceedings etc       hamilton happened to call upon madison while

these or a majority of them shall have assembled according to such notice they shall by joint ballot by plurality of votes elect a president of the united states and the constitution thus organized shall be carried into effect —mad mss col hamilton did not propose in the convention any plan of a constitution he had sketched an outline which he read as part of a speech observing that he did not mean it as a proposition but only to give a more correct view of his ideas mr patterson regularly proposed a plan which was discussed  voted on—madison to john quincy adams montpellier nov        dept of state mss miscellaneous letters  quere  to provide for distant states—note in madisons hand   this was the last session of the convention in committee of the whole   mr dickinson supposed that there were good regulations in both let us therefore contrast the one with the other and consolidate such parts of them as the committee approve—yates secret proceedings etc   0   king in his notes gives a résumé of his speech it illustrates the accuracy of madisons reporting answer r king the states under the confed are not sovereign states they can do no act but such as are of a subordinate nature or such as terminate in themselves—and even these are restrained—coinage p office c they are wholly incompetent to the exercise of any of the gt  distinguishing acts of sovereignty—they can neither make nor receive embassies to or from any other sovereign—they have not the powers of injuring another or of defending themselves from an injury offered from one another—they are deaf dumb and impotent—these faculties are yielded up and the u s in c assd hold and possess them and they alone can exercise them—they are so far out of the controul of the separate states yt if every state in the union was to instruct yr deleg and those delegates within ye powers of the arts of union shd do an act in violation of their instructions it wd nevertheless be valid if they declared a war any giving aid or comfort to the enemy wd be treason if peace any capture on the high seas wd be piracy this remark proves yt the states are now subordinate corporations or societies and not sovereigns—these imperfect states are the confederates and they are the electors of the magistrates who exercise the national sovereignty the articles of confedr and perpetual union are partly federal  partly of the nature of a constitution or form of govt arising from and applying to the citizens of the u s  not from the individual states the only criterion of determining what is federal  what is national is this those acts which are for the government of the states only are purely federal those which are for the government of the citizens of the individual states are national and not federal if then the articles of confedr  perpetual union have this twofold capacity and if they provide for an alteration in a certain mode why may not they be so altered as that the federal article may be changed to a national one and the national to a federal i see no argument that can be objected to the authority the  th article regulates the influence of the several states and makes them equal—does not the confed authorize this alteration that instead of this equality one state may have double the influence of another—i conceive it does—and so of every article except that wh destroys the idea of a confedy i think it may be proved that every article may be totally altered provided you have one guarantying to each state the right of regulating its private  internal affairs in the manner of a subordinate corporation but admitting that the arts of confed  perpet union or the powers of the legis did not extend to the proposed reform yet the public deputations  the public danger require it—the system proposed to be adopted is no scheme of a day calculated to postpone the hour of danger  thus leave it to fall with double ruin on our successors—it is no crude and undigested plan the child of narrow and unextensive views brought forward under the auspices of cowardice  irresolution—it is a measure of decision it is the foundation of freedom  of national glory it will draw on itself and be able to support the severest scrutiny  examination it is no idle experiment no romantic speculation—the measure forces itself upon wise men and if they have not firmness to look it in the face and protect it—farewell to the freedom of our government—our military glory will be tarnished and our boasts of freedom will be the scorn of the enemies of liberty—life and correspondence of rufus king i  0  n   mr martin was educated for the bar and is attorney general for the state of maryland this gentleman possesses a good deal of information but he has a very bad delivery and so extremely prolix that he never speaks without tiring the patience of all who hear him he is about    years of age—pierces notes am hist rev iii   0   from june    to july    inclusive not copied by mr eppes—madisons note this applies evidently to notes he permitted hon george w eppes jeffersons soninlaw to take   dr johnson is a character much celebrated for his legal knowledge he is said to be one of the first classics in america and certainly possesses a very strong and enlightened understanding as an orator in my opinion there is nothing in him that warrants the high reputation which he has for public speaking there is something in the tone of his voice not pleasing to the ear—but he is eloquent and clear—always abounding with information and instruction he was once employed as an agent for the state of connecticut to state her claims to certain landed territory before the british house of commons this office he discharged with so much dignity and made such an ingenious display of his powers that he laid the foundation of a reputation which will probably last much longer than his own life dr johnson is about sixty years of age posseses the manners of a gentleman and engages the hearts of men by the sweetness of his temper and that affectionate style of address with which he accosts his acquaintance—pierces notes am hist rev iii       after martins second according to yates mr madison i oppose the motion—there are no difficulties but they may be obviated in the details connected with the subject—yates secret proceedings etc       mr strong is a lawyer of some eminence—he has received a liberal education and has good connections to recommend him as a speaker he is feeble and without confidence this gentn is about thirty five years of age and greatly in the esteem of his colleagues—pierces notes amer hist rev iii       m gorham is a merchant in boston high in reputation and much in the esteem of his countrymen he is a man of very good sense but not much improved in his education he is eloquent and easy in public debate but has nothing fashionable or elegant in his style—all he aims at is to convince and where he fails it never is from his auditory not understanding him for no man is more perspicuous and full he has been president of congress and three years a member of that body mr gorham is about    years of age rather lusty and has an agreeable and pleasing manner—pierces notes am hist rev iii       according to yates wilson followed ellsworth mr wilson i am not for submitting the national government to the approbation of the state legislatures i know that they and the state officers will oppose it i am for carrying it to the people of each state—yates secret proceedings etc       it appeared that massts concurred not because they thought the state treasy ought to be substituted but because they thought nothing should be said on the subject in which case it wd silently devolve on the natl treasury to support the national legislature—madisons note   according to yates madison followed wilson mr madison some gentlemen give too much weight and others too little to this subject if you have no exclusive clause there may be danger of creating offices or augmenting the stipends of those already created in order to gratify some members if they were not excluded such an instance has fallen within my own observation i am therefore of opinion that no office ought to be open to a member which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature—yates secret proceedings etc     yates gives the rest of the debate as follows mr mason it seems as if it was taken for granted that all offices will be filled by the executive while i think many will remain in the gift of the legislature in either case it is necessary to shut the door against corruption if otherwise they may make or multiply offices in order to fill them are gentlemen in earnest when they suppose that this exclusion will prevent the first characters from coming forward are we not struck at seeing the luxury and venality which has already crept in among us if not checked we shall have ambassadors to every petty state in europe—the little republic of st marino not excepted we must in the present system remove the temptation i admire many parts of the british constitution and government but i detest their corruption—why has the power of the crown so remarkably increased the last century a stranger by reading their laws would suppose it considerably diminished and yet by the sole power of appointing the increased officers of government corruption pervades every town and village in the kingdom if such a restriction should abridge the right of election it is still necessary as it will prevent the people from ruining themselves and will not the same causes here produce the same effects i consider this clause as the cornerstone on which our liberties depend—and if we strike it out we are erecting a fabric for our destruction mr gorham the corruption of the english government cannot be applied to america this evil exists there in the venality of their boroughs but even this corruption has its advantage as it gives stability to their government we do not know what the effect would be if members of parliament were excluded from offices the great bulwark of our liberty is the frequency of elections and the great danger is the septennial parliaments mr hamilton in all general questions which become the subjects of discussion there are always some truths mixed with falsehoods i confess there is danger where men are capable of holding two offices take mankind in general they are vicious—their passions may be operated upon we have been taught to reprobate the danger of influence in the british government without duly reflecting how far it was necessary to support a good government we have taken up many ideas on trust and at last pleased with their own opinions establish them as undoubted truths humes opinion of the british constitution confirms the remark that there is always a body of firm patriots who often shake a corrupt administration take mankind as they are and what are they governed by their passions there may be in every government a few choice spirits who may act from more worthy motives one great error is that we suppose mankind more honest than they are our prevailing passions are ambition and interest and it will ever be the duty of a wise government to avail itself of those passions in order to make them subservient to the public good—for these ever induce us to action perhaps a few men in a state may from patriotic motives or to display their talents or to reap the advantage of public applause step forward but if we adopt the clause we destroy the motive i am therefore against all exclusions and refinements except only in this case that when a member takes his seat he should vacate every other office it is difficult to put any exclusive regulation into effect we must in some degree submit to the inconvenience—yates secret proceedings etc           according to yates wilson followed pinckney mr wilson i perceive that some gentlemen are of opinion to give a bias in favor of state governments this question ought to stand on the same footing—yates secret proceedings etc       mr martin was lately governor of north carolina which office he filled with credit he is a man of sense and undoubtedly is a good politician but he is not formed to shine in public debate being no speaker mr martin was once a colonel in the american army but proved unfit for the field he is about  0 years of age—pierces notes am hist rev iii       yates gives masons speech more fully and a speech by madison omitted here mr mason i differ from my colleague in his proposed amendment let me state the practice in the state where we came from there all officers are appointed by the legislature need i add that many of their appointments are most shameful nor will the check proposed by this amendment be sufficient it will soon cease to be any check at all it is asserted that it will be very difficult to find men sufficiently qualified as legislators without the inducement of emolument i do believe that men of genius will be deterred unless possessed of great virtues we may well dispense with the first characters when destitute of virtue—i should wish them never to come forward—but if we do not provide against corruption our government will soon be at an end nor would i wish to put a man of virtue in the way of temptation evasions and caballing would evade the amendment nor would the danger be less if the executive has the appointment of officers the first three or four years we might go on well enough but what would be the case afterwards i will add that such a government ought to be refused by the people—and it will be refused mr madison my wish is that the national legislature be as uncorrupt as possible i believe all public bodies are inclined from various motives to support its members but it is not always done from the base motives of venality friendship and a knowledge of the abilities of those with whom they associate may produce it if you bar the door against such attachments you deprive the government of its greatest strength and support can you always rely on the patriotism of the members if this be the only inducement you will find a great indifferency in filling your legislative body if we expect to call forth useful characters we must hold out allurements nor can any great inconveniency arise from such inducements the legislative body must be the road to public honor and the advantage will be greater to adopt my motion than any possible inconvenience—yates secret proceedings etc       yates gives gerrys remarks this amendment is of great weight and its consequences ought to be well considered at the beginning of the war we possessed more than roman virtue it appears to me it is now the reverse we have more land and stockjobbers than any place on earth it appears to me that we have constantly endeavored to keep distinct the three great branches of government but if we agree to this motion it must be destroyed by admitting the legislators to share in the executive or to be too much influenced by the executive in looking up to them for offices—yates secret proceedings etc   0   pinckney furnished madison with a copy of this speech which he transcribed but apparently not with the whole of it as madisons note at the end indicates the original pinckney draft is among the madison papers and shows madisons copying to have been accurate   the residue of this speech was not furnished like the above by mr pinckney—madisons note yates report of the speech is meagre the closing paragraph apparently the part lacking in madisons report is while we were dependent on the crown of great britain it was in contemplation to form the whole into one but it was found impracticable no legislature could make good laws for the whole nor can it now be done it would necessarily place the power in the hands of the few nearest the seat of government state governments must therefore remain if you mean to prevent confusion the general negative powers will support the general government upon these considerations i am led to form the second branch differently from the report these powers are important and the number not too large upon the principle of proportion i have considered the subject with great attention and i propose this plan reads it and if no better plan is proposed i will then move its adoption—yates secret proceedings etc       madisons note it must be kept in view that the largest states particularly pennsylvania  virginia always considered the choice of the  d branch by the state legislatures as opposed to a proportional representation to which they were attached as a fundamental principle of just government the smaller states who had opposite views were reinforced by the members from the large states most anxious to secure the importance of the state governments   according to yates madison followed pinckney mr madison we are proceeding in the same manner that was done when the confederation was first formed its original draft was excellent but in its progress and completion it became so insufficient as to give rise to the present convention by the vote already taken will not the temper of the state legislatures transfuse itself into the senate do we create a free government—yates secret proceedings etc       yates has the question on five years but this is obviously a mistake—yates secret proceedings etc       quer whether connecticut should not be no  delaware ay—madisons note   cap dayton is a young gentleman of talents with ambition to exert them he possesses a good education and some reading he speaks well and seems desirous of improving himself in oratory there is an impetuosity in his temper that is injurious to him but there is an honest rectitude about him that makes him a valuable member of society and secures to him the esteem of all good men he is about  0 years old served with me a brother aid to general sullivan in the western expedition of   —pierces notes am hist rev iii       according to yates before wilson spoke mr madison congress heretofore depended on state interests we are now going to pursue the same plan—yates secret proceedings etc       after wilson according to yates mr butler this second branch i consider as the aristocratic part of our government and they must be controlled by the states or they will be too independent—yates secret proceedings etc       mr martin the attorneygeneral from maryland spoke on this subject upwards of three hours as his arguments were too diffuse and in many instances desultory it was not possible to trace him through the whole or to methodize his ideas into a systematic or argumentative arrangement—yates secret proceedings etc       yates gives martins speech more fully on federal grounds it is said that a minority will govern a majority—but on the virginia plan a minority would tax a majority in a federal government a majority of states must and ought to tax in the local government of states counties may be unequal—still numbers not property govern what is the government now forming over states or persons as to the latter their rights cannot be the object of a general government these are already secured by their guardians the state governments the general government is therefore intended only to protect and guard the rights of the states as states this general government i believe is the first upon earth which gives checks against democracies or aristocracies the only necessary check in a general government ought to be a restraint to prevent its absorbing the powers of the state governments representation on federal principles can only flow from state societies representation and taxation are ever inseparable—not according to the quantum of property but the quantum of freedom will the representatives of a state forget state interests the mode of election cannot change it these prejudices cannot be eradicated—your general government cannot be just or equal upon the virginia plan unless you abolish state interests if this cannot be done you must go back to principles purely federal on this latter ground the state legislatures and their constituents will have no interests to pursue different from the general government and both will be interested to support each other under these ideas can it be expected that the people can approve the virginia plan but it is said the people not the state legislatures will be called upon for approbation—with an evident design to separate the interests of the governors from the governed what must be the consequence anarchy and confusion we lose the ideas of the powers with which we are intrusted the legislatures must approve by them it must on your own plan be laid before the people how will such a government over so many great states operate wherever new settlements have been formed in large states they immediately want to shake off their independency why because the government is too remote for their good the people want it nearer home the basis of all ancient and modern confederacies is the freedom and the independency of the states composing it the states forming the amphictionic council were equal though lacedemon one of the greatest states attempted the exclusion of three of the lesser states from this right the plan reported it is true only intends to diminish those rights not to annihilate them—it was the ambition and power of the great grecian states which at last ruined this respectable council the states as societies are ever respectful has holland or switzerland ever complained of the equality of the states which compose their respective confederacies bern and zurich are larger than the remaining eleven cantons—so of many of the states of germany and yet their governments are not complained of bern alone might usurp the whole power of the helvetic confederacy but she is contented still with being equal the admission of the larger states into the confederation on the principle of equality is dangerous—but on the virginia system it is ruinous and destructive still it is the true interest of all the states to confederate—it is their joint efforts which must protect and secure us from foreign danger and give us peace and harmony at home here mr martin entered into a detail of the comparative powers of each state and stated their probable weakness and strength at the beginning of our troubles with great britain the smaller states were attempted to be cajoled to submit to the views of that nation lest the larger states should usurp their rights we then answered them—your present plan is slavery which on the remote prospect of a distant evil we will not submit to i would rather confederate with any single state than submit to the virginia plan but we are already confederated and no power on earth can dissolve it but by the consent of all the contracting powers—and four states on this floor have already declared their opposition to annihilate it is the old confederation dissolved because some of the states wish a new confederation—yates secret proceedings etc       according to kings notes charles pinckney spoke after madison charles pinckney the honors  offices may become the objects of strong desire and of combination to acquire them if representatives be apportioned among the states in the ratio of numbers the citizens will be free and equal but the states will be unequal and their sovereignty will be degraded—kings life and correspondence of rufus king i   0   according to yates madison followed sherman mr madison there is danger in the idea of the gentleman from connecticut unjust representation will ever produce it in the united netherlands holland governs the whole although she has only one vote the counties in virginia are exceedingly disproportionate and yet the smaller has

according to yates after baldwin spoke mr madison i would always exclude inconsistent principles in framing a system of government the difficulty of getting its defects amended are great and sometimes insurmountable the virginia state government was the first which was made and though its defects are evident to every person we cannot get it amended the dutch have made four several attempts to amend their system without success the few alterations made in it were by tumult and faction and for the worse if there was real danger i would give the smaller states the defensive weapons—but there is none from that quarter the great danger to our general government is the great southern and northern interests of the continent being opposed to each other look to the votes in congress and most of them stand divided by the geography of the country not according to the size of the states suppose the first branch granted money may not the second branch from state views counteract the first in congress the single state of delaware prevented an embargo at the time that all the other states thought it absolutely necessary for the support of the army other powers and those very essential besides the legislative will be given to the second branch—such as the negativing all state laws i would compromise on this question if i could do it on correct principles but otherwise not—if the old fabric of the confederation must be the groundwork of the new we must fall—yates secret proceedings etc       he had just returned from n y havg left ye convention a few days after it commenced business—madisons note   tuesday july        the grand committee met mr gerry was chosen chairman the committee proceeded to consider in what manner they should discharge the business with which they were intrusted by the proceedings in the convention they were so equally divided on the important question of representation in the two branches that the idea of a conciliatory adjustment must have been in contemplation of the house in the appointment of this committee but still how to effect this salutory purpose was the question many of the members impressed with the utility of a general government connected with it the indispensable necessity of a representation from the states according to their numbers and wealth while others equally tenacious of the rights of the states would admit of no other representation but such as was strictly federal or in other words equality of suffrage this brought on a discussion of the principles on which the house had divided and a lengthy recapitulation of the arguments advanced in the house in support of these opposite propositions as i had not openly explained my sentiments on any former occasion on this question but constantly in giving my vote showed my attachment to the national government on federal principles i took this occasion to explain my motives these remarks gave rise to a motion of dr franklin which after some modification was agreed to and made the basis of the following report of the committee—yates secret proceedings etc  0  the report is given by madison hamilton who had gone to new york wrote to washington under date of july  d in my passage through the jerseys and since my arrival here i have taken particular pains to discover the public sentiment and i am more and more convinced that this is the critical opportunity for establishing the prosperity of this country on a solid foundation i have conversed with men of information not only in this city but from different parts of the state and they agree that there has been an astonishing revolution for the better in the minds of the people the prevailing apprehension among thinking men is that the convention from the fear of shocking the popular opinion will not go far enough they seem to be convinced that a strong wellmounted government will better suit the popular palate than one of a different complexion men in office are indeed taking all possible pains to give an unfavorable impression of the convention but the current seems to be moving strongly the other way a plain but sensible man in a conversation i had with him yesterday expressed himself nearly in this manner the people begin to be convinced that their excellent form of government as they have been used to call it will not answer their purpose and that they must substitute something not very remote from that which they have lately quitted these appearances though they will not warrant a conclusion that the people are yet ripe for such a plan as i advocate yet serve to prove that there is no reason to despair of their adopting one equally energetic if the convention should think proper to propose it they serve to prove that we ought not to allow too much weight to objections drawn from the supposed repugnance of the people to an efficient constitution i confess i am more and more inclined to believe that former habits of thinking are regaining their influence with more rapidity than is generally imagined not having compared ideas with you sir i cannot judge how far our sentiments agree but as i persuade myself the genuineness of my representations will receive credit with you my anxiety for the event of the deliberations of the convention induces me to make this communication of what appears to be the tendency of the public mind i own to you sir that i am seriously and deeply distressed at the aspect of the counsels which prevailed when i left philadelphia i fear we shall let slip the golden opportunity of rescuing the american empire from disunion anarchy and misery no motley or feeble measure can answer the end or will finally receive the public support decision is true wisdom and will not be less reputable to the convention than salutary to the community i shall of necessity remain here ten or twelve days if i have reason to believe that my attendance at philadelphia will not be mere waste of time i shall after that period rejoin the convention—hamiltons works lodge   this report was founded on a motion in the com̃itte made by dr franklin it was barely acquiesced in by the members from the states opposed to an equity of votes in the  d branch and was evidently considered by the members on the other side as a gaining of their point a motion was made by mr sherman he acted in the place of mr elseworth who was kept away by indisposition in the committee to the following effect that each state should have an equal vote in the  d branch provided that no decision therein should prevail unless the majority of states concurring should also comprise a majority of the inhabitants of the u states this motion was not much deliberated on nor approved in the committee a similar proviso had been proposed in the debates on the articles of confederation in      to the articles giving certain powers to nine states see journals of congs for      p    —madison note   yates and his colleague

three speeches of gerry madison and patterson as follows gerry i agree to the measure provided that the first br h of reps shall originate money bills and money appropriations the prejudices as well as the interest of our constituents must be regarded—two or three thousand men are in office in the states—their influence will be in favor of an equality of votes among the states madison equality in the senate will enable a minority to hold a majority and to oblige them to submit to their interests or they will withdraw their assent to measures essential and necessary to the general good i have known one man when the state was represented by only two and they were divided oppose six states in congress on an important occasion for three days and finally compel them to gratify his caprice in order to obtain his suffrage the senate will possess certain exclusive powers such as the appointments to office if the states have equal votes a minority of people will appoint the great offices besides the small states may be near the seat of govt—a bare quorum of the h of r may be easily assembled and carry a bill against the sense of a majority if all were present and the senate tho all were present might confirm such bill virginia has objected to every addition of the powers of congress because she has only     of the power when she ought to have one sixth paterson i hope the question will be taken if we do not give equal votes in the senate to the states the small states agreeing that money bills and appropriations shall originate in the h of reps elected according to numbers it must not be expected that the small states will agree to the amendments of the confederation let us decide this question and lose no more time i think that i shall vote against the provision because i think that the exclusive originating of money bills  appropriations by the h of reps is giving up too much on the part of the small states—kings life and correspondence of rufus

of opinion as a number in the affirmative probably had it chiefly in view to alarm those attached to a dependence of the executive on the legislature  thereby facilitate some final arrangement of a contrary tendency the avowed friends of an executive during good behaviour were not more than three or four nor is it certain they would finally have adhered to such a tenure an independence of the three great departments of each other as far as possible and the responsibility of all to the will of the community seemed to be generally admitted as the true basis of a well constructed
