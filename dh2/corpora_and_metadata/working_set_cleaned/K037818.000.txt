of the most industrious men in the whole village his cottage which was his own and partly built by his own hands stands on the common about a stones cast from the road near the great oak tree in the parish of kings charleton in somersetshire the lord of the manor having granted him leave to enclose a bit of the common for a garden my father had got a thriving young orchard and a long strip of potatoes besides his cottage all the produce of his own industry it used to be a favorite saying with him that no man to whom god had given two hands had ever need to want for my part says he i never knew what want was when i am sick the club supports me and when i am well i warrant i will support myself my mother besides being equally industrious was much more religious and therefore much happier she was as good and as sweettempered a woman as any in the world be the next where she will for constancy at her place of worship civility to her neighbors cleanliness in her own person her house and her children she had not her fellow but the most remarkable thing in her i am afraid a very uncommon thing was her steady and uninterrupted practice of family prayer it must have been a hard days work indeed that hindered her from her prayers at six in the morning and eight in the evening as regularly as ever the hour came she always knelt down with her children round her four of us and read with great solemnity and devotion a short form given her by the clergyman which concluded with the lords prayer in which we all joined and she used to say after she had finished  now i can go to bed or to work in peace for now we may hope god will protect us i am sorry to say my father seldom joined with us he used to pretend he was busy or tired and yet it would not have detained him long neither for we were never more than six minutes about it and surely twelve minutes a day six in the morning and six in the evening is no great time to give to god one thing has often struck me that if any thing went wrong and ruffled my dear mothers temper or made her uneasy the prayers seemed to set it all to rights when she had been to prayers all her grief seemed to be sled away and indeed i observed the same thing with respect to my father if he ever did join with us it always seemed somehow to compose and sweeten his mind and make him a great deal kinder to my mother and us  as my father and mother were very industrious themselves they were very desirous to make their children so every child was employed as soon as he was able in something or other at about thirteen years of age my employment had been for some time to weed in the parsons garden and run of errands for him at fourteen he took me into his house and not a little proud was i at obtaining the title of his little footman the morning i left my fathers cottage my dear mother who was as kind as she was good appeared to be very much affected she said she could not commit me to the wide world without first committing me to god who governed it and then she knelt down with me by her side and prayed gracious lord be pleased to have mercy on my dear boy  the care i commend him guard him i beseech thee in the many temptations which he is now beginning to encounter may he with solid pity and honest diligence do his duty in that state of life in which it has pleased thee to place him she then gave me her blessing put a testament into my pocket bid me fear god and always act for my master as i would do for myself  in my new situation there were to be sure some few things disagreeable my mistress was peevish and fretful the cook violent and passionate but what service is there or indeed what situation in life howsoever much above servitude in which there is not something unpleasant every state has it is trials servants have theirs but if they cannot learn to put up with some little inconveniences they may change their places every year of their lives and never be satisfied after all this is a lesson i have learnt by long experience  though by gods blessing i had received a more religious education than most children it yet soon appeared that i had many faults which it was necessary for me to be corrected of before i could become a good servant at first when i was sent upon an errand i was much given to loitering i was then too young to consider that by loitering in errands i was wasting what was not my own my masters time besides this fault as every thing which i saw and heard in my masters house was such as i had never seen and heard before i was too apt to talk of it to my old playfellows or at the village shop but as soon as ever i became a little older i began to reflect that this was very wrong one sunday evening when i had leave to go home to see my parents i was beginning to te my mother how there had been a great uproar a the parsonage the day before about  here she put her hand upon my lips and said charles no a word more of what has passed at the parsonage whatsoever happens in your masters house is never to be spoken of out of your masters doors a tale bearing servant is always an unfaithful servant he betrays the trust which his master puts in him  my mothers vehemence surprised me a little but it made so much impression upon me that i was pretty well broken of the fault from that very time into how many scrapes has this talkative temper brought many servants of my acquaintance there was poor nic jarrett the squires under footman that lost his place a new suit of black broad cloth and a legacy of five pounds which he would soon have had by reason of his masters death only for saying at a neighbors house that his mistress sometimes fell asleep while the squire was reading to the family on a sunday night  nic and i were at one time rather too intimate i remember one day when i was about sixteen having attended my master to the squires house nic prevailed on me after dinner to play with him at pitch and toss i was worth at that time five shillings and twopence more money than i had ever possessed before in my life in about two hours nic reduced me to my last shilling but though it was a heavy stroke at the time yet it proved in the end a happy event for by my mothers persuasions i resolved thence forward never to game again as long as i lived which resolution by gods grace i have hitherto happily kept i wish from my heart that all other servants would resolve the same the practice of cardplaying so common amongst servants in large families is the worst custom they can possibly fall into my poor brother tom suffered enough for it one day having received in the morning a quarters wages he lost the whole of it before night at allfours and what was the consequence why from that very time he took to those practices of cheating his master which ended  his ruin  servants if instead of wasting their leisure in card playing they would amuse themselves in reading some godly book or improve themselves in writing or cyphering it was by this means for i was never taught to write that i qualified myself for the place of bailiff which i now fill  i remember nic used to say whilst my master plays cards in the parlour why should thou be so squeamish as not to play in the kitchen but nic did not consider that his master being rich and playing for small sums his losses laid him under no temptation of dishonesty in order to repair them besides the squire could read and write at any time whereas this was our only leisure time and if we did not improve ourselves then we never could what might be comparatively innocent in him might be ruinous to us and even if my master be a professed gambler that is no reason i should be so too a servant is to do what is right let his master do what he will if a master swears and gets drunk and talks at table with indecency or against god and religion to god he must account for it and a sorry account it will be i doubt but his example will not excuse our crimes though it will aggravate his we must take care of our own souls whether our masters take care of theirs or not  but to return to my history i am ashamed to say that i was guilty more than once in the earlier part of my servitude of the shocking and detestable crime of lying in order to excuse or screen my faults happily i was cured of it in the following manner having been one day ordered to carry a bottle of wine to a sick man one of my masters parishioners i accidentally broke the bottle and o course lost the wine what was to be done should i confess my misfortune and acknowledge my carelessness or conceal it by a lie after same delibe made up my story how the poor man sent his duty to my master and thanked him a thousand times and that he was a little better and that his wife said she thought this wine would save his life being thus prepared as i was returning home i met a pedlar of whom i bought for a penny a little book containing a story of a woman at devizes who was struck dead on the spot for telling a lie to be sure it was heaven that sent the pedlar to me to save me from the sin i was going to commit if this woman was struck dead for a lie said i to myself why may not i i therefore went directly home and made a confession of my negligence and misfortune and it was well for me i did for the sick man whose duty and thanks i had wickedly intended to carry to my master was dead as i understood afterward three hours before the bottle was broken from this time therefore i began to see what i am now fully convinced of that beside the sinfulness of lying it was always more for the interest and lasting comfort of servants to confess the truth at once than to conceal a fault by falsehood when a servant has told a lie he is always in danger of it is being found out and sooner or later it generally is found out and then his character is ruined whereas if he confesses the truth at once he probably escapes without any anger at all or at worst it is soon over and the fault itself is forgotten  having now lived seven years at the parsonage and being twentyone years of age my master called me one day into his study where he spent a good deal of his time and said to me charles you have lived with me a considerable time and it has been always with much pleasure that i have remarked the decency sobriety and diligence of your conduct those few faults which you have farther experience and more years will i doubt not cure you are now qualified for a better place than mine and are entitled to higher wages than it is in my power to give i have therefore recommended you to a friend of mine in london for which place you are to set out if you approve it in a month but i should think it a crime to dismiss you to a situation so full of temptations without giving you some little advice listen therefore my dear charles to what i shall say as i mean it only for your good in the first place fear god and then you will never have any occasion to be afraid of man act always as in his presence never enter or quit your bed without prayer do always for your master as you would your master if you were to change places should do for you endeavor to get a pious friend but avoid as you would the plague all wicked company be cautious of too great familiarity with your female fellow servants an unlawful intercourse of this kind will ruin you body and soul flee from an alehouse as you would from the devil if you once get into it you will never be out of it keep your money and your money will keep you here charles is a bible for you the more you read it the more you will love it and the more you love it the better you will be and the happier i have written some directions for you in the first page of it god bless you and when my race which is now drawing to its end shall finish may we meet in heaven my masters kindness so affected me that i could not answer him for tears i was indeed very glad of going to so fine a place as london though at the same time i could not leave a house where i had been treated more like a child than a servant without great regret i shall not attempt to describe my parting with my mother no description i am sure could do justice to the solemn and affectionate manner in which she exhorted me to be pious and just and recommended me to god in prayer her last words i shall never forget   i know my dear son said she that you love me tenderly and that you would not give me unnecessary pain on any account remember then that whenever you do any wrong thing you are planting a dagger in your mothers heart with these words her eyes brim full of tears and her hands listed up in silent prayer to god she turned away from me and went into the cottage  and now reader you find me in the great and dangerous city of london in the service of a very wealthy master who kept twelve servants besides myself if country people knew london as well as i do how cautious they would be of exchanging their safe and peaceful situations in the country for the perils and temptations of a great city how many young fellows have i known who lived honestly and happily in their native place come up to london in the hope of higher wages and there forfeit their integrity their peace of mind their health their character and souls workmen in particular are very fond of getting into large cities because they think their labor will turn to better account there than in their own villages they do not consider that in a city they must give as much for a filthy room in a filthy house inhabited by half a dozen families situated in a close smokey dirty street as in the country would pay the rent of a cottage and a garden they do not consider the dearness of provisions in a city the temptations they are under from bad women wicked company and the great number of alehouses in short i am fully persuaded that a labourer in the country on a shilling a days is better off than one in a city on two shillings  when i came to my place i found every thing for the first three or four days very smooth and very pleasant plenty of provisions plenty of drink little work and a very merry servants hall but soon the face of things with respect to me changed very much and i underwent a severer temptation than i ever experienced before or since in the whole course of my life i had always hitherto been taught to consider that sobriety and diligence and piety were virtues i therefore never swore i never got drunk i never gamed i went to church as often as i could i said my prayers night and morning and on sunday at least if not on other days i read a little in my good old masters bible but here i soon found that all this was the worst vice i could be guilty of as soon as they found me out it seemed to be a trial of skill amongst them who should plague me most one called me the parson another methodist a third a conceited prig a fourth a canting hypocrite if i went into any other gentlemans kitchen it was all the same my character always flew before me and many were the jests and laughs raised both at home and abroad at my expense in short during three months my life was a constant state of anxiety and torment so that at last i was almost tempted god forgive me for the thought to do as they did and forfeit my everlasting soul in order to avoid the present uneasiness but while things were in this state i felt myself greatly and unexpectedly relieved one sunday morning by a sermon which i happened to hear from our parishminister on the following text  blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil of you falsely for my sake for great is your reward in heaven the excellent discourse which this pious man delivered on these words was so exactly suited to my circumstances and feelings that it seemed as if it had been addressed solely to me and it pleased god so to apply what had been said to my heart and understanding that i not only determined to bear in future the sneers and scoffs of my fellow servants with patience and fortitude but even those very sneers which i formerly considered as my heaviest calamity were now no longer grievous from this time therefore my uneasiness was pretty well at an end and i earnestly recommend it to all other servants who have been so happy as to acquire sober and virtuous habits not to suffer themselves to be laughed out of their sobriety and virtue by the jests and ridicule of their fellow servants they may depend upon it that their cause is a good one and though they suffer for it at first they will finally triumph in a short time all my persecution was at an end to be sure said the coachman one day to the cook charles is a little too religious but upon my word i dont think he is the worse for it mayhap it might be better for us if we were more like him i dont see but that he is as humble friendly and worthy a fellow as any amongst us for my part i shall laugh at him no longer this speech which i happened accidentally to overhear gave me great pleasure and i soon found by the agreeable change in my fellow servants conduct toward me that the coachman had expressed the opinion of the whole hall it is true i did every thing to obtain their good will that lay in my power i was as civil and obliging to every one among them as i possibly could was any thing to be done if nobody else would do it i never stopped to consider whether it belonged to my place or not but did it out of hand if any body took it into his head to fall out with me i generally disarmed him of his wrath by saying nothing if any little quarrels or misfortunes or misconduct happened in the hall i always endeavored to hush it up and never carried any tales to the master unless when i saw any body wronging him and then i thought it my duty or unless the thing was very bad indeed in short by pursuing always this line of conduct i found my situation very comfortable and agreeable my master treated me with great confidence and kindness my fellow servants with great friendliness and respect  in about two years time the footman that used to go to market being turned away for drunkenness which vice soon proved his ruin my master told me that as he believed i was an honest and careful young man and perceiving that i could write and keep an account he should in future employ me in marketing to market therefore i went every day and as i had now a good deal of my masters money always in my hands i prayed heartily to god that he would be pleased to preserve me under the temptation to which this exposed me my first exploit in this way was the purchase of ten shillings worth of fruit at a fruiterers when i had finished my bargain and was coming out of the shop the fruiterer slipped a shilling into my hand as i had never to the best of my recollection seen him before i was somewhat surrpized at his generosity but fortunately had the presence of mind to ask him whether he had charged his fruit the higher on account of this present to me why young man said he that is an honest question and i will give you an honest answer the fact is that as we know that gentlemen of your cloth expect some compliment from the tradesmen they deal with we are obliged in our own defense to charge our articles the higher on that account to their masters and so said i the money you give us comes finally from the pockets of our masters to be sure it does why then said i i will take your shilling but shall charge my master only nine shillings and this method i constantly pursued in the like case ever after for i think the abovementioned practice of footmen which however i hope is not very common with them is just the same thing in conscience as if they should rob their masters bureau  one monday morning having settled my account for the last week with my master i found that he had made a mistake against himself of twenty shillings as soon as i discovered it i said to myself here now is an opportunity of getting twenty shillings without any risk or detection but god forbid that i should do it as it would ruin my peace of mind and destroy my soul i therefore pointed out the error to my master the first opportunity  charles said he you are right the mistake is obvious i acknowledge i made it purposely to try your honesty you shall find that this affair will turn out before long to your advantage now though i do not think it quite fair for masters to lay this kind of trap for their servants integrity yet as i know by experience they sometimes do it we must be doubly on our guard indeed dishonesty is never safe it always will out some how or other i have seen surprising instances of the discovery of it when it seemed to have been committed with such cunning as to be impossible to be detected  one day as i was going to market i met sir robert ss butler who told me that having long observed my sobriety and diligence he was happy to have it now in his power to offer me a place in his masters family where my wages would be raised two guineas a year i thanked him and told him he should have his answer next evening in the mean time i called upon a pious and worthy friend whom i consulted in all difficulties and asked his opinion after mature deliberation he said charles dont go when you are once got into a good place stick to it like a leech the rolling stone gets no moss the more years you continue in one service the more you are respected by your master and all the world a good family considers an old servant as one of themselves and can no more see him want than a near relation whereas servants that are continually roving from place to place have no friend in distress and seldom get a provision for old age happy it was for me that i followed this good advice if i had not i should probably have been nothing more than a poor footman all my life  but before i bring my own story to an end i must beg my readers patience to listen to the sad fate of my poor brother tom alas poor tom he was a great favorite in our kitchen because he sung the best song and told the merriest tale and paid his card money the most freely of any gentleman footman about town and then he swore so much like a gentleman and was so complaisant to the ladies and pushed about the strong beer so merrily that he was said our servants the most agreeable company in the world and yet all these entertaining qualities did not preserve my poor brother from the most dreadful state of distress and ruin one morning he came to me about ten oclock with a very woeful face which was a thing very unusual for him and told me that he had just been turned away from his place without a character that he had no money many debts and no real friends and what was worse than all that he was laboring under disease  tom grew worse every day and was at length given over in the morning of that day while i was sitsitting at his bedside who should come in but my dear mother she had walked   0 miles except now and then a lift in the wagon to attend upon and comfort her undeserving son when she saw him pale and emaciated and his face half consumed by disease it so shocked her that she fainted away as soon as she recovered and was a little relieved by a plentiful flood of tears she said my dear tom i am come to take care of thee and make thee better if i can alas mother answered he putting his claycold hand into here is it is all too late i have but a few hours to live it is by neglecting your advice that i am brought to this gaming and drink and bad company and bad women have been my ruin o what will become of my soul if i could but live my life over again  here he was seized with a sudden sit and though he lived some hours he never spoke after and died that evening in my mothers arms  after recounting the sorrowful history of my unhappy brother i must now hasten to conclude my own about a twelvemonth after the offer of a place in sir robert s  s family my master in consideration as he said of my faithful services made me his butler he was indeed so kind and friendly to me on all occasions that i found it necessary to be extremely cautious left i should grow proud or saucy or familiar which some servants when they have lived long in a place and find themselves in favor are apt to do after enjoying this post about six years our family being now removed into the country i made acquaintance with a farmers daughter living near the great house whom on account of her religious and industrious principles and her amiable and cheerful temper i wished to make my wife she was no flaunter in fine clothes none of your dancing flirting forward lasses that run about to christenings and revels and hops that will ruin a man before he knows where he is but a pious sober stayathome industrious young woman else i am sure any body might have had her for me as i had never been guilty of any unnecessary expense for nobody will call that unnecessary which i sent yearly to my parents my savings the interest being added yearly to the principal in the hands of my master amounted to two hundred pounds and as fannys father promised to give her another hundred i thought we might with this take a small farm and maintain ourselves comfortably and decently i therefore communicated the affair to my master charles said he though i am loath to part with so good a servant yet i think it an act of gratitude due to you for your long and faithful services to consent readily to any thing which may be for your welfare but i do not think it necessary for us to part at all i am at present in want of a bailiff you may if you approve it undertake that office and still retain your present wages your fatherinlaw who is an experienced farmer will instruct and assist you in the duties of it i will besides let you a small farm on an advantageous lease which you may may make the most of for yourself  to this kind and generous offer i joyully assented and fanny and myself have now lived together six years in the farmhouse near the parkgate happy and prosperous my father being dead and my brother and sister settled my mother who is now very old lives with me and by her example and exhortation i find a sense of religion sink deeper and deeper into my soul everyday and indeed i am firmly convinced by long experience that there is nothing in this world can make us truly happy but that  i address this little book which i wrote by little and little in the long evenings of the last hard winter to all footmen i hope they will not be angry with my wellmeant endeavors but take kindly what is intended only for their good  the end
