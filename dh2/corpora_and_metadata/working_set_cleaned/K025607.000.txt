he may meet the blow as i am one of human race with patience waiting heavenly grace and age has worn me fifty years with tardy hopes and swiftwingd fears i would wish the lees of life to wear without the weight of wordly care had i my wish or choice to dwell it should be some clean rural cell beneath the shade of spreading trees whose murmrings with a gentle breeze might lull my senses into rest

springing love within thy shade i would fix my cell there is none on earth would please so well through the vast globe i have wandered over and touched at many a distant shore seen various nations rude and mild nature improved and nature wild yet none have such contentment given as thou dunmore an earthly heaven yet when i view thy mouldering walls whose trembling ruin daily falls i must lament thy ancient date with him that urged his luckless fate a little garden formed for food selfculturd to enlive my blood if laboring in my gardens bound along hid treasure should be found for ages buried under ground in during marble would i raise to you great mr collis the inventor of the marble mills near kilkenny collis endless praise with artful chissel should be shown in bust a figure like thy

showers should nature heated cease to deign her friendly clouds and dropping rain there would i scent the damask rose that in my vernal border grows and as it is sweetness meets decay i should reflect and sighing say thus life blooms up and fades away beneath my little garden wall a purling stream should gently fall whose limpid murmurings might glide unmixed with any lustful tide to violate her virtuous bed and swell her womb with riseing dread then leave her stained to weep and mourn with various mischiefs not her own as many a wretch has woman done o lovely sex your virtue keep let no ill thoughts disturb your sleep take sage advice from him that knows the strength and number of your foes all sullied arts and sighs despise repel the darts of guilty eyes the glittering gem the orient

habit plain devoid of lace that suits not an autumnal face a coarse dark frize may fit my age that might the northern blasts assuage when winters snow and petrid hail deform the riseing hill and dale and hoary frosts disguise the woods and bind in chains the rapid floods within my cell i would retire and warm me with kilkenny fire a few well chosen books i would have some to prepare me for the grave the rest to pass my time away heaven asks not all my hours to pray religion ought to cheer the mind form us benevolent and kind no scowling looks or sour grimace should ere be seated on the face

mount the fiery mettled steed who champs and foaming to be freed with guided rein to scour the mead or ore the breathing mountain lead my blood would rouse me from my cell to view the sport i loved so well yet take discretion for my guide and walk such hills i used to ride then when the pleasing toil was over and hounds and horns were heard no more i would to my quiet cell repair and healthful feed on homely fare high sauces but corrupt the blood diffusing poison with our food a little nature will suffice an epicure was never wise when spring revives the flowery field and calls the feathered race to build when they begin to strain their throats with various and delightful notes i should not judge it any crime to call back years of fletting time and tho those days are long since past for pleasing moments fly in haste yet i may think upon the fair whose lovely eyes dispeld despair but then to lose a virtuous wife that joy dispenser of my life that social balm to every smart that cordial to an aching heart he that can feel by simphathy must lose his wife and love like me for love in age to friendship turns and with a lasting ardour burns hale youth perhaps may smilling seem to taunt and ridicule this theme but youngsters i would have you know i once was young as well as you true love was never thought a crime a pleasing joy a bliss sublime a beauteous infant ever mild a

noxious air the vitals breath the caverns ending none can tell old fables say there witches dwell and this the ready road to hell miles have been traced the gloomy way without the sight of chearing day yet all the surface over head is fertile land and grassgrown mead where cattle graze and nightly sleep and shepherds keep their harmless sheep to watch their lambs to give relief or guard them
