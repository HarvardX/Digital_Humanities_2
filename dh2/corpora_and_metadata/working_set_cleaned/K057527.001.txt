the adventures of anthony varnish vol i  the adventures of anthony varnish or a peep at the manners of society by an adept  parva res est voluptatum in vita prae quam quod molestum est in three volumes vol i  london printed for william lane leadenhallstreet mdcclxxxvi  to george colman esquire sir i beg leave to lay an inconsiderable trifle at your feet  the motive that impels me to such a proceeding is too obvious either to escape your notice or that of the public namely to place a weak bantling under the wing of a powerful protector  i forbear to make use of that fulsome panegyric so usually conveyed in dedications first because i should be concerned to see you placed on a level with persons who owe their consequence to false praise and secondly because it is wholly unnecessary to tell the world that you are not only one of the greatest examples of merit yourself as an englishman but a warm patron whenever you meet with it in others  the following sketches are gleaned from the field of nature and some of the portraits are copied i flatter myself with a faithful pencil  if a perusal of them can make you laugh in spite of the inroads of care or the attacks of disease i shall think myself sufficiently rewarded for my trouble  i am sir with great respect your sincere admirer and most obedient servant the author  advertisement considering the partiality that is entertained for novels in this country it is much to be regretted that the generality of them are not written in a style and manner sufficiently excellent to justify so established a prejudice in their favor  on the contrary in very many instances we find the characters are unnatural the plot improbable and the language flimsy and unmeaning besides it is too often objected by the thinking part of the world that their tendency operates rather to corrupt the heart than to amend it as the writers endeavor to throw a sort of pleasing and fashionable veil over the blandishments of vice and make the habits of intrigue familiar to the minds of the female part of the rising generation before they can form a proper distinction between right and wrong which is doing a greater injury to public morality than is at first apprehended whereas if the scenes were drawn from real life the reader may not only be entertained with the absurdities of the weak part of human nature but at the same time gather experience from the ill consequences of their folly but this is a species of writing either very little understood or very difficult to be accomplished for scarce one in a hundred of all the ladies and gentlemen who have favored the world with what they call novels have been able to effect it and we are still left to lament that the genius of a fielding a smollett or a goldsmith is not to be discovered in any of the modern compositions of that description  the adventures of anthony varnish chapter i my origin and introduction into society  a short account of my family  my fathers retirement  his courtship of my mother  their marriage  my birth  the dreadful circumstance that accompanied it  my mothers sickness and recovery  as some curiosity may be excited in the minds of those who shall peruse the following narrative respecting the place of my nativity i have thought it necessary to give a brief detail of that as well as some other matters that respect my first entrance upon this great theater the world i beg leave to observe that a spirit of vanity by no means impels me to become my own biographer as is frequently the case with certain great men who to use a pertinent expression from the facetious harry fielding upon a similar occasion have been suspected to have lived an eccentric life merely to have the pleasure of telling it to the world no i disclaim such an idea in toto my motive is a sincere desire to oblige my readers of all parties and complexions which they will readily give credit to when they understand that the authors of my being were not remarkable for valuing themselves upon the honor of their house or the splendor of their situations  i drew my first breath in ireland a country long since renowned for the hospitality and generous spirit of its inhabitants the spot where i first opened my eyes upon the genial day was at a small cabin on the borders of the famous bay of allen in the queens county my father had served with great credit to his country and honor to himself in a regiment of horse at the celebrated battle of minden where he received a wound that incapacitated him from continuing in the army any longer with the heart of a hero and the resignation of a philosopher he was found to quit a service to which the habits of his life and a natural love for glory had attached him in a particular manner the recollection that he had been an active though humble instrument in the abovementioned gallant action proved a source of happiness that cheered him to his grave  fatigued with the calamities of war he pined to revisit his native home from which he had been separated five years  a small portion of time perhaps to those whose hearts were never sacrificed to love and constancy but it was not so with my father for five years to him appeared as five thousand  there lived in the neighborhood of my grandfather a rich farmer who at that time rented two hundred acres from the lord of the manor by a course of frugality and industry he had amassed sufficient wealth to command the necessaries and even the comforts of life but his riches did not consist in his money so much as in the possession of an only daughter whom he tenderly loved and expected to marry with advantage to a farmers son of the next village of extensive property  the fair kathleen was the admiration of all the young men in that part of the country but she treated their offers of marriage with scorn and neglect which was universally attributed to her pride though the real motive was a secret passion she entertained for my father in the course of their rural occupations they frequently met  a sympathy of soul rendered them pleasing to each other  they looked and frequently gave involuntary sighs the meaning of which they could not comprehend  they sought every opportunity of viewing each other but it produced no other effect than riveting their chains the stronger at last nature tired with the conflict urged my father to a declaration of his passion he seized the trembling hand of his dear kathleen and pressing it to his lips kissed it with an ardour that alarmed the natural modesty of his mistress  the blood rushed into her cheeks and hastily withdrawing her hand she reproved his warmth with an air of tenderness that tacitly encouraged the freedoms which her language affected to depress  by repeated solicitations my father won her to declare that she would marry only him but prudence forbidding their union at that time they resolved to defer the completion of their bliss till a change of circumstances should happen in their favor their interviews now became more frequent than ever till their mutual passion at last reached the ears of her father who enraged in the most peremptory terms of anger forbade his daughter ever to think more of her lover whom he represented as utterly beneath her consideration or regard  it was not long before my father learned the dreadful issue of their affections in the first moments of his despair he determined to put an end to an existence which was now rendered miserable for ever he actually was preparing for that dreadful measure when a ray of hope diverted him from the horrid purpose his fainting spirits once more revived and he resolved if possible to see his kathleen once again cupid ever attentive to the interests of his votaries favored his resolution for by means of a hind in the service of her father he got a message conveyed to the mistress of his heart earnestly entreating a meeting in the evening she complied with his wishes when my father with tears in his eyes took a final adieu resolving that the violence of his love should be no bar to the future happiness of his adored kathleen  after a solemn and sincere interchange of those sentiments which love inspires they parted with their eyes bathed in tears my father to forget his sorrows repaired to a public house in an adjoining village where meeting with a recruitingserjeant who struck with the manly beauty of his figure made him a tender of his services and courted him to join a regiment then stationed in that county urged by despair and willing to die he accepted his proposal joined the corpse and went abroad where he was soon signalized for his bravery and good conduct on the establishment of the peace he returned home when upon inquiring after his dear kathleen he learned that she had resisted every importunity of her father to marry who dying shortly after in consequence of her disobedience left her destitute of a shilling  my father soon discovered the place of her retreat and flying on the wings of love he rescued her from that misery to which she was resigned from an apprehension that her lover was no more the joy that followed upon their meeting can be conceived better than described  to be brief they were married in a few days and lived together many years afterward exemplary objects of mutual love and fidelity  two moons had scarce wasted since hymen smiled upon their wishes when my mother exhibited evident signs of pregnancy every care was taken by my father every consolation administered that could reduce the pains of her situation he viewed the progress of her state with joy anxiously looking forward to the time that heaven should vouchsafe to give them an offspring equally dear to both  my mother had advanced into the eighth month of her pregnancy when my father laboring one evening in his potatoegarden was alarmed with the cries of a female he immediately rushed as it were by instinct to her relief but who can paint the anguish of his soul when looking over the hedge he perceived my mother prostrate on the road he instantly raised her up and inquiring into the cause of her affright learned that a bull driven by some boys rushed by her when she was on the return from market when her fears had overcome her so far that she shrieked and fainted away  luckily the place of her accident was within a hundred yards of her own cabin to which she was conducted by my father with all possible tenderness who placing her in a chair began to rub her temples and exercise all those little assiduities which are so pleasing to the human mind in the hour of sickness or distress but notwithstanding his utmost efforts my mother grew still worse when calling in the assistance of a female neighbor she pronounced she was in labor upon this declaration she was put to bed and every assistance procured that the country could afford three quarters of an hour after the arrival of the midwife i was brought forth and by her triumphantly displayed to my father as one of the finest male children that ever she had the happiness of introducing into this scurvy motley world of disquiet and vicissitudes my father could not conceal his rapture at my infantine beauty and shape notwithstanding the moans and agony of my mother who lay writhing under the pains with which heaven has thought proper to accompany the dearest consequence of wedded love  however what with the tenderness of my father and the administrations of the midwife in about a fortnight the rosy hue of health began to reassume her throne on the cheek of my mother her vivacity returned my father rejoiced and every necessary preparation was made to render the approaching christening as splendid and happy as the narrow circumstances of my family would permit  chapter ii my christening  am sent to school  the delight which parents take in the improvement of their offspring  sent to a schoolmaster  my astonishing progress in learning  my fathers death  my mothers melancholy  her death  the beginning of my distresses  the time prescribed by custom having arrived when it was thought proper to give me a christian name a select number of relations and friends were summoned to attend the ceremony among the rest was an uncle of my father who had signalized himself upon many occasions in rendering him every service that lay in his power and to manifest his gratitude in the best manner he was able my father resolved that i should be named after him  i was accordingly christened anthony that being the name of the old gentleman with all due rites and solemn preparations it were needless to recount all the little pleasantries and harmless jokes which passed in that rural though friendly circle upon the occasion good humor presided at the humble board and gave a charming zest to the joyous entertainment after each guest had drunk a health to young anthony in whiskeypunch the merry group separated and sought their respective homes highly pleased with the conviviality of the evening  when i had arrived at the age of five years it was determined by my fond parents that i should be sent to school and an opportunity offered at that time which it was thought necessary to embrace  the widow of an exciseofficer who had been left with a large family in indigent circumstances was advised by her friends to open a school for the education of children at a certain age to assist in the support of her young family i was accordingly sent to mrs goodman with a strong charge from my father that she would instruct me in my letters with all possible expedition and an entreaty from my poor mother that she would not whip me for fear of spoiling my disposition  i attended the school regularly for three years morning and afternoon at the expiration of which i had made such a progress in my learning that i was spoken of as a prodigy for my years  i not only did great credit to the endeavors of mrs goodman but gave infinite satisfaction to my poor parents under the idea that they had not bestowed their money for nothing this part of my education stood them in halfacrown a quarter  an inconsiderable sum to the affluent and the vain but a very important one to my father and mother the former of whom labored at husbandry for the poor pittance of sixpence per day and the latter spun yarn for a much less consideration  from this school i was removed to learn latin and writing at a hedge academy kept for that purpose by a romish priest who had been degraded for malpractices in his profession by an ecclesiastic synod of his own persuasion i had not been six months in my new situation when by the quickness of my parts and the cunning of my address i gained an entire ascendency over the will of this country pedagogue which was considered as a very flattering circumstance as father doolough was not remarkable for the gentleness of his disposition or the charity of his opinion however the gratitude of my parents did not suffer his partiality to their child to go unrewarded every little opportunity was seized to send his reverence a present of some fresh butter milk and a piece of pork every christmas when they killed a pig it must be owned to the generality of my readers such acknowledgements will appear trifling but the cheerfulness with which they were given was more than a compensation for their deficiency in value  i made an astonishing progress in my learning for my years and could construe the easiest of the latin authors with tolerable facility when a dreadful accident happened which proved in its consequences a fatal wound to my prosperity  my father returning home from a neighboring fair where he had been to purchase a cow was thrown from his horse and died upon the spot when the news was first brought to my mother she was deprived of her reason and did not recover the use of her understanding until the remains of my muchlamented parent had been deposited to sleep with his fathers  from that moment she gave herself up a prey to grief and lamentation a rooted melancholy fastened on her mind and secluding herself from comfort and society her constitution was greatly impaired the little property that their parsimony had gathered together was now diminishing daily her dearest concerns were neglected and even my presence ceased to give her pleasure after languishing for a few months the cold hand of death put a final period to all her miseries and left me an orphan at twelve years of age to struggle with a base world in the best manner i was able  chapter iii enter into the service of father doolough  become the object of his hatred  lament my situation  account of my masters niece  an accident occurs for which i am punished with great severity  my elopement from school  arrival at a hedge alehouse  a description of the company  the influence of priestcraft  a bloody affray and its dreadful consequences  after the burial of my mother a cousin of here is who entertained a sincere regard for her memory and being a man not wholly unacquainted with the impulse of humanity undertook to put me in a situation that should be most likely ultimately to turn out to my advantage after devising various schemes it was settled between him and my schoolmaster that i should remain in the house of father doolough and by serving him in the capacity of his boy endeavor by waiting upon his person sweeping the school and performing numberless other little offices to repay him for the charges of victuals and education i entered in this new department with more cheerfulness than could be expected from a child of my tender years who had so recently been deprived of parents whose only wish was to render him happy but many days had not passed over my head before i felt the loss of their protection and kindness my master being naturally of a morose and saturnine disposition seemed to single me out as the object of his resentment when any accident or untoward circumstance made him angry one evening when he returned home from a neighboring village i perceived his countenance naturally stern and forbidding heightened with an unusual degree of severity he called for me to take off his boots i went trembling with apprehension and had scarce laid hold of his foot when he gave me a kick which laid me senseless on the floor at the same time loading me with the most opprobrious epithets calling me an awkward rascal and that i was not worth bestowing bread and water upon i made all possible haste to retreat from his fury and abuse and hiding myself in the schoolroom gave vent to a flood of tears which in some measure relieved my heart  i considered that as the first lesson of all my future sorrow i bewailed my condition in terms of regret and despair but knowing of no remedy but patience i resolved to bear up under my misfortunes in the best manner i was able when i had indulged myself in these reveries for about half an hour i was visited by my masters niece judy a goodnatured girl about five years older than myself and who compassionated me from a spirit of sympathy as her uncle notwithstanding the tie of consanguinity very frequently used her in a manner to the full as cruel and unjustifiable  in this manner did i live for a whole twelvemonth the humble helpless victim of an unfeeling barbarian and probably should have continued much longer had not a circumstance occurred which determined me to change my situation at all events  unfortunately for me some boys belonging to our school had broke into the fruitgarden of a gentleman in the neighborhood and not only stripped the bushes of all the gooseberries and currants they could meet but committed various other wanton depredations such as breaking the fences and destroying the flowers a formal complaint was lodged by the gentleman whose gardener swore positively that he saw a boy in the garden and traced him as far as the school the boys were all severally examined and dreading the schoolmasters vengeance stoutly denied the fact my master thinking some expiation absolutely necessary to appease the gentleman and not being able to charge the theft home to any one very charitably fixed upon me who he asserted was the most probable person in the school for an action of that enormity from the wickedness and bent of my disposition it was in vain that i fell on my knees and protested i was innocent his heart was steeled against my prayers and the more i insisted on the cruelty of punishing me for the fault of another the more he maintained that he saw guilt in my face he ordered two of the stoutest boys to take me on their back and uncovering my posteriors flogged me in spite of my lamentations until the blood started at every blow when he had satisfied his brutal inclination i was released a spectacle of misery and pity  my resentment taught me inwardly for the first time to mutter curses on so inflexible a tyrant  i meditated numberless schemes of revenge but the tenderness of my years and the fear of the consequences always deterred me from putting them in execution  when i found myself pretty well recovered from the hard punishment i had undergone i took a firm and determined resolution to leave the house for ever i kept my purpose secret until the moment of putting it in execution when i took the opportunity of the pedagogues absence from home to effect it i took leave of his niece with tears of regret and wishing her everlasting happiness set forward in the wide world at thirteen years of age without a parent friend or benefactor  after wandering for an hour through bypath and across the most unfrequented fields to avoid meeting my master the idea of whom was shocking to my imagination i came to a little meanlooking cabin which by the wellknown symbols to irish travelers of a pipe and a rag stuck in the thatch i knew to be a house of entertainment for weary wretches like myself who after traveling all day solace themselves with clean straw in a corner for the small consideration of twopence per head  as i approached nearer to this humble mansion of hospitality i heard a noise resembling a confusion of voices all engaged in conversation at the same time and above all i could easily distinguish the melodious tones of a bagpipe with some little apprehension i entered the cabin and soon learned the cause of all this merriment which was no other than a parcel of country people who had assembled at this shebeen house as they term it in irish to wake the body of the mans wife who lived there  as this is a custom not known to the generality of my readers i will give them an explanation  when any person dies in ireland among the lower orders of the people it is usual for the neighbors to assemble for a day or two previous to the interment of the body at the house of the deceased whose nearest relations always provide a sufficient quantity of whiskey and tobacco for the accommodation of the guests and these meetings are always most numerous when the deceased has been particularly wellbeloved for the circumstance of dying in that country is not considered among the peasantry as a matter of sorrow but rejoicing and this opinion is founded on the best idea imaginable which is that of the defuncts having been removed by the will of heaven from a situation laden with anxieties and trouble to a state of everlasting joy  and the poor cottager possessing such principles may look down with contempt on the affluence and vices of the great world  after a few questions from the landlord i was introduced among the festive group who sitting on the ground had formed a circle round the dead body which was placed in a coffin in the center of the apartment elevated upon two stools in a distinguished place in the room there sat a little squat man with a loose great coat thrown carelessly over his shoulders he seemed about fifty years of age with a countenance remarkably carbuncled and so red and inflamed that he looked at first sight like a flaming meteor he had on a large bushy wig without powder a flapped hat and boots notwithstanding which i could see plainly that his legs when he stood upright formed a parenthesis or in other words were extremely bandy by the silence that was observed whenever the little man opened his mouth i soon found out that he was no other than the parish priest who had rode two miles on purpose to pay this mark of his respect to the memory of the deceased for whom i understood from the insinuations of a part of the company he had a particular degree of esteem when living so much so that the foul voice of scandal was not wanting to assert that her godly confessor in their hours of private devotion had a much greater regard for her body than her soul which opinion i the more readily gave credit to as i perceived that the widower did not pay those tokens of attention and profound respect to the priest as were reasonably to be expected and that he bore the loss of his wife with as much indifference and philosophy as if he had been educated in st jamess parish  after the whiskey had circulated pretty briskly i saw the eyes of the ecclesiastic begin to twinkle with strong symptoms of intoxication and the strength of the liquor had so far overpowered his understanding that he voluntarily proposed giving the company a song which being assented to with the lungs of a stentor he bellowed forth the wedding of baltimore and being joined in chorus by the rest they made the room echo with a noise so loud as must have waked the deceased if any thing less than the last trumpet could have roused her from the stillsleep of death  when the noise subsided the priest called for his horse signifying his intention to depart and getting up staggered to the coffin which leaning over he uttered the following incoherent ejaculation  you know well enough without my telling you that you  you  you are my shep  shepherd and i am your flock and that you  you  ought to be after doing nothing do you see withou  ou  out my orders  no father shaughnessy cries a fellow half drunk there youre out for we are the flock and you are the shepherd  no bocklish my dear says the priest it is all one for that honey  but you  you  are an imper  r  tinent vagabond so you are to be wanting to be teaching your betters  and now i think of it you heant been at confession since last aester for which omisshon you will go to the devil  mister terry do you hear that  and i will tell you a little bit more for your comfort mister terence maclachlan for that i think is your ugly name if you dont pay your dues to the church more punctually by my own soul and i am not jasting my dare i will be after excommunicating your mothers son do you see  these last words operated like a clap of thunder on the ears of poor terry who promised obedience to the reverend father with the most servile submission  when the priest addressing the company once more enjoined them to be very circumspect in their manners and above all not to get drunk  arrah now be temperate my jewels temperance is a very great vartue says he and drunkenness is little better than a deadly sin  so mind my words and be good christians  if you dont why bad luck to you  after concluding this eloquent and pious harangue the good mans powers of persuasion forsook him and falling fast asleep over the dead body he began to snore louder than the bass note of a cathedral organ the husband of the deceased slapping him on the shoulder informed him that his horse was at the door when he reeled out of the room with infinite difficulty and bestriding his garran rode off toward his own home  when the priest had left the room whose appearance even drunk kept them in some awe they gave a loose to all those indecent sports which they could not with any propriety act before him it was immediately determined to hunt the brogue a pastime peculiar to that country the mode is this  one of the girls takes off her shoe which is there called a brogue and the company sitting with their knees bent forms a passage to convey the brogue from one person to another for in the quickness of the conveyance consists the merit of the game  they had not pursued their diversion for above ten minutes when a very serious affair took place darby who had a vast deal of roguery intermixed in the particles of his composition in searching for the brogue under the legs of a young woman who sat next to him made a terrible mistake which laid the foundation of much confusion and bloodshed  in short totally regardless of the suggestions of delicacy he laid his hand upon a part of the young lady which gave her such offense that with one blow she laid him sprawling on his motherearth her lover who was one of the party being made acquainted with the nature of the transaction took the part of his enamorata and aimed a blow at the head of the aggressor which unluckily alighting on the cranium of a drunken titheproctor who was fast asleep he awaked in the utmost rage and demanding the name of the person who had presented him with that friendly salutation he returned the compliment with so much interest that he made his assailant stagger under the blow and fairly knocked him over an old woman who having taken too copious a quantity of whiskey that evening was evacuating in a corner the foul contents of an overcharged stomach the young woman perceiving the disaster of her sweetheart flew upon the proctor with the fury of a lioness in defense of her young and fastening her nails in his visage made such incisions as drew forth the blood which ran in torrents down each side of his face  now the riot became universal  the old woman enraged at the treatment she had met with seized the hair of the young man with one hand and catching up an earthen jug which lay by her with the other made such a powerful application of it to his head that if his scull had been formed of penetrable materials must have done his business completely however quickly recovering he turned round and gave the old sybil such a stroke on her face as actually drove the remains of an old canine tooth the only one left in her head fairly down her throat the landlord interfered to put an end to the combat when unfortunately in a struggle for superiority between the old hag and her adversary they overset the stools which supported the coffin of the deceased which rolling on the floor contributed to render the scene more dreadful and so affrighted me that using all the expedition i was able i made my escape from a scene that struck me equally with terror and amazement in my hurry out of the cabin i quite forgot to pay my reckoning and would have instantly returned to discharge it if i had not been prevented by my fears  chapter iv am exceedingly frightened  arrive at a town  the hospitality of the poor natives  the good nature of my landladys son  our supper  reflections on mankind  a gleam of hope  my spirits are revived by the good offices of my benefactress  after running for a full hour until i was quite out of breath without once turning about or looking behind i perceived by the great quantity of smoke that issued from a valley at a distance that i was not very far from a town emboldened by this discovery i mended my pace and arrived there just as night began to spread her sooty wings over the darkening world overcome by my exertions i sat myself down at the door of a cabin and began to ruminate in my mind what step i should pursue  i looked over my money and found it amounted to one shilling and ninepence halfpenny a sum by no means inconsiderable in my eyes at that time  as i sat brooding over my misfortunes i was accosted by an old woman who perceiving me fatigued invited me into her cabin and offered me some buttermilk to assuage my thirst i thanked her for her kindness and finding her a humane benevolent poor creature i told her of my distress and unbosomed myself to her with all the frankness of innocence she pitied my situation and offered me every service in her power she requested me to rest in her cabin that night and that in the morning she would inquire in the town and see what she could do for me i would have gone and purchased something for supper not being willing to be too burdensome to her but such was her spirit of hospitality that she would not permit me  she informed me that she had buried her husband for many years and owed her present subsistence to the goodness of her son whom she expected to return home from his daily labor every minute and to what little she could pick up by going out to nurse in the town and neighborhood  here she broke off her discourse to introduce me to her son who now entered the room with a scythe in his hand the sharp part of which was bound round with hay as soon as he understood my situation from his mother he told me i was heartily welcome to my bed and my supper and immediately taking a piece of dried beef which hung suspended from the rafters of the cabin cut a large slice and giving it to his mother requested her to boil it that evening with some potatoes which he meant as an extraordinary dainty prepared as a compliment to me and to manifest that hearty welcome which is universally paid by the inhabitants of ireland to every stranger that comes within their gates  during the preparation of our homely repast my kind host entertained me with an account of the town which he informed me was composed principally of french families or their descendents who were on the whole a very good sort of people  that as far as they were able they gave bread to the poor but there being no manufactory of any sort carried on in the place the majority of the inhabitants were frequently in very great distress for want of employment  by this time our supper being ready we sat round the table when being naturally bashful and reserved i at first are but sparingly but the importunities of my kind host and his mother at last removed all restraint and giving way to the keenness of my appetite i made a most hearty supper after which we all prepared for rest my host inviting me to a share of his bed i undressed and getting into bed could hear my benefactor recommending himself to the protection of the almighty with the most fervent zeal and piety  at that moment i could not avoid reflecting upon the great difference we perceive in the dispositions of the human race and formed a striking contrast between the behavior of the young man and his mother which appeared to me in a light so perfectly amiable and praiseworthy and the tyrannic brutal spirit which actuated the breast and conduct of my late master  young as i was i strove within myself to account for such a seeming want of virtue in particular individuals but the subject being of a nature too deep and abstruse for my comprehension i lost myself in conjecture and slept till morning  as soon as the crowing of the cock proclaimed the return of day my bedfellow springing from his humble couch put on his clothes and saying a short prayer wished me a good morning and taking his scythe proceeded to a renewal of those labors in the execution of which his heart is happy his fellow creatures assisted and his creator pleased  after the departure of my friend i composed myself to rest a second time and was awakened in the morning by my kind benefactress who informed me with great satisfaction in her countenance that she believed she had heard of a place that would suit me a physician of the town had parted with his servant the day before and wanted a smart boy to supply his place  to be sure added she the doctor is reckoned in the town but an odd sort of a man and is not over liberal to his domestics but he is looked upon as extremely skilful in his profession and has a vast deal of practice all over the country  now says she if you are agreeable i will speak this morning to my friend who shall take you with him to the doctor  i was overpowered with joy at the news and eagerly thanked the poor woman for the interest she had taken in my affairs and getting out of bed i dressed myself with all possible haste to be ready to attend my new master whenever i should be called upon  chapter v my benefactress returns  i am introduced to my new master  entertain no very advantageous idea of him  his treatment of a patient with a broken leg  his singular ideas respecting human nature  jokes illtimed when at the expense of the miseries of our fellow creatures  a striking specimen of my masters economy  after waiting about a quarter of an hour mrs commins for that was the name of my kind hostess returned bringing with her a young man whose face if it is to be considered as the index of his mind proclaimed him to be remarkably stupid  here mr rhubarb says she at the same time presenting me to the person in question is the young lad that i was speaking about  if you will use your interest with dr calomel and get him into his service i shall be for ever obliged to you  i have conceived a great partiality in his favor and i have no doubt but the doctor will think himself obliged to us both for the recommendation  the young man asked me if i was willing to go to service and upon my answering in the affirmative with great readiness he desired me to come along with him and he would do my business mrs commins thanked him and said that heaven would reward him doublefold for the kindnesses he was showing to a poor orphan helpless and unbefriended  i took my hat and prepared to follow my conductor but not before i had seized the hand of my benefactress and wanting words to thank her for such an instance of friendship and generosity i bathed it with my tears she kissed me and bade me be a good boy under which injunction i departed and with sear and trepidation followed mr rhubarb to the house of my new master  upon our knocking at the door and inquiring for dr calomel we were desired to walk into the parlour when we entered i saw this grotesque son of esculapius reclining in an armchair amusing himself with the perusal of that celebrated key to the sublime parts of natural knowledge called aristotles masterpiece as his person struck me in the tout ensemble as strongly partaking of the singular and ridiculous i shall attempt a description  he appeared somewhat turned of fifty in stature about four feet nine inches with a complexion so nearly approaching to the ethiopian that i should have concluded his parents were natives of africa and subjects of prester john if i had not been assured upon credible authority that they were an honest couple of french refugees who had fled into ireland in consequence of the edict of nantz  his nose was short with a round nob at the end somewhat like the top of the handle of a kitchen poker and his face was farther embellished by an enormous wide mouth which appeared when he laughed to be bounded only by his ears  his eyes were small and black yet piercing and animated and when he rose to receive us i perceived that his knees formed two angles which crossed each other alternately as he walked  he had on a large thick woollen nightcap tied under the chin a camblet gown manufactured in the good days of queen elizabeth a black waistcoat embrowned with snuff which he took in prodigious quantities leather breeches unbuttoned at the knees coarse worsted stockings and a pair of green slippers that seemed by their patches and appearance to have been in the doctors service a considerable time   aye aye master rhubarb says the doctor on our entrance what you have brought me another patient i see  i suppose now his constitution is ruined by some ignorant member of the faculty and you have brought him to me to patch it up as usual  tell me boy says he addressing himself to me and putting on his spectacles how long have you been ill  what is your disorder  come show me your tongue  doctor says my friend rhubarb as soon as the astonishing loquacity of the physician would give him an opportunity to put in a word you are deceived this boy is not ill  he is come to offer his services to you to supply the place of the lad you have discharged  oh ho says this retainer of death evidently disconcerted at his own want of penetration that alters the case no no i will be sworn if he is come to serve me that he is well enough egad  he will eat his allowance without much solicitation i will be bound for him  there is that rascal peter i turned off would eat you his pound of solid beef at a sitting with as much ease as i can draw a tooth  damme if a dozen such hungry dogs would not breed a famine in the country  well where the devil did you come from says he turning to me where did you live last who will give you a character  here my friend rhubarb proceeded to tell the doctor my situation and concluded with observing that he believed i was willing to leave the articles of wages entirely to his generosity at the mention of the last article a smile of complacency stole across the visage of the physician who stroking me over the head assured me that if i became his servant and behaved myself well i should never want for proper encouragement upon my making a low bow and thanking him he bade me wait till he should have occasion for me  now rhubarb and the doctor having seated themselves by the fireside began to discourse upon the effect of the several medicines that had been administered to calomels patients in the course of the preceding week by the course of their observations i soon discovered to my utter astonishment that gambouge and brickdust scotch snuff chalk and vinegar made up the principal part of every recipe that the doctor had issued for the last twelve months totally regardless of the disorder whether gout fever lax pox or consumption  after this conscientious physician and his understrapper had diverted themselves at the expense of their patients for some time an object of misery was brought in to the doctor for advice upon which mr rhubarb wishing him a good morning took his leave and my master proceeded to examine the object alluded to which was a woman turned of forty with a pallid emaciated countenance and her body and legs so swelled with a dropsy that the members of her frame seemed to have lost all proportion  when the doctor had surveyed her for a few minutes he very gravely asked the poor sufferer what she wanted with him she replied she hoped that under heaven he would cure her  cure you woman replies calomel why youre in a confirmed dropsy  and is there no relief added she in a tone fraught with anguish and despair  relief aye aye i can relieve you woman as to that matter  if you can says the woebegone wretch lifting up her hands as in the act of prayer i pray that god may reward you hereafter  i have no sort of objection to a reward here as well as hereafter  you understand me  oh sir i do replies the unhappy being but alas i am poor and have not the power  i was left a widow with a large family of young children who will incessantly pray for your health and prosperity  aye aye my good woman replies the disciple of galen i am much obliged to you for the intention  but do you hear me get home as fast as you can and i will contrive to give you some ease in about a couple of hours  in two hours sir  yes i will come and tap you as they do the smallbeer barrels though i am afraid for one quart of water i shall find two of whiskey isnt so  damme i should not be surprised if the whole country was in a dropsy for threefourths of their existence are dedicated to drinking and sleeping  oh sir says the emaciated object wounded to the quick at the cruel insinuations of my master i assure you i never drink spirits of any kind  oh lord no to be sure says the doctor you drink whiskey  i beg your pardon  no no  whiskey indeed says he it is water  yes yes you are all damned fond of water  you sleep with water get drunk with water and wallow about the streets like a sow in a dunghill  however good woman go about your business  upon which the poor creature took her leave of this physical brute with tears in her eyes  she had scarce got out of the doors when another unhappy claimant made his appearance this was a young man who in thatching an outhouse in the neighborhood by his foot slipping had fallen from the top of the building into the street and broke his leg and was conducted to the house of calomel to have it set for the doctor was not only the principal physician but likewise surgeon and manmidwife to half the county after they had placed the unfortunate young man in a chair my master began to examine the limb while he was performing of which the poor fellow looked most wistfully in the face of the doctor as if anxious to learn his fate by the turn of his countenance which calomel perceiving he heightened the apprehensions of his patient by exercising the most significant grimaces in the whole art of which he was an adept and at times shaking his head as if seriously alarmed about the consequences of the fracture which he continued to exercise with other gesticulations until he had worked upon the fears of the poor lad so far that in the utmost vehemence of despair he asked the doctor if he must lose his leg to which question calomel replied in doubtful terms he began to bewail his misfortune which the doctor treated as a jest telling him at the worst he could but lose his leg which was a circumstance not so unfortunate as was generally imagined when he considered the great savings that are made in the articles of shoes and stockings with a number of witticisms of this nature he entertained the miserable wretch who lay writhing with pain while he set his limb after effecting which he consigned him to the care of his friends promising to call the next day to see how he went on  by this time i had conceived the most unconquerable aversion to my new master both for his principles and practice  i looked upon him as a monster utterly devoid of humanity callous to the misfortunes of his fellow creatures and a dishonor to his profession  after the doctor had dispatched the young man with the fractured limb he gave orders that he would see no more paupers that morning as the hour had arrived when it was usual for him to visit his outdoor patients while he was adjusting his wig which forms no inconsiderable part of a physicians consequence his friend rhubarb paid him a second visit i soon understood that this gentleman was as necessary to the doctors operations as his right arm  i learned from a neighbor that mr rhubarb was an apothecary in the town whose practice had been exceedingly diminished by the irregularities of his conduct and more particularly by a small mistake which he made in the recipe of another physician which was no other than administering an emetic of three times the strength prescribed to a young lady the consequence of which mistake was no less than the instantaneous death of the patient as the physician partook of the odium affixed to the blunder of the apothecary and getting into disrepute it proved a matter of the most satisfactory nature to the malignant spirit of calomel who secretly rejoiced at the event inasmuch as it was a deep wound to the reputation of the physician who had heretofore been a formidable rival to calomel upon all occasions  after giving me directions to tell any person who might call upon him that he should return in the afternoon this redoubted son of galen attended by his medical assistant set out to visit a patient who resided about four miles from the town and to whom calomel wished to introduce rhubarb as the apothecary  for what reason it is presumed the reader is already sufficiently acquainted  chapter vi an account of my masters study  the arrival of a relation  my masters ideas of human wisdom  a picture of the physicians economy  the dinner  my masters exordium by the way of grace  his description of the town  he indulges his malice at the expense of his veracity  his propensity to humor  the departure of the guests  after the departure of the doctor and his brother in iniquity i began to take an accurate survey of the apartment which he dignified with the name of study in a glass case in the middle of the room there was preserved in spirits of wine a great variety of uncommon animals insects and reptiles and among the rest a human foetus as it is situated in the womb after four months conception  on the shelf over the fireplace were the sculls of an european an african and a monkey by a comparison of which i perceived that there was a strong resemblance between the cranium of a man and that of a monkey but particularly so in that of the negro the formation of which approached so near to that of the monkey that there was scarcely any difference except in the disproportion of size  his collection of books consisted principally of cheseldens anatomy a few numbers of the medical magazine cowper on midwifery a french edition of boileaus poetry a latin dictionary and an old bible  in one corner of the room stood a wigblock unoccupied and in the other a case containing an imperfect skeleton at the first sight of which i thought i should have dropped dead with affright  on a peg in the middle of the room hung a scarlet cloak which with six crazy chairs a foldingtable and a draughtboard completed the furniture of the room  when i had satisfied my curiosity i began to peruse cheseldens anatomy and was amusing myself with looking at the cuts when i heard a loud double knock at the door on opening of which a gentleman on horseback inquired if dr calomel was at home to which i answered in the negative but at the same time informed him agreeably to his directions that i expected him home to dinner upon which the gentleman desired me to acquaint my master that his name was rapine and that he should do himself the favor to dine with him on his return from the inn where he was going to put up his horse  the stranger had not been gone from the door above half an hour when my master arrived accompanied by his zealous adherent rhubarb he inquired if there had been any persons wanting him since he went out upon which i informed him that mr rapine had been there and acquainted him with his intention of dining with him  at the mention of the name of rapine i perceived the muscles of calomel to distend with smiles of secret satisfaction  odso says he turning to rhubarb a cousingerman of mine from the north from whom i have great expectations  he is a great wit a manufacturer of bons mots and a very tolerable hand at the violin  he has amassed a prodigious sum in the service of his majesty  what he is been some naval or military officer i suppose says rhubarb who after a life spent in honorable fatigue has retired to end his days in peace and solitude beneath the shade of his own laurels  why not exactly so replies the doctor my cousin has never had the honor of exposing his person on the quarter deck of a man of war or in defending a battery against the approaches of an enemy no my dear rhubarb excuse me we have no such fools in our family  mr rapine has served the king it is true but between ourselves where he studied the interest of his majesty in one instance he was wise enough to take care of his own in ten  you understand me says calomel putting his finger to his nose with a significant leer  oh perfectly well says the pliant apothecary  he was for the space of seven years continues the doctor a collector of excise at  in the county of  but some of his indirect practices being discovered in spite of all his cunning and address to hide them he was in consequence removed from his employment but not quite destitute as my indefatigable relation had taken care to amass a fortune in that situation amounting to very near twenty thousand pounds  upon which my master retired into the kitchen to give orders for something extraordinary for dinner that day which he intended should be in a style of elegance superior to his ordinary mode of living on purpose to entertain his wealthy kinsman and left poor rhubarb in amazement at the industry and enormity of mr rapines character from which reverie he was awakened by the arrival of the doctors guest who entered the room with that selfconsequential mien which is ever to be met with in those worldly grublings who have gathered and scraped a fortune at the expense of all the good and noble characteristics of a man  he had scarce seated himself when my master running into the room and embracing his cousin professed himself much honored by his visit which compliment mr rapine returned with great formality and reserve the doctor seized his hat whip and coat with that kind of obsequious officiousness which would be highly painful to a generous mind but it was what the doctor well knew would be extremely pleasing to his visitor the bent and turn of whose disposition he had long studied with a particular degree of attention  the three worthies for the doctor had invited rhubarb to partake of the entertainment trifled away the time in discourse until i was dispatched by the housekeeper for the doctor was never married having a peculiar aversion to the female sex to inform them that dinner was on the table at which joyful summons i observed rhubarb to smack his lips and rub his hands with great energy but a visible mortification and disappointment appeared in his visage when hastening into the diningparlour he perceived the rigid economy of the physicians table however after exhibiting some small signs of surprise he sat down to dinner with his companions which consisted of a tureen of meagre broth  the scanty remains of a scrag end of a neck of mutton  a potatoepudding  a dish of colcanon which is no other than cabbage and kitchenstuff boiled and mashed together  and in compliment to mr rapine an antiquated goose which had seen at least three summers was served up stuffed with sage onions and garlic  as the goose seemed to be the most attractive object in the bill of fare the apothecary at the instigation of rapine stuck his fork in the devoted fowl and was proceeding to dissection when an effluvium issued from the stuffing which disconcerted the famished rhubarb so much that he was obliged in spite of the voraciousness of his appetite to forego the operation the cause of which intolerable stench was no other than a prudent maneuver of the physician who knowing rhubarb to be a capital hand at a knife and fork and particularly fond of geese had taken care to mix a little assafoetida with the stuffing in some measure to allay the fury of his stomach and the expedient succeeded so well that the astonished retailer of drugs had very nigh fainted under the influence of the noxious smell however after the first assault was over he resumed his office finished the carving of the goose and made shift in spite of the assafoetida to demolish two legs a wing part of the breast a side bone and afterward ate the rump made into a devil to provoke his thirst so far that by drinking after dinner he might revenge the affront at the expense of the doctors wine  but there he reckoned without his host for as soon as the tablecloth was removed and calomel had finished his dissertation upon the virtues of assafoetida and the good effects of moderation in eating he entered upon another subject for the benefit of his guests which was no other than a learned account of the numerous evils which must of course follow the indulgence of our appetites especially in whatever had any relation to excessive drinking which he asserted not only degraded human nature to a level with brutality but absolutely undermined and ruined the constitution beyond the possibility of relief the doctor entreated them not to disregard his doctrine for he shrewdly observed that he had been feed very highly for advice that was not a tenth part so salutary but as they were his particular friends he should be sufficiently recompensed in their enjoyment of a good state of health  when he had finished this welltimed exordium he called for the remains of a bottle of port and at the same time a mug of ale and a decanter of spring water he placed the bottle before his relation the water before himself and the ale before the apothecary upon the latter persons appearing somewhat dissatisfied at his allowance the doctor recommended it to his palate in such terms as his friend rhubarb did not think it proper or prudent at that time to call in question but took copious draughts of the homely beverage the excellent flavor of which he extolled to the skies while his heart was tormented at an indignity which he had neither spirit nor capability of resenting  upon mr rapines inquiring into the trade of the town and the amusements of its inhabitants the doctor gave him the following account   p  t  g  n is a town says the physician that is extremely singular in every point of view it owes the little importance it enjoys to the settlement of a few vagrant french families who fled from oppression in their own country about half a century ago to take up their abode in a land which they despised  their descendents who form the principal part of the inhabitants at the present day have carefully preserved the little pride and narrow prejudices of their forefathers to which they have annexed that spirit of idleness and negligence of improvement which are so conspicuous in this country and what renders their follies the more lamentable is that from some unaccountable combination of events the children of onethird of our people of distinction are sent here to imbibe the first rudiments of their education which doubtless in a great degree establishes their manners ever after and to give you an instance of the qualification of the masters of these infantine seminaries i will relate to you an account of the birth knowledge and endowments of my neighbor monsieur de champignon who is considered as the pink of goodbreeding and flower of all schoolmasters  de champignon is a native of bourdeaux in the south of france his father was merryandrew to a charlatan and his mother servant and confidante to a figurante at the opera my neighbor whose birth you will admit is not in the least illustrious derived from his parents those qualities the possession of which with a small portion of industry are sufficient to make a fortune  you will naturally conclude i mean servility and impudence which as he grew toward manhood were matured and directed by the instructions of his parents and he profited by their admonitions so well that after a series of twelve years laudably spent in studying mankind and making himself on all occasions even the most infamous an instrument of pleasure to his betters he wormed himself into the good graces of a certain ridiculous baronet who advised him to set up a school and teach the french tongue for his perfect knowledge of which he undertook to be responsible though between ourselves the baronet himself cannot speak ten words of the language  de champignon followed the advice of his patron and under his protection has in a few years realised fortune sufficient to ride in his own carriage and look down with disdain on those poor beings who have been weak enough to be guided through life by principles of virtue and morality  upon rapines testifying some astonishment at the account the doctor appealed to rhubarb who notwithstanding his knowledge of one half of the story to be false nodded his head in token of an acknowledgement of the truth  as to the amusements of the town says calomel they are equally under the influence of absurdity the better sort of people assemble every evening at each others houses to drink tea and scandalize each other after which for want of ideas and information to discourse rationally to kill time they have recourse to cards when though the narrowness of their circumstances obliges them to play for trifles they practice as many tricks to obtain the stake as were ever known to the most experienced gamesters in the purlieus of st jamess  i will tell you of an occurrence that happened at a drum where i had the misfortune of doing penance yesterday evening  a mrs lepoche sent cards of invitation round to her acquaintance to spend the evening at her house among the rest she did me the honor of an invitation i obeyed the summons and immediately on my entrance i was accosted by two of the party a pair of wrinkled old maids who had been soured by the neglect of mankind into an unusual severity of disposition they attacked me openmouthed with pray doctor do you know that creature in the corner pointing to a young woman who sat blushing with confusion at the manifest impoliteness of these hags  i think it extremely wrong of mrs lepoche cries the first to be asking every creature to her drums that can boast the possession of a silk gown  i think she looks no better than she should be cries the other at length the rudeness of these stale virgins attracted the notice of the lady of the house who upon inquiring into the cause of their behavior assured them upon her honor that the person alluded to was a gentlewoman and indeed it was afterward proved upon inquiry that the father of these malevolent virgins had been formerly coachman to the uncle of this amiable stranger  to sum up all in a few words  i do most heartily hate the town and despise its inhabitants who possess neither candor nor urbanity  their manners are a satire upon politeness and their boasted borough of p  t  g  n is neither more nor less than the grave of merit the hotbed of presumption and an inexhaustible magazine of folly impertinence and virginity  after my master had indulged his splenetic disposition by making a variety of other remarks of the same malignant complexion upon the inhabitants of the place among whom he was living apparently in perfect harmony this triumvirate rose from the table rapine and the physician sauntered out to view the town and rhubarb directed his steps toward his own shop to make up a recipe for a tallowchandlers wife who had been delivered of three children the evening before and all likely to live and do well  chapter vii the ill effects that accompany the want of feeling for the miseries of our fellow creatures  account of captain hawser  his aversion to my master  their supposed reconciliation  the physicians vanity displayed on that occasion  his journey delayed by a small accident  my master discomfited  misfortune upon misfortune  the tragical issue of the expedition to mount binnacle  from my frequent conversations with my masters housekeeper whose good opinion i cultivated with the most solicitous assiduity i soon found out that the eccentricity of the doctors genius and the want of humanity that too frequently attended his surgical operations had procured him no inconsiderable share of enemies the ill effects of which he very frequently experienced by numberless little tricks that were practiced upon him to his great mortification and disquiet  before i had been quite a fortnight in calomels service i was a witness to one of these impositions which had like to have proved in its consequences of a very serious nature  among the number of the doctors most formidable enemies was one squire hawser who lived upon the side of a mountain about nine miles from p  n he had served his country onboard a man of war and passed through the different gradations of the service from midshipman to captain with distinguished honor but having a fortune of fifteen hundred a year left him by a distant relation at the close of the last war he resigned his naval command and retired to spend the remainder of his life in the improvement of his estate the protection of the poor and the enjoyment of his friend  the captain had not been settled a month in his estate when his groom breakingin a young colt at the immediate desire of his master was thrown from the back of the restive beast with such violence that it was apprehended his scull was fractured calomel as a surgeon of the highest repute for anatomical skill in the county was sent for in great haste after examining the confusion he treated their fears on the poor mans account with great pleasantry at the same time affirming that whatever he might do by hanging he would venture to assure him that he would never lose his life by a fracture the comfortable thickness of his scull putting any such accident at defiance in short by his neglect of the miserable patient for the doctor considered the life of a poor individual as of no more importance to society than that of a dog the man languished in great torment for a few days and then expired  after his death the captain for his own satisfaction had his scull examined when it was clearly perceived that an absolute fracture had taken place but one of that nature that if any the most ordinary care had been taken of it the sufferer might have survived and done well upon this information the captain whose heart overflowed with the milk of human kindness swore that if ever he met with calomel he would take the most exemplary vengeance on him for his cruelty to his domestic whose death the generous hawser could not help thinking was in a great measure unhappily though innocently owing to himself  the threats of the captain had long since reach the ears of calomel which operated upon his fears so powerfully for the doctor it must be observed was the most arrant coward upon the face of nature that he left no stone unturned to bring about a reconciliation among the foremost of his advocates on this occasion was a mr wilson a relation of the captain who promised the physician to use his interest with hawser in his behalf these circumstances coming to the ears of some wags who resided in the neighborhood and who entertained likewise a most inveterate aversion to the doctor they resolved in close divan to execute a trick upon him which they effected in the following manner  they bribed one of the captains servants to lend his liverycoat to one of their party whom they sent to calomel with the following letter which was to be delivered into his own hands written from the implacable hawser  sir an unfortunate misunderstanding having taken place between you and me i beg leave to inform you that by a thorough investigation of the cause and the kind interposition of mr wilson it is on my part entirely done away and i sincerely hope that it will be equally so on yours  i have to acquaint you that i have been confined to my room for some time with that cursed old disorder that renders life intolerable to me i mean the gout and shall esteem it as an infinite obligation if you will do me the honor of a visit this evening that you may prescribe something to relieve the insupportable anguish of  dear doctor your most humble servant hannibal hawser mount binnacle april     the doctor was at home playing a game at backgammon with his friend rhubarb when the fictitious servant delivered the abovewritten letter when the physician first saw the servants livery which he well knew a thousand fears crowded into his brain in an instant but when he opened the letter and saw the contents which he read aloud with exultation these unpleasing ideas vanished and joy and satisfaction sat triumphant in his countenance  it was some minutes before he could completely overcome the astonishment which the receipt of this letter occasioned at last he recovered himself so far as to desire the servant to give his best respects to the captain and to inform him that he should do himself the honor to wait upon him with all convenient speed  as soon as the servant was gone  there says the doctor handing the letter to rhubarb what do you think of me now am i to consider myself indebted to my abilities as a physician for this condescension in the captain or the kindnesses of my friend wilson  i should rather imagine that you are obliged entirely to your abilities doctor says the humble parasite which without flattery may be placed in the same class with a boerhaave a celsus or an hippocrates and are indeed if properly known the glory of your country  you are perfectly in the right rhubarb replies the doctor your remarks are pertinent and just  damme if i ever thought before that you had half the discernment which i find you possess the modest apothecary bowed his head for the compliment while my master desired me to get his two horses sorrel and slyboots saddled immediately and to bring them round to the halldoor while he drew on his boots  whether it was owing to the consideration of the fee which he already touched in imagination the thoughts of being reconciled to hawser whose resentment he dreaded little less than that of the devil himself or the welltimed compliments of rhubarb upon his physical skill i will not pretend to determine but it is certain that then and only then for the first time in his life a spark of liberality illumined his sordid heart so far that he absolutely called for a bottle of port which he invited rhubarb to partake of and as small pressing is necessary where the mind is willing the apothecary complied and so warmly did they sacrifice to bacchus while the potation lasted that they finished the bottle in something more than ten minutes drinking success to the faculty and a general indisposition to the rest of mankind at the death of the last glass it was very apparent that the physicians understanding was somewhat wounded when he rose from his seat to ride with all haste to mount binnacle  but this progress was retarded by an unlucky accident which discomfited poor calomel very much when i had saddled the horses and agreeably to my masters directions brought them round to the halldoor he called me in to help him on with his boots and while i was performing that part of my duty some mischievous boys had contrived to tie the prickly part of a gooseberrybush under the tail of the doctors horse which in his great hurry to depart he did not perceive when he got on horseback but the instant he bestrided his old favorite sorrel the beast began to kick and rear up in a manner that threw the physician into the utmost terrors however inspired by the fumes of his own port he ventured to clap his spurs in the sides of sorrel who being unused to such an unwelcome salutation and irritated by the bush at his posteriors sprang forward and began to plunge with his rider with great fury and presently unburdened calomel of his hat and wig upon which the doctor who was a timid horseman clung fast hold of the mane but notwithstanding all the physicians prudence and in spite of his cries to the people to stop the horse sorrel set off in a full gallop and never ceased till he came to the confines of a wet bog into which with the utmost disdain he threw the unfortunate son of galen who now stuck in the filth up to the armpits roaring out for help with the lungs of a stentor  as soon as i saw sorrel gallop off with my master i followed as fast as possible attended by numbers of the towns people who so far from pitying his mischance seemed to be gratified at the doctors nasty situation after many entreaties on my part and unnumbered prayers on his we prevailed on an old woman and a travellingtinker to assist me in rescuing the crestfallen calomel from the imminent perils with which he was surrounded immediately upon his release he kneeled and returned his creator thanks for his timely delivery for i forgot to remark that the doctor was apparently very religious though he did not possess a single grain of charity  by this time we were joined by his friend rhubarb who after wiping his clothes helped me to place the doctor on my horse which was quiet enough being a miserable beast which he had received as part of payment from a poor widow with seven young children for his attendance on her husband who had lately died in a high fever in this manner we reconducted him to town when after rubbing his temples with vinegar and giving him a large glass of brandy we recruited his spirits so far that he sent me to the inn for a postchaise while he put on some clean clothes and linen determined that neither the expense of the chaise nor the consequences of the accident should be the means of losing so profitable a patient as captain hawser which he might do if he did not pay that attention to his letter which a man of his spirit and consequence naturally expected  being strictly enjoined to make haste i presently returned with the chaise into which the doctor stepped having already cleaned himself amid the gibes and sneers of a concourse of the neighbors who surrounded the carriage  after giving the postchaise boy directions to drive to mount binnacle with all imaginable expedition i got on my bucephalus and followed my master  it may be necessary here to inform the reader of the situation of affairs at mount binnacle at the time of our arrival  captain hawser who had actually been confined with the gout for a considerable time a circumstanee that calomel well knew was about an hour before we paid him our visit seized with one of those paroxysms that are attendant on the disorder which for the time by the acute pain they create almost deprive the patient of his senses and which working on the active disposition of hawser rendered him peevish and inflamed him to the highest pitch of irritability added to this he had just received an account of the loss of the ship he had formerly commanded with all her crew among whom were some of his dearest friends in the gulf of florida in a hard gale of wind these circumstances combining made the celebrated descent of orpheus into hell journeying through a path of roses in comparison to that which the devoted detested but selfsufficient calomel was about to undertake  as soon as we reached the iron gates at the entrance of the park i rang the bell when the porter who had received his instructions accompanied with a bribe opened the gates for the doctor with marks of great respect which calomel thought proceeded entirely from the directions of his master and giving him sixpence he inquired after the health of the captain when the servant informed him that he was in the greatest agonies with the gout which corresponding with the account he had received he said aye aye my friend but i will soon put him upon his legs i warrant you  then ordering the postchaise boy to drive up to the door he commanded me to knock which to do my master honor i did so loud and so long that i verily believe it might have been heard at five miles distance  the captain thinking by the loudness of the knock that it was a visit from a neighboring peer whom he expected hurried off the sopha on which he was lying enjoying a little momentary ease from his sufferings and getting upon his crutches hobbled toward the door to receive him but what artist can paint the look of hawser when instead of the expected nobleman the detested calomel presented himself before him  it was a combination of rage horror and astonishment  his eyes darted with indignant fire and his lips trembled with aggravation which the poor doctor perceiving and unfortunately attributing both that and his silence to the great anguish he was undergoing he walked up with the utmost confidence to the captain and was attempting to feel his pulse when hawser recovering the use of his faculties and collecting all the might he was master of with one stroke of his crutch for he was a large athletic man struck the exulting calomel such a tremendous blow on the scull as felled him instantly to the ground where he lay gasping and kicking for life like a wounded salmon in a fishingboat till a repetition of the blow put a period to his capering  he now lay extended at his length and speechless as harry the eighth in his tomb at westminster when this irascible commander ordered his servants to take the body to the horsepond which they gladly obeyed and taking hold each of an arm and a leg they conveyed the fallen victim to a large pool in a yard adjoining the house which served as a reservoir for all the filth and ordure of the family the captain following on his crutches to see his orders strictly obeyed into which without either caution or mercy like falstaffs fat paunch hissing hot they plunged the pummelled carcass of this redoubted prime minister of death who did not recover the use of his speech until the third time of rising in the water when he had just strength enough left to crawl to the side and shake off a part of the mud and dung with which he was very near being suffocated  as soon as he could speak and understood his situation in spite of his terrors he threatened to prosecute hawser for damages when the captain damning him for his impudence ordered the large mastiff in the yard to be unchained which calomel perceiving he took to his heels and ran for his life with the swiftness of a greyhound and had got within a few yards of the iron gate at the entrance of the park when the dog seized the poor physician by the breech and did not quit his hold till he had torn his clothes all to fragments and had not left a piece of his breeches or a remnant of his shirt hanging together when the servants probably apprehensive of his losing his life took the mastiff off and left the miserable calomel on the ground gasping for life and entirely destitute of a rag to cover him in that state he crept into the chaise with a countenance strongly denoting misery and woe and ordering me to follow him drove to his own house  chapter viii our return to p  n  my masters lamentations  the danger of being in too great hurry  a battle in a bedchamber  the doctors metamorphosis  the sarcastic compliments of his acquaintance  his chagrin  my reflections  we arrived home after the deplorable expedition to mount binnacle about eight oclock in the evening my master having charged the postillion not to enter the town until it was quite dark lest his disgrace should be discovered which he knew would be treated only as a jest by the neighborhood unaccompanied with either pity or assistance  as soon as he had got safe into his own house he threw himself into a chair and after sighing most piteously for a few minutes began to talk very loud in the french language which from the small knowledge of it that i had gleaned i soon understood to be a volley of curses which he uttered with all the gestures of a man in the last stage of horror and despair  when his rage had a little subsided by the entreaties of his housekeeper he suffered himself to be conveyed to bed where he had not been above an hour before i carried him a basin of hot water gruel and found him asleep but at the same time furiously agitated talking as in a dream and frequently repeating the words death damages and damnation at last i ventured to awake him and sitting upright in the bed he seized the gruel and being insensible attempted to drink it off at a draught like so much water when the hot beverage scalded his throat in so shocking a manner that he roared out like a goaded bull and laying hold of my ear which he squeezed without mercy endeavored to throw the remainder of the gruel in my face but perceiving his intention and bobbing down my head he threw it directly in the face of the housekeeper who had just entered the apartment to inquire after his health which salutation made her shriek and roar not less loud though infinitely more discordant than the doctor after running about the chamber menacing vengeance against the author of her pain and dancing as frantic as a drunken welchman on the first of march she flew to the bed and tearing down the clothes under which the doctor had retreated from her fury began to belabour the head shoulders and flank of poor calomel with a pair of tremendous fists which for size and sinewy strength were equal to those of any bruiser in the british dominions after she had amused herself at the expense of the doctors bones for a few minutes he being unable to bear the effect of her vengeance any longer suddenly turned round and fastening his teeth in the left arm of this domestic thalestris obliged her to desist from the farther prosecution of her resentment a parley now took place and mutual apologies having passed between them they put the best complexion they were able upon their several disasters and the housekeeper repairing to the kitchen to dress her wounds left her master groaning under the severe pressure of a train of evils which had pursued him without intermission in the course of that memorable day while i slunk to my homely bed composed of an old mattress stuffed with straw to seek repose in the arms of morpheus  the next morning at the usual hour the illfated doctor made his appearance but so rueful and dejected and so black and blue with the bruises that he had received that it was scarcely possible to know him after giving orders to be denied to every person that should call upon him excepting his associate rhubarb he began to practice every expedient that could heal his wounds and render him fit once more to mingle with society and after being a close prisoner in his own house for a week he began to venture abroad having almost wholly recovered by that time his usual pertness and vivacity  when he first sallied forth among his acquaintance he was soon convinced that the calamities which befell him at mount binnacle were no secret one asked him with seeming earnestness after the captains health another congratulated him upon his reconciliation with so opulent and respectable a family while a third inquired with prodigious eagerness after the state of his own health which he assured him he heard with great sorrow had confined him to his bedchamber i heard it was a violent fit of the rheumatism cried a fourth a fifth asserted it was an ague and a sixth heard it was a fever at last after a sullen silence on the part of calomel during their impertinent inquiries he stopped their mouths by informing them that they were all right for he really had been suffering for some days from a complication of disorders which from the various symptoms he had experienced bore some sort of affinity to the different complaints alluded to  as it is frequently said that we may even extract good out of evil i was tempted to hope that the doctors misfortunes would make him reflect upon his own want of humanity indeed notwithstanding the baseness of his disposition i saw him reduced to such a state of abject humiliation that i could not avoid pitying him and as i perceived that he talked less and thought more than usual i had no doubt of his amendment  chapter ix my masters endeavors to procure satisfaction but he is defeated  the necessity of preserving a good character  his attention to a female patient mistaken for gallantry  the horrid consequences  the sagacity of a country magistrate  the doctor exhibits evident signs of insanity  the arrival of his friend rhubarb  his notions of the administration of public justice  as soon as my master was convinced that the sad issue of his journey to captain hawser was known all over the country he determined to apply for justice and endeavor by procuring large damages against him to satisfy himself for the indignities he had suffered and the dangers he had undergone but the character of calomel was so universally despised and that of his aggressor so generally respected that he could not with all his art and industry procure a bill to be returned by the grand jury so the doctor was reduced to the disagreeable necessity of chewing the cud of resentment in silence  but notwithstanding his late disgraces his practice in the joint capacities of physician and surgeon was by no means diminished and as manmidwife he brought more children into the world than half the accoucheurs in the country being retained by a young butcher in the town to attend his wife during her pregnancy who was remarkably handsome the doctors evil genius who never entirely forsook him took an active part in the affair which terminated greatly to his dissatisfaction one morning when he paid a visit to mrs marrowbone for that was the name of his fair patient there happened to be present a mischievous gossip to whom the doctor had formerly given offense and who to be revenged took especial care to represent the carriage and behavior of calomel in such a disadvantageous light to the husband of mrs marrowbone that he determined to watch the doctors motions and if ever he discovered any impropriety or indelicacy on the part of the physician toward his wife to take ample revenge  one day when the doctor had been dining at the table of an acquaintance where he drank more than a quantum sufficit of wine for he always exceeded the bounds of discretion in that particular when it was attended with no expense to himself on his return home as he passed by mrs marrowbones door he stepped in to ask her how she was the butcher who accidentally saw the doctor go into his house in the evening and suspecting his intentions to be carnally and not physically directed followed him in and getting unperceived into an adjoining closet to the room in which his wife was then sitting put his eye to a crevice whence he could easily distinguish every thing that passed he had not remained long in that situation when his attention was rouzed and his temper naturally jealous was fired by some expressions of the doctor toward his wife which he conceived to border upon too much familiarity the fact is the physicians spirits had been wound up to a high pitch of vivacity by his friends wine and cheerful conversation which operated so powerfully upon his actions that he could not avoid mixing a little smattering of gallantry in his dialogue with mrs marrowbone though to do him justice in his sober moments he had as little desire for the finest woman in the creation as a jew rabbi for a porksteak and the doctor even proceeded so far in his indiscretions as to attempt to ravish a kiss which the butcher perceiving from his hiding place he burst into the room and before calomel could recover from the consternation into which this unseasonable visit threw him made him an instantaneous present of such a violent blow in the eye with all the force he was able as drove the ball fairly into the socket and so discomposed his optic nerves that every object in the  00m seemed to the doctor to be dancing before him but upon receiving another blow upon the stomach equally salutary he measured his length upon the floor and crept under the bed with all the dexterity he was able whence he was drawn out by the enraged butcher who throwing calomel upon his back kneeled upon his breast while he whetted a long knife which hung by his side and swore with the most dreadful imprecations that he would instantly disqualify the doctor from all attempts of that nature for the future and was proceeding to put his threats in execution when the physician with uplifted hands and his eyes swimming in tears entreated the butcher for the love of god to desist from his bloody purpose every now and then interlarding his prayers with crying murder as loud as he was able upon hearing the noise some of the neighbors rushed in and prevailed on the butcher to release him which at length he consented to with infinite reluctance  as soon as the doctor got fairly out of the door he set off running as fast as if satan himself had been in pursuit of him and never stopped to look back until he was quite at his own door at which knocking lustily i ran in haste to open it and there saw my miserable master with one eye swelled as it were out of his head and his face covered with blood and dirt the instant he got in the housekeeper seeing his dirty condition brought him some warm water to wash his face after which he informed us of every particular swearing that he would never rest in his bed until he got revenge for so unparalleled an outrage  when he had got his face cleaned and a bandage to his eye he flapped his hat and walked out to a justice of the peace who lived within a few paces of his own house at the same time desiring me to follow him and after presenting himself before the justice he made his complaint in very moving terms upon hearing which his worship commiserated his misfortunes and assured him that justice should be done him  the magistrate sent his servant immediately to the butcher to desire him to attend and requested my master to sit down until his arrival after waiting about half an hour in came marrowbone with his wife and half a score neighbors and so far was the doctor from gaining any satisfaction that in the course of the butchers deposition he had eloquence enough to convince the magistrate who was not one of the wisest of mankind that calomel meant no less than to dishonor him which deposition was strengthened by the evidence of the wife and two of the neighbors upon which in spite of all the doctors protestations of innocence the justice advised him to make up the matter with the butcher in the best manner he was able at the same time cautioning the physician against all such attempts for the future  the poor doctor foamed at the mouth with vexation and even went so far as to charge the justice with partiality in the proceeding which the other received in such dudgeon that he told calomel if he was in the husbands place he would not only sue him for damages which no court of justice he said would refuse on such corroborating evidence but would publish the story to the world and ruin his character this last suggestion of the magistrate alarmed the doctor very much who now lowering his note declared he was willing to dismiss the parties to which proposal the butcher was so far from agreeing that he demanded reparation for the injury he had received in which he was supported by the magistrate as a matter perfectly just and equitable the apprehension of being exposed in that situation to the world wrought upon the doctor so forcibly that he asked the butcher what sum he expected marrowbone replied he would drop the affair for a consideration of forty guineas to which proposal the physician who would as soon have parted with so many ounces of his hearts blood remaining inexorable the justice interfered and settled the sum at twenty guineas at last both parties agreeing with great reluctance the doctor deposited the sum and walked out of the magistrates house without wishing him a good evening grumbling and muttering all the way to his own door being greatly dissatisfied at the conduct of the justice in the whole transaction  the moment he got into his study he walked about the room with great agitation cursing singing and crying by turns then tore his wig and throwing it on the floor stamped upon it with great violence then run his head against the wall and began to caper about the place in such a manner that i had not the least doubt remaining of his brain being disordered so stealing out of the room i locked the door on the outside resolving not to venture into the room by myself  after sitting by the kitchenfire for about a quarter of an hour the housekeeper who had been out to procure some necessaries for the family coming in i told her the story which terrified her almost as much as myself it was at last resolved that i should go for mr rhubarb but he happened fortunately to knock at the door just at that instant when we unlocked the door of the doctors study i found him with his head upon the table fast asleep and snoring comfortably without his wig  mr rhubarb expressed great sorrow at seeing his friend and patron so maltreated and in so comfortless a situation but desiring the housekeeper to bring his woollen nightcap the officious apothecary tied it under his chin and advised us to conduct him to bed which endeavoring to put in execution the doctor awoke and perceiving his friend and counselor mr rhubarb he embraced him seemingly with great affection at the same time the tears ran down his cheeks so copiously that my heart melted within me here he recounted the adventures and mistakes which had reduced him to such a pitiable condition venting the severest curses and calling the magistrate by the most opprobrious epithets at the instigation of rhubarb he permitted us to convey him to his bedchamber and there while he was sitting on the edge of the bed undressing himself he amused us with a dissertation on the perversion of the distinction of right and wrong and the glaring folly of the legislature in appointing individuals to be magistrates whose educations are narrow and whose principles are vulnerable and to do him justice he handled the subject with a degree of ingenuity and knowledge that sufficiently proved him in the possession of a keen and strong understanding  now we left him to enjoy a comfortable nights rest of which indeed he had great occasion not only to recruit his spirits but his strength to encounter a series of unnumbered calamities which the flintyhearted destinies had decreed should torment him on the following day  chapter x fresh storms gathering for my master  the necessity of being modest in public conversation  give a dog an ill name and you had better hang him  the arrival of a scotch physician  the inefficacy of lying  calomel invited to a supper  falls into a pit of distress  a certain cure for black eyes  one evil springing out of the womb of another  the climax of human wretchedness  a large party of highlanders arriving in the town on their way from dublin to cork and some of the officers spending the evening at the inn with the gentlemen of the place a thought came into the head of a pleasant fellow who was one of the party to put another trick upon calomel which if it succeeded and was carried on properly would effectually reduce him so far that he would never be able to hold his head up again or mortify him to that degree as to oblige him to quit the town a circumstance most ardently wished for by a majority of the inhabitants to whom he had made himself exceedingly obnoxious  the scheme was built upon the doctors frequent boasting in company that when he was at glasgow prosecuting his medical studies he was signalized and honored for his peculiar industry and penetration and that one of the most eminent physicians of that country a dr macgreggor kept up a constant correspondence with him ever since  now it was resolved that a captain crazy a determined enemy of the doctors and one of the party should dress himself in a highland played and being an excellent mimic should pass for the surgeon of the regiment and nephew to the scotch physician in question  and that he should send his compliments to dr calomel and acquaint him that he would do himself the honor of paying his respects to him before he left the town accordingly the card was written and a man dispatched with it to his house in the mean while crazy and another of the party put on the highland uniform and agreeably to promise after disguising their faces went to calomels and knocked at the door the doctor on any other occasion would have been proud to have received such a mark of respect from the nephew of so great a man but circumstanced as he was at that time with a most tremendous black eye he would most willingly have declined the interview however they came in so unawares that they absolutely took the doctor by surprise who was then in the act of adjusting himself to hide his disgrace as much as lay in his power after the first ceremonies were over and calomel had made the necessary inquiries after the health of his friend macgreggor the pretended surgeon asked him how he came by so disagreeable an accident as that of a black eye the question abashed the doctor at first but assuming an air of indifference and a spirit of lying being among the rest of his qualifications he told them that having occasion to get up in the night in attempting to go down stairs his foot slipped and he fell from the top to the bottom and struck his eye against a stool which his servant had carelessly left there after winding up the clock which stood at the bottom of the stairs they pitied his case and to all appearance swallowed the doctors circumstantial lie with great credulity upon the pretended surgeons begging leave to look at it calomel complied with a great deal of unwillingness and upon the parties going to the window to examine it the surgeon took care while he was feeling the swelling which was prodigiously large and inflamed to give him such pinches and handled the business so roughly that calomel in spite of all his endeavors to the contrary could not help wincing and grinding his teeth with torture till at last the pretended nephew of macgreggor gave him such a confounded pinch that the doctor losing all patience bellowed like a stuck pig exclaiming with great vociferation that he could not endure more pain in an amputation upon which the other asking pardon the doctor appeared perfectly satisfied  after some desultory discourse upon the state of physic in scotland a subject which the doctors visitor avoided as much as possible they parted but not before the physician had made a promise to spend the evening at the inn when calomel started some objections relative to his eye the other assured him upon his honor that he was in possession of the means of curing it in the course of a single night and that he would do himself the pleasure of removing so ungentlemanlike and perplexing a disfigurement that very evening for which kind and polite intention calomel professed himself very happy  at the appointed hour for meeting in the evening the doctors newlyacquired friends accompanied with two or three more implacable foes to calomel properly disguised and a few scotch officers assembled together expecting the physician every minute  i must inform my readers that my master was so elevated with the idea of his own consequence which he conceived to be greatly heightened by the late visit that he made a point to go among his acquaintance and publish the circumstance as a matter materially resounding to his personal honor and character he set forth the respect that was entertained for his abilities in other countries and at the same time hinted how much the people of p  n were indebted to him for residing among them  the time arriving that he was to repair to the inn he put on his best wig nicely powdered for the occasion and curled as close as a cauliflower and getting into a chair he proceeded to the rendezvous with a heart as light as pride and vanity could make it when he entered the room the gentlemen rose and insisted upon his taking the chair at the upper end of the table which with a little affectation of modesty he accepted after a dozen glasses had circulated briskly the doctors unbound eye began to twinkle and not entirely without a cause for these wags had slily infused a quantity of brandy into every glass of wine the doctor drank while he proud of exhibiting his talents for disputation was holding forth to the rest of the company and explaining with great energy the origin and exertion of the muscles  at last conceiving a disrelish for the wine a large bowl of punch was ordered which they placed before calomel who bending over the bowl lost his equilibrium and falling along the table was with some difficulty replaced in his chair by his comic companions but not without disordering his wig in such a manner that it was impossible he could put it on his head any more that evening for the truth is when the doctor first lost the center of gravity in plunging forward his nicelydressed wig fell into the punchbowl where it was swimming for a period of five minutes while they were fixing the physician in his presidential chair but the doctor complaining that his head was cold they called for a red nightcap which the landlord brought and with that they protected his seat of knowledge and medical skill from the assaults of the cold air  it was now proposed by the fictitious surgeon to apply the remedy to the doctors eye which he assenting to by a nod being entirely overcome with liquor they tipped the landlord a wink who went out and returned in a few minutes with a platefull of guts taken warm from a sheep that was just killed which putting in a coarse cloth they applied smoking hot to the maimed eye and cheek of the passive doctor who having fallen into a sound sleep lay snoring in his chair drunk and insensible to all their kind exertions for the restoration of his health  after having tied on this neverfailing plaster for his recovery which moderately speaking covered threefourths of his head and enjoying the brilliant success of their design for some time they ordered a chair and putting the physician into it sent him home dead drunk with his wig dropping wet in his lap before him the chairmen who had been previously made tipsy for the purpose had not proceeded far with their burden when the foremost man stumbling against a stone which lay in his way lost his hold and falling to the ground the chair dropped with him the door of which being unfastened within flew open and lodged the blackvisaged doctor in the mud the chairmen being almost as drunk as their employer and not perceiving his disaster got up and made the best of their way to the doctors house hearing the chair stop i ran with the light but guess our surprise when we found the vehicle unoccupied  the chairmen were thunderstruck and all the housekeeper and i could get out of them was that they were certain the doctor got into the sedan at the inn  in the midst of concern for our masters safety it was determined that i should go to mr rhubarb and endeavor with him to discover what had become of the doctor accordingly i went and called mr rhubarb who imagining it was a summons to attend some person that had been taken sick in the night jumped up and dressing himself with uncommon alacrity inquired who was unwell but seeing me and understanding that the doctor was missing he appeared very much alarmed and taking hat cloak and stick we sallied forth in quest of this medical child of innumerable misfortunes after rambling about the town for above half an hour to no purpose and wet to the skin for it rained extremely hard we resolved to give over the pursuit but on turning the corner of the marketplace we heard a noise much resembling that of a man groaning and going up to inquire the cause there we found the pitiable calomel for by this time the wet and cold he had sustained awaked him groping in the surrounding mud for assistance and he was so disfigured that had it not been for his voice we never should have recognized his person  after getting him upon his legs rhubarb called up a poor woman who lived hard by the place and when she had struck a light we guided this miserable disciple of hippocrates into the house when mr rhubarb first saw his head he burst into an exclamation of ch  t j  s what have we here sure this is not the doctor  yes but it is though you sneaking clysterpipe son of a whore cries calomel at the same time belching most immoderately if it is not me who is it tell me that  do you hear  i beg your pardon doctor cries rhubarb i did not mean to give you offense upon my honor  you and your honor may be damned together  do you hear me now  here is a pretty scou  ou  ou  ndrel to be talking of honor that sells the powder of rotten wood for julep and ground oistershells for magnesia alba  i scorn your words replied the other  you and your scorn may go to the devil together said the doctor  do you hear me now you dried eelskin  here house bring me some brandy for i am cursed dry  the apothecary and i stared with astonishment at each other and could scarce believe we were in our senses but perceiving his head tied up and the wildness of his eye and discourse cooperating with our fears we took it for granted that by some shocking accident the scull was fractured and that the sensorium was wounded by the contusion however with the assistance of the old woman of the house we made him three quarts of whey which forcing down his throat we perceived his reason to return apace  when he came a little to himself rhubarb ventured to inquire what was the cause of his head being bound up in so extraordinary a manner all we could gather from his answer was that it was put on by dr macgreggor  who is dr macgreggor cries the other  oh by my soul says the doctor one that will flog all your country for knowledge my lad of physic  galen and esculapius were but fools to him  it is he has the notes for it  by this time the copious draughts of whey that he had drunk mixing with the vile dregs of the spirituous liquor in his stomach caused an insurrection in that sensible part of the frame that put a total stop to calomels eulogium on his friend macgreggor and after turning up the white of his eye with great energy his face appeared as agitated by strong convulsions which lasted until nature harrassed with such a combination of liquids impelled the physician to discharge the nauseating load which lighting on the neck of the old woman who was stooping to rekindle her fire ran down her back and shoulders like a torrent and made her stink more offensive than a boghouse in the dog days rhubarb all the while kept slapping his patron on the back who giving a violent strain to bring up the last remains of the filthy cargo burst the bandage which tied the plaster to his eye when the guts and garbage falling to the ground fairly suffocated a young kitten that was fast asleep at the doctors feet when rhubarb saw the ingredients of macgreggors plaster he lifted up his eyes in astonishment and calomel confounded and chopfallen swore that he would never receive the soft blessing of rest until he had wreaked his resentment on the caitiff who had used him so unworthily  chapter xi the doctor passes a night of great uneasiness  seeks his persecutor in the morning  is guilty of a small mistake which throws him into a paroxysm of despair  receives a threatening letter  to avoid public shame he retires to a relations and i am discharged from his service  while the doctor and his friend rhubarb passed the remainder of the night at the old womans cabin that they might not fail to find out dr macgreggor in the morning which if they went to bed they apprehended might be the case as the highlanders were ordered to assemble in the morning early at the marketplace for the purpose of proceeding on their route to cork i was dispatched home to bring a change of clothes and linen that my master might be properly dressed to call his brother in physical iniquity to a proper account for the affront he had received at his hands overnight on my return we used every expedient to array him properly  we stripped the doctor stark naked and washed him with buckets of water from head to foot and after rubbing him dry by frequently giving him whey and buttermilk recovered him pretty tolerably so that when aurora thought proper to give birth to a new day the physician had almost totally surmounted his late indisposition and considering every thing cut a better figure as a human being than could well have been expected from the variety of misery he had so recently experienced  as soon as we heard the drums of the highland regiment beating a reveilly to call the soldiers to assemble the purified doctor began to breathe nothing but denunciations of vengeance against the supposed nephew of the celebrated dr macgreggor he swore with great bitterness of expression that no consideration whatever should restrain him from publicly chastising the object of his wrath  he had scarcely finished this menacing and terrific prologue to the approaching farce when the old woman whom he had dispatched to the marketplace for the purpose of bringing the earliest account of their mustering returned to inform my master that the scotchmen had already formed their ranks with every man his knapsack and appeared equipped at all points for an immediate departure  this information rouzed the maltreated calomel who attended by his faithful ally mr rhubarb and myself sallied forth to the proposed scene of action my master hurried on with prodigious haste until we came within fifty paces of the marketplace when his walking became slower and slower and it was evident by the livid paleness of his countenance and the quivering of his lips that he sorely repented of his rashness when he came within sight of the soldiers he suddenly turned about and addressed his friend rhubarb in the following manner his knees trembling under him all the while  dont you think now mr rhubarb that this action of mine favors strongly of a bloody and desperate disposition if it come to a duel i know i shall certainly kill him and you must be convinced that is but little short of murder  no i know my own rashness says he with trembling accents  it is an unchristianlike deed to seek revenge and i will go no farther  what says rhubarb shocked at his want of spirit will you permit such an outrage committed on your person to go unpunished  oh fie doctor  it must not be says rhubarb at the same time giving him a shove with his shoulder which drove the petrified physician three yards nearer to the enemy  my master finding it impossible to retreat with honor as things had been already carried so far made the best of the embarrassment and assuming all the importance he was able walked up to the commanding officer shaking all the way like a man in a palsy and putting his cane to his nose asked for dr macgreggor in as authoritative a tone as he possibly could assume the officer perceiving that he was not treated with all that respect which he conceived to be his due looked down upon this harbinger of death with ineffable contempt at the same time remaining silent but upon the doctors repeating the question a young ensign who stood at his elbow told him there was no such man in the regiment calomel replied that was impossible for he had invited him in propria persona but the day before and had likewise spent the evening in his company at the inn with six officers belonging to the corpse and had received such ungentlemanlike usage that he demanded satisfaction  here the commanding officer perceiving the mistake assured him upon his honor there was no such person belonging to the regiment the physician was thunderstruck but observing the master of the inn at a distance he beckoned him to him and asked him before a whole circle of people who had by this time gathered round the doctor if he knew who it was he was in company with the evening before at his house  the innkeeper replied perfectly well  that they were a parcel of gentlemen of the town who had dressed themselves for the sake of a frolic in the highland uniform  the doctor hastily inquired who it was that called for the wine and hearing it was mr mneil he appeared thoughtful for a few seconds and recollecting his features and the successful effect of their stratagem at his expense together with the ridiculous boastings he had made of the honor of such a connection the blood forsook his cheeks and he absolutely fainted away in the arms of the apothecary being completely overcome by a strong sense of shame grief and mortification  in this state he was conveyed home before he recovered the use of his faculties which he no sooner found himself in possession of than he tore his hair and beat his breast with uncommon violence and with the tears trickling down his face he kneeled upon the ground and with the most infernal execrations cursed himself and the womb that brought him forth at the same time vowing an eternal enmity with all mankind  the perturbation of his mind was so great that not only rhubarb but the housekeeper and myself expected nothing less from such excessive agitations but an instantaneous deprivation of his senses his friend declaring him in a high fever he was put to bed which he kept for a fortnight refusing to take any kind of sustenance or refreshment for the first three days  when he had pretty well overcome the dreadful effects of the malady he received one morning while he was sitting by himself and ruminating upon the sad events of his too easy credulity the two following curious epistles the last of which was delivered open  to dr francis calomel sir this is to let you know that if you dont deposit the sum of fifty guineas under the gate that leads into your meadow at the back of your house this evening before nine oclock you shall have reason to repent it as long as you live for we are determined to watch you the first time that you stir out of town and after cutting off your ears and slitting your nose to carry you into the middle of the bog and bury you alive and thereby rid the community of an arrant scoundrel so pray take a friends advice and do as you are desired or expect the consequences from your determined foes  cornelius cutthroat peter perdition and phelim otawney  feb     after staring with his eyes fixed upon me in a wild manner the letter dropped from his hands and he exclaimed with great emphasis and force of expression  ch  t have mercy upon us  what these villains want first to murder me and then to bury me alive  aye but i will be damned if they do  it was some time before i could divert him from his reverie to inform him that there was a second letter for him which with trembling hands he took off the table  what opened too  well says calomel it cannot be worse than the former if it even came from the devil himself upon unfolding it he read as follows  to dr francis calomel sir you are hereby summoned at your peril to attend us next thursday morning to answer the complaints of thady ocarrol and bryan obrogue for breaking the glasses of their sedanchair when you were brought in a state of intoxication from the inn a few nights since and not to depart the court without leave  walter jolterhead esqr timothy numscull esqr    when he had finished perusing the second unwelcome epistle he put it in his mouth and began to chew it with great emotion and from that and other unfavourable symptoms we were apprehensive of a return of the phrensy which had accompanied his fever to a dreadful degree but luckily in the midst of our alarms his friend rhubarb called upon him whose presence never failed to give him some solace even in the utmost extremities of his chagrin the doctor signifying a desire for us to retire we left the physical twain in close consultation  at the expiration of half an hour mr rhubarb came into the kitchen and told me that my master had taken a resolution to pass some time at a distant relations of his who lived in the next county until his present disgrace should be forgotten in the town at the same time telling me to provide myself with another master as he should have no farther occasion for my services  after receiving my wages which with what i had deducted for clothes and other necessaries amounted in the course of upwards of two years service to just two pounds nine shillings and seven pence three farthings i quitted the service of this most extraordinary character to go once more in pursuit of that most capricious of all whimsical females fortune  chapter xii i take leave of the

part of my wardrobe tied up in a handkerchief which putting at the end of a crabstick i threw them across my shoulder and bade adieu to p  n for ever  taking the road to dublin i had traveled on somewhat better than seven miles when i began to find myself in want of refreshment and stopping at a small town i went into a little meanlooking publichouse distinguished from the rest by a miserable sign which the artist meant should be taken for the venerable figure of st patrick in the act of driving all venomous reptiles out of the land of saints  on my entering i found the whole family had just sat down to dinner and hunger at that time being the greatest of the evils i endured i resolved to take advantage of my good fortune and remove it so boldly marching in i told the landlord if it were agreeable i would make one among them offering at the same time to pay whatever he should think necessary he gladly accepted my offer and one and all seemed to strive who should be foremost to accommodate the young stranger so taking my place by a lusty blackeyed wench whom i afterward found to be the landlords eldest daughter i began to assail the wholesome dainties of the table which consisted of a piece of salt pork boiled  some red herrings  a profusion of potatoes  and some griddlebread and indeed it was extremely fortunate that i was so sharp set for while i was casting an eye of admiration toward the rosy wench that sat at my right hand the master of the house had filled my plate so full of the best of every thing at the table that it formed a kind of pyramid behind which i sat entrenched and lost in a kind of astonishment which is not so much to be wondered at as i had so recently left the oeconomic table of dr calomel who would not willingly have allowed me so much victuals for a weeks subsistence as this poor man designed should be only a part of one meal  after i had allayed the cravings of my appetite which at the first encounter bordered a little on the voracious i had time and opportunity to survey the rest of the family  besides the host who was a hearty facetious man and his buxom daughter we had the company of his wife who did the honors of her table if it may be allowed that the fulfilling them consists in making every one around her eat plentifully for my part she so teazed me with her importunities to devour more than i was able that i longed most ardently for a removal of the victuals to get rid of the troublesome effects of her wellmeant hospitality  on the ground at one corner of the apartment were three fubby masculine children the eldest not more than six years old as naked as when they came out of their mothers womb surrounding a large wooden dish full of potatoes out of which they were eating lustily accompanied by the like number of pigs who by their noise in eating formed a kind of concert the grunting of the pigs serving as a kind of bass which accorded perfectly well with the treble and tenor squalling of the children after the swine had finished their repast they ranged about the room with that kind of confidence and dumb pleasure which clearly proved to me that they did not consider themselves by any means as inconsiderable members of the family  when i had satisfied the landlord for my refreshment i once more renewed my pedestrian expedition still keeping on the high road to the metropolis as i walked fast i overtook a pedlar and joined company with him after a few questions had passed on both sides he informed me that he was going to dublin likewise to procure a fresh assortment of goods but that being the time of the curragh meeting he proposed to stop that evening at kildare which resolution he advised me to concur in as the evening was approaching very fast  i thought his determination so proper and moreover liking his company that i instantly agreed and on we jogged together the pedlar beguiling both the time and the road by recapitulating his adventures in the course of his remarks he did not fail to warn me against the impositions of the world and recounted various instances of youth coming to a bad and an untimely end by making choice in the early part of their lives of vicious and unprincipled companions i was so well pleased with his discourse that i listened to him with very great attention and secretly blessed myself for being so uncommonly fortunate as to meet with so good and so exemplary an associate  while i was attending to the sage injunctions of this itinerant mentor we imperceptibly arrived at kildare i was so much attached to my companion that i requested him as a particular favor that he would permit me to mess and sleep with him until we reached dublin to which after some little hesitation he assented  we put up at the sign of the brogue and shamrock and having secured our bed for the use of which for one night we agreed to pay fourpence my companion whose name i now understood to be dennis blarney made many inquiries concerning the company in the town which we found was extremely respectable and numerous owing to a great match that was to be run for the next day upon the curragh of kildare for five hundred guineas we passed away the time in discoursing on various topics in which my friend blarney never failed to introduce some excellent lesson of morality  we regaled ourselves at intervals with eating bread and cheese and washing it down with copious draughts of ale brewed by our landlady as thick as water gruel and as sour as a crabapple  when we signified a desire of going to bed the hostess stepped forward and extending her hand informed me that our reckoning came to tenpencehalfpenny when my friend blarney seeing me put my hand in my pocket and pull out my money to discharge it immediately stopped me and paying the reckoning himself told me that young people like me had enough to do with their money besides treating their fellowtravellers  i was so struck with this instance of disinterested generosity in such a man that i could have hugged him with transports of gratitude and respect  the good woman now showed us to our bed to which we ascended by the help of an old ladder  it was placed in a kind of loft in which we were forced to bend double the rafters of the cieling and the floor being within three feet of each other  after our landlady had strictly charged us to take care of our light which was a dried rush dipped in grease she left us to our private meditations the dreary appearance around me made me undress myself and get into bed as fast as possible which my moral friend blarney perceiving rebuked me in very severe terms for lying down to rest without first returning thanks for the blessings and comforts i had enjoyed through the day i was so confounded and ashamed that although it was a cold night i got out of bed and kneeling by the side of blarney he made me repeat such a long succession of prayers that every joint trembled with cold at last thinking proper to end his devotions we got into bed and bein very much fatigued with traveling so many miles i instantly fell asleep  but how great was my surprise when i awoke in the morning and found my partner gone however concluding that he had some business to transact in the town and that when he had performed it he would return and call me i remained perfectly satisfied and insensibly fell into another doze from which i was rouzed by the woman of the house who asked me in a very rough manner if i meant to sleep all day as well as all night upon which i asked her what time of the morning it was  time says she why it is time to go to dinner at which i was so startled that i got up and dressed myself in a few minutes and descending the ladder inquired if she had seen my bedfellow that morning  seen him says she no no dennis blarney knows better than to be seen in kildare by daylight i warrant him that he is a good ten mile of the road by this time when i inquired into the meaning of her suggestions she told me that he was as big a villain as was unhanged and had actually been tried at the assizes in that town on a suspicion of burglary  on hearing this account which i believed as neither more nor less than a downright falsehood i told the woman that certainly she was deceived for i was convinced by his behavior that he was not only an honest but a religious man at which my landlady burst into a loud laugh and asked me how long i had been acquainted with him on my replying only about three hours before i entered her house she said that was long enough in all conscience and bade me as i valued my character if ever i met blarney again to shun him as i would a thirdday ague  my stomach being by this time ready for the reception of another meal i ordered some eggs to be boiled and demolished nine in as many seconds which lest they should lie heavy i qualified with a quart of ale and inquiring how much they came to was preparing to discharge the obligation when lo i put my hand in my pocket and found my money had fled  i searched one pocket after another with the utmost trepidation but alas all to no purpose my landlady perceiving my tribulation inquired the cause and when i informed her that i had lost my money she asked what opinion i had of honest dennis blarney now who it seems notwithstanding all his morality and religion had thought proper to march off not only with my money but likewise with two shirts three pair of stockings and a linen waistcoat which i had tied up in a handkerchief and left in the room when i went to rest  i was so affected at first with my loss that i wept bitterly being left in a strange place totally destitute of friends and not a penny in my pocket to procure me food the poor woman at whose house i had lodged took companion on my distress and told me that i was extremely welcome to what i owed herself but advised me while i lived not to be overready in giving credit to the professions of men that i did not know at first for the future with this wholesome admonition in my head and abundance of sorrow in my heart i went forth from her house with a considerable addition to my experience and not a penny in my pocket  after sauntering about the place a great part of the day i chanced to pass by a gateway entirely wrapped up in contemplation on the melancholy state of my finances when a noise all on a sudden assailed me so loud shrill and discordant that i verily believed it had burst the drum of my ear after instinctively clapping my hands to my head to feel if it had not received some alteration from the violent nature of the assault i turned about and saw a fellow in a liverycoat striped waistcoat red breeches and an old goldlaced hat in the act of blowing a trumpet this prodigious exertion which indeed was not thrown away for he made the very element resound with the alarm swelled his cheeks to the resemblance of bladders overcharged with wind  when he had finished this melodious flourish which had drawn together a large auditory of men women and children he changed the mode of entertainment and proceeded to give a verbal description of the wonderful sights that were brought to the town for the mere purpose of contributing to their amusement he conveyed his lively descriptions in a voice that had i been blind i never should imagine could have issued from human organs  he seemed to heave every sentence from his lungs with prodigious difficulty and with such a terrible hoarseness of accent as rendered the pleasant sallies of his imagination almost unintelligible  this is the time my noble masters roared this herald of wonders to see the largest white bear do you see that ever was brought from the shores of greenland  its body is as large as a young elephant and every claw as thick as my leg  moreover besides that we have brought a most astonishing baboon as tall when he stands upright do you see as ever a trooper in the ligonier horse  and for the pleasure and satisfaction of my noble masters and mistresses do you see the bear and the baboon shall dance the minivit dilly core such as was danced before their majestys at windsor god bless em  the bear larnd the minivitstep from tom surly who kept a threepennyhalfpenny hop in st giless and the baboon was larnd by the famous monsieur neverashirt in pettyfrance  this is your time my hearts of gold to see the wonderful wild beestis  having by the superior eloquence of his harangue drawn a young woman to the feet of some steps that led to the scene of wonders he suddenly clapped his shoulder to her bottom while she stood gazing with her mouth wide open and fairly lifting her up three steps began to roar see how they tumble up there my hearts now is your time or never  the young woman was so confounded at her unexpected elevation that for fear of turning about and exposing herself to the mirth of the mob she paid her money at the entrance and hurried in as fast as her legs could carry her and the consequences proved that the fellows ingenious expedient of forcing the young woman in a manner to become a spectator against her own consent was well timed for the rest of the assembly began to ascend so fast that in a short space of time the room of exhibition was entirely crammed  the fellow at the door soliciting me to deposit my twopence for the sight among the rest with all the persuasion he was master of i ingenuously told him that twopence in coin was at that time more than i was worth in the whole world upon his asking if i had a strong desire to see the show and my replying in the affirmative he bade me follow him for that they were going to begin  elated with the opportunity of seeing the dance for nothing and highly pleased with the goodnatured offer of the man i followed him into a dark passage when upon lifting up the shattered remains of an old carpet i found myself on a sudden behind the scenes but the place was so dark that i could not distinguish one object from another nor should i have been able to have discovered the situation of the audience if it had not been for the thundering clamor which they made for the showman to begin  i was so embarrassed in my new sitution that i was afraid to stir for fear of doing some mischief when in the midst of a loud roar which the spectators set up for the entertainments to commence a fellow in the gallery enraged at the delay and perceiving me groping about the stage whom he mistook for the showman himself threw an apple with such force as unluckily coming full in my left eye made it actually strike fire and frightened me to that degree that attempting to make my escape i ran directly against master bruin who was sitting upon his hind legs ready to be led out to dance by his agreeable partner the baboon the strength with which i ran against the bear who had not been used to such intrusions offended him so much that quickly turning round he seized me in his paws and griping me with more violence than hercules ever did anteus made me bawl out murder without intermission until the keeper came with a light to my rescue and found me enclosed fast in the shaggy animals embrace while he was pummelling me over the head and face with his snout which it was extremely lucky for me was securely muzzled otherwise the angry brute had certainly made a breakfast on my brains  when the keeper made him quit his prey by dint of many hard blows which he gave bruin with a long pole that he kept for that purpose i dropped motionless on the ground and sainted in a fit out of which i was recovered as i afterward found by an old woman who poured a whole pailfull of water upon my face which instantaneously called me back to life but the remedy was attended with one disagreeable effect which was that it left me as wet as if i had been dipped in the river  upon my expressing some apprehensions of catching cold the old woman desired me to go with her and she would bring me to a fire that i might dry myself i at first was rather unwilling to embrace her offer for fear of losing a sight of the dance but an accident happened which made me think i could dry myself and return to the show time enough for the diversion  the occurrence was briefly this  in the general confusion when the keeper was belabouring the bear the baboon who had on more occasions than one felt the ponderous weight of his arm under a notion that possibly his turn might be next thought like many an able general that it was equally honorable and infinitely safer to make a retreat from an enemy in time whom he could not encounter without a certainty of losing the battle and in pursuance of this resolution he made the best of his way to the top of the building where he sat on a cross beam grinning with a mischievous and malignant aspect upon his master every now and then scratching his rump as if he meant to treat both him and his vengeance with sovereign contempt however the keeper who had been pretty well accustomed to the unlucky pranks of this facetious young gentleman procured a ladder and a horsewhip and was ascending to bring his excentric pupil to a proper sense of his duty when i went out with the old gentlewoman to dry myself by her fire  chapter xiii description of a minuet  the keeper apologizes for the bears want of politeness  the musician overthrown  i

the good effects of obedience in domestics  i returned from drying myself just in the nick of time for the dance between the bear and the baboon was then going to begin i must own my expectations were exceedingly great and i surveyed the progress of the brutes with particular attention when the baboon extended his paw to the bear he seemed to accept it with that sullen kind of complaisance which made it appear rather a matter of force than inclination but receiving from the showman at that instant a welldirected thump upon his posteriors it brought him to such a proper sense of decency and good manners that he immediately proceeded to the front of the stage with all the grace and agility of which he was master when a little man with one leg and as blind as a millhorse who sat on a chair in the center of the platform began to play the wellknown and equallycelebrated tune of sheelanagig upon an old violin that appeared to have received as much injury from the hand of time as himself for of the five strings which the original inventor of the instrument thought necessary to the production of perfect harmony there were but two remaining but this decrepid orpheus seemed to think very little of such an impediment for laboring away with head hands and feet he brought forth an infernal grating distant resemblance of the tune in question indeed had he performed ever so well it would have answered very little purpose for the sportive animals either from want of a musical ear or stubbornness of disposition paid so little regard to the time or the tune that it was palpable they jumped and skipped about as disorderly as if they had been both deaf to the elegant flourishes of the blind harmonist  but what they wanted in knowledge and attention they amply made up in effect for during the performance the laughter and applause that accompanied it was truly wonderful  at the close of the dance some of the more intelligent part of the audience publicly complained to the showman that the dance which they had seen was not the dance that they were promised the keeper replied that he was sorry their complaint was in one particular but too well grounded for said he i have been told as how in dancing the minevit dilly core they must not turn their backside on the audience now though i have beat the bear black and blue as it were my masters i could not for the soul of me bring him to alter his manners or to think otherwise than that his breech was to the full as honorable as any other part of his rough composition  the keepers apology for bruins want of politeness was received with great approbation and he was desired to go on with the diversions  now though the minevit might not be to your fancy altogether says the showman you shall see a hornpipe in style and damme i defy any of the great playhouses in london to show a better  the bear shall perform against any of em for a guinea and i say done first why it is no matter to me if they belong ise not afraid of my money to commongarden do you see my masters or the noted flockton  at the close of this inimitable panegyric on his companion and fellowtraveller the bear he gave him a violent thump on the head with a stick which it seems was a signal for beginning to which the animal had been so well used that he immediately began to caper about the stage in a surprising manner  the poor sightless fiddler was playing the tune of nancy dawson with great eagerness to accommodate his friend bruin as well as he was able when the master of the ceremonies not entirely satisfied with his pupils performance lifted up his stick to the shaggy actor in a threatening manner which alarmed him so much expecting the terrific motion to be followed by a blow that in the endeavor to retreat from his fury he fell backwards over the maimed musician and so crushed his weatherbeaten carcass with his ponderous weight that it was greatly apprehended by all present that a stop was put to his gutscraping talent for ever  a few yards from the prostrate victim lay the remains of his oncefamed violin from whose genial womb he had so often called forth the fascinating strains of melody to beguile the lazy foot of time and dissipate the impressions of care from the peasants mind  but alas it was decreed that it should yield delight no more for it lay participating the fate of its master in a state of ruin and shattered into a hundred pieces  the lamentable situation of the fallen son of apollo seemed to awaken the soft influence of sympathy in every breast  the keeper having secured the bear every attention appeared now to center in the fiddlers catastrophe after rubbing his temples with vinegar for a few minutes it was evident that he began to breathe when a young surgeon who had mingled with the throng offered his assistance gratis and recommended that he should be instantly bled which operation he set about performing without hesitation and having tied up his arm he opened a vein whence the blood flowed in streams as thick and valuable as ever warmed the frame of an irish king the wiser part of the company foreseeing that if he continued to bleed in that manner for a short time longer it must inevitably deprive him of the little life that remained proposed binding up his arm to which the surgeon assented and he was conveyed to the next house to receive such nourishment as the personal injuries he had suffered made necessary  the alertness and activity i had shown in attending upon the poor fiddler had attracted the notice of the master of the show who after the business was concluded took occasion to ask me some questions as who i was etc intermixing his inquiries with some flattering compliments such as he believed i was a damned clever boy and that if i had a mind to go with him i should live as merry as the day was long  surrounded as i was by distress and entirely destitute of a friend on whom i could with any degree of certainty rely for a shilling i thought i could not in my present circumstances do better than close with the bearleaders proposal so striking his hand with a hearty good will which he held out for that purpose he shook it in so cordial and at the same time so vigorous a manner that i thought at first he had dislocated my shoulder but this friendly salute on the part of the showman was considered as a ratification of the treaty between us which was now agreeably to the nature of such bargains signed and sealed to all intents and purposes  as my new master thought that he had gleaned the harvest of the town pretty well it was judged expedient in a full council composed of him the trumpeter and myself for the poor fiddler remained so ill from the rough usage of the bear that we were forced to leave him behind to move our quarters with all convenient expedition so after securing master bruin who i was informed was apt to be extremely unruly unless such a precaution was taken and tying up the baboon in a sack which was kept for that purpose we deposited them and the rest of our portable furniture in a cart and at exactly half an hour after three the next morning began our march taking our route toward the northern part of the kingdom  as we were tolerably well provided against the inconveniences of traveling so early my master having wisely furnished himself with a bottle of whiskey and some bread baked on an iron griddle we proceeded as joyously as we could wish the trumpeter every now and then favoring us with a song the burdens of which i do not think necessary to repeat for though the intention of the shrill sensestunning chanter was to oblige us by his vocal essays the composition of his favorite ditties was not any ways remarkable for delicacy of expression  in this carekilling disposition did we pass along until we came to a little dirty hovel by the roadside which by the number of cars that were ranged before the door we presently knew to be a kind of caravansera or rural hotel where animals of all descriptions might be entertained with bed and board at all the hours of the day and night for a very small consideration it was now resolved that we should stop and procure a fresh supply of hay for old sorrel the miserable horse that drew the cart and its appendages he having long since devoured the quota that was allotted him at the time we set out and which for his convenience was tied in a bundle and hung immediately under his nose that in order to lose as little time as possible he might eat and work at the same instant and from what i understood it was a step absolutely necessary to be taken for he was one of those obstinate kind of quadrupeds that would have his own way and if once they neglected to satisfy his appetite the devil might draw the cart for sorrel  when we made our entrance into the inn the sides of which were built of mud cemented with straw and formed a sort of wall about three feet in thickness and covered with thatch so old and so productive that in many places it appeared more verdant than the adjacent fields by the large quantity of grass and weeds with which it was covered over i thought myself transported on a sudden into the regions of darkness which would have been total but for the faint glimmering of the remains of a turf fire which pervaded the surrounding gloom from a corner of this wretched hovel but though it might with great truth be figuratively called the habitation of darkness it was by no means the abode of silence for a variety of voices issued from every part of the place at the same time that formed a kind of grating discord which may be conceived by the imagination but is wholly undescribable by words  feeling myself very much chilled by the coldness of the morning air i ventured to grope my way as well as i could to the place where i saw the fire but had not gone three steps before i stumbled and falling over a large warm body which intercepted my passage i alighted on the other side in an instant and unluckily pitched my head right into the face of a drover of cattle who lay snoring upon his back with his mouth open a foot wide he no sooner felt the unwelcome visit than he grappled me fast by the hair of my head which he held most tenaciously while he struck me on the ribs with such fury that i thought in my terrors he had actually drove them into my body calling me a little dirty spalpeen son of a whore though by no means equal in strength to my adversary i was so enraged at the smart of the discipline i had received that i returned his favors with all the vigor i was able and we lay struggling together on the ground for some seconds till a cow who it appeared afterward was my assailants bedfellow being disturbed by the affray got up turned herself about and lifting her tail let fly without any sort of ceremony and absolutely deluged both him and me with the copiousness of her evacuation on the receipt of this fresh annoyance he quitted his hold and i crept away well pleased to escape the farther effects of his revenge even in my present filthy condition  the noise which we made in this dirty rencounter had by this time awakened several more of the lodgers in this dreary temple of repose from one of whom issued the following question in a sound which made me tremble in every limb very much resembling that of a boatswain with a hoarseness bellowing through the speakingtrumpet of a firstrate man of war  blood and ouns what is all this you are at and be damned to you  by the sweet jasus but you are making a pretty sort of a rumpus so you are  arrah mun jowl you vagabonds if youre not quiet in no time at all at all your souls to the devil but i will be after running the pitchfork up to the hilt in every whores son of ye do you see  ah by the immaculate into my own swate cow herself god bless her so i will  to which dreadful threat another voice replies which from the dialogue that ensued we understood to be a females arrah darby now what makes you be putting yourself into such a hell of a passion  cannot you be azy and let em fight and be damned  when the other roared no you munster bitch i will not be azy nor have my house disturbed at this time of night by any spalpeen among them  hush cries the female voice evidently softening her tone hush my dare darby if youre after talking so you will affront your lodgers and lose their custom  which prudent hint was taken in such dudgeon by the other that he answered with great vociferation what is that you say mistress juggy  i shall lose their custom  may i never ate another peratee but to the devil i pitch both them and their custom  and i will tell you what if you dont take a friends advice and get up and strike a light immadiately you notorious whore of ireland i will be after leathering your fat carcass like a sack so i will the sound of the word leather had scarcely reached her ear when well knowing the inauspicious omens it conveyed she leaped up from her longfeathered resting place and in the twinkling of an eye began to rake together the ashes of the turf at the same time kneeling down she took the candle in one hand while with the tongs made of a twisted sapling she held a piece of turf with the other and putting them together she applied her mouth close to the sod and by the dint of a few blasts heaved with force from lungs of no ordinary texture lighted the taper in consequence of which we could with great ease and satisfaction distinguish each other  chapter xiv a faithful portrait of the chambermaid colored after nature  overtures of friendship or small circumstances necessary to link society  portrait of the maitre dhotel  a general alarm  a circumstance takes place which proves honesty to be the best policy  after settling our accounts we bid adieu to the retreat of filth and indigence and follow the caprices of fortune  by the assistance of the light i could easily perceive that this public hospitable receptacle was equally open for the accommodation of every kind of animal man included in the center of the place was erected a kind of temporary manger under which some horses were extended in a sound sleep and at their heads their drivers were employed in the same salutary pastime with their bodies parallel with the wall  but what attracted my attention most was the singular appearance of the lady who had deigned in conformity with the commands of her master to illuminate the filthy hovel her person was rather of the shortest being without her brogues and besides the lady exposed somewhat too much of the rerum naturae for the eye of modesty in height about four feet and an inch  her figure square squab and flabby  and her hair of which she seemed to have a prodigious quantity was of the deepest tint of that obnoxious color vulgarly called carroty part of which hung in wanton ringlets down her shoulder and the remainder appeared to be tied up as rough and strong as a colts mane under the miserable remnants of a dirty piece of linen which so indifferent was the fair juggy in the ornaments of her beauteous person served as a succedaneum for a cap  her extremities bore all the marks of a vigorous muscular proportion particularly her legs which were coarse red and scurfy and had evidently a strong inclination to be bandy and the gasterocnemii of which were as large and sinewy as those of the farnese hercules  this delicate frame of the kind and officious nymph was sheltered from the rude winds and more especially from the roving eye of curious and unhallowed observers by a kind of smock in the color of which both black and white seemed to contend for the superiority and the back of which the only part i had the happiness of surveying reached just as low down her body as where the most skilful anatomists have thought proper to place the origin of the glutaeus and from which spot commences the formation of those convenient globular bodies in the neighborhood of which the concurring determinations of the most sagacious of mankind have placed the sensible seat of personal honor  i had just time to take this cursory survey of her person when the spirit of delicacy impelled her to waddle toward the straw whence she had just risen and there i left her gathering up the tattered remains of her motley drapery to enable her to go through the duties and labor of the approaching day  as a kind of general disturbance had taken place and some of the drovers thought it time to get up and pursue their several journies a considerable number had assembled round the fire among whom were myself the showman and the trumpeter after some time employed in yawning rubbing their eyes and shrugging their shoulders it was proposed to smoke a whiff before they set off and in consequence a small pipe was produced broke off to the length of two inches covered with an incrustation of dirt and by the long course of service it had seen as black as my hat this was instantly filled with tobacco and when properly lighted was handed as a testimony of good fellowship round the company who each in his turn took a blast for about five minutes and then without ceremony unwiped and reeking warm from the rotten teeth and gums of their associates they partook well pleased refreshing whiffs from the joyinspiring weed  when the pipe came round to me it was with the utmost loathing of my stomach that i accepted of the instrument of social intercourse but apprehensive of appearing to dislike what all my companions seemed to relish with so high a gust i resolved to make a virtue of necessity and taking the pipe and putting it to my mouth with an intention of smoking a more offensive smell assailed my nose than could possibly have issued from the celebrated box of madam pandora which was reported to contain all that was shocking and calamitous to human nature under the pretense of tobacco making me sick i was obliged to shift the pipe to my neighbor with the best grace i was able  we were now joined by the maitre d hotel whose gigantic figure corresponded with the tremendous sound of his voice being a tall bony man in stature when he stood upright at least six feet four or five inches with a grisly black beard and had on a dirty woollen nightcap and a frieze great coat thrown loosely over his shoulders in this garb he mixed among his guests and inquired if we were inclined to have any refreshment before we pursued our journey upon my masters replying in the affirmative the kind host was busied in preparing some eggs with a thick cut from a piece of pork that hung in the chimney dried to that extreme degree that it was as void of juice and as hard as an oaktable while the accomplished and loveinspiring juggy was placing a threelegged stool before us which was intended to serve as a table in lieu of a better when all on a sudden the whole process of eating was disturbed and every ones attention engaged by a noise and shrieking that seemed to alarm the very elements  juggy who had been dispatched for the purpose of learning the cause of this terrible outcry soon returned with her hands lifted up in wonder and her face pale with fear crying out och hone och hone  with some difficulty we learned in the midst of her lamentations that a wild baast had bit off the head of bryan msnivel upon this information we all started up in an instant and ran to the scene of action  when we got to our cart we found a man roaring for assistance with his head buried in the sack in which my master had tied up the baboon and then we soon divined the cause of this bloody and dreadful adventure which was exactly thus  the stock of potatoes at the inn being consumed and juggy having forgot to provide a fresh supply on the day before agreeably to the directions of her master had prevailed upon bryan msnivel who it seems was one of her humble admirers to go and forage among the cars before their departure and get a small quantity out of each sack and poor bryan was actually engaged in this friendly business when he met with the misfortune alluded to for coming to our cart among the rest and perceiving a sack which had formerly held potatoes fastened at the mouth he ventured to untie it and thinking from the position it lay in that the potatoes were at the bottom he put in his head and shoulders and was groping about with his left arm when he clawed hold of the baboon who being awaked from a sound sleep was so irritated that he immediately jumped up and fastened his fangs an inch deep in the scull of the obliging darby  as soon as my master had disengaged the poor fellow from the teeth of the grinning animal and brought his head once more into open day he made a most rueful and sanguinary appearance the features of his face were totally disfigured with the blood that still continued to flow without intermission from the wounded head of the disconsolate lover indeed upon examination the perforation which the angry animal had made was so deep that had the misfortune happened to a scull of common thickness his teeth must have gone clear through the piamater into the brain but darbys seat of understanding was cased very luckily with none of those flimsy defenses for had the baboon penetrated an inch deeper the wound would have still remained curable  as the people of the inn seemed to lessen their attention toward us after this accident we finished our repast with great expedition and paying the demand yoked old sorrel to the cart and set forward on our journey  chapter xv we arrive at the place of destination  i enter upon my new employment  the necessity of paying due obedience to fools in office  an instance to prove that authority should be exercised with discretion  leave my new master  take up my lodging at an inn  character of a neighboring justice  joined by an itinerant soldier  about ten the same morning we arrived safe with all our baggage at the place of destination and having deposited our friend bruin and his companion in a place of safety in a barn which my master had hired for the purpose of his exhibition we began to perambulate the town preceded by our trumpeter  the nature of my office was to distribute handbills among the people in which were pompously set forth the surprising wonders that would await their attention at the hour of seven in the evening my master farther illustrating the description by a sort of oratory peculiar to those caterers of amusement for the vulgar wherein he did not forget to inform them that for the paltry and low consideration of threepence a head they should see the greatest miracles that ever were brought into ireland since the reign of broderic king of leinster  when we had gone through every part of the place and announced our arrival we repaired to the barn to make up a temporary stage and get every thing in readiness against the evening that no disappointment might happen to the audience on the first night to provide against which my master took unusual pains knowing it from experience to be a matter extremely essential to our future success as the people were generally induced to favor him with their company in proportion to the account that they heard from those who attended the first night  after bruin and the baboon were taken from their confinement and fed we began a private rehearsal of the feats which it was intended should be performed in the evening and indeed they acquitted themselves so well that their leader had strong hopes of acquiring a great share of reputation and eventually much profit by their approaching performances but alas as the wisest of mankind have been deluded by too fond an indulgence of hope it was no wonder that my master should be deceived who certainly had no great claim to the character of a man of wisdom  at the proposed time of beginning the company came pouring into the barn in great numbers at the sight of which my master was so elevated that he declared he believed he should receive more money in this place than he had done in any other since he came into that part of the country upon my informing him that there were upwards of eight and forty shillings already received he began to rub his hands exclaiming a lucky hit by g  d when two stout fellows came behind the scenes and instantly laid hold of his collar followed by a thickset lusty man with a scarlet cloak and a bushy wig who it appeared at the conclusion was a justice of the peace and lived within a short mile of the town and had taken offense that any person should presume to exhibit their mummeries in that town without first asking his permission a compliment it seems which he had been always used to receive from every itinerant vagabond that visited his neighborhood from the comedian to the conjurer  upon my master who now began to smoke the business asking with great humility what was the reason of his being seized in that manner like a common felon the magistrate answered contracting his brows into a most ferocious frown oh i will let you know you dog the reason in proper time i will teach you you vagrant scoundrel to bring your mummery and nonsense here to draw the money out of the pockets of the industrious poor and to debauch with your vicious spectacles the morals of the young women  take him away i say take him away  aye but your reverences worship says another of his attendants what shall we do with the wild beastises  what replies the sage pillar of the law has he brought the wild beasts among us too  oh you varlet i will have you hanged you dog i will  take him to jail and as for his monsters we will secure them in the pound  i am afraid to go near em your honor says the fellow  afraid says the fat magistrate afraid of what you blockhead why i suppose he has neither got a mermaid nor a crocodile nor the huge behemoth that we read of in the bible  no your honor says the other but he is got a bear and a large monkey what do you say a bear and a monkey only says the witty justice ha ha ha  i will punish the scoundrel for being such an ass as to bring a bear and a monkey to a place that abounded in such animals long before his arrival ha ha ha laughing violently at his own sarcastic remark and in which the people joined him though the joke was fabricated at their expense  the trumpeter foreseeing that the end of this unlucky affair would be the total destruction of his employer for whose interest he had imbibed a regard almost equal to his own resolved to take ample revenge and while this fat terror of all the vagrant tribe was amusing himself with his jest he unchained the bear and leading him slily to the back of the justice slipped off his muzzle in an instant and at the same time tripped up the heels of this little dispenser of the statutes and made his escape as fast as he could which he had scarcely put in execution when the bear finding himself at liberty began to growl which affrighted the servants of the justice so much that they quitted my masters collar and disappeared in a twinkling leaving the magistrate who lay sprawling on the ground to the mercy of the bear who no sooner perceived his prey than he seized him by his posteriors and after shaking him for a considerable time with great violence ran out into the town through the door which they had left open in their confusion with the little man in his mouth plunging with his arms and legs to get loose and calling out to the people to rescue him for the love of god after running with him in that perilous situation above a quarter of a mile he quitted his hold and making across the fields dropped the justice in the middle of the high road where he was found by his servants in a deep swoon a short time afterward  thus by a seemingly trivial omission of respect was the fairest prospect of my poor master overthrown perhaps for ever  what became of him after this adventure i could never learn for the instant that he got his freedom he made a most precipitate retreat as well as his trumpeter and left me once more to ramble on the face of the creation in search of employment to procure me the means of living  after revolving in my mind the unfortunate train of events that had taken place i began to think that this was not a place of safety for me to remain in more especially since i understood that the justice was a vindictive man and as he was notorious for pursuing every person that he could to destruction who was unhappy enough to have given him any umbrage whatever what was i to expect who was well known to be a limb of that party which had rendered him a public object of derision  upon these considerations i got over a gate at the back of the barn and after crossing some fields came to a cabin at the the door of which i saw an old man sitting with a long staff in his hand  his venerable and silver locks whitened by his infirmities and the hand of time hung in scanty order down his palsied head i approached him with an air of the most profound respect and inquiring if he knew a place where i could rest for that night he told me if it so pleased me that i might lodge with him at the same time pointing to a small board over the door on which was painted dry lodging for travelers which in my contemplating the poor old man who sat at the entrance i had not noticed  after inviting me to a share of his seat which was made of sods of earth placed over each other we entered into discourse in the progress of which i found that my venerable companion had formerly been a considerable farmer in that county but one misfortune happening upon the back of another had reduced him at last to a state of extreme indigence at a time of life when the comforts annexed to prosperity are most requisite i learned that he had been driven out of his last farm and his cattle off the lands for a years rent which he had been rendered unable to pay by a fire that had consumed a large stock of corn on the produce of which at market he should have been enabled to have satisfied his landlord who i found afterward was the very individual justice from whose resentment i had made my escape prompted by a desire to be acquainted with his character my decrepid host complied in the following manner  when justice guttle first came to live in the town of  he was neither more or less than a pettifogging attorney and before he had resided in the place three years had caused more mischief and lawsuits among its inhabitants than had been known before in the memory of the oldest person living and to do him justice he had rendered himself completely detestable to all his neighbors however having a thorough knowledge of mankind he always manifested it by oppressing the poor and flattering the vices of the rich and he succeeded so far by making himself an active instrument in a longcontested county election in favor of one squire bribeem who originally owned this manor that he made him his agent and that appointment was a woeful one to me as well as to his patron for he had not been in his agency above ten years before he contrived by one diabolical practice or another to get the greatest part of the estate into his own hands and this was the more easily effected as the squire seldom came down among his tenantry in the country but spent his time and his fortune in every species of riot and dissipation till he had reduced himself so low that he was obliged to live upon a small annuity in the south of france while his honest agent the justice keeps a coach and four kills his own venison and washes it down every day after dinner with at least a gallon of claret to assist the powers of digestion  upon receiving this description of the magistrate i ventured to relate to the old man what had passed at  which when he heard he told me that i had acted a very wise part in leaving the town for it was certain if ever he got me in his clutches he would punish me upon one pretense or other most severely and i might think myself happy to get off with a public whipping and at least a years imprisonment in the countyjail i was so much alarmed at this account that i determined to get up at daybreak the next morning lest by some untoward accident it might be discovered that i was in the vicinity of the place  we were now joined by a maimed soldier and his wife with a young child at her back which she contrived to keep there by tying the two ends of her gown together and forming a sort of bag in which the child slept in perfect security having lodged at the cabin before they all three walked into the house without any sort of ceremony calling for some ale after the warrior and his yokefellow had refreshed themselves he came out with the mug in his hand and offered it to the old man who refused his kindness by informing him that he had just been drinking upon which he handed the mug to me saying here my lad you will drink i suppose though the landlord will not thanking him for his kindness i took the mug and drank to his good health  thankee thankee my lad said he and sitting down between me and the reverend host he began to make some remarks upon the fineness of the evening at the same time telling us unasked that he had traveled a good forty miles that day and being damnably tired why he did not care how soon he began to take a comfortable snoose  end of the first volume
