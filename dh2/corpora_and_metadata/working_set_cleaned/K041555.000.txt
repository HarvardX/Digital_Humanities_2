retirement some wise men rise to public view some folly all forego so scythians shoot when they pursue or when they shun the foe statesmen and warriors the first  while those that court the muse and calm philosophy more thirst for peaceful life recluse the lark that highest sings and flies the lowest builds her nest and she that warbles to the skies in valleys seeks for rest considring life with reason due good taste prefers a mean and but for the discerning few would wish to live unseen ii rural repose now day declines and all is still save herds that homeward hie the sunbeam fades on yonder hill soft as a farewell sigh blessed mind that no rude tempest knows but moved with joy serene sinks smiling into calm repose like evnings gentle scene but mortals turbulent and vain know naught of tranquil joy often seeking to inflict a pain often they themselves annoy false hopes false cares fly high fly low to flatter or affright these trimmed in fair and specious show those like foul hags of night lo where ambition seeks to found true pleasure on a name like taperfly still circling round the giddy torch of fame there thunder mighty heroes braves usurping sovereign sway the nations kings though natures slaves vain tyrants of a day while here sweet peace with head reclined upon her downy wing eyes with a smile the cottage hind or hears him blythly sing iii ode to modesty tune the lute and tune the lyre these can life and love inspire while the muses touch the string mirth shall bashful merit bring modesty is joy concealing impudence is want of feeling come modesty firstbidden guest who of thyself would come the last kind love shall veil thee from the eyes and insolence of ruder spies and taste fair virtues child entwine a garland for thy brows divine happy he whose wishes find modest worth and love combined tune the lute and tune the lyre these can life and love inspire in all things modesty with thee good taste and temperance agree true beauty knows no boastful glare to make the superficial stare fond love endymion like in sight prefers the moons chaste modest light to ruffian war loud sounds belong thou love the soft sicilian song tune the lute and tune the lyre these can life and love inspire not in rude bulk fair beautys queen moves goddess of a graceful mien but in due figure unconfined denoting elegance of mind but fools still hold an idle slate and for the good admire the great thus often ill actions gain acclaim while modest worth is marked with blame tune the lute and tune the lyre these can life and love inspire nor in vain greatness nor the voice of many thou conceivst thy choice the foolish are a numerous crew the wise that worth esteem are few from mercury love ever young first learned fair fluency of tongue but from diana chaste to wing the shaft and from the muse to sing the gentle muse that shuns the crowd ever violent ever loud happy he whose wishes find modest worth and love combined tune the lute and tune the lyre these can life and love inspire iv on truth truth boasts no supernatral light yet smiles at fables moral slight and skilful in the rapturous art herself can sometimes bear a part daughter of reason pure and love adored by all who pleasure prove thy mild yet energetic ray like hesperus at close of day not dazzles with excess of light but charms while it directs the sight thou love the unfrequented way where genius and fair science stray v estimate of truth he truth alone can rightly prize who is himself maturely wise to sottish drunkards those appear like sots who keep their senses clear and those of coolest soundest brain are marked by madmen for insane in superstitions sickly dream foul stains pollute the clearest stream the modest voice of better sense to snarling fools gives harsh offense as much enraged the wild boar rears his bristles when he music hears  among gods a goddess genius sits a silent slave amongst meaner wits vi estimate of pleasure pleasures moving human mind are of mixed uncertain kind sometimes much on fate depends sometimes fancy marrs or mends treachry dressed like truth prepares for the feeling heart her snares folly wearing friendships guise lends her ears to slanders lies what is merits great reward save a cold or rough regard what does life itself imply since all things that live must die vii on affectation poor affectation how much better be that which we seem than idly thus like thee to seem what we are not thy cheating art robs even its owner of the better part for when thou strivst to please it is all in vain and pained thyself thou givst to others pain twinchild of treachery with deadly guile disguised like thee in gesture look and smile slight ape of gracefulness without the grace that mockst the sympathies of human race lover and friend without love or esteem nothing to be but all things fair to seem endimpled so the whirlpool hides deaths frown as smiling on him whom it seeks to drown viii fond hope what rapture would the muse again inspire what dear delusive hope what fond desire would she describe the cheerful beams of morn or sadder sweets that evening scenes adorn would she the charms of sacred beauty sing or ecstasies that heavenly knowledge bring what are the joys which nature yields or art unless those joys we freely might impart but o sad thought a heart supremely kind seems but a vision of the lovesick mind the longing of a soul whose hopes pursue a counterpart that still eludes her view so rare is truth affections taste so rare and bent on vanity most worldly care ix retirement of philosophy a sonnet as little springs that force their liquid way from bottom of the everraging flood beat off rude waves and rising into day to thirsty sailors prove a sovereign good so fair philosophy thy deepdrawn streams pervade even rankest tides of error foul dispel the rage of superstitious dreams imparting tranquil pleasure to the soul softpiniond peace attends thy simple state retires with thee to bower or rocky cell the sciences thy handmaids ready wait with thee alone bright truth delights to dwell while all afar prevails the horrid rout which scylla and charybdis herds about x the double mistake a sonnet see a poem of shakespeare entitled error in opinion   it is better to be good though ill esteemed and have the light though others lack the skill to know what should or good or bad be deemed or take for good what reason takes for ill must i cry lame because the cripple halt or feign me blind because the lame would lead must i be senseless held for others fault or hold me dumb because the deaf not heed yet true it is too cheaply have i sold that which to me has ever been most dear and better had to better hearts been told than turned to falsehood in a foolish ear to some too freely would i truth have shown their fraud unknowing i to them unknown xi revolution of all things the gentle primrose leads the train of vernal flowers that grace the plain the daisy and the vilet lead the summerblooms that scent the mead the last of winters hardy train lead on the laughing spring again nor first nor last we clearly trace in the bright perennial race all all in endless circles run to the point where they begun the planets whirl the sun about nor tell us where they first set out all living things new shoots supply and only in the old ones die mortals quickly too advance in the neverceasing dance men ever in their offspring live and as they get still freely give like the swift nightracing band who bear the torch from hand to hand giving life and labor over to the youths who run before the simile in the above alludes to an athenian exercise of racing in which one person ran with a torch and delivered it over to the next in succession  all all in endless circles run to the point where they begun nor first nor last we clearly trace in the bright perennial race xii on a flowergarden spare o spare each smiling flower offspring of a fleeting hour let them live their little day man is transient too as they man who seeks with giddy joy first to rear and then destroy let them wanton in the wind let them live to leave their kind still in brightest beauty seen in their native couches green so shall they fresh odours bring wafting sweets on zephyrs wing xiii song of the fates see in platos republic the story of erus armenus  in garments white with crowns of gold preside the sister fates that hold their seats on high the world above beneath the throne of thundering jove amid the sirens in a ring alternate thus they spin and sing  souls of a day  away away  another crop of mortal race  this quickly gone shall come in place  turn the whirl the spindle turn  mortals laugh and mortals mourn  happy those who life employ  in social sense and genial joy  far from horrid haunts of war  from rapine and injustice far  turn the whirl the spindle turn  mortals laugh and mortals mourn  let wretches tremble at their fate  who truth regard with rancrous hate  for jove has linked with their crimes  the dire events of future times  turn the whirl the spindle turn  mortals laugh and mortals mourn the sirenchorus join the song and in full harmony prolong  souls of a day  away away  another crop of mortal race  this quickly gone shall come in place  turn the whirl the spindle turn  mortals laugh and mortals mourn xiv sonnet on the death of a lady now western clouds appear of golden hue inlacd with purple streaks of living light and distant hills look dusky azure blue involved within the glimmering shades of night woods hamlets plains with sadness are overcast sols parting rays play on the dimpling main amid the murmurs of the wintry blast like joyful spirits dancing in his train the trees have lost their silken green attire to foreign climes the heraldswallow flies all silent drooping sit the tuneful quire or welcome newborn day in happier skies these in their season soon shall glad return but she no more alas for whom i mourn xv on soft music soft music still affords relief to gentle souls far gone in grief not such unmitigated woe as only duller mortals know whose vilent sorrow may no longer last than morning dew or april shower is past but that much deeper mourning of the heart in which the sacred sisters bear a part like love sincere unchangeable remains and inly soothes while yet the soul it pains xvi on an aeolian harp sweet instrument whose wild notes can allay the violence of passions ruder sway thou by thy charming influence can bring music from winds and teach them how to sing o soothe a tender lovers soul to rest and calm the tempest in his troubled breast xvii to the spirit of the world o thou eternal harmony of things the rest and motion labor and repose of all by turns in their revolving course thou force cohesive and dissolvent power relation reason infinite immense with humble reverence and silent awe let me thy light contemplate and thy love thou shinest in the dimond and the dew of fragrant morn thou in the lilly shinst and in the vernal rose the higher orbs the sun great source of light the moon serene and all the starry host shine forth in thee but ah how far surpassing these shine forth the light of reason and the social sense the sense of truth the sympathy of love these in the wise are seen the wise in thee do live thou live in the wise in these then let me worship thee not in dull rites in speculative dreams and mysteries not in mouthpraises which the vain affect but natures pure simplicity and grace in actions noble just beneficent so shall i live love of thy love in thee who art the boundless all of life and love finis
