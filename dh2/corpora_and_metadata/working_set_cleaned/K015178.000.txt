w woodfall in whitefriars mdcclxxii  advertisement the following may more properly be termed a compilation than a poem it was prepared for the composer in little more than two days and may therefore rather be considered as an industrious effort of gratitude than of genius  in justice to the composer it may likewise be right to inform the public that the music was adapted in a period of time equally short  speakersmr lee and mrs bellamy  singersmr champnes mr dine and miss jameson with twelve chorus singers  the music prepared and adapted by signor vento  threnodia augustalis overture a solemn dirge  air trio arise ye sons of worth arise and waken every note of woe when truth and virtue reach the skies it is ours to weep the want below chorus when truth and virtue reach the skies it is ours to weep the want below man speaker the praise attending pomp and power the incense given to kings are but the trappings of an hour mere transitory things the base bestow them but the good agree to spurn the venal gifts as flattery  but when to pomp and power are joined an equal dignity of mind when titles are the smallest claim when wealth and rank and noble blood but aid the power of doing good then all their trophies last  and flattery turns to fame blessed spirit thou whose fame just born to bloom shall spread and flourish from the tomb how have thou left mankind for heaven even now reproach and faction mourn and wondering how their rage was born request to be forgiven alas they never had thy hate unmoved in conscious rectitude thy towering mind selfcentered stood nor wanted mans opinion to be great in vain to charm thy ravished sight a thousand gifts would fortune send in vain to drive thee from the right a thousand sorrows urged thy end like some wellfashiond arch thy patience stood and purchased strength from its increasing load pain met thee like a friend that set thee free affliction still is virtues opportunity virtue on herself relying every passion hushed to rest loses every pain of dying in the hopes of being blessed every added pang she suffers some increasing good bestows and every shock that malice offers only rocks her to repose  song by a man affettuoso virtue on herself relying every passion hushed to rest loses every pain in dying in the hopes of being blessed every added pang she suffers some increasing good bestows every shock that malice offers only rocks her to repose woman speaker yet ah what terrors frowned upon her fate death with its formidable band fever and pain and pale consumptive care determined took their stand nor did the cruel ravagers design to finish all their efforts at a blow but mischievously slow they robbed the relic and defaced the shrine  with unavailing grief despairing of relief her weeping children round beheld each hour deaths growing power and trembled as he frowned as helpless friends who view from shore the laboring ship and hear the tempest roar while winds and waves their wishes cross they stood while hope and comfort fail not to assist but to bewail the inevitable loss  relentless tyrant at thy call how do the good the virtuous fall truth beauty worth and all that most engage but wake thy vengeance and provoke thy rage  song by a man basso staccato spirituoso when vice my dart and scythe supply how great a king of terrors i if folly fraud your hearts engage tremble ye mortals at my rage fall round me fall ye little things ye statesmen warriors poets kings if virtue fail her counsel sage tremble ye mortals at my rage man speaker yet let that wisdom urged by her example teach us to estimate what all must suffer let us prize death as the best gift of nature as a safe inn where weary travelers when they have journeyed through a world of cares may put off life and be at rest for ever groans weeping friends indeed and gloomy sables may often distract us with their sad solemnity the preparation is the executioner death when unmasked shows me a friendly face and is a terror only at a distance for as the line of life conducts me on to deaths great court the prospect seems more fair it is natures kind retreat that is always open to take us in when we have drained the cup of life or worn our days to wretchedness  in that secure serene retreat where all the humble all the great promiscuously recline where wildly huddled to the eye the beggars pouch and princes purple lie may every bliss be thine and ah blessed spirit wheresoeer thy flight through rolling worlds or fields of liquid light may cherubs welcome their expected guest may saints with songs receive thee to their rest may peace that claimed while here thy warmest love may blissful endless peace be thine above  song by a woman amoroso lovely lasting peace below comforter of every woe heavenly born and bred on high to crown the favorites of the sky lovely lasting peace appear this world itself if thou art here is once again with eden blessed and man contains it in his breast woman speaker our vows are heard long long to mortal eyes her soul was fitting to its kindred skies celestiallike her bounty fell where modest want and patient sorrow dwell want passed for merit at her door unseen the modest were supplied her constant pity fed the poor then only poor indeed the day she died and oh for this while sculpture decks thy shrine and art exhausts profusion round the tribute of a tear be mine a simple song a sigh profound there faith shall come a pilgrim gray to bless the tomb that wraps thy clay and calm religion shall repair to dwell a weeping hermit there truth fortitude and friendship shall agree to blend their virtues while they think of thee  air chorus pomposo let us let all the world agree to profit by resembling thee end of the first part part ii overture pastorale  man speaker fast by that shore where thames translucent stream reflects new glories on his breast where splendid as the youthful poets dream he forms a scene beyond elysium blessed where sculptured elegance and native grace unite to stamp the beauties of the place while sweetly blending still are seen the wavy lawn the sloping green while novelty with cautious cunning through every maze of fancy running from china borrows aid to deck the scene there sorrowing by the rivers glassy bed forlorn a rural band complained all whom augustas bounty fed all whom her clemency sustained the good old sire unconscious of decay the modest matron clad in homespun gray the military boy the orphand maid the shattered veteran now first dismayed these sadly join beside the murmuring deep and as they view the towers of kew call on their mistress now no more and weep  chorus affettuoso largo ye shady walks ye waving greens ye nodding towers ye fairy scenes let all your echoes now deplore that she who formed your beauties is no more man speaker first of the train the patient rustic came whose callous hand had formed the scene bending at once with sorrow and with age with many a tear and many a sigh between and where he cried shall now my babes have bread or how shall age support its feeble fire no lord will take me now my vigor fled nor can my strength perform what they require each grudging master keeps the labourer bare a sleek and idle race is all their care my noble mistress thought not so her bounty like the morning dew unseen though constant used to flow and as my strength decayed her bounty grew  woman speaker in decent dress and coarsly clean the pious matron next was seen clasped in her hand a godly book was borne by use and daily meditation worn that decent decent dress this holy guide augustas care had well supplied and ah she cries all woe begone what now remains for me oh where shall weeping want repair to ask for charity too late in life for me to ask and shame prevents the deed and tardy tardy are the times to succor should i need but all my wants before i spoke were to my mistress known she still relieved nor sought my praise contented with her own but every day her name i will bless my morning prayer my evening song i will praise her while my life shall last a life that cannot last me long  song by a woman each day each hour her name i will bless my morning and my evening song and when in death my vows shall cease my children shall the note prolong man speaker the hardy veteran after struck the sight scarrd mangled maimed in every part lopped of his limbs in many a gallant fight in naught entire  except his heart mute for a while and sullenly distressed at last the impetuous sorrow fired his breast wild is the whirlwind rolling over africks sandy plain and wild the tempest howling along the billowd main but every danger felt before the raging deep the whirlwinds roar less dreadful struck me with dismay than what i feel this fatal day oh let me fly a land that spurns the brave oswegos dreary shores shall be my grave i will seek that less inhospitable coast and lay my body where my limbs were lost  song by a man basso spirituoso old edwards sons unknown to yield shall crowd from cressys laurelld field to do thy memory right for thine and britains wrongs they feel again they snatch the gleamy steel and wish the avenging fight woman speaker in innocence and youth complaining next appeared a lovely maid affliction over each feature reigning kindly came in beautieys aid every grace that grief dispenses every glance that warms the soul in sweet succession charmed the senses while pity harmonizd the whole the garland of beauty it is thus she would say no more shall my crook or my temple adorn i will not wear a garland augustas away i will not wear a garland until she return but alas that return i never shall see the echoes of thames shall my sorrows proclaim there promised a lover to come but oh me twas death twas the death of my mistress that came but ever for ever her image shall last i will strip all the spring of its earliest bloom on her grave shall the cowslip and primrose be cast and the newblossomd thorn shall whiten her tomb  song by a woman pastorale with garlands of beauty the queen of the may no more will her crook or her temples adorn for whod wear a garland when she is away when she is removed and shall never return on the grave of augusta these garlands be placed well rifle the spring of its earliest bloom and there shall the cowslip and primrose be cast and the newblossomd thorn shall whiten her tomb chorus altro modo on the grave of augusta this garland be placed well rifle the spring of its earliest bloom and there shall the cowslip and primrose be cast and the tears of her country shall water her tomb the end
