a letter to a lady on the mode of conducting herself during pregnancy  also on the management of the infant  london printed by baker and galabin in ingramcourt  mdcclxxvii  this book is entered at stationers hall and whoever pirates it will be prosecuted  preface i flatter myself my friends will readily conceive when first i made the subsequent memorandums that they were not designed for the perusal of any other persons than my two daughters nor should i have been tempted to have made them known had it not been at the earnest request of a young lady who having the misfortune to lose her parents when very young and by a late marriage was removed at a distance from her friends reasonably supposing from my having been the mother of seven children she knew i had suckled and superintended that experience would have enabled me to give her some instructions that might be useful to her in her condition from those considerations lest it should please god to call me before my dear children were settled in life on whose account i had taken such pains i determined to comply with her request and accordingly sent her the following directions not imagining at that time she would have desired me to print them but as i presume there may be some observations worthy the attention of every mother and nurse in justice to myself and family i could do no less  dear madam when i consider how much your present situation demands the advice of a real friend i shall exert my endeavors though i fear inadequate to the undertaking to give you such instructions as i am persuaded will tend much to your relief you very reasonably imagine in consequence of the natural courses incident to our sex not appearing at their regular time that you are breeding from that circumstance i readily suppose you have taken particular notice when nature was last on you should you continue without any farther alteration you may begin to reckon from the tenth day after the last time this method my mother taught me with my first child and i do assure you that my midwife paid her a very high compliment on the occasion  rise at your usual time and if you breed sick which is usual order a cup of camomiletea or pumpwater as soon as you come down stairs in the morning that will help to keep your body open if tea does not agree with you try coffee chocolate milk milkporridge water gruel balmtea or a calfsfoot boiled in milk some one of which most likely will  perhaps you may have little or no appetite early in a morning if so give a general order to have something brought you at eleven oclock should you not be inclined to eat let it not be removed for though it should not be agreeable then it may a little time afterward  by no means ever go out hungry from that cause the desire of a person for many things they see or smell in general proceeds to avoid being so i would wish you to carry a biscuit or something of that kind at all times in your pocket should you be so unfortunate as to mark the child be not discouraged as it will not be of any bad consequence and in some cases a see the receipts at the end of the book remedy may be applied  during your pregnancy should you chance to meet or see any disagreeable object such as lame blind etc do not suffer it to make any impression on your mind as you may then rest assured it will have no effect on you or the child  when you are three months advanced on no account keep it secret as many ladies prejudice themselves thereby should you be hot or feverish and frequently sick it is absolutely necessary you should make your condition known to your midwife that he may order you at that time to lose a little blood otherwise you may depend upon it you will have sore nipples or your navel start from both those circumstances i suffered much with my first child it therefore behooves you to be particularly careful to avoid those inconveniences and believe me you cannot do yourself or midwife justice to conceal from him or her your condition a gentleman will understand your meaning at the instant  should your body not be regular every day eat fruit vegetables or a few jarraisins  when you are five months advanced put on jumps wear very broad bandages to your upper and under petticoats sew an eye to the jumps that they may hook on by this method you take the weight off the loins and at this time you should engage with a nurse  when turned of six months should feverish heats fixed pains in the side or any inflammatory symptoms appear lose more blood which will give you immediate relief should you perceive your water warmer than usual take a tablespoonful of gum arabic twice a day be sure at this time to have your childbed linen well aired and put into a large tinbox in a warm place for fear of a sevenmonths child damp linen being particularly hurtful strictly observing that napkins are not applied to you or the child hot as they would occasion a violent inflammation in both  as you find yourself grow weighty lie down between the blankets at least three times a day to alter the posture from which you will find great relief  it is necessary to have two motions a day the two last months the last fortnight you should drink a glass of mountain with a tablespoonful of sweet oil in it as it relaxes and will be of great service in labor  should you my dear madam find yourself very uneasy the latterpart of your time make not yourself unhappy as it is most probable you will come the quicker and better for it  as soon as you are taken in labor comb your hair smooth have an inch cut off behind and before or you will find it comb off very much at the months end i know several ladies who have lost very fine heads of hair by this omission the next thing put on your nightcap which will prove very comfortable some ladies will not be persuaded to it and by that means are very much disturbed four people about you are quite sufficient the midwife nurse and two assistants more only heat the room create confusion baulk your pains and prevent your taking them as you otherwise would to prevent flooding which is too often the case or the fatigue of raising yourself up i would recommend a silver suckingspout by the assistance of which you may drink without being moved  a halfshift and bodycloth with strings a double napkin to your breasts and a single waistcoat with sleeves to come as low as your elbows made by a skilful tailor as soon as your are with child are all that are necessary when you sit up in your bed throw a double handkerchief over your neck and slip on your bedgown lie warm but not hot  providence has so ordained it that a woman with her first child has seldom or ever any afterpains if you are well and can eat a biscuit or crust of bread the minute after delivery it will keep the wind out of your stomach and strengthen you very much be sure to have spermaceti sugar and nutmeg and plenty of very weak brandy and water and in a few hours afterward a halfpint basin of barleyjelly but no caudle on any consideration till the milk has been at the height and is quite gone off so that you have not the least fever as by suppressing the milk at that time according to instructions you will gain strength very fast  for the first twelve days take of sugar and spermaceti about onethird of an ounce frequently and every or every other day take a quarter of an ounce of manna as you find occasion one motion a day being sufficient without which in all probability you will have a fever owing to confinement  you may eat part of a boiled rabbit chicken or such like food every day for the first week and about eleven oclock in the forenoon have some good broth beeftea or calfsfoot jelly by way of change with the barleyjelly after which time if you follow my directions you may live as the family do provided they dine at one oclock  if your strength will admit i would wish you to get up the second day to have your bed made about the fourth or fifth put on your jumps and pin your gown quite close by attending to that it will strengthen your back much and from that day endeavor to sit up an hour and so on by degrees by which means you will recover your strength sooner than you are aware of the weak state ladies in general are reduced to arises from lying in bed too long  the fifth day you may drink half a pint of beer with a glass of mountain in it and if you have any desire for cheese at your dinner eat a piece the size of a nutmeg after which drink a glass of portwine the seventh or eighth day you may venture to drink beer alone in that case at and after dinner drink a glass of portwine some time after lie down between the blankets for an hour or more if you can compose yourself to rest it will be of great service in this manner you should proceed the first three weeks during which time always breakfast in bed and lie two hours after before you rise be sure to have something warm  dine at one oclock and by no means drink tea later than five for if you do it will interfere with the undressing your child and getting your supper  between your tea and seven oclock drink a little warm jelly or a glass of wine with a crust of bread otherwise undressing your child and suckling will be too great a fatigue sup at nine oclock and be in bed by ten after that time do not suffer any person to come into your room as it will disturb you and very likely prevent your sleeping  avoid seeing much company for the weak state you may probably be in will not admit of it should you be so attend to this for the first three weeks by which means you will regain your strength sooner  when your month is up and you are able to go abroad i earnestly recommend you to observe that if by any means you have been prevented suckling for six eight or ten hours which will sometimes be the case you will use the assistant instead of applying the child should your exercise have thrown you into a perspiration however gentle make water put another cloak on and drink something warm the milk then will be fresh and good should it not have vented itself in such a number of hours you will be convinced by its smelling offensively that it must be hurtful to the infant and without those preparations the countenance will immediately turn pale cause it to cry have a stool or perhaps both and then it is the blood gets foul by this omission i lost a fine boy four months old as every disagreeable eircumstance injures the milk if your breasts are hard and overful be assured you have taken cold which is impossible to be avoided without great precaution and thus numbers of children by the foulness of the milk have been thrown into convulsions  i have great reason to believe had i not drawn my breasts at least fourscore times with each of my two last children i should not have been able to have reared them from trouble of mind fatigue and cold  the management of the infant with respect to the treatment of your infant though it be your request that i should offer my advice yet i do not presume to dictate to your midwife as i very much approve of their method in general however i have no doubt that by pursuing the following directions great advantage will be found  as to the dress it should consist of a bellyband made of a piece of fine linen cloth doubled about three fingers wide when the navelstring is off put it single when quite well leave it off as the shirt with strings answers that purpose a blanket a short loose roller a little gown and one cap a long stay may be made use of if you think proper but not continued more than three weeks either night or day  as soon as the child is dressed i would have you give it of syrup of marshmallows and oil of sweet almonds two teaspoonfuls of each mixed together which cleanses more than sugar and butter as the former sticks to the mouth causes sore nipples and frequently throws children into the watery gripes  in the next place the child should be put to the breast if the milk cannot be obtained let it be fed with beeftea without sugar should it be even in that case it must be fed with the tea three times a day for a suckingchild requires victuals oftener than you are aware of if it continues to suck the milk will cleanse it sufficiently should it not it is necessary to give it three doses of physic by your doctors or apothecarys order as i i am persuaded few nurses understand enough of drugs to cleanse it properly  should you have overheated yourself had any uncommon uneasiness during your pregnancy or you or your husband have any humors in your blood lay a blister on as soon as the child is born i am well acquainted with an eminent and skiful midwife who never brings a child into the world without applying one before it is dressed and orders gumarabic about a teaspoonful at a time to be given discretionally into its victuals or alone  on the eleventh day as soon as the child is dressed to a papspoonful of purifying lotion add six drops of each of the head tinctures with which the head forehead eyebrows neck throat loins and knees should be rubbed well it will give spirits and strength to the infant and may be used with safety sick or well be careful to dry the head and as soon as done put on the cap not using pomatum on any account children in common have a great deal of weak hair by pursuing this method every day it will either take it off at the months end or give strength and make it grow it will cleanse an infants head in ten days should it have ever so great a quantity of white or yellow scurf without the least hazard of giving the child cold  the mismanagement of childrens heads in general induced me to try the experiment on one of my own by which means i made the discovery i therefore strongly recommend it to you as i am persuaded it will be of great service to your child and will prevent the fever in the head most children are subject to from improper treatment  there are two disorders incident to an infant in the month viz the redgum and thrush the latter should be very closely watched for that it may be sent through as soon as possible  if the child is subject to the hicup which is a species of convulsions and proceeds from the wind getting into the stomach it should be put to the breast that it may suck it away if it neither will nor can give it some warm beeftea  at the end of three weeks i would have you coat the child which with the stay should be half a yard in length the shirt to be one inch longer and the frock rather longer than the rest they should all tie behind by which means you may put on the dress in a minute feed your child as directed keep it to regular hours and cool in the night you will then have little trouble about that time should the child be well it will then endeavor to step up the nurses stomach and get on her head is it not then absurd that it should be clothed in such a manner as to deprive it of the proper use of its limbs which it often is from the common mode of dressing at least six months how did our first parents shelter themselves from cold the scripture tells us they came naked into the world and had they not touched the forbidden fruit they would never have known the want of clothing nature points out to us to keep ourselves cool the great folly of childrens wearing long clothes i attribute to a mistaken notion taken from that passage in the scripture where we are told our blessed savior was wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger as there was no other room for him in the inn at that time the reason was just being the depth of winter but surely there can be none given now for clothing a child so hot who is confined for the first month and for the most part a quarter of a year either to the lyingin room or nursery which in general may be more properly compared to a bagnio than any other place  when you take an infant of three weeks old in your arms sit as upright in your chair as if at your harpsichord from that position you will have the full use of your arms dance it from thigh to thigh which you will find gives it a notion of stepping that you may not be at a loss after your nurse has left you when the child is at the breast avoid talking loud as it affrights and makes it quit it should you have done so by chance speak in a low tone of voice it will look up in your face smile and in all probability suck again  the time of day an infant is dressed in general is about eleven or twelve oclock which i look upon to be an improper one it should be early in a morning as it not only tires but refreshes and gives it an appetite to its breakfast when finished if not sleepy send it into the air i mean at that season of the year when the shortness of the days and the inclemency of the weather will otherwise prevent its enjoying the benefit of it at a proper time of day in summer it is not material  at six weeks old it should have no other covering to sleep in but a shirt and a little shift or bedgown half an ell long should it not be kept cool as much strength will be lost in one night as gained in two days  it is a mistaken opinion that an infant will sleep the first quarter some may but believe me it is not natural the first four months being the time to give them a notion of their feet at six weeks if you suffer the child to stand on your left thigh you will find it shove forwards and put out its fee to step you may then with safety put on the nursesrelief which i have so contrived that it takes off the whole weight of the child and may be worn at all times it grieves me to hear parent desire the nurse to take the child it is so heavy she cannot hold it in justice to yourself and it to which particular attendance must and should be given for the first twelve months which will fully employ the time of any one person by that means you will in all probability have your child out of arms in that time on the contrary it may be almost two years you will easily judge by taking it into your arms occasionally whether it is properly nursed or not  some ladies are so particular that they think a child should not be set on its feet till expiration of the first eight months which is a false notion for as i observed before the first four months the child should exercise its limbs after that time and in many children before the teeth are shooting into the gums and that is often attended with worse consequences than actual tthing itself because an infant is subject to the strangury and a parents not knowing or considering that circumstance is what occasions children to be taken off from the age of four months to three years old an instance of which i will give you  a person who takes in children to nurse whose house i had occasion frequently to pass taking notice of my little boy then in arms led me naturally to enquire after her nursing child whom i had often seen and remarked to have been a fine boy the poor woman dropped a tear and said the child was dead the agitation of mind she then appeared to be in would not permit me to ask any other questions but as i was passing in the evening i took the opportunity while she was standing at the door of enquiring if he had been long ill she said he had not and what age he was about five months and had two teeth looked so blue that she had no doubt would have been cut the next day which led me farther to ask concerning the childs water first whether she perceived any stoppage secondly if he cried before he made any and thirdly when he did if it was not extremely hot really said the woman i did not take sufficient notice another person who occasionally assisted her and was then confined to her bed in the next room overhearing the conversation desired i would walk in when she informed me she recollected that the child not only cried when it made water but that the water was so extremely hot it almost fleed him but that is common they then sent for the apothecary but before he could come to their assistance the child was carried off in a fit occasioned by the strangury which he being unacquainted with directly pronounced it to be occasioned by the two teeth  as a farther proof i will give you an instance of a child of twenty weeks old i was called n by a neighbor to look at whom i found in a violent fit of crying in which it had been about two hours observing the childs knees drawn up to its chin induced me to ask if it had made water in that time i was told it had not in about an hour after i looked in again and found the child in a sound sleep upon enquiry i was told he had been very uneasy before he made water but as soon as he had it relieved him and he became composed and as in the case beforementioned his thighs were almost fleed by the heat of its water in consequence of which i advised her to give it some gumarabic water which had the desired effect the following day she perceived two under teeth look blue which i recommended her to rub with a gold ring she did and they came through with great ease encouraged by the gumarabic carrying the fever off by urine incident to those cases she has continued it ever since in every thing he eats and drinks and he is now a fine boy his grandmother is of opinion that his life was saved by that means in order to keep the mouth cool when you perceive the child about its teeth the first thing given it in a morning should be a teaspoonful of cold spring water  every mother or nurse should constantly feel the childs pulse once every day that she may judge whether it is in health or not for my own part though i do not profess any skill yet by accustoming myself to this method feeling the water and examining the stools i am able to sorm a better judgment than most people would imagine i am indebted to a very eminent physician for this hint and i do verily believe it is a very essential one to any who have the care of an infant  if a childs water appears of the color of milk neglect not to give it the gumarabic three or four times a day as you may be assured it has either caught cold or is about its double teeth in either case it has been found of great use unless it operates as a purgative which is very seldom the case if it does omit it a day or two  some little time after the foregoing observations i met a gentleman of the faculty the father of a large family whose opinion i asked concerning a childs having the strangury and at what age he said at or about two years old the earnest manner in which i put the question to him i suppose led him to ask me whether i had reason from the experience i had had in attending my own children to imagine it appeared before i evaded the question as at that time it did not suit me to make the confession knowing it would be of great advantage to every person that purchased a nursesrelief of me as i then intended to make a point of convincing them how necessary it is for a parent or nurse to have the gumarabic water by them the first three years as few children cut all their double teeth sooner  should the child frequently heave when the stomach is oppressed which is common from six weeks to four or five months old send for your apothecary that he may order something for its relief otherwise by not checking the disorder in time you will most likely throw the infant into convulsions  it is very absurd for any one to imagine the faculty do not understand the disorders incident to infants in many instances you will find their opinion requisite should that be the case i earnestly entreat you will make it a rule to ask in what manner he expects the medicines to operate they will all acquaint you but some through hurry of business omit it by which they are often under the necessity of attending a second time to satisfy the doubts and fears of the nurse who from the childs having two or three motions in an hour and perhaps frequently sick alarms herself with apprehension of danger though at the same time it may be quite necessary and the infant could not be relieved without  i was greatly alarmed in a similar case with my last child and should have been more so had it not been for my mother who told me the medicine the apothecary sent would take the effect as above mentioned or probably by means of the fright i might have lost my milk instances of which have been frequent as soon a you have given the medicines for they do not always operate alike put a double napkin round its nek and lay it in your lap at least an hour it possibly may fall asleep if so the better and it is a great chance when it awakes if it be not sick or have a motion perhaps both it may otherwise pass off by urine in which case should it be a little convulsed do not alarm yourself as it will not be of any bad consequence  should the child be in a cold clammy sweat do not let it make you uneasy apply warm napkins to the neck face hands and bottom lay your hand on the navel and gently rub the stomach carefully avoiding to overheat the child as soon as it is easy it will reward your tender care with a pleasing smile endeavor to compose it and then you may with safety put it in the bed or cradle taking care not to disturb it on any consideration should it sleep five six or eight hours be sure in that time to draw your breasts twice as more children suffer by that omission than you are aware of among the number i lost a fine boy of my own four months old by that neglect  when your child is five months old provided you follow my directions you may put it into a gocart which i am persuaded will be found very convenient after it is in tie the cart to the leg of a table or chair continue it thus for a fortnight that it may feel its feet properly it will take great pleasure in standing so if you do not observe this caution but suffer the cart to run on the floor at first it may very likely intimidate the child and give it a dislike to it i have given directions for one to be made with a flag to it to encourage the child to stand upright and a chair on a different construction from those made use of in common of which i very much disapprove as they are too great a confinement  i have observed by my own children when ill that they have frequently taken a little warm victuals or drink because the fatigue of sucking has been too great but as soon as a child finds itself easy it will readily receive the nourishment from the breast designed by nature when you take the child out of the cradle or off the bed after sleeping it should not be set on its feet immediately as it is apt to make it cross the feeble state we ourselves are in on our first getting out of bed plainly shows the utility of the above caution you will therefore do well to set the child in its chair and divert it for five minutes after that time it may with safety be allowed to go to play  i do not approve of a backstring nor do i allow a child to run alone till it can get up of itself after falling neither do i suffer any body to take it off the ground when young should you accustom them to that they will ie and scream till you do on the contrary if no notice is taken they will get up of themselves go to play and not mind a fall so much even if an accident happened by it  i hope by these instructions which you have from under my hand you will be a better nurse to your first child than i was to my fifth that it may prove so is the sincere wish of  dear madam your obedient humble servant london october         receipts referred to in the body of the work to make barleyjelly for a
