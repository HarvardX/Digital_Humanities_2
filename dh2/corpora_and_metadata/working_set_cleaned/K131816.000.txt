mrs pit nancy mrs t kennedy dimity mrs morton a servant etc three weeks after marriage act i enter woodley and dimity dimity po po  no such thing  i tell you mr woodley you are a mere novice in these affairs   wood nay but listen to reason mrs dimity  has not your master mr drugget invited me down to his countryseat in order to give me his daughter nancy in marriage and with what pretense can he now break off   dim what pretense  you put a body out of all patience  but go on your own way sir my advice is all lost upon you   wood you do me injustice mrs dimity  your advice has governed my whole conduct  have not i sixed an interest in the young ladys heart   dim an interest in a fiddlestick  you ought to have made love to the father and mother  what do you think the way to get a wife at this time of day is by speaking sine things to the lady you have a fancy for  that was the practice indeed but things are altered now  you must address the old people sir and never trouble your head about your mistress  none of your letters and verses and soft looks and fine speeches  have compassion thou angelic creature on a poor dying  pshaw stuff nonsense all out of fashion  go your ways to the old curmudgeon humor his whims  i shall esteem it an honor sir to be allied to a gentleman of your rank and taste upon my word he is a pretty young gentleman  then wheel about to the mother your daughter maam is the very model of you and i shall adore her for your sake here come hither nancy take this gentleman for better for worse la mama i can never consent  i should not have thought of your consent  the consent of your relations is enough why how now hussy so away you go to church the knot is tied an agreeable honeymoon follows the charm is then dissolved you go to all the clubs in st jamess street your lady goes to the coterie and in a little time you both go to doctors commons and if faults on both sides prevent a divorce you will quarrel like contrary elements all the rest of your lives that is the way of the world now   wood but you know my dear dimity the old couple have received every mark of attention from me   dim attention to be sure you did not fall asleep in their company but what then  you should have entered into their characters played with their humors and sacrificed to their absurdities   wood but if my temper is too frank    dim frank indeed yes you have been frank enough to ruin yourself  have not you to do with a rich old shopkeeper retired from business with an hundred thousand pounds in his pocket to enjoy the dust of the london road which he calls living in the country  and yet you must find fault with his situation  what if he has made a ridiculous gimcrack of his house and gardens you know his heart is set upon it and could not you have commended his taste but you must be too frank  those walks and alleys are too regular  those evergreens should not be cut into such fantastic shapes  and thus you advise a poor old mechanic who delights in every thing that is monstrous to follow nature  oh youre likely to be a successful lover   wood but why should i not save a fatherinlaw from being a laughing stock   dim make him your fatherinlaw first    wood why he cannot open his windows for the dust  he stands all day looking through a pane of glass at the carts and stagecoaches as they pass by and he calls that living in the fresh air and enjoying his own thoughts   dim and could not you let him go on his own way you have ruined yourself by talking sense to him and all your nonsense to the daughter will not make amends for it  and then the mother how have you played your cards in that quarter  she wants a tinsel man of fashion for her second daughter  dont you see says she how happy my eldest girl is made by marrying sir charles rackett she has been married three entire weeks and not so much as one angry word has passed between them  nancy shall have a man of quality too   wood and yet i know sir charles rackett perfectly well   dim yes so do i and i know he will make his lady wretched at last  but what then you should have humored the old folks  you should have been a talking empty fop to the good old lady and to the old gentleman an admirer of his taste in gardening but you have lost him  he is grown fond of this beau lovelace who is here in the house with him the coxcomb ingratiates himself by flattery and youre undone by frankness   wood and yet dimity i will not despair   dim and yet you have reason to despair a million of reasons  tomorrow is fixed for the wedding day sir charles and his lady are to be here this very night  they are engaged indeed at a great rout in town but they take a bed here notwithstanding  the family is sitting up for them mr drugget will keep you all up in the next room there till they arrive  and tomorrow the business is over  and yet you dont despair  hush  hold your tongue here comes lovelace  step in and i will devise something i warrant you  exit woodley the old folks shall not have their own way  it is enough to vex a body to see an old father and mother marrying their daughter as they please in spite of all i can do   exit enter drugget and lovelace drug and so you like my house and gardens mr lovelace   love oh perfectly sir they gratify my taste of all things one sees villas where nature reigns in a wild kind of simplicity but then

gardening to assist you   drug lackaday no  ha ha i understand these things  i love my garden the front of my house mr lovelace is not that very pretty   love elegant to a degree   drug dont you like the sundial placed just by my dining room windows   love a perfect beauty   drug i knew you would like it  and the motto is so well adapted  tempus edax and index rerum and i know the meaning of it  time eats and discovers all things  ha ha pretty mr lovelace  i have seen people so stare at it as they pass by  ha ha   love why now i dont believe there is a nobleman in the kingdom has such a thing   drug oh no  they have got into a false taste i bought that bit of ground the other side of the road  and it looks very pretty  i made a duckpond there for the sake of the prospect   love charmingly imagined   drug my leaden images are well    love they exceed ancient statuary   drug i love to be surpised at the turning of a walk with an inanimate figure that looks you full in the face and can say nothing to you while one is enjoying ones own thoughts  ha ha  mr lovelace i will point out a beauty to you  just by the hawhaw at the end of my ground there is a fine dutch figure with a scythe in his hand and a pipe in his mouth  that is a jewel mr lovelace   love that escaped me a thousand thanks for pointing it out  i observe you have two very fine yewtrees before the house   drug lackaday sir they look uncouth  i have a design about them  i intend  ha ha it will be very pretty mr lovelace  i intend to have them cut into the shape of the two giants at guildhall  ha ha   love exquisite  why then they will not look like trees   drug oh no no  not at all  i will not have any thing in my garden that looks like what it is  ha ha   love nobody understands these things like you mr drugget   drug lackaday its all my delight now  this is what i have been working for i have a great improvement to make still  i propose to have my evergreens cut into fortifications and then i shall have the moro castle and the havanna and then near it shall be ships of myrtle sailing upon seas of box to attack the town will not that make my place look very rural mr lovelace   love why you have the most fertile invention mr drugget   drug ha ha this is what i have been working for i love my garden  but i must beg your pardon for a few moments  i must step and speak with a famous nurseryman who is come to offer me some choice things  do go and join the company mr lovelace  my daughter rackett and sir charles will be here presently  i shall not go to bed till i see em  ha ha my place is prettily variegated  this is what i have been working for  i fined for sheriff to enjoy these things  ha ha   exit love poor mr drugget mynheer van thundertentrunck in his little box at the side of a dyke has as much taste and elegance  however if i can but carry off his daughter if i can but rob his garden of that flower  why then i shall say this is what i have been working for   enter dimity dim do lend us your assistance mr lovelace  youre a sweet gentleman and love a good natured action   love why how now what is the matter   dim my master is going to cut the two yewtrees into the shape of two devils i believe and my poor mistress is breaking her heart for it  do run and advise him against it  she is your friend you know she is sir   love oh if that is all  i will make that matter easy directly   dim my mistress will be for ever obliged to you and you will marry her daughter in the morning   love oh my rhetoric shall dissuade him   dim and sir put him against dealing with that nurseryman mrs drugget hates him   love does she   dim mortally   love say no more the business is done   exit dim if he says one word old drugget will never forgive him  my brain was at its last shift but if this plot takes  so here comes our nancy   enter nancy nan well dimity what is to become of me   dim my stars what makes you up miss  i thought you were gone to bed   nan what should i go to bed for only to tumble and toss and fret and be uneasy  they are going to marry me and i am frighted out of my wits   dim why then youre the only young lady within fifty miles round that would be frightened at such a thing   nan ah if they would let me choose for myself   dim dont you like mr lovelace   nan my mama does but i dont i dont mind his being a man of fashion not i   dim and pray can you do better than follow the fashion   nan ah i know there is a fashion for new bonnets and a fashion for dressing the hair  but i never heard of a fashion for the heart   dim why then my dear the heart mostly follows the fashion now   nan does it  pray who sets the fashion of the heart   dim all the fine ladies in london of my conscience   nan and what is the last new fashion pray   dim why to marry any fop that has a few deceitful agreeable appearances about him something of a pert phrase a good operator for the teeth and tolerable tailor   nan and do they marry without loving   dim oh marrying for love has been a great while out of fashion   nan why then i will wait till that fashion comes up again   dim and then mr lovelace i reckon    nan pshaw i dont like him he talks to me as if he was the most miserable man in the world and the confident thing looks so pleased with himself all the while  i want to marry for love and not for cardplaying  i should not be able to bear the life my sister leads with sir charles rackett  and i will forfeit my new cap if they dont quarrel soon   dim oh fie no they will not quarrel yet awhile  a quarrel in three weeks after marriage would be somewhat of the quickest  by and by we shall hear of their whims and their humors  well but if you dont like mr lovelace what say you to mr woodley   nan ah  i dont know what to say  but i can sing something that will explain my mind   song when first the dear youth passing by disclosed his fair form to my sight i gazed but i could not tell why my heart it went throb with delight as nearer he drew those sweet eyes were with their dear meaning so bright i trembled and lost in surprise my heart it went throb with delight when his lips their dear accents did try the return of my love to excite i feigned yet began to guess why my heart it went throb with delight we changed the stolen glance the fond smile which lovers alone read aright we looked and we sighed yet the while our hearts they went throb with delight consent i soon blushed with a sigh my promise i ventured to plight come hymen we then shall know why our hearts they go throb with delight enter woodley wood my sweetest angel i have heard all and my heart overflows with love and gratitude   nan ah but i did not know you was listening you should not have betrayed me so dimity i shall be angry with you   dim well i

if that is the wise deep meaning of our poet the mans a fool a blockhead and i will show it what could induce him in an age so nice so famed for virtue so refined from vice to form a plan so trivial false and low as if a belle could quarrel with a beau as if there were  in these thrice happy days one who from nature or from reason strays there is no cross husband now no wrangling wife the man is downright ignorant of life it is the millennium this  devoid of guile fair gentle truth and white robbed candor smile from every breast the sordid love of gold is banished quite  no boroughs now are sold pray tell me sirs  for i dont know i vow pray  is there such a thing as gaming now do peers make laws against that giant vice and then at arthurs break them in a trice no  no  our lives are virtuous all austere and hard pray ladies  do you ever see a card those empty boxes show you dont love plays the managers poor souls get nothing now a days if here you come  by chance but once a week the pit can witness that you never speak pensive attention sits with decent mien no paint no naked shoulders to be seen and yet this grave this moral pious age may learn one useful lesson from the stage shun strife ye fair and once a contest over wake to a blaze the dying flame no more  from fierce debate fly all the tender loves and venus cries coachman putto my doves the genial bed no blooming grace prepares and every day becomes a day of cares finis
