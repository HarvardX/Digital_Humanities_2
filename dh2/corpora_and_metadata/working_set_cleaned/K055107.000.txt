doctor last in his chariot a comedy as it is performed at the theater royal in the haymarket  london printed for w griffin at garricks head in catharinestreet strand mdcclxix  to samuel foot esquire sir though had this comedy failed which from it is first nights reception was somewhat more than probable i should certainly have suffered the whole disgrace it is not with less readiness that i seize this opportunity on its better success to acknowledge the obligations which the editor of doctor last in his chariot has to mr foot  i am indebted to you for undertaking a very long part which in your circumstances i consider as a particular favor i am indebted to you for exerting unusual spirit in the performance when there was little hopes of putting the audience in a good humor and more dont be ashamed when i boast of it i am indebted to you not only for a whole scene the consultation of physicians in the first act but for several hints throughout the piece which had the happiest effect though some of them may perhaps have suffered by being clothed in my language  i am more particularly acknowledging upon this occasion because in the repeated remarks which the newspapers have thought proper to make on your address to the public the first night this thing was acted they would insinuate that you used the advantage your situation gave you of a personal application to the audience in order to throw contempt upon the piece while that and it is author were immediately under your protection  however sir while i return you those thanks which justice and gratitude oblige me to i am extremely doubtful whether the public will consider the favors i confess as any capital exertion of benevolence on your part for they will naturally say that as to your acting the play could not possibly have done without it which after you had received it must have been to your loss and for giving me your wit and humor all the world is sensible that there is scarcely a man living who has so much to spare i am  sir your most obliged humble servant the editor  preface the following piece is a translation of le malade imaginaire one of molieres most celebrated productions in the farcical kind some scenes which could not possibly succeed upon the english stage have been removed and those substituted in which the character of doctor last is introduced and for that character only the editor has to answer nothing else in the subsequent scenes being entirely his  how it has hitherto appeared upon the stage or how it may appear hereafter is at present of little consequence it is submitted to the candor of intelligent readers who will consider a farce as such and decide upon it is merit accordingly to add more is needless except thanks to the performers particularly to mr sowdon for his kindness to the editor when he stood in great need of assistance and to that admirable comedian mr weston by whose excellent performance dr last is still rendered a laughable object  prologue written by d garrick esquire and spoken by mr foot your servants kind masters from bottom to top be assured while i breath or can walk  i mean hop be you pleased to smile or be pleased to grumble be whatever you please i am still your most humble as to laugh is a right only given to man to keep up that right is my pride and my plan  fair ladies dont frown i meant woman too  what is common to man must be common to you  you all have a right your sweet muscles to curl from the old smirking prude to the tittring young girl and ever with pleasure my brains i could spin to make you all giggle and you ye gods grin in this present summer as well as the past to your favor again we present dr last who by wonderful feats in the papers recounted from trudging on foot to his chariot has mounted amongst the old britons when war was begun charioteers would slay ten while the foot could slay one so when doctors on wheels with dispatches are sent mortality bills rise a thousand per cent but think not to physic that quackrys confined all the world is a stage and the quacks are mankind  there is trade law and statequacks nay would we but search we should find  heaven bless us  some quacks in the church the stiff band and stiff bob of the methodist race give the balsam of life and the tincture of grace and their poor wretched patients think much good is done em though blisters and causticks are ever upon them as for law and the state if quackrys a curse which will make the good bad and the bad will make worse we should point out the quack from the regular brother they are wiser than i who can tell one from the other can the stage with its bills puffs and patents stand trial shall we find out no quacks in the theater royal some dramatical drugs that are puffed on the town cause many wry faces and scarce will go down nay an audience sometimes will in quackry delight and sweat down an author some pounds in one night to return to our quack  should he helped by the weather raise laughter and kind perspiration together should his nostrums of hips and of vapors but cure ye his chariot he well will deserve i assure ye it is easy to set up a chariot in town and easier still is that chariot laid down he petitions by me both as doctor and lover that you will not stop his wheels or his chariot tip over fix him well i beseech you the worst on it would be should

town numerous as they are he is the most ignorant as well as the most impudent but it is really shocking to humanity to consider to what a head these dangerous cheats are arrived in this great city and it is not less amazing that people should confide their health their most valuable possession to wretches they would not trust with any thing else in short i know no way of putting a stop to their progress but by an unlimited act against the vending of poisons which i think would very fairly comprehend them   ail ha  you have made a very fine speech now  do you think if the cures they perform were not wonderful people would take their medicines so kindly  what has essence of waterdock done for the scurvy  what balsam of honey in colds and consumptions  the stomach pills for cholicky complaints  then you senseless idiot you do you think his majesty would give his royal letters patent for pills essences electuaries cordials tinctures quintessences to poison his subjects  but to strike you dumb at once is not that blessed medicine baume de vie in itself a remedy for all disorders under heaven   friend all   ail look at the list of cures  then the reasonings good  all disorders spring from the stomach  baume de vie is a sovereign remedy for the stomach  and therefore cures all disorders   friend if so why dont you take it and get rid of yours   ail why why  there is no general rule without an exception   friend come come brother the truth of it is there is nothing the matter with you at all and i desire no better proof of the excellency of your constitution

tears bedew my face and her sweet lips kissing my cheeks a thousand times to bring me back again to life and her  ah verily i will do it verily i will do it and then sir what will become of your fine surmises  but prudence art thou not afraid that her very thinking me dead will break her heart   pru to be sure sir if you should keep her in her fright too long   ail o let me alone for that i will make the experiment this very minute this very minute  but is there no danger in feigning ones self dead   pru no no what danger should there be it is only shutting your eyes and stretching yourself out to friendly now sir we shall show you your error and convince you how much you have injured the best of wives to ailwoud twill be pleasant enough afterward to see how blank he will look  here is

excellent funeral sermon truly aside   mrs ail prudence you must assist me in the execution of my design and you may depend upon it i will amply reward your services since by good fortune no one is yet apprisd of this accident besides ourselves let us keep his death a secret a few days till i have been able to settle my affairs on a sure foundation there are papers and money of which i would possess myself  nor indeed is it just that all i have suffered with him living should not be rewarded by some advantage at his death   pru to be sure madam   mrs ail in the mean time i will go and secure his keys for i know he has a considerable sum of money in his scrutore which he received yesterday   scene ix ailwoud friendly prudence and mrs ailwoud who going to the door meets her husband

ignorance of the medicinal art if you can think of any method to remove that    har i must own sir i am afraid i am rather too far advanced in life to make any progress in so deep and abstracted a study   ail why with regard to the more capital branches i grant you but in the subaltern offices i am of a contrary opinion suppose now you were to bind yourself apprentice for a year or two to some skilful apothecary surely in that time you might learn to decypher a prescription and make up a medicine with very few blunders   har do you think so sir   ail you might indeed now and then give a dose of arsenick for salts but that is an accident might happen to the oldest practitioner   friend ah brother brother what is this i hear it was but this moment you were determined to renounce physic
