a collection of poems on various subjects  by thomas ellwood  london printed and sold by luke hind in georgeyard lombard street price sixpence  to the reader the following poems wrote by thomas ellwood which have lain dormant in manuscript for many years being lately communicated to me by a friend i thereupon gave them a serious perusal and observing the pious and religious sentiments wherewith they abound thought they were too good to be lost especially as there is room to hope the uncaptious and sincerely religious youth of either sex may be benefitted thereby  the editor  divine

whose treasure lies in realms above nay all that are not foes draw near and grant my song a willing ear in early times when man was made before the priesthood was confined while truth in adams household stayed and god adored by all mankind no form of worship that appears had been prescribed for many years while men with god a converse kept and on him did devoutly wait he gracious while they waked or slept did so their minds illuminate that they not only knew his will but by his aid could it fulfill before the flood and after long the patriarchs directed were both when to warble out their song and how to open heavens gate by prayer whatever act the lord required their hearts he thereunto inspired but after that heaven did decree in special love to abraham that his posterity should be sacred to him and bear his name a worship asked at their hand which did in observations stand what must be offered when and where each part was carefully expressed the various modes prescribed were for sacrificing and the rest settimes were fixed for solemn feasts difference twixt clean and unclean beasts this legal worship as it stood in meats and drinks and carnal rites were types of that eternal good to which the gospel all invites the longest date that it could claim was but till heb ix  0 reformation came when that auspicious time drew nigh the morning of that day was come the word

templevail did rend and being of those types the sum that dispensation had its end twas meet the servant should withdraw when he the masters presence saw but yet ever christ would abrogate a worship so long time in use and disannul the legal state he did a better introduce this law was not in marble cut but in the heart and conscience put for so the prophets in gods name while yet the law in vigor stood did by authority proclaim he said who what he says makes good jer xxxi    ezekiel xi     0 after those days i in the heart my fear will place and law impart again joel ii    and it shall come to pass my spirit on all flesh i will pour on young and old the lad and lass shall feel the virtue of this shower not of the priest shall law be sought but all thy sons of god be taught happy they who such a teacher have and yield thereto a willing ear from all that is hurtful he will save if in his law they persevere o that mankind therein would walk nor some against some only for it talk the son of god who from heaven came and fully mans redemption wrought when met by the samarian dame the true approved worship taught not at that jerusalem city or this mount though revered for jacobs fount but who the father will adore whether bond or free aged or youth must worship not as heretofore in types but in spirit and truth gods a spirit  among jews and greeks such inward worshipers he seeks not those who serve in repititions or in prescriptions as the jews nor yet in oral vain traditions such as samaritans did use the jewish faith in symbols stood the samaritans was never good types shadows sacraments and signs did on this dispensation wait who to the gospel worship joins shadows must leave to the shadwy state it is not the fatted calf that skips is offered now but calves of lips thanks and praise sacrifices are to god most pleasing when they spring from a pure heart he does prepare and then excites his acts to sing true christans use both heart and tongue whenever a hymn or psalm is sung not chanting in a formal note states touched in ancient song perverting what the psalmist wrote whose case cannot to all belong it is who their own experence bring with spirit and with judgment sing instead of incense to perfume the altar from the soul arise in flames that warm but not consume sighs supplications groans and cries which though but weak do never fail at mercys fountain to prevail romans viii    we know not what to ask  paul taught who then shall forms appoint true prayer is by the spirit wrought with which heaven does each child anoint he that best knows what we should have inwardly teaches what to crave this then of worship is the sum to wait in spirit on the lord that at what time he deigns to come the soul may hear his living word and with alacrity fulfill what he makes known to be his will for when the mind on god is stayed in silence waiting to be taught the worlds concerns aside are laid nor license gin to one vain thought the lord does to that soul draw near and with instruction fills its ear instructed still the soul does cleave the lord his virtue does impart discoveries of his will he leaves which operate upon the heart a sacrifice he does prepare whether thanksgiving praise or prayer great is the pleasure god does take in such oblations in his sight that soul is dear he will not forsake but in his book his name will write the joys that the obedient feel nor men nor angels can reveal inward peace my peace i give unto you john xiv    who can conceive much less express the inward peace which they possess who by the indwelling of the light have put satanic powers to flight in whom renewed and born again the lord of life does live and reign renewed restored purged purified and natural rovings laid aside cleansd by the blood kept by the grace that sin in them scarce finds a place the temple swept prepared then blessed with presence of an heavenly guest a guest not for a night or twain but one that always will remain yea such a guest as does impart that joy which overcomes the heart a joy so great no tongue of man express the fullness of it can and this unutterable bliss flows from the love of god to his o love immense and without bound to all that in the truth are found words are too short to set it forth in its extent and real worth the wife that in the bosom lies is precious in the husbands eyes the sucking babe is very near the only son exceeding dear tender the apple of the eye friends and relations very nigh but yet this love does far transcend that to wife child eye parent friend these metaphors are all too low the nature of this love to show no tongue is able to declare how dear to god his children are only the sense of it is felt which breaks the heart and makes it melt fraus diabolica the devil overreached men by a slight when first he taught them to oppose the light for he himself in darkness dwells and he that hates the light must needs in darkness be archcraft indeed he knows the light who shun must needs into the thickest darkness run and he so craftily his plot has laid that many simple ones he has betrayed to tread the path that leads to deaths dark cell till by a sad mistake they come to hell loyalty i know my heart is loyal to my prince i never harbored a disloyal thought and if my pen or tongue has given offense that error has through ignorance been wrought for which when proved i will for mercy cry and thankful live or uncomplaining die thoughts how long alas shall vain thoughts in me rest and find a lurking place within my breast how long how long ever i a conqueror be and over my ownself get the victory ah how disgustful is it when i find some little trival thought possess my mind often have i set myself to keep the door that no vain cogitation enter more and reckoned too so strict a watch to keep that nothing unexamind in should creep but on a sudden when i least suspected an idle thought has satan introjected which like a little thief has open set the door for greater rovers in to get i will trust myself no more i see it is vain man of himself no conquest can obtain to him will i betake myself from whom each good and perfect gift i know does come his succor will i beg his aid implore who for the helpless still has help in store thou israels shepherd thou alone can keep my soul who neither slumber do nor sleep thou everywhere who do all places fill who art both perfect power and perfect will thou allsufficient art no thought can fly the scrutage of thy alldiscerning eye and thou dear father too commanded have thy children all their care on thee to cast which i most gladly do but yet not so as henceforth careless in myself to grow no i resolve still on the watch to be not in my own strength but empowered by thee set thou the watch o lord appoint the guard give thou the charge o help me so to ward that no vain thought into my mind may slip but in the embrio may receive a nip thou who for me have great deliverance wrought deliver too from every idle thought to such as stand idle in the marketplace why do you trifle thus your time away why are you of such treasure so profuse do you expect to have another day who of the present make so ill a use how can it be the moment that is past will come no more the hour misspent can never be recalled old cronos has but one poor lock before his head behind is altogether bald take that from me be therefore wise in time while yet an hour is lent you lest when that is vainly spent it never should again be in your power although with tears ye seek it to repent for god is just and though he frequently does man invite to cease from evil and accept of grace yet if fond man persists his love to slight mercy withdraws justice steps in her place and die he must agony i faint my dying breath will not suffice to midwife forth my words my faltring tongue resigns its office to my weeping eyes speak eyes and do my faithful heart no wrong ye crystal fountains set your sluices wide stream forth your tears like a full flowing tide draw up the floodgates let the torrent flow in its right current whether fast or slow a state blessed is the man whose heart is found when trials come upright and sound whom not the hopes of greatest gain nor fear of most tormenting pain nor yet the most magnetic pleasure nor honors heaped up without measure can cause to shrink or start aside and leave the strait way for the wide this is the state on which my eye is fixed oh that no cloud may ever come betwixt but that my heart may henceforth always dwell in that which does all earthly things excel for he alone can stand the dreadful shock whose house is built on the eternal rock to a friend in america my heart is with thee but i dare not give myself the pleasure of a wandering thought that i to see the day may ever live when to america i may be brought where i that peaceful solitude may find which more than riches would delight my mind but here i am fixed my station here is set by him whose will is sovereign to mine my work and service tie me here as yet at which i bless my god i dont repine o may my spirit always take delight in that which is most pleasing in his sight deus est qui cuncta gubernat except the psalm cxxvii lord the city keep the watchman watches but in vain the adversary in will creep and hardly be got out again so close his stratagems are laid so deep and many are his wiles the sentinels by him betrayed and he the watchman too beguiles sometimes truths colors up he sets as if indeed a friend he were and by that practice in he gets before his falsehood does appear and which is worst within are some that always treacherous have been who when he to the gate does come too ready are to let him in lord thou art he in whom i trust on whom my safety does depend thou only can subdue the lust thou only can the place defend my weakness lord i daily find it is thou alone sufficient art to thee therefore i have resigned the care and keeping of my heart be thou commander there in chief place thou the guard the watchman set at each assault send thou relief let satan no advantage get put thou the enemy to flight break thou his strength his works destroy discomfit thou his forces quite and fill my soul with lasting joy take too a course with those within that would the place to him betray burn up the ground that brings forth sin and the rebellious nature slay then shall i praise thy holy name and hallelujahs to thee sing my tongue and pen extend thy fame who art my god and sions king fancy when love and hate before my fancy pass they look methinks like a prospective glass if on another persons failings i do chance at any time to cast an eye love takes the end that does extenuate the opposite is held by squinteyed hate but if on tother hand i have a mind to view their actions who to me are kind love presently presents unto mine eye that glass which their good turns will magnify hate too would be as forward if she might to clap her partial glass before my sight but i am weary of her  for i know she to all goodness is a mortal foe loves the best glass by far yet many choose to look through that which sight does most abuse loves original love is a cyon cropped from virtues tree and grafted in the stock of purity planted at first in natures choicest soil before the fiend did natures beauty spoil but thence transplanted to a richer ground than can in all dame natures realm be found where being well manured it takes deep root downward and branches upward forth does shoot the sap which does this stately tree maintain is sympathy which runs as in a vein through every branch causing it first to sprout and ever awhile young tender buds spring out nor is it barren but much fruit does bear to taste most pleasing and to sight most fair a sound substantial fruit that can endure the sharpest frost and yet continue pure and that ye may this fruit the more admire take notice that i call it chaste desire loves definition the author being pressed to show his mind what is true love what not has here defined  i call not that true love which can admit of heats and colds like to an aguefit those rivers which their banks do overflow in a few hours their empty channels show that is not true love that is grounded upon wealth or has the least regard to worldly pelf for such an one might he his end obtain would prostitute his very wife for gain nor can he with true lovers have a place who is love depends upon some pretty face which age or sickness having once defaced the very groundwork of his love is razed and since that sordid thing selfinterest is able to defile the chastest breast if not prevented therefore i declare that it and true love inconsistent are such marks as these i could add many more like watchtowrs tending to forewarn the jolly but young unskilful mariners before they split their vessels on the rocks of folly but for this theme let this suffice while i tired with the subject borrow wings and fly into an higher orb where i may view that love who is choicest epithet is true that i call love that only love i call whose birth appears to be caelestial that and that only i account true love which in the sphere of chastity does move he is a true lover not who can subdue monsters and giants for his mistress sake and sighs perhaps and weep with much ado for fear she should some other happy make but who so far her happiness prefers before his own that he can be content to sacrifice his own to purchase hers though with the price of his own banishment a hearty lover wholly does devote himself to make her happy whom he loves and does with might and main her good promote although destructive to his hopes it proves he that loves truly loves to that degree whatever notions libertines may spread that he would be content yea joy to see his mistress bless some worthier persons bed nor can true love to hatred ever turn although it never should acceptance find but like a lamp clear to the last would burn and thereby manifest a noble mind such amorous motions then conclude we must how speciously so ever they are decked proceed not from true love but filthy lust which each chaste breast should study to reject loves caveat if virtue move a man to love how can he then refuse if nature move unless he prove how knows he what to choose for vices look for virtues took by many an honest heart who think they are safe till felt they have her deadly stinging smart and then too late cry o my fate was ever grief like mine i thought my love sprung from above and that it was divine but now i find with grief of mind that from the earth it came and that the fruit which thence does shoot is naught but grief and shame thus honest men are now and then deceived by beautys bait which makes them choose pleasure and lose a far more happy state nor can man be from danger free but as he does abide in that which will that nature kill and keeps close to his guide which if he do twill to him show each motions root and ground that in this day no folly may in israel be found which is the cry of one whose eye has been too apt to stray who could not stand did not gods hand support him day by day integrity it is not wealth nor worldly pelf could my affection take i am not such a friend to self to suffer for its sake it is not the features of a face could captivate mine eye i have seen some of the sweetest grace yet kept my liberty what was it then stout heart i pray did thee to love incline can thou without presumption say it was a power divine much i could say did need require in favor of my love but i choose rather to retire let it itself approve a prospect twas toward the evening of the day when books lie still and scholars play that having got an hour to spare i walked out to take the air to which the heavens did invite with smiles that promised delight my walk upon a bank i took which was the margin to a brook whose crystal streams so small did slide as if they feared to be descried save that a pebble here and there whispered their flight into mine ear hence i designed to take a view of nature in her richest hue nor should i think my labor lost to see the like at double cost the birds in various notes did sing a penegyrick to the spring each strove i think to do her best but philomel excelled the rest the trees served for a shady screen hung round with canopies of green and some were here and there imbossd with blossoms at dame natures cost which with a gentle zephyr played and pretty whistling murmurs made which way so ever i turned mine eye i saw wellmixd variety the fine wrought tapstry of the field did many pretty landscapes yield here wheat there barley did appear some in the blade some in the ear the pease in bloom and beans in flower stood waiting for a gentle shower for fear of which in haste home flies the be with honeyladen thighs the meadows in their grassgreen vest methought were very neatly dressed not only neat but richly fraught with checkered flowers finely wrought cowslips and violets intermixed and tufted daises cast betwixt each object did affect my sight with sweetest innocent delight but stayed i there oh no my heart cried still give me the better part let me with him for ever live that to these things does being give exterior things may please each sense and be enjoyed without offense but nothing but a power divine can make their virtues truly mine thy wisdom therefore so infuse into my heart that i may use thy creatures as they ought to be and still return the praise to thee to whom the highest praise is due o god most holy just and true upon his dear deceased friends isaac and mary penington since first made one as one they lived together in heart and mind in flesh and spirit one till death in part this unity did sever by taking him and leaving her alone in silent grief his absence to bemoan he being gone she could not long survive but daily from his death began to die and rather seemed to be than was alive restless till by his side she came to lie her spirit joined to his again on high thus death by whom the parting blow was given brought them together again in earth and heaven in remembrance of my friend mary penington upon septembers eighteenth day in sixteen hundred eighty two death took a virtuous dame away who of her equals left but few she widow was but now is gone to springett and to penington for personal endowments held she justly was to few behind but those wherein she most excelled were the endowments of the mind my pen i fear would wrong her worth should i attempt to set them forth i therefore purposely abstain from seeking words to speak her praise i know twould labor be in vain her fame no words can higher raise let others sing her worth while i honor and love her memory exercise ah me how bitter is this cup to drink how do i tremble when on it i think surely to fight with tigres or to rouse old hungry lions were less hazardous yea i should think i made a happy change to meet a bear whom hunger makes to range or to encounter with a dragon fierce whose scaly hide no sword did ever pierce but what do i demur still make delay seem yet to doubt whether i should obey or rebel prove let no such tainting thought into my yet untainted breast be brought why stay i why forbear then to proceed success crowns acts delays but danger breed and strength in weakness faithfulness does find when slothfulness is often left behind the bleating sheep or the flocks complaint of their shepherds woe to the shepherds of israel that do feed themselves  ye feed not the flock  but with force and with cruelty have ruled them  therefore thus faith the lord behold i am against the shepherds i will require my flock at their hand ezekiel xxxiv        0 in elder times ever shepherds were so great so arch so lordly so ambitious grown long time before the pontificial seat wherewith the world has been so plagued was known before that voice was heard which stories say was spoke from heaven by an angels tongue  poison is poured into the church this day when constantine his great revenues flung amongst the gaping shepherds ever much wealth had made them proud and lazy long ever this while they their conventicles had by stealth and glad were when informers they could miss how honorable was the shepherds trade in those blessed times how much to be desired when none unto himself advantage made of the flock when none to lordly rule aspired not seeking theirs but them content to live and living well thereon cause therein blessed upon the milk the sheep did freely give thus were the shepherds fed sheep not oppressed nor were mean while the fleecy flock ingrate but right regardful of their pastors pains with cheerful hearts they did communicate of each good thing that human life sustains in sweet communion thus they walked together and mutual comfort in each other had what was a grief to one was grief to either and what made one rejoice made the other glad the shepherds for the sheep no pains did spare but for their safety labored watched and prayed the sheep were conscious of the shepherds care and unto them a due observance paid and both the shepherds and the sheep did aim in all they undertook with heart and tongue to magnify the supreme shepherds name to whom both sheep and shepherds did belong thus was it in the morning of that day which on the heathen world long since did break and thus it held while simple truth bore sway as stories sacred and profane do speak but ah how short a time that day did last how soon eclipsed was that glorious light how quickly was its brightness overcast and buried in the grave of dusky night which never to be enough lamented loss the ruin of so excellent a state by what unhappy means it came to pass my muse will in the following lines relate blessed with a peaceful time the fruitful flock grew numerous fat and with fair fleeces clad after they had sustained many a shock from wolves bears tigres and from dogs run mad enriched with plenty by the bounteous hand of the great shepherd whose indulgent care over his flock his treasures did expand and all good things did for his sheep prepare the grateful flock of quiet thus possessed and having now of worldly wealth good store remembered with a right regardful breast the sufferings of their pastors heretofore with open hand and with enlarged heart such is the nature of a bounteous mind they to their pastors did their wealth impart each striving how to leave the rest behind none thought he gave enough all studied how they to their shepherds might their love express each seemed to vie which should the church endow most amply with the goods he did possess thus they went on a while but ever twas long the glue of gold to pastoral fingers stuck the attractive power of riches was so strong it did them from their honest labors pluck the phrygian fabler tells us of a hen that one egg daily added to the store until her dame her overfed and then she grew so overfat she laid no more so did it with these ancient shepherds fare who while a spare and temperate life they led upon their flock nor care nor pains did spare what pity twas they ever were overfed for after that through too indulgent love and injudicious zeal the wellfleecd sheep upon their shepherds who had learnt to improve their bounty did unneeded riches heap the shepherds who by that time were become not better but more greedy than before the more they in superfluous plenty swam the more they wanted and still craved the more the sheep by blind devotion led still give in hopes at length the shepherds mouths to fill scarce leaving to themselves whereon to live and yet the gaping shepherds craved still at length the shepherds in some grand offense some of the chief bellweathers having caught wrang from them great endowments on pretense large gifts to them would expiate the faut by various arts the wily shepherds get from the unthinking sheep still more and more and what at first was gift they now call debt the sheep must now pay what they gave before fullfed the shepherds quickly idle grew betook themselves to a voluptuous ease their due attendance on the flock withdrew and studied chiefly how themselves to please then discord rose among them how to part their illgot wealth they could not well agree only in this they all were of one heart that by them all the flock should fleeced be themselves they therefore into cycles cast some small some great some low some too too high and that the model might the better last they gave their plan the name of hierarchy the higher orbs the sturdier shepherds take and thereof as their own themselves possess where fair provisions for themselves they make leaving the lower circles to the less those undershepherds servants to the rest thus left to scramble for what to others left each carved for himself as he thought best so parting though unequally their theft to these the mastershepherds did commit the flock which was before their common care who fed them once or twice a week abit and that too with but dry and feeble fare the mastershepherds having thus devolved upon their journeymen the working part their genius wholly to indulge resolved and with soft pleasures satiate their heart for palaces and lofty seats they build wherein they live in most resplendent state supplied with all things that delight may yield to wanton sense and nature captivate ambition now prevails to swilling pride and portly pomp they now let loose the rein drawn in their coach and fix abroad they ride attended with a great and splendid train of the chiefweathers these precedence claim in state conventions are above them placed most of them arch by nature are by name two always with the style of arch are graced high titles they ambitiously affect sure token of foul arrogance and pride and to be called my lord your grace expect for which judicious sheep do them deride a common sheep being by chance in place where he an undershepherd heard ever while saying to one of these mayt please your grace wished him more grace in heart though less in style yet the bare name of lordship will not do they lordship love and will dominion have over both the sheep and undershepherds too who at their graces hands for grace must crave to these the undershepherds tribute pay which does them in a poor condition keep and makes them with a sharper hunger prey upon the harmless and poor helpless sheep wherein the mastershepherds them support not only with their countenance but power that by the assistance of their shepherds court they may the sheep and what they have devour and they so many ways have found to pull lock after lock from the deluded sheep that they scarce leave the sheep enough of wool them from the blasts of poverty to keep besides the general tax they on them lay whereby the flock they yearly decimate for every little cheer they make them pay and often too at unconscionable rate a ram and ewe may not with nuptial rite together join but there must present be some one of these who to them must recite the spousal words for which he claims a fee and when the pregnant ewe her lamb does yean the shepherd will another taglock get by telling them that now the ewe is clean and may again among the flock be set some certain rites too must performed be to give the lamb admittance to the fold for which the shepherd claims another fee and thus the sheep both old and young are polld when a sheep dies the shepherd dirge must say over the corpse when to the grave it is brought for which he will be sure to have his fee and mortuary if the sheep left ought thus the poor sheep the shepherds do oppress and with exactions peel on every hand nor can the sheep expect to find redress while they must to the oppressors judgment stand for in the shepherds courts these pleas are tried if any hardy sheep to pay refuse where shepherds or their creatures still preside who serve such sheep as christ was served by jews for having there contemned them right or wrong they over to the seclar power are turned to be in prison cast amongst a throng of criminals and in some countries burned these are the courts from which the sheep sustain by shepherds who them cruelly entreat such hardships as enforce them to complain and vent their sorrows with a mournful bleat ah who can without indignation hear how shepherds do the sheep in bondage keep who can from shedding showers of tears forbear at the bemoanings of the bleating sheep floralia or an account of the rise of maygames and maypoles when rome was wholly pagan long before the virgins womb our blessed savior bore there lived in rome a most lascivious dame a noted harlot flora was her name who prostituting of herself for hire great wealth did with great infamy acquire this filthy strumpet when she came to die bequeathed her treasures to romes treasury for she her heir the roman people made of what she got by her venereal trade and that her memory might still abide among them by her will she did provide that on her birthday certain wanton games should celebrated be by roman dames which that they might not for the charge decline part of her wealth she thereto did assign so large a legacy however got the roman senate thought deserved not to be contemned yet that the filthy stain of her lewd life might not too long remain a blemish on them they a way contrive the whore to bury flora keep alive her they a goddess feign whom deifyd they make over fruits and flowers to preside to her they altars raise and by decree appoint the rites of her solemnity the common people in next age adore her whom their fathers knew to be a whore and drenched in superstitious darkness fear they neither flowers nor fruits should have that year if they to keep her festivals forbear yet cause the better part did still retain a sense how she her goddeship did gain such as had due regard unto their honor would rather venture that than wait upon her but all the strumpets of the town and such as had of fame or modesty not much unto her altars flocked and danced the round some naked some in partycolours gown having their heads with flowery garlands crowned nor spared they wine but in full bowls did quaff and at each others antic gestures laugh the rein was quite let loose and they were best accounted of could break the rudest jest torches were used to intimate that night had been the time of floras chief delight and to denote how lustful she had been the goat and hare in these her games were seen thus did they yearly celebrate her day upon the calends of the month called may thus twas while heathenish superstition reigned before the gospel light dominion gained over pagan darkness but when once the day the illustrious day of christ broke forth away these filthy vapors rolled the gospel light from christian hearts dispelled this darkness quite nor can the patrons of these maygames now of such lewd pastimes any footsteps show amongst the ancient christians even in rome from whence those pagan rites at first did come but after that through satans wiles ill men from truth to error had relapsed again after the power of godliness was lost and formal christians of more form did boast when christian rome was three times worse become in some respects than had been heathen rome then to debauch the nations up were brought some pagan rites condemned of old as naught amongst these the maygames with such variation as suited best the humor of each nation how in this island they were used of old is that which in the next place shall be told on floras birthday a long pole they raise in marketplaces or in parting ways a painted pole whereon there hang displayed fine garlands of the choicest flowers made on top of which a weathercock is set emblem of those who do such sports abet unto this pole the looser class resort and spend their time in timemispending sports the fiddle or the bagpipe calls them forth and they come foremost who are of least worth here old and young of either sex do meet and with obscene discourse each other greet about the tree they in disorder dance as children on their hobbyhorses prance confusedly they intermix in routs and drown the fiddle with their deafning shouts one breaks a bawdy jest wherein does follow from all the rabble an applauding hollow with scoffs derisions jeers they entertain each other and whatevers loose and vain and who most archly can the mimick play is sure for praise to bear the bell away the liberty which at such times they use with scoffs and jokes the passersby to abuse has passed into a proverb that it is said of such an one they a mere may game made for in these revelrouts they countenance whatever tends profaneness to advance nor are these dry feasts flora does pretend to guard the vine and store of barley send and therefore sure her votaries will not fail to steep their brains that day in wine or ale in brimful bowls or glasses then they bouse and healths on bare and bended knees carouse the health they drink perhaps of some great lord who is wellgrown woods their may pole did afford who is honor doubtless would have risen higher had he bestowed it on the poor for fire patrons of maypoles if they please may see the original of this their vanity yea all the rise of maygames may behold who for them are so strenuous and bold it is floras feast a strumpet void of shame the institution from the romans came but they were heathen what is that to we who boast a nobler birth a higher pedigree oh britons give your views a higher aim nor slur with pagan rites the christian name an epistle to a friend via recta ad
