spring and its note when heard early in the year should never fail to invite the rural oeconomist to his useful occupation with stillingfleet and pennant we acknowledge the fallibility of human calendars for the purposes of husbandry and with them must conclude that some attention should be given to those feathered guides who come heaventaught and point out the true commencement of the season their food being the insects of those seasons they continue with us br zool   the cuckoo is so well known in this and every other country of europe that we are not surprised to find its natural history has engaged the particular attention of every writer on ornithology in whose works it could be introduced with propriety it may hence be difficult if not impossible to treat of its peculiar habits with an elegance of language superior to the description of buffon to select more judiciously the beautiful fictions of ancient bards than has been done by pennant and other preceding writers who have thus embellished its history or to add to general information any material circumstance that has evaded the vigilance and accuracy of latham  the note of this bird is a call to love and is peculiar to the male who perched on the branch of a tree or the summit of an eminence thus invites the female from the coppice in which she sits in silence in a calm evening his note may be heard among the trees far off and when disappointed of its mate the neighboring woods reecho his hollow note at the distance of a quarter of a mile  all authors have allowed that the cuckoo does not hatch its own eggs but deposits them in the nest of some other bird generally in that of a hedgesparrow waterwagtail or a yellowhammer some writers say the cuckoo lays only one egg others two the egg figured by sepp is like the jackdaws both in size and shape of a greenish white speckled with brown  latham says it is certainly not that of the cuckoo which he describes not much bigger than that of the hedgesparrow greatly elongated in shape the ground color not unlike it and mottled all over with ferruginous purple in the nest the fosterparent attends them with the same care as her own and when the brood is hatched she shows no dislike to the spurious offspring she treats them with equal tenderness and toils with the same assiduity to supply them with food the young cuckoo when fledged follows its little instructor for a short time but as its appetite increases and the small insects it collects in imitation of its supposed parent soon become insufficient for its subsistence they separate its ingratitude is proverbial among the french ingrat comme un coucou  from a ridiculous supposition that it changed into a hawk and devoured its nurse  about the end of june the call of the
