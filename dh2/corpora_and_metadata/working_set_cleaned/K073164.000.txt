written by general sir william waller  london printed for j bell bookseller to his royal highness the prince of wales       preface in this little collection of poems all those signed anna matilda except the reply to reuben have been before the public desirous to have her name united with that of della crusca s longer than the fleeting fame of newspapers allows anna matilda had begun to recall some fugitive trifles in order to form them into a volume  when she saw the poetry of della crusca etc advertised by mr bell this did not induce her to change her design only the mode of it and still wishing to be united with her favorite bard in a distinct publication she offered his publisher her poems on condition of their being formed into a volume similar to his  the offer was accepted  not having however poetry enough to form such a volume she was persuaded to enrich it with some curious prose  written in other times the fragment subjoined to the poems is from the autograph of the famous sir william waller an important actor in the busy drama of the last century the manuscript has been preserved in a family to which its editor is allied and who are pleased at an opportunity of making their treasure public how then can anna matilda fear for her poetic existence when it is protected on the one hand by the best lyric of the present age and on the other by one of the most pious

verge of windsor forest have i then left you sweet hygeian bowers  oh have i left you friendships holy hours why are ye vanished dear inviting shades why ceased the cheering music of your glades not that which on the surging ether floats or trembles in the linnets gurgling notes  but that which gives you harriets polished mind her sense reflective and her taste refined that which your venerable dryads love when midst their haunts they see her graceful move that which adorns the clearest strongest sense and clothes in lightest dress the thought intense invocation written on a very hot day in august      cooling zephyrs haste away round my humid temples play groves and grots in pity leave on my fainting bosom breathe skim as you pass your silken wings over gurgling founts and glassy springs oh come from greenlands icy plains where silver winter constant reigns or from the arctic higher fly through the chill norwegian sky  turn not to gallias sunny vales nor mix with yours italias gales strait over the northern ocean sweep where pearls the frozen naiads weep but on high grampias fleecy top where kids the gelid herbage crop there zephyr touch  then with new wing fresh from its chilly caverns spring oh linger not midst englands fields nor taste the sweets the garden yields heed not our meadows gaudy charms but dart with vigor to my arms address to two candles no subject so mean that poetry cannot elevate and render interesting anon at a cottage on an eminence anna matilda had ordered the candles to be removed from the window but the night was dark and recollecting the situation she replaced and thus addressed them  burn  lucid tapers fiercer burn refine each ray to purer light pervade the circumambient air and pierce the closest robe of night why faintly glow your spiral fires whilst charity invokes your beams why inauspicious to my prayer  still faint and fainter are your gleams oh think that on the distant heath whose canopys a sombre sky some weary traveller may roam  no hut no guide no shelter nigh perhaps an aged parent tries to find amidst the thickning shades her doubtful path  perhaps a child bemoans forlorn in yonder glades your honest light they need not dread no ignis false instructs your ray to guide amiss their trembling feet or lure them from the intended way no vapor gross your fulgence feeds from snowy wax your flame is drawn by virgin bees extracted pure from every sweet that decks the lawn the rose the violet and the thyme that scent the mornings dewy shower combined their aromatic gifts and formed ye for the present hour then gentle tapers brisker burn dart with new vigor through the night tinge every ray with brighter hues and pour them on the wandrers sight on seeing the palette of a celebrated painter this wild chaotic mass of every dye where principles of beauteous order lie is sure an emblem of the scene when out of dark confusion sprung the variegated orb terrene and in the solar system hung soon as the mighty artist gives the sign this formless mass as at the word divine shall regulate its shade and light harmonious move as he shall will  its tints divide or else unite obedient to his powerful skill and as the glorious vision fills his mind they to its plastic impulse all resigned shall into prospects vast expand  foaming in surfy billows rise then stretch their velvet into land then bid their radiance stream  in skies in cumbrous alps ascend whose tops explore regions where dayeyd eagles fear to soar or in the soft jonquil unfold midst the low beauties of the vale her robe of imitative gold which loads with sweets the dancing gale in distant forests spread the inviting brown or hide with spikey furze the barren down  then tumbling from the flinty rock in white meanders lead the eye and then the eyes keen search to mock through some timefretted cavern fly richly festoond in luscious purple shine extending over the slope the nectrous vine or in the gaudy spheroids swell which the swart indians groves illume or dye the spicey nonpareil or the soft peachs stain assume yet more  he wills and from the palette starts the form divine  of soul illumined parts here springs a hebe there a sage here heroes from the mass break forth there the soft lais of the age from hence the caesar of the north oh wondrous science first of arts among and do those mighty powers to thee belong here  here then poetry thy numbers bring here music strike thy sweetly trembling string creative painting asks the adoring knee who though a sister called shall hence your sovereign be the funeral the paper blackd a full inch deep at every corner seemed to weep the seal with fearful speed was broke when thus the writer sadly spoke   oh charles beloved my dear is dead  and every bliss for ever fled  you and your wife her constant friend  her funeral rites must now attend the day approached the solemn bell in dismal notes rang lauras knell charles and his mate in blackness clad with rueful thoughts and faces sad saw her interred  heard  dust to dust and cried  to this all come and must the coaches now in sad array pace back the mournful late trod way whilst floating plumes on shoulders borne the dusty lanes and streets adorn the widower sad alone they found in sable length upon the ground his consolation charles essayed and many a weary moment stayed from scripture culled a sacred store and drained from heathenish learned lore all that was ever thought or said to prove we cannot call back the dead he soothed his tears at every gush and saw at length his sorrows hush oh charles james cried you are very kind this shall live long within my mind  how shall the friendship i repay thoust proved upon this mournful day which tore my dearest wife away and placed her with her kindred clay charles rubbed his cheek and thus replied with head a little turned aside  why dearest james thou shall to me be just the friend i have been to thee would fate grant that it is all i ask be mine the sorrow thine the task in the following correspondence which has occasioned much notice it has been suggested that there has been some collusion  anna matilda therefore declares that though she has lately guessed at della crusca she is yet uncertain as to his name and rank and she is persuaded that he cannot have the most dis tantidea of here is  the beautiful lines of the adieu and recall struck her so forcibly that without rising from the table at which she read she answered them della cruscas elegant reply surprised her into another and thus the correspondence most unexpectedly became settled anna matildas share in it has little to boast but she has one claim of which she is proud  that of having been the first to point out the excellence of della crusca if there can be merit in discerning what is so very obvious  the adieu and recall to love go idle boy i quit thy power thy couch of many a thorn and flower thy twanging bow thine arrow keen deceitful beautys timid mien the feigned surprise the roguish leer the tender smile the thrilling tear have now no pangs no joys for me so fare thee well for i am free then flutter hence on wanton wing or lave thee in yon lucid spring or take thy bevrage from the rose or on louisas breast repose i wish thee well for pleasures past yet bless the hour i am free at last but sure methinks the altered day scatters around a mournful ray and chilling every zephyr blows and every stream untuneful flows no rapture swells the linnets voice no more the vocal groves rejoice and even thy song sweet bird of eve with whom i loved so often to grieve now scarce regarded meets my ear unanswered by a sigh or tear no more with devious step i choose to brush the mountains morning dews to drink the spirit of the breeze or wander midst oerarching trees or woo with undisturbed delight the palecheekd virgin of the night that piercing through the leafy bower throws on the ground a silvry shower alas is all this boasted ease to lose each warm desire to please no sweet solicitude to know for others bliss for others woe a frozen apathy to find a sad vacuity of mind o hasten back then idle boy and with thine anguish bring thy joy return with all thy torments here and let me hope and doubt and fear o rend my heart with every pain but let me let me love again della crusca  to della crusca the pen o seize again thy golden quill and with its point my bosom thrill with magic touch explore my heart and bid the tear of passion start thy golden quill apollo gave  drenched first in bright aonias wave he snatched it fluttering through the sky borne on the vapor of a sigh it fell from cupids burnished wing as forcefully he drew the string which sent his keenest surest dart through a rebellious frozen heart that had till then defied his power and vacant beat through each dull hour be worthy then the sacred loan seated on fancys airbuilt throne immerse it in her rainbow hues nor what the godheads bid refuse apollo cupid shall inspire and aid thee with their blended fire the one poetic language give the other bid thy passion live with soft ideas fill thy lays and crown with love thy wintry days anna matilda  to anna matilda i know thee well enchanting maid i have marked thee in the silent glade i have seen thee on the mountains height i have met thee in the storms of night i have viewed thee on the wild beach run to gaze upon the setting sun then stop aghast his ray no more to hear the impetuous surges roar have thou not stood with rapturous eye to trace the starry worlds on high tobserve the moons weak crescent throw over hills and woods a glimmering glow or all beside some wizard stream to watch its undulating beam o well thy form divine i know  when youthful errors brought me woe when all was dreary to behold and many a bosomfriend grew cold thou thou unlike the summer crew that from my adverse fortune flew came with melodious voice to cheer my throbbing heart and check the tear from thee i learnt twas vain to scan the low ingratitude of man thou badst me fancys wilds to rove and seek the ecstatic bower of love when on his couch i threw me down i saw thee weave a myrtle crown and blend it with the shining hair of her the fairest of the fair for this may every wandering gale the essence of the rose exhale and pour the fragrance on thy breast and gently fan thy charms to rest soon as the purple slumbers fly the opening radiance of thine eye strike strike again the magic lyre with all thy pathos all thy fire with all that sweetlywarbled grace which proves thee of celestial race o then in varying colors dressed and living glory stand confessed shake from thy locks ambrosial dew and thrill each pulse of joy anew with glowing ardours rouse my soul and bid the tides of passion roll but think no longer in disguise to screen thy beauty from mine eyes nor deign a borrowed name to use for well i know  thou art the muse della crusca  to della crusca thou bidst   my purple slumbers fly days radiance pours upon my eye i wake  i live the sense oerpays the trivial griefs of early days what though the rosebud on my cheek has shed its leaves which late so sleek spoke youth and joy  and careless thought by guilt or fear or shame unsmote my blooming soul is yet in youth its lively sense attests the truth o i can wander yet and taste the beauties of the flowery waste the nightingales deep swell can feel whilst from my lids the soft drops steal rapt gaze upon the gemdeckd night and mark the clear moons silent flight whilst the slow rivers crumpled wave repeats the quivering beams she gave nor yet the pencil strives in vain to wake upon the canvas plain all the strong passions of the mind or hint the sentiment refined to its sweet magic yet i bow as when youth decked my polished brow the chisels feathry touch to trace through the nervd form or softened grace is lent me still still i admire and kindle at the poets fire  my torch at della cruscas light and distant follow his superior flight o time since these are left me still of lesser thefts even take thy fill yes steal the luster from my eye and bid the soft carnation fly my tresses sprinkle with thy snow which boasted once the auburn glow warp the slim form that was adored by him so loved my bosoms lord  but leave me when all these you steal the mind to taste the nerve to feel anna matilda  to anna matilda and art thou then alas like me offspring of frail mortality must ruthless times rude touch efface each lovely features varying grace and must toward earth that form incline and even those eyes forbear to shine yet when with icy hand he throws amongst thine auburn locks his snows the freezing influence never shall dart to chill thy warmlybeating heart and scorning deaths oblivious hour thou shall exult  beyond his power methinks as passion drives along as frantic grown i feel thy song eager i would traverse lybias plain the tawny lions dread domain to meet thee there nor flagging fear should ever on my cheek appear for even the forests king obeys majestic woman s potent gaze or left on some resourceless shore where neverceasing billows roar which teeming clouds and heavy hail and furious hurricanes assail far to the pole  while half the year on ebon throne sits night severe and to her solitary court seafowl and monsters fierce resort  even there matilda there with thee impending horrors all should flee thy luster of poetic ray should wake an artificial day sure thou wast never doomed to know what pangs from care and danger flow but fairest scenes thy thoughts employ and art and science bring thee joy the quickening sense the throb divine fancy and feeling all are thine it is thine by blushing summer led a shower of roses round thee shed to hie thee forth at morns advance in wild excess of rapturous trance and see the suns proud deluge stream in copious tides of golden beam while faint his sisterorb on high fades to a vapor of the sky when gradual evening comes to hide in sabling shades creation s pride when heaving hills and forests drear and lessening towns but scarce appear while the last lingering western glow hangs on the lucid lake below then trivial joys i deem forgot thou love to seek the humble cot to scatter comforts balm around and heal pale povertys deep wound drive sickness from the languid bed raise the lorn widows drooping head render the newmade mother blessed and snatch the infant to thy breast o anna then if true thou say thy radiant beauties steal away yet shall i never fail to find eternal beauties in thy mind to those i offer up my vows and love which virtues self allows unknown again thou art adored as once by him thy  bosoms lord della crusca  elegy written on the plain of fontenoy chill blows the blast and twilights dewy hand draws in the west her dusky veil away a deeper shadow steals along the land and nature muses at the death of day near this bleak waste no friendly mansion rears its walls where mirth and social joys resound but each sad object melts the soul to tears while horror treads the scattered bones around as thus alone and comfortless i roam wet with the drizling shower i sigh sincere i cast a fond look toward my native home and think what valiant britons perished here yes the time was nor very far the date when carnage here her crimson toil began when nations standards waved in threatening state and man the murderer met the murderer man for war is murder though the voice of kings has styled it justice styled it glory too yet from worst motives fierce ambition springs and there fixed prejudice is all we view but sure it is heavens immutable decree for thousands every age in fight to fall some natural cause prevails we cannot see and that is fate which we ambition call o let the aspiring warrior think with grief that as produced by chymic art refined  so glittering conquest from the laurel leaf extracts a general poison for mankind here let him wander at the midnight hour these morbid rains these gelid gales to meet and mourn like me the ravages of power and feel like me that victory is defeat nor deem ye vain that ever i mean to swell my feeble verse with many a sounding name of such the mercenary bard may tell and call such dreary desolation fame the genuine muse removes the thin disguise that cheats the world whenever she deigns to sing and full as meritorious to her eyes seems the poor soldier as the mighty king alike i shun in labored strain to show how britain more than triumphed though she fled where louis stood where stalked the column slow i turn from these and dwell upon the dead yet much my beating breast respects the brave too well i love them not to mourn their fate why should they seek for greatness in the grave their hearts are noble  and in life they are great nor think it is but in war the brave excel  to valor every virtue is allied here faithful friendship mid the battle fell and love true love in bitter anguish died alas the solemn slaughter i retrace that checks lifes current circling through my veins bathed in moist sorrow many a beauteous face and gave a grief perhaps that still remains i can no more  an agony too keen absorbs my senses and my mind subdues hard were that heart which here could beat serene or the just tribute of a pang refuse but lo through yonder opening clouds afar shoots the bright planets sanguinary ray that bears thy name fictitious lord of war and with red luster guides my lonely way then fontenoy farewell yet much i fear wherever chance my course compells to find discord and blood  the thrilling sounds i hear  the noise of battle hurtles in the wind from barbarous turkey to britannias shore opposing interests into rage increase destruction rears her scepter tumults roar ah where shall hapless man repose in peace della crusca  stanzas to della crusca hushed be each ruder note  soft silence spread with ermine hand thy cobweb robe around attention pillow my reclining head whilst eagerly i catch the golden sound ha what a tone was that which floating near seemed harmonys full soul  whose is the lyre which seizing thus on my enraptured ear chills with its force yet melts me with its fire ah dull of heart thy minstrels touch not know what bard but della crusca boasts such skill from him alone those melting notes can flow  he only knows adroitly thus to trill well have i left the groves which sighing wave amidst novembers blast their naked arms whilst their red leaves fall fluttering to their grave and give again to dust mays vernal charms well have i left the airembosomd hills where sprightly health in verdant buskin plays forsaken fallow meads and circling mills and thymedressd heaths where the soft flock yet strays obscuring smoke and air impure i greet with the coarse din that trade and folly form for here the muses son again i meet  i catch his notes amidst the vulgar storm his notes now bear me pensive to the plain clothed by a verdure drawn from britains heart whose heroes bled superior to their pain sunk crowned with glory and contemned the smart soft as he leads me round the ensanguind fields the laureled shades forsake their grassy tomb the bursting sod its palid inmate yields and over the immortal waste their spirits roam obedient to the muse the acts revive which time long past had veiled from mortal ken embattled squadrons rush as when alive and shadowy falchions gleam over shadowy men ah who art thou who thus with frantic air flyst fearless to support that bleeding youth binds his deep gashes with thy glowing hair and die beside him to attest thy truth  his sister i an orphand pair we grieved  for parents long at rest within the grave  by a false guardian of our wealth bereaved   the little all parental care could save  chill looked the world and chilly grew our hearts  oh where shall poverty expect a smile  gross lawless love assumed its ready arts  and all beset was i with fraud and guile  my henry sought the war and dropped the tears  of love fraternal as he bade farewell  but fear soon made me rise above my fears   i followed  and fate tolls our mutual knell chaste maiden rest and brighter spring the green that decorates the turf thy bloom will feed and oh in softest mercy twas i ween to worth like thine a brothers graves decreed the dreadful shriek of death now darts around the hollow winds repeat each tortured sigh deep bitter groans still deeper groans resound whilst fathers brothers lovers husbands die turn from this spot blessed bard thy mental eye to hamlets cities empires bend its beam twill there such multiplying deaths descry that all before theell but an abstract seem why waste thy tears over this contracted plain the sky which canopies the sons of breath sees the whole earth one scene of mortal pain the vast the universal bed of death where do not husbands fathers dying moan where do not mothers sisters orphans weep where is not heard the last expiring groan or the deep throttle of the deathful sleep if as philosophy does often muse a state of war is natural state to man battles the sickness bravery would choose  noblest disease in natures various plan let vulgar souls stoop to the fevers rage or slow beneath pale atrophy depart with gout and scrophula weak variance wage or sink with sorrow cankring at the heart these be to common minds the unwishd decree the firm select an illness more sublime by languid pains scorn their high souls to free but seek the swords swift edge and spurn at time anna matilda  to anna matilda on the seashore with folded arms i stood the sun just sinking shot a level ray luxuriant crimson glowed upon the flood and the curled surf was tinged with golden spray far of i faintly trackd the feathry sail when thy sweet numbers caught my yielded ear borne on the bosom of the fluttering gale they struck my heart  and roused me to a tear yet flowed no bitter anguish from mine eye a while remembrance left my wayward state and the soft cadence of thy warbled sigh poured healing balm into the wounds of fate what though grim winters desolating frown the wild waves uproar when rough eurus blows the tangled forest and the desert down be all the solace della crusca knows yet from matildas pure celestial fire one ruby spark shall to his gloom be given lured by its light his fancy may aspire and catch a ray of bliss  a glimpse of heaven vain in the morn of life and thoughtless too he rushed impetuous as strong passion drove but soon each flattering prospect fled his view deceived by friendship much but more by love yes he has loved to transports dire excess has felt the potent eye inflict the wound has felt the female voice each pulse oppress and grown a breathless statue at the sound but why recall the moments that are fled for ever fled like yonder sweeping blast with love each active principle is dead and all except its sad regret is past ah had he met thee in this happier hour ere yet he languishd in the gripe of care thy minstrel then had fondly owned thy power thy minstrel then might have escaped despair o different lot for he who daily grieves then with thy beauty blessed and generous mind had not like sallow autumns falling leaves been shrunk alas and scattered in the wind happily he had not roamd for lingering years on many a rugged alp and foreign shore he never had known the cause of all his tears the cherished cause that bids him  hope no more he would have led thee with attentive gaze where the brown hamlets neighboring shades retire have hung entranced upon thy living lays and swept with feebler hand a kindred lyre while the dear songstress had melodious stole over every sense and charmed each nerve to rest thy bard in silent ecstacy of soul had strained the dearer woman to his breast or had she said that wars the worthiest grave he would have felt his proud heart burn the while have dared perhaps to rush among the brave have gained perhaps the glory  of a smile and it is most true while times relentless hand with sickly grasp drags others to the tomb the soldier scorns to wait the dull command but springs impatient to a nobler doom though on the plain he lies outstretchd and pale without one friend his steadfast eyes to close yet on his honored corse shall many a gale waft the moist fragrance of the weeping rose over that dread spot the melancholy moon shall pause a while a sadder beam to shed and starry night amidst her awful noon sprinkle light dews upon his hallowed head there too the solitary bird shall swell with longdrawn melody her plaintive throat while distant echo from responsive cell shall often with fading force return the note such recompense be valors due alone to me no proffered meed must ever belong to me who trod the vale of life unknown whose proudest boast was but an idle song della crusca  to della crusca i hate the tardy elegiac lay  choose me a measure jocund as the day such days as near the ides of june meet the larks elabrate tune when his downy fringed breast ambitious on a cloud to rest he soars aloft and from his gurgling throat darts to the earth the piercing note  which softly falling with the dews of morn that bless the scented pink and snowy thorn expands upon the zephyrs wing and wakes the burnished finch and linnet sweet to sing and be thy lines irregular and free poetic chains should fall before such bards as thee scorn the dull laws that pinch thee round raising about thy verse a mound over which thy muse so lofty dares not bound bid her in verse meandring sport her footsteps quick or long or short just as her various impulse wills  scorning the frigid square which her fine fervor chills and in thy verse meandring wild thou who art fancys favorite child may sweetly paint the long past hour when the slave of cupids power thou could the tear of rapture weep and feed on agony and banish sleep ha did thou favored mortal taste all that adorns our lifes dull waste have thou known loves enchanting pain  its hopes its woes and yet complain thy senses at a voice been lost thy madning soul in tumults tossed ecstatic wishes fire thy brain  these have thou known and yet complain thou then deserve never more to feel  thy nerves be rigid hence as steel their fine vibrations all destroyed thy future days a tasteless void never shall thou know again to sigh or on a soft idea die never on a recollection gasp thy arms the airdrawn charmer never grasp vapid content her poppies round thee strew whilst to the bliss of taste thou bidst adieu to vulgar comforts be thou hence confined and the shrunk bays be from thy brow untwind thy statue torn from cupids hallowed nitch but in return thou shall be dull and rich the muses hence disown thy rebel lay  but thou in aldermanic gown their scorn repay crimsoned and furred the highest honors dare and on thy laurels tread  a plump lord mayor anna matilda  invocation to horror far be removed each painted scene what is to me the sapphire sky what is to me the earths soft dye or fragrant vales which sink between those velvet hills yes there i see  why do those beauties burst on me pearl dropping groves bow to the sun seizing his beams bright rivers run that dart redoubled day hope ye vain scenes to catch the mind to torpid sorrow all resigned or bid my heart be gay false are those hopes  i turn  i fly where no enchantment meets the eye or soft ideas stray horror i call thee from the mouldering tower the murky churchyard and forsaken bower where midst unwholesome damps the vapry gleamy lamps of ignes fatui show the thickwove night where morbid melancholy sits and weeps and sings and raves by fits and to her bosom strains the fancied sprite or if amidst the arctic gloom thou toilest at thy sable loom forming the hideous phantoms of despair  instant thy grisly labors leave with raven wing the concave cleave where floats selfborne the dense nocturnal air oh bear me to the impending cliff under whose brow the dashing skiff beholds thee seated on thy rocky throne there midst the shrieking wild winds roar thy influence horror i will adore and at thy magic touch congeal to stone oh hide the moons obtrusive orb the gleams of every star absorb and let creation be a moment thine bid billows dash let whirlwinds roar and the stern rockypointed shore the stranded bark back to the waves resign then whilst from yonder turbid cloud thou rollst thy thunders long and loud and lightenings flash upon the deep below let the expiring seamans cry the pilots agonizing sigh mingle and in the dreadful chorus flow horror far back thou datst thy reign ere kings the historic page could stain with records black or deeds of lawless power ere empires alexanders cursed or faction madning caesars nursed the frighted world received thy awful dower whose pen jehovahs self inspired he who in eloquence attired led israels squadrons over the earth grandly terrific paints thy birth the almighty midst his fulgent seat on high where glowing seraphs round his footstool fly beheld the wanton cities of the plain with acts of deadly name his laws disdain he gave the irrevocable sign which marked to man the hate divine and sudden from the starting sky the angels of his wrath bid fly then horror thou presidedst over the whole and filled and rapt each selfaccusing soul thou did ascend to guide the burning shower  on thee the omnipotent bestowed the hour twas thine to scourge the sinful land twas thine to toss the fiery brand beneath thy glance the temples fell and mountains crumble at thy yell once more thou wilt triumph in a fiery storm once more the earth behold thy direful form then shall thou seek as holy prophets tell thy native throne amidst the eternal shades of hell anna matilda  to anna matilda to thee a stranger dares address his theme to thee proud mistress of apollos lyre one ray emitted from thy golden gleam prompted by love would  set the world on fire adorn then love in fancytincturd vest camelion like anon of various hue by  penserosa and  allegro dressed  such genius claimed when she idalia drew i see the pencil on the canvas shine reynolds admires  in science then proceed the name of poet painter both are thine we view the speaking painting  as we read paris reuben  to reuben midst the proud fervor of the day whilst the sun darts a torrid ray the humble daisey sinks its head and faints upon its lowly bed but when moist eve has quenched his fire and treads the fields in cool attire the daisy spreads again her bloom and offers up her mild perfume thus your resuscitating praise breathed life upon my dying lays reynolds admires flattery so sweet with blushing vanity i meet but bard polite how hard the task which with such elegance you ask when dido bad eneas tell the woes he knew to paint so well  did he not tell the queen she tore his closing wounds and drew fresh gore from stabs that time had almost healed  such reuben such the thorn concealed within your verses flowery spell which barbarous dares my pen compel yet how describe the various god twhom proteus selfs a heavy clod differing in each differing heart scorning to play a constant part a tiger  tyrant  such is he whom painted with bandeau you see with downy wings and childish face as though of the blessed cherubs race  but oh a serpent in disguise and as the lynx his piercing eyes a raging fire a deadly pain that gentlest heart strings most will strain a fever tempest madness he  of all lifes ills  a dread epitome ha do thou fear and will thou run the little monster try to shun and will thou reuben too succeed  and shall thy bosom never bleed never his poisoned rankling dart quiver within thy tender heart oh hapless man  oh wretched fate fly to loves altar ere too late and deprecate the doom accursed or bid that heart with sorrow burst welcome the deadly fiery pain that gentlest heart strings most will strain  madness is his  but it is replete with all that makes lifes blessings sweet  a tyrant he but oh his chains are richer than an empires gains sweet the delirium which by love is spread whatever the paths his raptured votries tread he paints the mist which hangs upon the eve with colors dearer than the sun can give it is he who lends the nightingale its trills when her rich pipe the empyrean fills oh it is the softness in his heart which makes the lover in her song take part and faint upon each touching pause and lengthen out each added clause till rapt attention strained too high rolls down its gushing tear and breathes its gentle sigh charming to love is mornings hour when from her crystal roseate tower she sees the goddess health pursue the skimming breeze through fields of dew charming the flaming hour of noon when the sunk linnets fading tune allures him to the beechy grove  or when some cragd grotesque alcove sounds in his ear its tinkling rill and tempts him to its moss grown sill most charmed when on his tranced mind is wisperd in the passing wind the name of her whose name is bliss or when he all unseen can kiss the fringed bank where late she lay hidden from the imperious day oh ye rapt glades which glistring luna decks whose stretching shadows her refulgence checks oh ye soft floods that hang upon the peak of lofty rocks and bound in wanton freak where thirsty meads your rushing streamlets crave and crowd their flowers around to drink your wave  what are ye all should love withhold the dart which wakes nice feelings in the torpid heart where is the heart that would such feelings fly or fear the enchanting madning cup to try must i speak more of love the boundless theme might run beyond the edge of lifes short dream his spells are blessings  witchries so sublime they triumph over distress and fate and time would ask the joys of love  oh change the prayer thou little know his power to fasten there let the mean bosom crave its loves return thine shall with more distinguished ardors burn to know the passion  yes be that thy strain invoke the god of the mysterious pain whatever thy nature  gentle fiery rough  to love  learn but to love  and thou have bliss enough anna matilda  ode to indifference oh nymph long sought of placid mien with careless step and brow serene i woo thee from the tufted bowers where listless pass thy easy hours  or if a naiade of the silver wave thou rather love thy pearly limbs to lave in some clear lake whose fascinating face lures the soft willow to its pure embrace or if beneath the gelid rock thy smiles all human sorrows mock wherever thou art in earth or air oh come and chase the fiend despair have i not marked thee on the green roving by vulgar eyes unseen have i not watched thy lightsome dance when evenings softened glows advance dear goddess yes and whilst the rustics mirth proclaims the hour which gives wild gambols birth supine i have found thee in the elmrows shade lulled by the hum returning bees have made who chary of their golden spoils finish their fragrant rosy toils with restinviting slumbrous song as to their waxen couch they throng chaste nymph the temple let me seek where thou residst in luster meek my future life to thee i give  irradiate every hour i live it is true no glowing bliss thy votries know from thee no poignant ecstacy can flow but oh thoushieldst the heart from rankling pain and misery strikes when blessed with thee in vain wan jealousys empoisoning tooth and love which feeds upon our youth and holy friendships broken tie never dim the luster of thy eye for thee it is all nature blooms for thee the spring new charms assumes nor vainly flings her blossoms round nor vainly bids her groves resound her music colors odours all are thine to thee her months their richest gifts consign to thee the morn is bright and sweet the ray that marks the progress of the sinking day each change is grateful to thy soul for its fine taste no woes control the powers of nature and of art alike entrance the easy heart and oh beneath thy gentle dome which the calm comforts make their home that cruel imp is never found whose fame such idle songs resound  dread sensibility  oh let me fly where greenland darkness drinks the beamy sky or where the sun with downward torrid ray kills with the barbarous glories of the day i would dare the excess of every clime grasp every evil known by time ere live beneath that witchs spells with whom no lasting pleasure dwells her lovely form deceives the heart the tear for ever prompt to start the tender look the ready sigh and soft emotion always nigh and yet content the insidious fiend forbids  oh she has torn the slumbers from my lids often roused my torpid sense to living woe and bid chill anguish to my bosom grow she seals her prey  in vain the spring wakes rapture through her groves to sing the roseate morns hygean bloom fades down unmarked to evenings gloom oh sensibility thy scepter sad points where the frantic glance proclaims the mad strained to excess reason is chained thy slave or the poor victim shuns thee in the grave to thee each crime each evil owes its birth that in gigantic horror treads the earth savage untamed she smiles to drink our tears and where is no solid ill she wounds with fears riots in sighs is soothed when most we smart  now while she guides my pen her fangs within my heart anna matilda  ode to anna matilda o cease matilda cease the strain that woos indifference to thy arms for what are all her boasted charms but only to be free from pain and would thou then her torpid ease her listless apathy to know renounce the magic power to please and lose the luxury of woe why does thy stream of sweetest song in many a wild maze wind along foam on the mountains murmuring side or through the vocal covert glide or among fairy meadows steal  it is because thy heart can feel alas if peace must be unknown till every nerve is turned to stone till not a teardrop wets the eye nor throbs the breast for sorrows sigh o may i never find relief but perish in the pang of grief think not i reason thus my fair a stranger to corroding care ah if thou seldom findst repose  i rest not on a bed of rose despair cold serpent loves to twine about this helpless heart of mine yet though neglected and forlorn i scarce can check the smile of scorn when those the vulgar call the great bend the important brow of state and strive a consequence to find by seeming more than humankind well let them strut their hour away till grinning death demand his prey meanwhile my anna let us rove the scented vale the bending grove mix our hot tears with evening dews and live for friendship and the muse yes let us hasten hand in hand where the blue billows lave the land and as they quick recoiling fly send on the surf a lengthened sigh that strikes the soul with truth sublime as twere the whispering tongue of time for thus our short lifes ebbing day murmurs awhile and hastes away or let us seek the mouldering wall or some lone abbeys gothic hall recline upon the kneeworn stone and catch the north winds dismal moan that midst his sorrows seems to boast of many a gallant vessel lost friends and lovers sunk in death  by the fury of his breath what though at the imagined tale thy altered cheek be sadly pale never can such sympathy annoy for it is the price of dearest joy when far off the night storm flies let us ponder on the skies where million stars are ever rolled which yet our weak eyes dare behold adore the selfexisting cause that gives to each its separate laws that when the impetuous comet runs athwart a wilderness of suns tells it what mandate to obey nor ever wander from its way till back it hasten whence twas brought beyond the boundaries of thought let not the studious seer reply  attraction regulates the sky  and lends each orb the secret force  that urges on or checks its course or with his orrery expound creations vainly fancied round ah quit thy toil presumptuous sage destroy thy calculating page no more on second causes plod it is not attraction but it is god and what the universe we call is but a point compad to all such bliss the sensate bosom knows such bliss indiffrence never bestows though small the circle we can trace in the abyss of time and space though learning has its limits got the feelings of the soul have not their vast excursions find no end and rapture needs not comprehend it is true we are ignrant how the earth wakes the first principles of birth with vegetative moisture feeds to different purpose different seeds gives to the rose such balmy sweet or fills the golden ear of wheat paints the ripe peach with velvet bloom or weaves the thick woods mingling bloom  yet we can wander in the bower can taste the fragrance of the flower drink the rich fruits nectareous juice and bend the harvest to our use  then give thy pure perceptions scope and sooth thy heaving heart with hope hope shall instruct my sorrwing friend the souls fine fervor never can end but when her limbs by death are laid beneath some yewtrees hallowed shade then shall her soaring spirit know the seraphims ecstatic glow then shall the essential mind confess that anguish has the power to bless that feeling was in bounty given and own the sacred truth  in heaven della crusca  ode to della crusca o thou who from  a wilderness of suns can stoop to where the low brook runs through space with rapid comets glow  or mark where soft the snowdrops grow o thou whose burning pen now rapture paints then moralizes cold with saints now trembling ardors can infuse  then seems as dipped in cloistered dews  o say thy being quick declare art thou a son of earth or air celestial bard though thy sweet song might to a seraphs strains belong its wondrous beauty and its art can only touch not change my heart so heavensent lightning powerless plays and wanton throws its purple rays it leaps through nights scarce pervious gloom attracted by the roses bloom the illumined shrub then quivering round it seems each scented bud to wound morn shakes her locks and see the rose in renovated beauty blows smiles at the dart which past away and flings her perfume on the day thy lightning pen it is thus i greet fearless its subtle point i meet never shall its spells my sad heart move from the calm state it vows to love all other bliss i have proved is vain  all other bliss is dashed with pain my waist with myrtles has been bound my brow with laurels has been crowned love has sighed hopeless at my feet love on my couch has poured each sweet all these i have known and now i fly with thee indifference to die nor is thy gift  dull torpid ease the minds quick powers that do not freeze no blessed by thee the soul expands and darts over freshcreated lands springs from the confines of the earth to where new systems struggle into birth the germ of future worlds beholds the secrets of dark space unfolds can watch how far the erratic runs and gaze on della cruscas suns in some new orb can meet  his starry mail and him on earth unknown in heaven with transport hail anna matilda  to anna matilda nor will i more of fate complain for i have lived to feel thy strain to feel its sunlike force divine swift darting through the clouds of woe shoot to my soul a sainted glow yet yet matilda spare to shine one moment be the blaze suppressed lest from this clod my spirit spring and borne by zephyrs trembling wing seek a new heaven upon thy breast but say does calm indifference dwell on the low mead or mountain swell or at gray evenings solemn gloom bend her bosom to the tomb or when the weak dawns orient rose in silvry foliage decked appears tell me if perchance she goes to the fresh gardens proud array where doubtful of the coming day each drooping flowret sheds translucent tears ah tell me tell me where for thou shall find me there like her own son in vestment pure with deep disguise of smile secure so shall i once thy form descry for once hold converse with thine eye vain is the thought for at thy sight soon as thy potent voice were found could i conceal the vast delight could i be tranquil at the sound could i repress quick raptures start or hide the bursting of my heart let but thy lyre impatient seize departing twilights filmy breeze that winds the enchanting chords among in lingering labyrinth of song anon the amorous bird of woe shall steal the tones that quivering flow and with them sooth the sighing woods and with them charm the slumbering floods till all exhausted by the lay he hang in silence on the spray drop to his idle flower beneath and midst her blushes cease to breathe warned by his fate twere surely well to shun the fascinating spell nor still presumptuous dare to fling my rude hand over the sounding string as though i fondly would aspire to match matildas heavenly fire yet may i sometimes far remote hear the loved cadence of her note and though the laurel i resign o may the bliss of taste be mine della crusca  the following was not composed from an idea that enough had not been said on the subject of indifference  it was hastily written merely to let della crusca know that he was guessed at  but the line which would to him have particularly pointed that out was when given in the world altered  it is now printed as originally written for its many careless passages anna matilda begs this apology may be accepted that she wrote it literally whilst sitting for her portrait  and whilst the sublimity of egyptian groves zenobias desert confucious marc antony etc etc had their ideas continually broken in upon with smile a little  more to the right now look up and so forth both the poetry and the painting have suffered for this  the one has been less happy the other less correct    does calm indifference dwell  on the low mead or mountain swell  oh tell me where  for thou shall find me there to della crusca yes on the mountains haughty swell and in the prostrate dell and where the dryades fling their shades  there may thou meet the maid serene or trace her on the zephyrd green whilst days carnation gently fades does nature make the prospect vast with rocks oerhang and rivers cast tumbling headlong to their base do seas stretch out their foamy plains compelling with their crystal chains wide continents to embrace all these attract the smoothbrowd fair  or where can art evince her powers where science strew immortal flowers and gay indifference  haste not there whilst passion narrows up the heart taste can no ray of bliss impart one strong idea grasps the mind  extends itself through all the soul through every vein its furies roll and tears with fangs unkind when newton trod the starry roads and viewed the dwellings of the gods and measured every orb  did silly love his steps attend his mighty purposes suspend or his grand mind absorb when intellectual lock explored the souls sad vacuum where no hoard of budding young ideas lay  oh tell thus robbed in wisdoms stole did loves coarse torch his view control or light him in the darksome way ha della crusca cease to feign thy cheek with red repentance stain for having feigned so long quick seize thy lyre sweep each bold string over every chord thy music fling  to calm indifference raise the song propitiate first then with her haste over the globes peopled motley waste watch character wherever it runs drink newer air see fiercer suns seek the bland realms where first the morn pours dawnlight from her beamy horn  pours scent and colors over the vale and wakes its song and wakes its tale mark how confucius feeble race whose records vast fail not to trace to imitation still confine their powers nor deviate from its line their fourteen thousand glowing springs passing through their yearly rings not one suggestion left behind no art nor virtue more refined philosophy no inroads made but mute within its awful shade its thoughts occult arrangd  whilst learning blindfold in its pen this costly precept gave to men   be wise but be unchanged haste  leave the insipid herd  away where egypt s sons imbrown the day for their primeval wisdom formed her wreath and science first was taught to breathe oh linger here the classic clime demands and will reward thy time here shall thou seek the immortal dome where pleasure triumphed over rome and tread were cleopatra trod and moisten with thy tear the sod where taste and love their banners waved snatching from the grave old time  whose life fastfading rapture saved and phoenixlike renewed its prime then find the myrtled tomb the now unenvied lovers home but lest thy pensive steps should stray to guide thee in the unknown way the moon her bright locks quick unshrouds her veil of gossamour thin clouds dissolves to air and her soft eye through the palm groves haughty shade and the lofty aloed glade shall guide thee where thy longowd sigh breathed over the mingling lovers dust shall gratify their hovering souls beyond an empire s votive bust is a soft willow bending near whose drooping leaves speak grief sincere its drooping leaves ah instant seize the happy violence will please  bend its tender flaccid boughs murmuring soft mysterious vows

learnings lore ages long past the soul beguiled  oh think in that unlettered wild longinus wrote zenobia smiled where now a humbled column lies streamed radiance from impassioned eyes the roof where odious night birds rest once sheltered wit once echoed jest where peasants cumbrous oxen stall therpsichore swam through the ball serpents convolve where music trilld and lost palmyras fates fulfilled does splendid scenes thy light heart prize fly to italias downy skies where fancys richest strokes abound where natures happiest points are found the pleasures here  a rosy band linked to her car with flowery chains bear their rapt goddess over the plains and strew their glories over her land the dulcet groves burst with rich notes flung from a thousand trembling throats the glossy rivers as they

right i ween the maid indifference dies anna matilda  to anna matilda age jam meorum finis amorum  and have i strove in vain to move thy heart fair phantom of my love and could thou think twas my design calmly to list thy notes divine that i responsive lays might send to gain a cold platonic friend far other hopes thy verse inspired and all my breast with passion fired for fancy to my mind had given thy form as of the forms of heaven  had bathed thy lips with vermil dew had touched thy cheek with mornings hue and down thy neck had sweetly rolled luxuriant locks of mazy gold yes i had hopes at least to press and lure thee to the chaste caress catch from thy breath the quivering sigh and meet the murder of thine eye ah when i deemed such joys at hand remorseless comes the stern command nor calls my wandering footsteps home but far and farther bids me roam and then thy vestal notes dispense the meed of cold indifference cursed power that to myself unknown still turns the heart i love to stone dwells with the fair whom most i prize and scorns my tears and mocks my sighs yes anna i will hasten forth to the bleak regions of the north where erickson immortal lord poured on the dane his vengeful sword or where wide over the barbarous plain fierce rurick held his ancient reign then once more will i trace the rhine and mark the rhones swift billows shine once more on virgils tomb i will muse and lauras gemmd with evening dews once more romes via sacra tread and ponder on the mighty dead more eastward then direct my way to thirsty egypts deserts stray fix in wonder to behold the pyramids renowned of old fallen near one of which i ween the hieroglyphic sphinx is seen the the overflowing of the nile always happens while the sun is in leo and virgo lion virgin sphinx that shows what time the rich nile overflows then will i sail the egean tide or seek scamanders tuneful side wander the secret groves among where homer waked the immortal song traverse the nemaean wood mark the spot where sparta stood or at humbled athens see its still remaining majesty  yet to indiffrence ever a foe may beauty other joys bestow her rapturous science i will pursue the science newton never knew now blows the wind with melancholy force and over the baltic points my weary course loud shout the mariners the white sails swell  anna matilda fare thee fare thee well farewell whoever thou art and may thou find health and repose and lasting peace of mind still pour the various verse with fancy clear to thrill the pulse and charm the attentive ear nor may relentless care thy days destroy but every hope be ripened into joy and o farewell to distant britains shore which i perhaps am doomed to see no more where valor wisdom taste and virtue dwell dear land of liberty alas farewell  yet often even there by wild ambition tossed the souls best season settles in a frost yet even there desponding late i knew that friendship foreignformd is rarely true for they whom most i loved whose kindness saved my shattered bark when erst the tempest raved at home even with the common herd could fly gaze on the wounded deer and pass him by nor yet can pride subdue my pangs severe but scorn itself evaprates in a tear thou too delusive maid whose winning charms seduced me first from slow wealths beckning arms sweet poetry my earliest falsest friend here shall my frantic adoration end take back the simple flute thy treachry gave take back and plunge it in oblivions wave so shall its sad notes hence no malice raise  the bard unknown  forgotten be the lays but should with annas verse his hapless rhyme in future meet the impartial eye of time say that thy wretched victim long endured pains which are seldom felt and never cured say midst the lassitude of hopes overthrown matildas strain could comfort him alone yet was the veil mysterious never removed from him the admiring and from her the loved and no kind intercourse the song repaid but each to each remained  a shadow and a shade della crusca  to della crusca oh stay oh stay thy rash speed check not yet ascend the flying deck nor europes hemisphere forsake nor from thy nations pleasures take a bliss so exquisite and chaste  a feast so dear to polished taste as that thy lyre correctly flings as that they feel when della crusca sings alas you are gone and to my straining eye thy bark seems buoyant on the distant sky  see in the clouds its mast it proudly laves scorning the aid of oceans humble waves well may it soar and bear aloft the prize whose verse immortal links him to the skies well may it scorn rough neptunes rocky way which bears the genius of the god of day and now matilda bind thy lyre with cypress wreathes the lambent fire thou kindledst at his fervid rays can gleam no more  thy future days lost to the muses and to taste each torpid hour will joyless waste in vain each morning now will glow  in vain soft maias music flow and to my pillow force its way and on my wakning senses play her notes my wakning senses fill and conscious slumbers own the trill but when at length remembrance bids the filmy slumber quit my lids saying the world its wit has brought  its various point its wellturnd thought  but della crusca lends no ray  oh what is morning  what is may yet hold some solace yet remains and pensive joys await my pains i too must leave this laureled coast which all that rome adorned can boast but not like thee for grecian shores  ah no my humbler prow explores the sea unsung which lies between dovers proud cliffs and france serene thou wilt skim the egeans brilliant tide i over the british channel glide this passage when given in the world was by mistake altered and some of its lines left out  it is here printed from the original copy  thou all enthusiast fondly trace the isle where phaons beauteous face gave birth to sapphos glorious art  illumd her name but tore her heart thy sappho seek the shores vicine where englands lovely greatsould queen sublimely knelt and snatched from blushing fate the godlike victims of her edwards hate thou at aonias sacred feet wilt duly pour libations meet i roam over gallias sportive plains where thoughtless pleasure ever reigns but it is not sportive gallias plains though pleasure there for ever reigns which promises the boasted bliss  no bard beloved the hope is this that there thy footsteps i may tread press the same turf where sunk thy head sip the quick stream thy thirst has slaked and greet the dawn where thou have waked  fancying her waves of mazy gold never with such rich refulgence rolled and when her tints of various dye burst from the pallid sickly sky there rush in violet there in green here in soft red imbue the scene then lose themselves by growing bright till swallowed up in one vast flood of light  thus shall i say he saw her rays thus was he roused to adore and praise oh sympathy of birth divine descend and round my heart strings twine touch the fine nerve whenever i breathe where della crusca dropped his wreath lead me the sacred way of rome lead me to kneel at virgils tomb where he thenduring marble round with freshwove laurels graceful bound then guide where still with sweeter note than flowed from petrarchs tuneful throat on lauras grave he poured the lay amidst the sighs of sinking day then point where on the sod his tear fell from its crystal source so clear that there my mingling tear may sink and the same dust its moisture drink thus dying swans are said to sing and their last breath in numbers fling over the dear liquid shining plains which nursed their joys and nursed their pains like them my muse pines fast away and this her last her closing day when one blessed word her lips has sealed in lasting silence she will be veiled expiring still her notes the same she murmurs della cruscas name  the sacred word ye heard it spoke  her book is closed  her lyre is broke anna matilda  a tale for jealousy a recent event in catalonia loud shrieked the wind hoarse struck the hour when from his couch alphonso rose bedecked with gold his splendid bower  gold had his couch but not repose the night sat brooding on the hill beneath the sable rivers rolled not glistring now the tinkling rill  its stream opaque its spirit cold his chamber long with restless feet the lord alphonso traversed over here once he tasted slumbers sweet but slumber sweet he knows no more his roused domestics strait obey the signal of their lord unloved their torches flash a second day as through the costly rooms they moved his favorite from the obsequious train was to his inmost closet led there heard confessed the amorous pain which tore him from his midnight bed oh thou were near alphonso cries when in the progress late we made gonsalvos daughter in our eyes made every other virgin fade her noble mien her blushes mild the burnish of her tresses bright her age  but just no longer child her rosy mouth her graceful height all these have in my timeworn heart lighted a youthful amorous fire  i sink beneath the poignant smart i faint with eager strong desire often did i try her soul to melt but ignrant she of cupids power  his ecstacies she never felt  but now is come her fated hour with flames illicit i essayed to touch her iced unwakend heart let hymen sooth the bashful maid she will wakened play a softer part strait to her fathers speed thy way the fleetest mules with haste prepare and ere tomorrow scants his day thou wilt reach the village of my fair these pearls these dimonds speak my truth woo her with treasures to my arms when love no longer boasts of youth riches may plead their meaner charms oh how unlike the rapturous hour when love is bought by love alone when a soft look a touch a flower is prized beyond inds brightest stone but go and to her parents bear thy lords designs  his hopes unfold plead with due force his meaning fair and in thy promises be bold much more the lord alphonso spoke his servants mind the whole retains whose lashes soon the mules provoke the mules skim over the distant plains the awakened night with streaks of gold her jetty robes begun to lace her drowsy car far off she rolled  the blithe sun urging to the race and ere his wheels had run behind the western mountains giddy slope julia with meekness all resigned had listened to alphonsos hope not so resigned but that her thought recoiled at such unequal love till by parental wisdom taught she learned to bear and then approve the sire attends his darling child for so alphonsos pride allows and with the transport almost wild saw her receive a grandees vows he saw that form where speaking grace gave soul to beauty most refined the robe of dignity embrace by taste magnificent designed her hair which floated over her dress a dress which to be seen demands its rich luxuriance to repress they tie in folds with diamond bands but the soft curls which haply fell upon her bosoms heaving snow were suffered there unbound to dwell and spread their wavy golden glow thus the fond parent saw her rove through gaudy halls and rooms of state whilst humble trains at distance wait and from her nod receive their fate succinct the time in which such joy around his aged heart might play bitter oh bitter the ally and set full soon is pleasures day for lord alphonso names the hour when he the sumptuous dome must quit and seek again the humble bower  for birth like his a mansion fit tells him to take a last farewell of her more dear then sense or light bids him never hope again to dwell where filial julia blessed his sight his daughter overwhelmed with woe the haughty cruel order hears she sees her mournful parent go and bathes his last steps with her tears now slow and saddend rolls the time which late flew rapid with delight heedless is she of mornings prime nor hails the soft approach of night her only solace was to roam midst the deep woods embosomd calm where distant from her gaudy home meek solitude bestowed its balm there on a rivers fringy side which snatched her breath as stealing by she would watch its curled unequal glide and swell with here is the zephyrs sigh mark with what truth it objects drew when ruffling zephyr ceased to breathe its surface polished to the view  a phantom forest underneath two drooping willows there displayed their foliage to the painting wave which in their pensive green arrayed would still their jutting bare roots lave these by her hands in garlands dressed she would sometimes chide the low bent branch which would its blooming fragrant vest upon the escaping river launch thus was she one bright eve employed whilst carols sad her sweet voice sung evenings own bird her note enjoyed  when from its shades a soldier sprung his form like that apollo wears when from his bow the swift dart sings or when the discus through the air with equal force and grace he flings martial his step his beamy eye bright as fair julias own appears strait to each others arms they fly  they mingle joy  they mingle tears twas julias brother whom she saw twas julia whom her brother pressed both dear by natures dearest law for twins they were who thus caressed from calpes glorious rock he came  immortal monument decreed of english elliots laureled name where english heroes often shall bleed and there his blood did gusman shed amongst the boldest ever found by sacred thirst of honor led  nor shunned the deaths that flew around but when bright peace her silver flute had sounded through wide europes skies and when the voice of war was mute sped by fond duty home he flies there he first learned his sisters fate how elevated  and how cursed heard that amidst her brilliant state her heart consuming sorrow nursed her husbands tyrant law revealed no dear relation to behold obliged him thus in shades concealed his sister to his heart to fold and often he mourned her cruel lot and often he dried her tears away when from the interesting spot they each were warned by closing day adieu my gusman julia cries yet let me see thee once again tomorrow bless thy sisters eyes then seek our dear paternal plain from forth my little treasured hoard fond tokens to my mother bear no miser is my cruel lord and gifts like these i well can spare gusman with pure fraternal love kissed either beauteous fading cheek vowing when morn should light the grove in its mild haunts her steps he would seek now evening hung its silvry dews on every shrub that decked the glades and fainter scents the flowers effuse  as loath to greet with sweets her shades often had fair julia lingered there in hours like these  and traced the beam which sent from lunas brilliant sphere shot through the wood a shivered gleam marked how each sound stole soft away as gliding off to shores more bright bribed by the gaudy tumid day to fly the doveeyed tender night by julia these are all forgot for pleasure has her soul suffused blind to the beauties of the spot she deigns not now to be amused braced with young joy the sportive fawn pursues her dam with motion fleet regardless of the sprinkled lawn that weaves its flowers around her feet so speeds the fair one to her home whose towers return the moons broad glare whilst to point out the distant dome they flash their gold vanes through the air on her soft pillow soon reclined round her the slumbers spun their veil and over her placid gentle mind the softest dreams their phantoms steal at mornings dawn her lord commands her placid slumbers must be broke he grasped in his her trembling hands he led her forth but never spoke and oh these horrid sounds she cried  those piteous shrieks which tear the ear with terror struck she faintly sighed and sunk at length oerpowerd with fear he dragged her on the screams of pain more piercing as they nearer grow left her scarce power to sustain her crimson lifes unequal flow there wretch behold alphonso cried as wide he threw the grating gate there feast thy loose adulterous eyes see there thy paramours just fate there stretched upon the racking wheel she saw her brothers tortured form from his torn flesh the jagged steel bad rush the blood with life yet warm she saw  but oh she spoke no more the agony too fierce to bear groaning she sunk upon the floor and breathed her spirit on the air sister the writhing gusman said  oh sister plead  then swoond with pain on his gashd bosom sunk his head his limbs convulsed the cords still strain alphonso when he heard the sound leapt sudden to the deathful wheel with eager haste the youths unbound and stern alphonso learns to feel he raves he sinks he strikes his breast but oh the guilty deed is past the victims pure are now at rest  thy tortures shall for ever last vain is all art for life no more can lift their pulse their cheeks can paint thoust freed their souls they quit the shore  each seeks its god  a murdered saint there tyrant lie and let the fangs of deep remorse thy bosom tear each wakning morn awake new pangs  teach thee to pity and despair anna matilda to those who read the following little tract printed carefully from the manuscript of the once famous sir william waller is considered as a curiosity worthy of being given to the public  it contains the memoranda and reflections of a man who had a considerable share in forming the fate of england at a time when the strong convulsions of its state arrested the attention of europe and of the world  sir william waller was a member of the house of commons and major general of the parliament army it appears from whitlock that he was a man of great consideration in the army and with the public oliver cromwell served under him  the king feared him  the parliament depended on him  the purity of his intentions and the uprightnes of his principles  the transcript before you will sufficiently establish  it is a mental mirror in which you behold the features of the writers mind as distinctly as a looking glass reflects to a young beauty her cheek of roses and her eye of fire that he was popular as to courage and resolution is plain from a formal petition sent to parliament by the inhabitants of portsmouth praying that sir william waller might be made their governor  that he had a mind capable of the tenderest impressions and alive to all the charms of love appears from this that he never lived unmarried three times he exulted in the flowery hymeneal chain and speaks of each lady with exalted fondness and affection but those alas were days in which the connubial passion was the only one tolerated  of waller hume begins to speak in the following words   in the year      sir william waller began to distinguish himself among the generals of the army active and indesatigable in his operations rapid and enterprising he was fitted by his genius to the nature of war vol vi p      it has been lately so much the taste to read the ana of celebrated men that the editor of these is persuaded their being combined with the effusions of her own idle hours will not render them unwelcome to the public perhaps there is no occasion for apology but toward the writer himself she has some consciousness of delinquency the brave general who wore himself out in campaigns cased in armor and peeping half his life through an iron vizor thought of nothing less probably than of turning author  yet it happens that after he has been at rest with his tumultuous ancestors i hope they will forgive my guessing at their characters almost a century and his military and moral character long ago decided on he is now made to hold up his hand at the literary bar to be tried by his critics and his country  to his critics and countrymen it may be observed that if they have an appetite for anecdote the following pages will not tend much to satisfy it they are filled with the recollections of a man who at the close of a busy life thought it time to recollect himself and who recollects only about himself in the retrospect his imminent dangers and hairbreadth escapes light up his gratitude to heaven and make his little book rather a compendium of piety than a register of events a piety not much differing from that which has provoked our sneers at the posthumous works of the great johnson  but then he was a scholar and a philosopher and his piety in course very much unlike other peoples what you are now offered is the piety of a general  we have many generals and they can answer for the similitude  in a word  this peculiar little volume is presented not to the world as an amusement but to the curious as a medal a medal struck at an era when the events of this country were mighty and when the characters of men were grand when every action was on an enlarged scale and in high relief  when the kingdom like sir joshuas infant hercules was struggling between the two deadly serpents which assailed its vitality  the tyranny of the commonwealth and the prerogative of the crown  the internal evidence the book carries with it is so strong that it is judged not necessary to say one word on its authenticity but it is necessary to say that besides the pages suppressed mentioned in the conclusion there has been an elision of one entire section under the head of perils by water a part likewise of that under the head by great sicknesses has been cut out because the circumstances mentioned and the terms used are not exactly correspondent to the ideas of delicacy which happily is in this age one of its characteristics  in the opening of the manuscript there appears to be two leaves wanting whether what is lost contained events or reflections it is impossible to judge  the leaves are not torn but cut out carefully with a knife close to the margin the beginning of the third leaf is the end of a reflection of which itt is the first word for further information the reader shall be now left to sir william himself and it is hoped he will not rank the half hour spent in his society amongst the most unprofitable half hours of his life  recollections by general sir william waller itt but a stormy sea if i cast my eyes backward the billows are still heaving and the angry waves are tossing their heads if i look forward the prospect does present to my imagination nothing new itt is still a stormy sea and the billows and the waves and the breakers surround the poor mariner who if by chance he does escape comes wounded and torn and almost spent to shore but   many o lord are thy wonderful works which thou have don and thy thoughts which are to me ward they cannot be reckoned upp in order unto thee ps xl    come therefore and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he has don for my soul ps lxvi      in personal deliverances  i may say with the apostle glorying as he did of the things which concern mine infirmityes i have been  in prisons frequent  seissed upon by the army as i was going to discharge my duty in the house of commons and contrary to privilege of parliament made a prisoner in the queens court from thence carried ignominiously to a place under the exchequer called hell and the next day to the kings head in the strand after singled out as a sheep to the slaughter and removed to st jamess thence sent to windsor castle and remanded to st jamess again lastly tossed like a ball into a strange country to denbigh castle in north wales remote from my relations and interests  after above three years imprisonment and thus being changed as itt were from vessel to vessel itt pleased the lord to turn my captivity and to restore me to the comforts of my poor family again and here let me call to mind how much reason i had to be thankful to him who chasteneth those whom he loves for the great consolation experienced in the dear partner of my captivity she came to me disguised in mean apparel when i had groaned in my bonds seven months thinking itt the duty of a wife to riske all things for the satisfaction of her husband much difficulty had she in coming and was frequent on the brink of being discovered but at length over mountains and unknown roads sometimes with a guide and sometimes with none she arrived at my prison and she seemed when she discovered herself to me to be like the angel who appeared unto peter in like circumstances she did not indeed bid my prison gates fly open but by her sweet converse and behavior she made those things seem light which were before heavy and scarce to be borne  i must ever acknowledge itt also a very great mercy that being so long subject to so great a malice armed with so great a power i was not given as a prey to their teeth and that after all the endeavors that were used to find out matter of charge against me i came off with an entire innocence not only uncondemned but unaccused  the  th of august      i was seized a prisoner by a party of horse in kent and the   d following i was committed to the tower only upon jealousy and because i refused to inform the council further than in what singly concerned my self and because i denied to give any engagement the   st of october following the lord delivered me by my habeas corpus in an open clear way notwithstanding all opposition blessed be his holy name who has been my constant keeper and has not only delivered me out of the mouth of the lion as he did paul but preserved me in itt and my trust is the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen    in deaths often    by sudden accidents  in my infancy when i lay in my cradle i escaped a great danger upon the casual discharge of a piece the shot whereof missed me very narrowly  at winchester castle i ran a great hassard of being buried under the ruins of an old outwall which i had been viewing and considering how to have it taken down and i was no sooner stepped into the house not above an easy stones cast off but itt fell and covered all the place where i had been and diverse yards beyond itt my dear wife the lady ann had a deliverance of the very same kind there likewise having been to look at an old staircase which was repairing she was no sooner gone but the place where she stood fell and in humane reason she could not but have perished in the ruins   at cropredy in oxfordshire i escaped a great danger of the like nature when being with my officers at a council of war the floor of the room where i was sunk under me and i lay overwhelmed with a great deal of lumber that fell upon me and yet blessed be god i had no hurt at all and at this place i did likewise escape a snare after the battle a message was sent to me by the king when i had given my answer that i could not treat with his majesty but by command of parliament i turned shortly round when the trumpet said he had a private mesage for me and prayed me to hear him i replied there need be no privacy not caring to give an handle to mine enemies but some that were near me did persuade me to hear the man and went out he then presently pulled forth a letter which to my great shame and surprise came from the lady  in itt she besought me to betray my cause and this she did so wittily and kind that i had much ado to be angry before this ladys marriage i had been her suitor and did dearly love her and she remembered me of this and of some soft passages whether or not she was putt on this by some greater than herself i never knew but i returned for answer that as i had never been traitor to my love so would i not to my cause which i should be if i did as she would advise and after this i heard no more     by great sicknesses   i had a great deliverance from the plague at my house in aldersgate street a chambermaid of my wifes being struck with itt who died within a day or two after at the pesthouse whither she was removed my wife being then great with child of my son thomas had her by the hand in her sickness and was near her when she was in sweats yet neither she nor any of my family were infected  at calais i escaped the plague when sir philip stapleton died of itt and i was with him and had him by the hand not above five or six hours before he departed    by hassards in war  in the wars between the venetians and the archduke ferdinand afterward emperor at the leaguer before rubia i escaped several very near shot one grazing at my foot another lighting between sir john vere and me as we sat close together by the battery and yet touched neither of us besides diverse others both great and small shot that endangered me  in the war between the emperor ferdinand and the king of bohemia i escaped miraculously out of the hands of the cossacks when in a skirmish my horse was killed under me and in the clearing of myself from him i fell with my foot hanging in the stirrup i was encompassed by them and in making my way through them to my own men had several shot made at me at a close distance yet itt pleased the lord none wounded only one grazed lightly on the topp of my head and i came off with safety  at the battle of edghill i had my horse shot under me but i was preserved from any hurt  at the taking of farnham castle i escaped a very near shot from one of mine own men as he followed me in a narrow passage after i was entered  in my retreat from chepstow when prince maurice had lined all the passages between that and gloucester with a very considerable army to intercept me i had no way left but to transport my foot and train of artillery cross the severn to barkley castle from whence they were secured and with my horse and dragoones to beat through his quarters upon the march that night thorough the forest of dean itt happened thorough the sleepiness of an officer that the maine body was separated a great distance from the fore troop with which i marched so that i was feign to make an halt for above half an hour within little more than a mile of the princes head quarter in broad day light the alarm taken and not one hundred and twenty horse with me nevertheless itt pleased god in his infinite mercy to direct the rest of my troops to me and under the conduct of his providence i made a safe and an honorable retreat to gloucester in despite of the enemy who charged me in the rear but with more loss to him than to me  at landsdown when i made the retreat i escaped a shower of shot  at the devises when i beat the lord marquess harford prince maurice and the lord hopton with their remaining forces into the town the second night after i sat down before itt having been out to visit the gardes and returning to a farmhouse at the foot of roundway down where i had given order to my cook that my supper should be ready against i came in and finding my meat but newly laid to the fire in a sudden impatience i resolved not to supp at all and so took horse again and rode upp to the topp where the body of my horse lay i was not gone above a muskett shot but some of the ennemy knowing the pasages thereabout which i did not and rationally supposing i might quarter in that place in regard of the convenient situation of itt between my horse and my foot came into the house and enquired and made a search for me and if i had stayed there as at first i intended in all probability they might have suddenly dispatched me and retired in the darkness of night with safety enough  some days after whilst i lay before the town i rode with a small party about the quarters particularly to see how the dragoones were laid on the further side of the town and being to return back itt pleased god to putt itt suddenly into my mind to go by another way than that i came which some of the party and some of mine own servants who staid a little behind not observing but taking the former way they were almost all taken by the ennemy i came back safely  at farnham god appeared wonderfully for me when the lord hopton drew upp his whole army within culverin shot of me being with the forces of sir jacob ashly who was then joined to him at the least eight thousand horse and foot and thorough the mistake or neglect of my adiutantgenerall and the slackness of my men in drawing to the rendevous i was not able to face him with two thousand men in that extremity the lord took opportunity to show himself for me and sent so thick a mist all the morning that by reason of the darkness the ennemy durst not give on and when the mist brake upp i had such an advantage of the ground that my weakness remained undiscovered and he drew off from me i was that day delivred from an imminent destruction  at cheriton field i was in danger to have been taken or killed the ennemy having by a charge given upon some troops of mine shutt me off from mine own men i having then but three with me but itt pleased god they were repulsed again and thereby a way opened for my retreat  i may reckon itt a mercy that upon a sudden occasion that day charging without my headpeece and being known by the ennemy as i afterward understood i came off safe and unhurt  when the king came suddenly upon me with his whole army at andover and i had then nothing but a body of horse and dragoones with me i made a fair retreat to basingstoke  at the second newbery fight when i fell on with my troops by the way off speenfield and we were mingled with the ennemy i had a great deliverence for one of the adverse party coming behind me and being ready to fire his pistol in my reins in that instant one of my life guard killed him or otherwise in all probability he had killed me   o god the lord the strength of my salvation thou have covered my head in the day off battle ps cxl    the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivers them ps xxxiv   in journyings often  in my travel between venice and florence i escaped the danger of the inquisition at bolonia where through the information of a priest that came along in company with me from venice i was searched my trunk wherein i had nothing but clothes was rifled to the bottom but itt pleased god to so order itt that they let alone a box wherein i had some papers which might have exposed me to question when they had itt in their hands ready to open itt  in my journey into yorkshire to my sisters house at hickleton being accompanied with my wife the lady ann and my dear mother i reckon itt a great deliverance that when my coach mares upon the descent of an hill had broken their raines and overthrown the coachman from the box and begun to run away the raines falling down upon the ground one of the mares treading upon them they checked her bitt and made her stopp which made the rest stand likewise  in perils in the city  when the army first marched up to the city of london and made that breach upon the parliament i was voted to command a body of horse and dragoones in the nature of a flying army for the defense of the king kingdom parliament and city and whilst i was acting with others according to my duty at the committee of militia to advance that levy we were all unexpectedly deserted and betrayed by the city and left out of all capitulation so that upon the entering of the army we were enforced to lie hidd and within a few days after to make use of the passes which the house of commons had given us and to quit the kingdom the lord all that time preserved me from falling into the hands of the army though i was pursued by land and sea  when after the death of my late dear wife i had sent out my sons to school and removed my daughters with some part of my goods to the lady blanyes house in long acre myself remaining in that desolate condition a prisoner at st jamess there was a base information given to the council of state by a servant of mine whom for a falsness i had putt away that i had deposited plate and jewels to a great vallue in that good ladies custody whereupon without any cause alleged or any thing at all in charge against me they sent a warrant signed bradshaw by a sargeant at arms to seize upon all thatt i had there as belonging to an ennemy of the state but itt pleased the wisdom of god to befoole their malice that they made no search in mine own house where all that i had of vallue was but only in that place where there was nothing but so inconsiderable a parcel of plate that they were ashamed to keep itt when they had itt and so they sent itt back again in the mean time i had leisure to dispose of what i had by me to a place of safety  march   d      i was seized upon as a prisoner by a warrant from the protector and brought to whitehall where i was examined by him he did examine me as a stranger not as one whom he had aforetime known and obeyed yet was he not discourteous and itt pleased the lord to preserve me that not one thing objected could be prooved against me so i was delivered and returned with comfort to my family again blessed be the name of the lord  in perils among false brethren  it pleased the house of commons to command my service in taking care for the drawing upp for the ordinance in favor of the apprentices upon which account some apprentices who negotiated that business for the rest made their application to me shortly after when that petition from the city was to be presented which was followed with so much confusion that it gave occasion or pretense to the speaker and diverse others of the house to withdraw to the army myself and the rest of the eleven members having then gained the leave of the house to absent ourselves for six months by that denial of our own right and privilege to preserve if possible the privilege of parliament from any further violation by the army some two days before the presentation of the above said petition there came two persons to my house in drury lane to speak with me who when i came out unto them told me they were apprentices of the city and came to be advised by me how they should manage their petition to whom i replied that i knew no advice to be given but that they should be careful to attend the house as early as they could before they were praeingaged in other business but this did not serve their purpose who came only to ensnare me whereupon they moved further and said that myself and the other impeached gentlemen were concerned in their petition and that they must and would have us into the house again to which i returned no more but that i should have no more to do in that business and so i left them this was all that passed and yet those false impudent creatures made their report at the army that i abetted that disorder and assault upon the house and cooperated with the apprentices in itt which served to exasperate the army so much the more against me but it pleased the lord that they never had power to act any thing upon itt to my prejudice  after i was made a prisoner by the army and removed from the kings head in the strand to st james i had a message sent me from one colonel fitzjames with the signification of his respect to me and compassion of me representing the extreme danger in which i was and the enevitable destruction that attended me if i did not endeavor to prevent itt by some escape in order to that he made me a tender of his assistance engaging himself that he would set me safe aboard a shipp that lay ready in the river for me to transport me beyond the reach of all mine ennemies but itt pleased god to prevent the effect of his treachery both by giving me the confidence to stand upon mine own innocence and by discovering to me that that perfidious man in the midst of all his protestations of friendshipp to me had privately offered himself to give evidence against me at the bar of the house of commons so that it was a mere train laid to bring a guiltiness upon me and to take away my life  the like offer was made to my wife in reference to the procurement of my escape out of windsor castle by one captain kempe of collonell prides regiment with the addition of an intended cheat but i was delivered as a bird out of the snare of these fowlers so that i was not caught with their chaff   about the same time shortly after my coming to windsor castle having opportunity to send to my dear wife whom i had left in a disconsolat condition at london great with child and within a few weeks of her delivery as i had sealed my letter and was ready to dispatch itt away i had notice given me by my keeper that the governor must see whatever letters i wrote or received whereupon i bad him carry itt unto him that he might open it if he thought fit but the governor returned itt back unto me untouched with this compliment that i was very much mistaken in him if i thought he would be so unworthy as to open letters between a man and his wife and with some further expressions of respect to me in regard he had formerly served as a lieutenant colonel under me this i took as a civility from him but i found it after to be no other than a mere insiduous practice for after an uninterrupted pasage of letters between my wife and me for about a fortnight or three weeks by which time he supposed we might be grown to a confidence to write freely he suddenly seized upon all my letters but there was nothing to be found in them that could prejudice me and so that snare likewise broke and i escaped the danger of it blessed be god  march      i have reason to acknowledge itt a great mercy of god that he preserved me in so insnaring a time wherein the lord heard my prayer   the wicked plotteth against the just  the lord shall laugh at him for he sees that his day is coming ps xxxvii        the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged ps xxxvii      in several prosperous successes    the taking of southsea castle    the taking of portsmouth  it was about this time that those misunderstandings grew between me and the lord general essex which were afterward noticed in some sort by the parliament and there were those who fomented our discord for their own advancement some whom i at that time commanded but who have since sat in a higher seat were not wanting to misrepresent and to inflame on either side and the country did suffer for these things which the parliament well knew but thought itt not convenient at all times to notice    the taking of farnham castle    the taking of chichester    the taking of malmesbury    the taking of heighnam and releiving of gloucester    the taking of monmouth    the taking of hereford    the fight at cheriton near wells in somersetshire where prince maurice was wounded and i putt a stopp to his pursuit of the forces under coll popham whilst in these parts itt was told that the queen had something endeared herself when at exeter by the following charity walking out northward of the city soon after her laying in she stopped at the cottage of a poor woman whom she heard making doleful cries she sent one of her train to know what itt might be which occasioned itt the page returned and said the woman was sorrowing grievously because her daughter had been two days in the straw and was almost dead for want of nourishment she having nothing to give her but water and not being able for the hardness of the times to get any thing on this the queen took a small chain of gould from her neck at which hung an agnus she took off the agnus and putt itt in her bosom and making the woman be called to her gave her the chain and bad her to go into the city to a gouldsmith and sell itt and keep the money to provide for the good woman in the straw and for this her confessor did afterward rebuke her because they were heretics when this thing was told to the king he asked jestingly if her confessor had made the queen do a penance for itt as she haddon once before for some innocent act when she was made to walk to tyburn some say barefoot   0 the beating up of coll hamiltons quarters     the fight at landsdown     the beating of the marquess of hartfords army into the devizes     the routing of the earl of crawfords party and taking the ammuniton which he was conveying into the devizes     the beating upp of the earl of crawfords quarter at alton where five hundred of the taken to make my success the greater took the covenant and served under me great was my exultation but itt had bitter endings for the parliament wrote to essex to join me intending that we together should do a mighty work but the general would not to their no small displeasure for which no good reason could be given but that he would have his great name stand alone my dismal defeat at roundway down was owing to those heart burnings and jealoucies for the general suffered the enemies horse to pass quietly and without molestation to the succor of their infantry which lay at the devizes in miserable plight the proud have laid snares for me says the psalmist and set traps in my way so sure was i of victory that i wrote to parliament to bid them be at rest for that i would shortly send them an account of the numbers taken and the numbers slain but it pleased the lord to turn my victory into mourning and my glory into shame with a small number of cavalry i retired to bristol and there heard continually of the successes of the royal party who took heart on this mischance of mine that had never happened had others don their duty     the taking of arundell     the battle at cheriton     the taking of christchurch     the taking of the pass at newbridg     the taking of sudely castle   0 the fight at speenfield by newberry     the beating upp of coll longs quarters in which cromwells horse did good service and here i cannot but mention the wonder which i have often times had to see this eagle in his eirey he at this time had never shown extraordinary parts nor do i think that he did himself believe that he had them for although he was blunt he did not bear himself with pride or disdain as an oficer he was obedient and did never dispute my orders nor argue upon them he did indeed seem to have great cunning and whilst he was cautious of his own words not putting forth too many lest they should betray his thoughts he made others talk until he had as it were sifted them and known their inmost designs a notable instance was his discovering in one short conversation with one captain giles a great favorite with the lord general and whom he most confided in that although his words were full of zeal and his actions seemingly brave that his heart was not with the cause and in fine this man did shortly after join the enemy at oxford with three and twenty stout fellows one other instance i will here set down being of the same sort as to his cunning  when i took the lord piercy at andover having at that time an inconvenient distemper i desired collonell cromwell to entertain him with some civility who did afterward tell me that amongst those whom we took with him being about thirty their was a youth of so fair a countenance that he doubted of his condition and to confirm himself willed him to sing which he did with such a daintiness that cromwell scrupled not to say to lord piercy that being a warrior he did wisely to be accompanied by amazons on which that lord in some confusion did acknowledge that she was a damsel this afterward gave cause for scoff at the kings party as that they were loose and wanton and minded their pleasure more than either their countrys service or their maisters good     the infall at the devizes and the taking of major rowles and his horse the remainder of colonel longs regiment   not unto us o lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy truths sake ps cxv    thine o lord is the victory   chronicles xxix    in returns for prayer  when it pleased god after seven years expectation that my first wife fell into travel i could not but be very apprehensive of the weakness of her condition and having retired myself to prayer and earnestly besought god to strengthen her and being desirous to comfort myself out of gods word i took the bible to read and letting itt fall with some passion upon the table without any particular design upon one place more than another itt opened upon the     psalm in the singing psalms  like fruitful vines on thy house side so does thy wife spring out with which being surprised i presumed to make a trial whether itt were more than an accident or no the good lord forgive me for that presumption and taking upp another bible that lay by itt opened likewise upon the same place within a few hours after my wife was safely delivered  not long after this being at london i was suddenly taken with a fit of the stone in that violence that itt grew insupportable to me whereupon i cast myself upon my knees and besought god for his mercy to me and before i rose upp my pain was mitigated and within one quarter of an hour i was perfectly well  after the death of my first wife and of my son which i had by her both very dear blessings to me when i putt on a resolution to marry again i humbly besought god to provide such a wife for me as might be an help to me in the way of his service and that i might have a religious woman or none and when his providence directed me to lady ann finch and that all things were agreed upon between my lord her father and me in reference to the marriage upon her motion she and i agreed together to set a day apart to seek god for his blessing in itt itt pleased the lord to answer our prayers in as full a measure of comfort as ever was powered out opon a married couple and though at the first there were some little differences in our natures and judgments as to some particulars yet within a little while that good god wrought us to that uniformity that i may say we were but as one soul in two bodies  after i had quitted the service of the parliament in the field and was returned to london and there settled with my family my estate began to fall short part thereof lying in the kings quarters and the rest through the distraction of the times affording me very little subsistence to supply my necessityes i was feign to sell several things and in the end i was at such a pinch as that without selling my plate which i had kept as my last reserve of vallue i knew not how to send to markett whereupon my wife and i having recommended our condition to god resolved the next morning to send our plate to the gouldsmiths and to make money of itt but the next morning i was wakened by my servant who let me know there was one come from barnstaple with some money for me the sum was not above fifteen pounds but that served my present occasions and before that was spent i received a further releife so as i was put to no more such exigencyes blessed be god  when his majesty was at worcester i thought itt my duty to seek god for him in that distressed condition itt pleased the lord to enlarge my heart with much comfort and to give me a confident assurance that i should have an answer of peace the issue was that his royal person was miraculously delivered out of the hands of those hunters  after my return from d  when i took upp a resolution to marry again i besought god for his direction in my choice who heard my petition and sent me the lady harcourt to repair the breach formerly made in my poor family which was so rich a blessing that i can never sufficiently acknowledge itt that god hearing prayer who has with the general approbation of good men united us by his sacred ordinance and made us not only one flesh but one spirit one in our affections judgments ways ends as if we had been both cut out of one piece he vouchsafes to preserve us together for the advancement of his service and glory   because thou have been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul follows hard after thee ps lxiii    because he has inclined his care unto me therefore will i call upon him as long as i live ps cxvi   in fatherlike chasticements    my endeavor to supplant mr yard in his possession of the markett of newton abbot though upon a dormant title yet proceeding from a covetous end was justly punished both in the loss of the thing i sued for and in all that trouble befell me in kings bench    when out of a covetuous desire to gain a good bargain upon mr price his lease by winchester i laid down five hundred pounds as a claw upon itt by way of morgage god justly punished me both in the loss of the lease and of my money too    it was just with god for the punishment of my giving way to the plunder of the city of winchester to permit the demolition of my house at winchester    my vanity in furniture justly punished in the loss of a great part of itt by the treachery of ellis    my presumption upon mine own strength and former successes justly humbled at the devises this was the most heavy stroke of any that did ever befall me general essex had thought to persuade the parliament to compromise with the king which so inflamed the zealous that they moved that the command of their army might be bestowed upon me but the news of this defeat arrived whilst they were deliberating on my advancement and itt was to me a double defeat i had nearly sunk under the affliction but that i had a dear and sweet comforter and i did at that time prove according to ecclesiasticus chap xxvi a virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband  as the sun when itt arises in the high heaven so is the beauty of a good wife verse       by an utter defeat and at croperdy with a dishonorable blow    itt was just with god to lay me by all employment as a broken vessel in regard of the corruption of my heart in my first engagement and neglect of reformation in the officers and soldiery under me    my not attending unto nor improoving by sermons when itt pleased the lord to come under my roof and to visit me by his ministers at st jamess was justly punished at denbigh by a restraint from all ordinances    after the end of the war that i began to enjoy my estate and the comforts of my family again and upon passing of the vote in the house of commons of   00 l to be settled upon me as a compensation for my service i was puffed upp with a presumption that i should never be moved whereupon god most justly within a few months after sent those several chastisements upon me banishment imprisonment sickness the death of my wife poverty    the not paying my vow upon the marriage with my wife justly punished by gods taking her from me   it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statutes ps cxix     rejoice not against me o mine ennemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold his righteosness micah vii   in acknowledgment of gods infinite mercy and goodness declared in his many deliverances of me and in his comforts and blessings to me particularly in my enlargement from my long captivity my return with comfort to my children and family and that inestimable blessing he has been pleased to bestow upon me in a most dear good wife i vow by his grace assisting and enabling me to restrain them in a thankful memory and to transmitt the recordation of them to my children that they may never be forgotten neither by me nor my posterity  i humbly renew my vows both against the practice or purpose of every gross sin or the allowance of any though never so small and resolve so far as i am able to shun the occasions of them and in particular i protest by the help of the divine grace against giving any entertainment or lodging in my heart to a p s c h w l  as a poor thank offering for so many undeserved mercyes i humble renew the consecration of the tenth of whatsoever i receive in my estate to pious uses and besides the  00th formerly devoted to those ends in acknowledgment of my deliverance out of prison i vow one hundred pounds more as an oblation to god for the blessing and happiness i enjoy in my present married condition to be employed in such ways as i shall be directed by my godly friends and if i be repaid the debt owing me from my l k i engage myself to dispose forty pounds of itt with the addition of tenn pounds more unto itt to the town of newton abbot in devon for the making upp of their stock for the setting of the poor at work in the workhouse there erected by me i humbly devote my life to god who has so often preserved itt and so many ways blessed itt resolving by his grace to do all i can for the setting of him upp in my heart to love fear and trust him more to pray read and hear more and more zealously than i have don hitherto to walk in my particular calling more uprightly constantly cheerfully fruitfully and to endeavor to become better in all relations both to the public in church and state whenever i shall be in a capacity to serve them and in private as a father husband master etc   as a father endeavoring to bring upp my children in the nurture and admonition of the lord teaching them his fear both by precept and example with a spirit of meekness that they may not be discouraged  as an husband dwelling with my dear yokefellow according to knowledge loving her as mine own body as mine ownself as christ loved his church so taking care with her for the things of this world that as we study to please one another we may likewise remember the homage we both owe to god and labor above all things to please him  as a master so carrying my self toward my servants forbearing threatening giving them what is just and equal as knowing that i also have a master in heaven and making provision for my family according to my duty  i will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered  and my mouth has spoken when i was in trouble ps lxxvi        i will pay that that i have vowed salvation is of the lord jonah ii   a daily direction  every day is a little life in the account whereof we may reckon our birth from the womb of the morning our growing time from thence to noone when we are as the sun in his strength after which like a ps cii   shadow that declineth we hasten to the evening of our age till at last we close our eyes in sleep the image of death and our whole life is but this tale of a day told over and over i should therefore so spend every day as if itt were all the life i had to live and in pursuance of this end and of the vow i have made to walk with god in a closer communion than i have formerly don i would endeavor by his grace to observe in the course of my remaining spann or rather inche of life this daily directory   ps cxxxix   ps lxiii  to awake with god as early as i can and to consecrate the first fruits of my thoughts unto him by prayer and meditaion and by renewed acts of faith and repentance that so god may awake for me and make the habitation of my righteosness prosperous job vili     to this end i would make itt my care to lie down the night before in the peace of god who has promised that his commandment shall keep me when i sleep and talk with me when i awake otherwise itt may be justly feared that those corruptions that bid me last good night will be ready to give me first good morrow   after this follows sixteen pages of text from scripture and scriptural allusions under the head of daily dangers of which the publisher thought the preceding pages had sufficient and on his judgment the rest are suppressed but the writers concluding reflections on his own situation and on that of the protectors shall be preserved he speaks of some enmities he had encountered and continues  when that poor man who relied on his maisters word understood that the king had consented to his death he piteously cried out putt not your trust in princes and nearly as good cause have i to say putt not your trust in parliaments i have served parliament with my blood and with my estate and gained nothing the while but mistrusts prisons and neglect at one time so full of my services they were going to make me general of all their forces but a panic of my horse which deserted me turned the tide
