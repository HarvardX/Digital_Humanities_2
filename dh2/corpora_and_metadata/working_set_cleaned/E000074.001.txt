the rights of nature against the usurpations of establishments price two shillings ii iii the rights of nature against the usurpations of establishments a series of letters to the people of britain on the state of public affairs and the recent effusions of the right honourable edmund burke by john thelwall letter the first london published by h d symonds no  0 paternosterrow and j march norwich      iv   the rights of nature against the usurpations of establishments letter i introductory remarks on the spirit and temper of burkes letters on the prospect of a regicide peace the tocsin of aristocracy sounds once more—the generale is beaten on the tortured hide of old john zisca and the yell of persecution rings through the harassed country rouse from the couch of lethargy o sluggish and insensate people shake off the drowsy stupor which creeping over the frozen nerve of misery at once soothes and threatens with the sleep of death if neither the blood of friends nor relatives poured out like water in this profligate crusade of the powerful and the wealthy against the poor and weak—of governments and government contractors against their oppressed and plundered people—if neither the sacrifice of thousands and tens of thousands by the yellow pestilence that high priestess to the moloc of west indian avarice   who immolates the flower of british youth for the perpetuity of the african slave trade—if neither the woes nor the insults you have endured nor the persecutions which have outraged all humanity and made law a mockery if neither the burthens under which you groan nor the organized system of monopoly which those burthens have of necessity produced and which worse than a blighting mildew hangs on the full ear of your vain prosperity counteracts the bounties of nature and in spite of an abundant harvest denies to the craving family of the artificer and the peasant even the negative blessing† of a plenteous meal—if neither of these nor all accumulated together in one horrid mass can goad and urge you to the manly energies of reason and the decided tone of authoritative complaint—if neither the invocations nor the sufferings of the intrepid few who even in these bad times dare to be the advocates of human rights can warm you to sympathy or rouse you to reflection yet listen awhile to the prophetic fury of the archenemy of your rights and freedom peruse the portentous leaves he has thus wildly scattered and think   upon the fetters that are still forging for you attend i say to the threats so liberally distributed stamped as it were with the currency of authority from the very mint of court confidence and issued by the pensioned hand of an hireling apostate paid by the produce of your labour to encrease your burthens and destroy your rights and when you have heard these denunciations which in daring profligacy outstrip conception and almost make us heretics against our senses then sink down again if ye can into your wonted supineness till the salutary but critical terrors of the cautery and the knife—the relumined fires of smithfield and the axe upon tower hill shall awaken and warn ye that your hour is come for myself my heart bleeds when i think of the abject condition to which the spirit of my devoted country is beaten down when hireling plunderers riotous paupers dependant upon the purse of extorted charity to support whose wasteful luxury the labourer must sweat so much the more at his hard drudgery and return at night to so much the worse hammock and the worse meal can dare to give public utterance to such sentiments as these pamphlets contain sentiments which outrage all humanity—which   defy all shame—which breathe the most unqualified tyranny—excite to the most sanguinary persecutions—tear asunder with the utmost violence all communion and sympathy between the governing few and the governed multitude—declare open inveterate irreconcileable war on the part of the former not only against the lives properties and liberties but against the opinions feelings inclinations of the latter—uphold the horrible doctrine of exterminating opinions and enforcing creeds and ceremonies by the sword†—threaten with something more than distant hints the abrogation of every provision that stands between the life of the patriot and the vengeance of a corrupt and irritated court‡ and denounce at once a computed   number of eighty thousand people according to the authors own account the stem and flower of british intellect† to the prompt and destroying fury of a vigour beyond the law yes my heart bleeds to think that such men dare to utter such sentiments—for though i wish not to stop the current of discussion either by legal persecution or the fury of a mob yet most certainly i do wish to uphold the salutary awe of popular opinion and notwithstanding some doctrines of supposed treasons propagated in the late never to be forgotten parliament and retailed again if retail it could be called in the nine hour harangues of adair scott and mitford i shall venture to affirm that in whatever country this salutary awe does not operate not only upon the tools and dependants of government but upon the government itself even to its highest head there tyranny in its essence is already established and liberty is but a name and how is this salutary awe to be enforced by the manly energies of the people—by their active vigilance in watching the conduct of their governors and comparing it with the sentiments of their advocates and known retainers—by that intellectual   courage which dares to give utterance to whatever the heart feels and above all by that sturdy restless jealous exertion of the inalienable prerogative of reason which contends inch by inch for the great charters of birthright and nature and instead of shrinking with panic terror at every triumph of legal innovation is roused to fresh exertions by every retrenchment and exercifes with greater ardour the rights which yet remain these are the means by which a brave and enlightened people overawe their governors and compel them to exercise a wary and modest caution salutary to the nation at large and ultimately beneficial to themselves these are the true and genuine checks of a free government without these i repeat it no government can be free different shapes and modes of political institution may give to these checks a different mode of operation—a better or a worse—a more permanent or a more precarious organization but the principle is in the heart of the people and where this principle is active monarchy itself may be attempered with a degree of liberty   without it republics are but despotisms in masquerade how stands it in this country with respect to this salutary check grounded as in the ensuing letters i shall prove it to be in the essential rights of nature and the very principles of political association does the government—does the legislature—do the ministers or even the hireling scribblers of those ministers feel and acknowledge this controlling awe no the legislature the late legislature has ventured to call this overawing influence of popular opinion high treason the ministers have declared in express terms that they lay taxes on our shoulders for the support of an immense troop of cavalry to outawe this awe to destroy this check to suppress this opinion to ram it down our throats with the broad sword or drown it with the murderous roar of musquetry while greyheaded pensioned apostates—the purchased panders of official corruption bewail the pretended relaxation of all authority and call aloud for laws of more sanguinary promptitude and measures of more coercive violence† because the crown forsooth cannot destroy   at will whomsoever it chooses to arraign but retires from its courts defeated and disgraced by the groundless prosecutions with which its ministers insult the justice and the feelings of the nation could these things be—could we be thus dragooned and trampled upon—half gagged and half bullied into silence if we were the men we have been—if we inherited the spirit of those ancestors over whose honourable graves we stalk an abject and degraded progeny no the evil is here a greedy and unsocial selfishness absorbs our faculties a base timidity bows our soliciting necks to the yoke and a want of all kindness all good faith and all common justice to those who embark fairly in the common cause palsies every effort of patriotism and leaves the isolated wretch whose desperate honesty still prompts him to contend with powerful usurpation more a prey to the malignant envy of those he endeavours to serve than the persecuting violence of the clan whose corruption he has the hardihood to expose these dispositions have had more to do in prostrating the hopes and liberties of the people at the footstool of boroughmongering usurpation than all the proclamations and persecutions of the last five years backed and supported with newfangled laws of treason and sedition the   formidable legions of military associators and all the troops of fencible and yeomanry cavalry which inflate with such audacious confidence the marat of the british cabinet while these dispositions remain the cause of liberty will be retrogade the beggary and wretchedness of the multitude will continually encrease and the growing insolence of authorised plunder will exult in apparent omnipotence in short while each man continues to care for no one but himself all will be trampled and oppressed and while the friends of liberty unassociated and unendeared to each other instead of considering themselves as one common family cherish their private jealousies and forget their common interests so long will fresh projects of usurpation be formed and executed with impunity and mankind be treated like a herd of cattle but when the people recovered from their panic and roused from their insensibility shall be persuaded to compare their faculties with their condition—the  0 situation in which they are—and that in which they have a right to be—when no longer the dupes of their own mistaken selfishness they shall feel and acknowledge the importance of a persevering fortitude and yielding to that strong sense of general necessity which annihilates or at least suspends the petty factions of jealousy and envy with a generous confidence and unanimity shall resolve to demand their rights then shall the golden visions of corruption fade away and the dark mists of hovering despotism flee before the rising sun of british freedom then shall the hireling burke with the whole clan of pensioned scribblers instead of yelping thus audaciously for the blood of their fellow citizens bow with becoming awe to the tribunal of popular opinion and learn to respect the rights and the feelings not only of four hundred thousand political citizens but of seven millions of enlightened britons all conscious of their natural and civil equality all asserting their equal share in the common inheritance of rights and producing in their persons their title deeds† in the meantime let us hope that this new outrage upon the rights and feelings and security    of mankind will not be without its influence in producing the desired effect for if ever wholesale denunciations could inspire a sense of common danger—and if ever a sense of common danger had the power of knitting men together in the firm links of unanimity and common interest surely these pamphlets contain sufficient warning that we must be no longer supine selfish and divided—unless indeed we mean to be reduced to the dreadful alternative of either abandoning for ever all discussion of our rights—all hope of improving our miserable condition—all opposition to the measures of government however corrupt and tyrannical they may become or of resigning to proscription legalized massacre or hired assassination an acknowledged fifth—perhaps a third—perhaps more than half of the well informed reflecting reasoning and what is aristocratically called respectable part of the community ⚓ ✪ this i say is the plain alternative laid down by mr burke but i shall not according to his fashion satisfy myself with assertion i shall proceed to proof mr b i should premise is a very desultory and excentric writer his combustible imagination fumes and boils and bursts away like the lava from a volcano as bright and as    destructive in a thousand different directions apparently without art or design order and arrangement appear to be entirely despised proportion of parts is expressly laid down in his only elementary work to be no ingredient of the beautiful and his political publications may be regarded as illustrations of this curious doctrine tropes sentiments and propositions are every now and then starting up one knows not why or whence or wherefore   the things tis true are costly rich and rare   but wonder how the devil they got there every metaphor becomes an allegory every embellishment a digression and every digression a voluminous episode but the reader who on this account should calculate upon the artlessness of mr burkes mind would do no credit to his own penetration if this be madness there is method int in this excursive frenzy of composition there is much deep design and insidious policy he not only writes with a twofold object—but his objects are in diametrical opposition to each other it is his intention at once to instruct and to confuse even in that small proportion of the people of britain whom he calls    the british public there is a still smaller subdivision men of complete leisure and of trained political education whom he regards as the initiated few and who of course may be expected to catch up and put together many of the loose disjointed hints scattered here and there with such studied carelessness as to escape the observation of those who read as they run hence if we want to know the whole meaning and real object of this master of political controversy instead of following him through the regular succession of pages and paragraphs we must seek for the leading traits and positions of his work and then putting together the disjointed parts of the syllogism so artfully divided we must extract the enveloped conclusion for ourselves having furnished the reader with this clue let him turn to the letters p    to    or the thoughts p    to    then to the thoughts p    to    and to the letters p    to    and he will find the dilemma i have stated to be very fully unfolded that is to say he will find the pensioner of an administration which has been in the constant practice of preparing the minds of a certain class by means of the pamphlets and paragraphs of their hirelings for the promulgation of every preconcerted scheme of tyranny    and usurpation—he will find this pensioned pander—this greyheaded procurator of proscription and blood seriously recommending by the severe and unshrinking operation of some new means of persecution and force the utter extermination of every sentiment of reform—or as he very accurately though insidiously calls it change in the first of those passages above referred to mr b after observing that it cannot be concealed we are a divided people proceeds to compute and to class those who in any political view are to be called the people—in england and scotland says he i compute that those of adult age not declining in life of tolerable leisure for such discussions and of some means of information more or less and who are above menial dependence or what is virtually such may amount to about four hundred thousand letters† p    to which in his original thoughts‡ he had added—in this number i include the women who take a concern in these transactions who cannot exceed twenty thousand and thus did this preux chevalier though so furious an antagonist of the rights of man in an unguarded perhaps a tender hour    confess himself a proselyte to the rights of woman and this says he—this petty fraction of the population of england and scotland—these four hundred thousand males and females who alone of all the three or four millions of adults by whom this island is peopled have leisure for discussion or the means of any degree of information—this is the british public—this is the natural representative of the people o insulted and degraded nature—o awful aggregate of existence how is thy venerable name blasphemed by these pious canting juggling politicians by what right by what omnipotent power by what uncreating and recreating authority does this base renegade doom to political annihilation ninetenths of the adult inhabitants of a nation where are the fatecommanding locks of this painted jupiter that thus he thinks to nod away the existence of millions—where are his thunderbolts and his lightnings—but i had forgot the lightnings and the thunderbolts are all prepared windham the armed progeny of his prolific brain keeps the key of the dread arsenal and if he does but turn the massy lock the thunders roar the conflagration spreads the heavy clouds bear death and desolation on their wings and the million trembles and obeys but waving these thundering arguments and i trust    that the time is not distant when the conductors of reason will disarm them of their terrors and the tempests of ministerial fury rage innoxious upon what foundation do these calculators take a tenth for the whole and call four hundred thousand men and women the public of britain why truly—the reason is even more profligate than the assertion itself—because of our whole population not more than a tenthpart have either the leisure or the means for any degree of information more or less and is this your boasted state of civilization and refinement—is this the wealth grandeur prosperity and flourishing condition of the country—is this good order—is this government or is it grinding and murderous oppression which dooms the mass of mankind to incessant toil and comfortless assiduity and assigns the leisure and the means of any degree of information or discussion to a tenthpart only of the inhabitants and even of this tenth how large a portion are to be ranked not among the promoters but the destroyers of the prosperity so much vaunted—not among the productive labourers but among the caterpillars and locusts the blights and mildews of social industry—the placemen and the pensioners the burkes and the reeveses—unprincipled sophists hired with prodigal portions of the general    plunder to abuse calumniate and destroy the poor wretches whom this plunder reduces to starving beggary are these the institutions which mr b wishes to support are these the perfect models of social jurisprudence which it is blasphemy to approach with the unhallowed finger of innovation or reform are these in their effects the regular and orderly fabrics of the ancient legitimate government of states whose plans and materials were drawn from the old germanic or gothic custumary and of which those famous architects the civilians the jurists and the publicists have given us such flattering draughts ground plots and elevations if they are perish i say such temples of oppression and injustice away with your idle jargon of venerable antiquity—that awful but endearing epithet belongs not mr burke to grey hairs alone away with your pompous boasts of grace beauty and sublimity of swelling proportions and polished symmetry if such are the effects of these fabrics they are hateful and accursed and though crowned with corinthian capitals though hung with antique trophies of renown and adorned with offerings of ancient and modern piety they must perish they ought to perish and they    will they are augean stables that must be cleansed they are bastilles of intellect which must be destroyed they are insulting mausoleums of buried rights and are ready to totter from their base for the day of the resurrection is near at hand and the vail of the temple shall be rent in twain but no mr b you are a slanderer of the institutions you pretend to support things are not yet so bad as you represent them though if you and your confederates were suffered to proceed in your infamous career there is no knowing how soon we might sink even to a still lower state of degradation the number of those who some how or other find or make the means and opportunities of obtaining some degree of information is not yet reduced to one in ten i indeed affirm and i shall argue the right hereafter that every man and every woman and every child ought to obtain something more in the general distribution of the fruits of labour than food and rags and a wretched hammock with a poor rug to cover it and that without working twelve or fourteen hours a day six days out of seven from six to sixty—they have a claim a sacred and inviolable claim growing out of that fundamental maxim upon which alone all property can be supported to some comforts and enjoyments in addition to the necessaries of life and to some    tolerable leisure for such discussion and some means of such information as may lead to an understanding of their rights without which they can never understand their duties it is true in the present circumstances of society the mass of the people are far from the enjoyment of this right let mr b determine whether this is to be attributed to the nature or the corruption of our institutions but still notwithstanding the scandalously inadequate price of labour—wages being in many instances rather a mockery than a support—notwithstanding the unreasonable number of hours through which the labour of the day is protracted and the impediments thrown in the way of a cheap and therefore general circulation of knowledge by the duties on paper stamps on newspapers advertisements and the like yet judging of the whole country from the parts which i have seen and making all possible allowances for the difference of local and adventitious advantages mr b will not be able to contract his new aristocracy of thinkers and discoursers into any thing like the narrow circle of four hundred thousand this champion for the few to the exclusion of the many—this advocate for the noble and the gentle at the expence of the useful and the honest may exult as much as he pleases in the luxuriancy of his imagination his various stores of learning and of science his  0 hours of literary leisure and his familiar intercourse with the wits and literati of half a century but there are hundreds nay thousands in those classes excluded from his calculation who though they could neither endite nor comprehend his learned metaphors and dashing periods would yet blush at such flimsy sophisms as he sometimes covers with a cloud of splendour and with the weapons of plain solid socratic argument would beat half a dozen such combatants out of the arena i could point him to whole companies whole neighbourhoods nay    almost whole professions of labouring manufacturers who understand the principles of government much better than himself and who want nothing but practical fluency to render them most formidable antagonists to the whole college of aristocratical declaimers the fact is that monopoly and the hideous accumulation of capital in a few hands like all diseases not absolutely mortal carry in their own enormity the seeds of cure man is by his very nature social and communicative—proud to display the little knowledge he possesses and eager as opportunity presents to encrease his store whatever presses men together therefore though it may generate some vices is favourable to the diffusion of knowledge and ultimately promotive of human liberty hence every large workshop and manufactory is a sort of political society which no act of parliament can silence and no magistrate disperse socrates therefore the first democratical lecturer mentioned in history and the founder of the unsophisticated and unrestricted system of sansculotte philosophy when he wished to expose the corruption and venality of the times and those false tenets and opinions which were contrary to the happiness of the human race† acted consistently with his    high character for wisdom and penetration in visiting among other places of résort the shops where workmen assembled to pursue their vocations—he began says the biographer to oppose sophistry and superstition with success and to teach his fellow citizens wisdom and virtue in the open streets in the public walks and baths in private houses in the workshops of artists or wherever he found men whom he could make better he entered into conversation with them explained what was right and wrong good and evil holy and unholy c the nature and tendency of these conversations we learn from a variety of passages we are particularly informed that such was his intrepid zeal for the promotion of truth and the assertion of human liberty that as soon as any opinion or superstition occasioned an open violence the invasion of the natural rights of man or the corruption of their morals no threats or persecution could deter him from declaring against it† and again we find that when a senate of tyrants a vile and detestable oligarchy‡ assisted by an armed force and a foreign alliance trampled on the rights and liberties of the athenian people and exercised an authority beyond the law—robbing the most upright men of the republic of their property and    their lives under the pretext of punishing rebellion and treasonable offences banishing others and driving many more to seek for peace and safety in voluntary emigration in the midst of these persecutions and proscriptions socrates was found as usual in the places of public resort—in the workshops of the artists and among the labourers in their manufactories uttering seditious allegories and condemning the desolating tyranny of the oligarchy it is wonderful indeed he is reported to have said if shepherds make the herd which is entrusted to their care grow smaller and more meagre and yet shall not be accounted bad shepherds but it is still more wonderful if the guardians of a state make its subjects grow fewer and worse that they should not be accounted bad guardians†    now though every workshop cannot have a socrates within the pale of its own society nor even every manufacturing town a man of such wisdom virtue and opportunities to instruct them yet a sort of socratic spirit will necessarily grow up wherever large bodies of men assemble each brings as it were into the common bank his mite of information and putting it to a sort of circulating usance each contributor has the advantage of a large interest without any diminution of capital but such men i shall be told are out of the question let their capacities their acquirements their understandings be what they may they form no part of the british public they are in a state of menial dependance or what is virtually such—dependance and independance fine distinctions but in what do they consist    are they to be sought in the station or in the mind do wealth and rank give independance does industrious poverty of necessity degrade the man an anecdote shall settle these questions during the late election at nottingham one of the principal manufacturers of that place who had always deprecated with great severity the present war and the whole system of ministerial measures was observed of a sudden to become reserved and wavering the ministerial candidate had concerns with a banking house which by means of acceptances discounts and the like was exceedingly useful to him in his large dealings dr crompton was a candidate for the people but he had no connection with any bank but that of virtue and patriotism and their notes you know are not current in commercial transactions the wealthy manufacturer deliberated—he doubted—he calculated—he resolved to vote for the ministerial champion he determined to canvass for him william said he to one of his journeymen i hope you mean to vote for mr smith—no sir replied the menial dependant indeed i do not i am surprised you should ask me such a question however if you are not independent i am this however i am aware will be no argument ad hominem as they call it to mr b it will rather enflame than moderate his prejudices he will regard    it as a flagrant act of jacobinism and insubordination an overtact of treason against the sovereignty of wealth a revolt of enterprising talent against property i grant also that this argument will not universally apply though some men have energy of mind enough to act in this independant way upon such occasions many under such circumstances feel themselves compelled to bow during the same nottingham election an instance of this sort occurred which to minds of a particular stamp at least cannot fail to be interesting a poor manufacturer who was past his best days and to whom therefore it was of serious consequence to be dismissed from an established shop—especially as he had a large family to support—was pressed by his employer in very authoritative terms to vote for this same mr smith he hesitated but the very sustenance of his family was at stake and he yielded going up to the hustings and having given in his name he was asked by the pollclerk for whom he voted why i have two votes have i not—you have—well then i give one of them to mr smith—but thats not mine its my masters the others my own and ill give that to dr crompton—for hes the man for the people—thank    you my good friend exclaims the courtly candidate—thank you for me let me have the pleasure of shaking hands with you—no im d—d if i do replied the voter i was obliged to vote for you but i ant obliged to shake hands with you neither but ill shake hands with you dr crompton for i gave it you from my heart mr b may despise the sansculotism displayed in this anecdote—and i am certainly no enemy to soothing manners and decorum—but yet such energy of mind however rudely fashioned is of ten thousand times more real worth than all the polished periods of pensioned apostacy and all the dressed up smiles that ever flickered on the curled lips of obsequious courtiers and whatever sentiments a master of the ceremonies might entertain upon the subject he is but a shallow politician who excludes such men from the account in his calculations of the weight and force of opinion such men have not it is true all the advantages of free agency—so much the worse for britain the generality of them have no votes at all and many who have are under coercion in the exercise of their privilege—so    much the greater scandal to justice and humanity but though they have not votes they have opinions they are a part of the british public even of mr burkes informed discussing garrulous public upon which more than the legal constituent the artificial representative is supposed falsely supposed to depend† an oppressive    combination of employers the cold grasp of penury or the brutal violence of a madheaded drunken profligate magistrate armed for the sake of the constitutional system of checks with the united powers of the police and of the sword may suppress for awhile the due influence of this opinion but ultimately it will have its weight and its weight will be greatest when its exertion is of most importance in the mean time it has a degree of influence even now though not in its natural and rightful place—that assembly which calls itself the commons house of parliament—the honourable and right honourable members of which as we are expressly told are in such a state of menial dependance or what is virtually such that the votes of the majority are directly opposite to their dispositions but it has its influence—a powerful influence upon the resources of the country upon the expence and the facility of filling the ranks of the army and upon the spirit of enthusiasm in the day of battle it has its influence also on the pillow of the minister where it requires no secondsight to perceive that it haunts his imagination and disturbs his slumbers there in prophetic visions it foretels the sad catastrophe of his ambition and points out in the  0 continuance of this war the means of british renovation the approaching failure of the funding system the demurs of moneylenders and the prudent desertion of those life and fortune men who repenting the madness of merchant taylors hall and finding the bankrupt state no longer competent to support at once the burthen of public credit and the enormous prodigality of the present system will be obliged to abandon the boroughmongers to preserve their property to appease this opinion to lay this wandering ghost of popular discontent the simulator pitt has drawn once more around him this magic circle of delusion with charms and spells of pretended negociation and backward mutters of arrogance and recantation but lift up your voices ye artificers ye mechanics ye manufacturers of the land ye genuine props and pillars of the nation be not amused with pretended treaties for what is a peace but war to you while ye drudge in servile misery for inadequate rewards and your families pine in want and ignorance wear not    your lungs with sighs and sullen murmurs—let not only the nocturnal phantom but the living body of your complaints appear before your oppressors try once more the manly energies of reason and tell them with a clear and decided tone that peace is not peace without reform that your discontents can never be allayed without the restoration of equal rights and equal laws and the adoption of a pure and independant organ through which the opinions not of a tenthpart but of the whole nation can be freely delivered and distinctly heard but no we are told the nation wants no such organ the opinions of the menial dependant mass must be taken for granted from those of their betters in those more reputable orders in that privileged four hundred thousand who by virtue of their situation have an exclusive licence to enquire and to discuss the people have already a natural representative natural representative—of what excellent use in the science of confusing mankind is this prerogative of coining new phrases natural representative of the people the people itself as the word is here used is an artificial or corporate body—for it means the aggregate population of a particular state or body politic and how there can be a natural representative of an artificial corporation i am yet to learn i can understand indeed that the parent    is the natural representative of his infant children armed with the right and bound by the duty of judging and acting for them i can also understand that children are the natural representatives of a departed parent and as such are entitled to those portions of the produce of his labour which have neither been consumed by him nor legally set apart to support the profligate luxury of placemen and pensioners but how it should happen that four hundred thousand people men and women from the mere accident of living in more comfort and with less toil should be the natural representatives of three or four millions of other fullgrown—fullaged beings of the same structure and faculty with themselves but to whom they have neither relationship nor affinity and as such should be entitled to act for them speak for them think for them and almost eat for them for even this privilege is scarcely left to the personal exercise of the million is a problem which the jurists and publicists must solve for i give it up entirely but mr bs nature and mine are widely different with him every thing is natural that has the hoar of ancient prejudice upon it and novelty is the test of crime in my humble estimate nothing is natural but what is fit and true and can endure the test of reason with him the feudal system and all its barbarous tyrannical    and superstitious appendages is natural with him all the gaudy cumbrous fustian of the old germanic or gothic custumary is natural and all the idolatrous foppery and degrading superstition of the church of rome are natural also nay with him that detestable traffic in blood and murder—that barter of groans and tortures and long long lingering deaths of shrieking anguish the slave trade is also natural nor do i doubt that with equal facility and upon the very same principles as he maintains the masters and employers of this country to be the natural representatives of the workmen they employ he could prove also those very humane and very very respectable beings who as they walk upon two legs i shall continue to call men by courtesy i mean the west india planters and their negro drivers to be the natural representatives of those poor harassed halfstarved whipgalled miserable slaves whom they also employ in their farms and factories in short this champion of the privileged orders adopts most unequivocally the principle of this similitude having assigned the exclusive privilege of opinion to the favoured four hundred thousand—a mixed herd of nobles and gentles placemen pensioners and courtexpectants of bankers and merchants manufacturers lawyers parsons    and physicians warehousemen and shopkeepers pimps and kings messengers fiddlers and auctioneers with the included twenty thousand petticoat allies—ladies of the court and ladies of the town—having secured this motley groupe the favoured progeny of means and leisure in the exclusive and unquestioned enjoyment of the rights of information and discussion he proceeds to observe that the rest when feeble are the objects of protection—objects of protection—so are my ladys lapdog and the negro slave it is easy to determine which of the two polished sensibility will shelter with the most anxious care—ye murky walls and foul strawlittered floors of the plantation hospital ye fullcrammed noxious workhouses of britain—vile dens of tyrannic penury and putrescence speak—speak i charge ye for that part of nature which should be loud and eloquent is spellbound in panic apathy—speak what is the protection which the feeble labourer or the sick negro finds and then refer for a comparison to the down pillow of yon pampered snarling cur or the commodious chambers of the canine palace at godwood—but    to return to the description—the rest when feeble are the objects of protection—when strong they are the means of force† so is the drayhorse and the poor ass that drudges in yon sandcart so are the bludgeon and the pistol with which under existing circumstances every man at least every marked obnoxious man will do well to be provided as preservatives against assassination‡ but foul befal the man and foul befal the government that considers the great mass of the people as mere brute machines insensate instruments of physical force deprived of all power and destitute of all right of reason or information doomed like the drayhorse or the musquet to perform mechanically whatever task of drudgery or murder a few counsellers and deliberators may command and yet mr b    tells us that they who affect to consider that part of us to wit ninetenths of the adult population of the country in any other point of view insult while they cajole us such my fellowcitizens is the language of insolence itself personified in the character of a pensioned prostitute nine out of ten of the human race it will anon be nineteen out of twenty are born to be beasts of burthen to the remaining tythe to be hewers of wood and drawers of water—to be exposed to heat and cold winds and waters rocks and tempests for these privileged masters and finally to be listed as soldiers for battle to defend or to aggrandise a country in which they have neither voice nor right and he who dares to assert their claim to any tolerable leisure for discussion or means of information—he who dares to maintain their pretensions to opinion or title to be regarded in any political view as a part of the people is an hypocritical jacobin incendiary revolts against the sovereignty of wealth and insults while he cajoles us such is the language of a man to whom our government gives a yearly pension of four thousand pounds for distracting the world with the ravings of bedlam and the filthy loquacity of the stews in    favour of aristocratic despotism and beating the tough hide of old zisca to animate europe to eternal battle but beware mr burke and you his hypocritical employers how ye cajole and insult us too far abuses when discovered inspire the sober wish of peaceful and rational reform but when wrong is added to wrong and coercion to coercion when remonstrance is answered by the goad and the yoke and insult is heaped upon oppression reason may be overpowered and madness may succeed and the philanthropic few who admonish in vain may deplore the destiny from which they cannot preserve you in vain do you shudder at the cannibals† of paris—in vain do you colour with exaggerated horrors the tribunals of maroon and negro slaves covered with the blood of their masters‡ if obstinately vicious instead of being warned ye are irritated by the example i deplore as you do the robberies and the murders of these poor wretches—the blind instruments of instinctive vengeance but i cannot like you forget by whom those lessons of    murderous rapacity were taught i cannot forget that slavery itself is robbery and murder and that the master who falls by the bondsmans hand is the victim of his own barbarity i am no apologist for the horrible massacres of revenge whether perpetrated by negroes by monarchs or by mobs i abhor revenge vengeance mr burke with me is crime all retrospective principle is crime and to its crime adds folly in your own sort of language i should say—we were made with our eyes in our foreheads that we might look onward to the future not linger upon that which can never be recalled give me security for the future i will dispense with what is called justice for the past but we are not to expect whole nations whether of maroon negroes or vassals of feudal tyranny to become of a sudden so entirely speculative revenge it cannot be concealed is a rude instinct common to all animated being which nothing but deep reflection and well digested principles can eradicate it is an instinct also when it dares to shew itself strongest in the most feeble fiercest in the most submissive and most fruitful in the steril soil of ignorance the bleak frost of severity nourishes it to wild luxuriance it perishes beneath the warm manure of kindness it is a wild growth of nature it is true but it is fatally cherished by authoritative example and if tyrants will teach    bloody lessons it is unreasonable in them to complain of the aptitude of their scholars add to which mr b this detestable vice is one of the virtues of the ancient and venerable part of that religion you so anxiously uphold the maxim of forgiveness to enemies is comparatively a modern innovation which accounts for its being so seldom practised by governments or priests eye for eye and tooth for tooth will not satisfy them theirs are the dread instructions which being taught return to plague the inventors theirs indeed too generally are the crimes unprovoked the crimes of revolutionists are only the crimes of revenge had the maroons and negroes never been most wickedly enslaved their masters had never been murdered had the chains of france been less galling they had never fallen so heavy on the heads of french oppressors to avoid their fate let governors avoid their crimes to render sanguinary revolutions impossible let them yield to temperate reforms to avert a dreaded vengeance let the provocations of injustice be instantly removed and the padlock from the mouth of an injured people be transferred to the lips of pensioned insolence but the politician of beaconsfield the doctor of the constitution—or rather the doctors doctor has found a shorter way—the cautery  0 and the knife are more sovereign than the emollient and the balm extermination even of eighty thousand men of talent and capacity is more easy than reform desolation itself is not to ministerial ears a word of such ill sound as change and jacobins and reformers are therefore to be submitted to the severe and awful operation in a manner that will expose the crown to no sort of danger of again retiring disgraced and defeated from its courts of these four hundred thousand political citizens says he i look upon onefifth or about eighty thousand to be pure jacobins utterly incapable of amendment objects of eternal vigilance c on these no reason no argument no example no venerable authority can have the slightest influence they desire—what a change and they will have it if they can—true and they ought to have it and they must or the nation is undone for ever if all are jacobins who wish for a change mr b most miserably underrates the jacobins of this country some wish for a greater change and others for a less there are i fear almost as many different opinions among reformers as to the extent of that change as there were among the allies about the objects of that ever to be renowned and glorious confederacy of kings by being chief    trumpeter to which—or more properly speaking drummajor for we must not forget old zisca mr burke has accumulated so considerable a portion of spoil at so small an expence of danger but barring the idle terrors which state jugglers keep so alertfully alive by repeating at due intervals and with due solemnity the cabalistic words french massacres republicans and levellers horrid atheists dreadful anarchy bloody regicides cannibal philosophy and the like i believe there is scarcely a single reflecting man unconnected by interest or expectation with existing corruptions who does not in some degree wish a change but says mr b england has been happy and change is a word of ill sound to happy ears—england has been happy—perhaps so england was not always infested with such a pestiferous swarm of placemen and pensioners boroughmongers and contractors as at this time devour the harvests and blast the smiling verdure of the year will mr b pretend to say that england is happy now will he pretend to say that even that small portion that tythe which he calls the british public are happy at this time and if they were what    right has a tenth part to be happy at the expence of the misery of all the rest but can even these be called happy are those middle classes which we middling people are apt so selfishly and so wickedly to consider as the whole—are even they happy alas alas how dismal the reverse ye tradesmen ye manufacturers ye noiseless proficients in the arts the sciences and the gainful branches of learning the bulk and mass of all those callings and professions nicknamed respectable tell me—tell the world can ye look in the innocent faces of your children and contemplating the prospect before them say that ye are happy can ye look upon your own condition your blighted prospects and your stinted comforts and even barring future prospects say ye are happy alas how many of you are at this very time descending and how rapidly down the ladder of degradation a few i grant it prosper a few swell to uncontroulable pride and incalculable affluence the more is your disaster to be like tantalus in a lake of misery with the prospect of abundance constantly before our eyes and never taste it is to be doubly lost but what is the condition of the mass—your    little mass i mean as for the great mass—it is trampled in the dust and is forgotten how many of you have been obliged to relinquish your little country house or country lodging—sweet recreations of health and pleasure which at once prolonged existence and decked it with a ruddier smile from the tables of how many has the taxgatherer snatched the cheering wine how many many a family that once basked in the inner has been pushed to the outer circles of this temperate zone how many from these outer circles have been thrust into the chill regions of penurious labour and how many thousands upon whose moderate toil the sidelong sun once cast his cheering gleams now shiver at the dark bleak poles of comfortless distress if then our happiness be reduced to a mere has been this terrible change is the burthen of a dirge rather than a word of omen and must impress us rather with plaintive than terrific sensations we might therefore with strict propriety dismiss the subject in mr bs own style by declaring that the objection will not apply and put it out of court accordingly ordering that so far as that goes the counsel for existing abuses take nothing by his motion but the counsel in this cause is a deep politician    he can practice popular arts against the people his motion was not made with any view to the decision of that high court of reason to which he appealed but for the sake of the general impression expected from the mere motion itself change is a word of ambiguous meaning and under certain circumstances the worst construction is sure to be put upon every ambiguity it should be remembered therefore that change revolution and reform are but modifications of the same idea though the last by established courtesy is the most unequivocally admitted in a favourable sense reform is a change or revolution from bad to good every usurpation and every concession is a change every alteration of the law the repeal of an old act or the passing of a new one is a change the whole history of government is nothing but a record of changes or revolutions gradual or sudden and the worst revolutions are those that are never called so in short abstractedly considered there is nothing terrible in change or revolution violence and cruelty are to be abhorred humanity is to be loved and cherished first and greatest of all virtues parent of all blessings fountain of all social joys it is to be wooed and fostered and reverenced with the fondest care to be clasped to the breast and entwined with the very texture of the heart—only to be torn away    with the last dearest fibre but when violence and cruelty are established—when they are surrounded by privileges and fortified by power revolution itself becomes humanity and justice the question then is what sort of a change do we desire does mr b mean to say that onefifth of the people of that class which he regards as the british public desires a change of tumult ferocious anarchy and slaughter—o woeful britain if this were indeed the case for there would scarcely be a paper partition between thee and the flames of the most hideous desolation but if by change he means as i do redress of grievances and reform of longgrowing corruptions i repeat it not a fifth but fourfifths of the thinking part of the community do in their hours of sanity when the tertian of alarm subsides wish for such a change and when i look around on the condition of my country and the scandalous abuses of government proud am i to be considered among the distinguished eighty thousand not the least obnoxious to mr b and his new employers after having thus indulged his indolence in a little faint and dubious colouring the artist however presently returns to his old dashing style if they cannot have this change which they desire by english cabal says he they will    make no sort of scruple of having it by the cabal of france into which already they are virtually incorporated thus all reformers are jacobins and all jacobins are of the french faction virtually incorporated with that nation and willing to secure the change they wish by foreign interference as for virtual incorporation or virtual presence whether in a wafer or a confederacy they are mysteries which i profess i do not understand mr b perhaps could explain the one and some of our good allies might write commentaries on the other but i am not curious about occult sciences and i shall only observe that if the french republic derives no greater benefit from our virtual incorporation than the grand confederacy from the virtual cooperation of the empress of russias manifestoes it would be most gratuitous prodigality in government to be at any further expence for special commissions and trials for high treason for my own part at least i have no objection to avow all the incorporation i am conscious of with french jacobinism i do confess that so long as i imagined it even possible for the republic to be overthrown no prospect was accompanied with equal anguish for notwithstanding the many adventitious horrors which have clouded the revolution i regarded it as a great and glorious effort for the    emancipation and moral improvement of the human race but the thought has long ceased to agitate my mind the republic stands upon a rock and æolus may blow till he cracks his cheeks but all the blasts of his eloquence will never shake it we must have miracles or all is safe the fluices of heaven must be opened and the waters of the great deep be broken up for nothing less than a general deluge can destroy it as for english reform by foreign cabal i shall only observe that i hold with respect to england the same doctrines that i held with respect to france i deny mr bs law of vicinage altogether and shall reply to his sophisms in another letter in the mean time i would have the reformers of all nations keep for ever in their minds the monitory remembrance that hatred may be forced but love cannot that chains may be imposed but freedom must be acquired—in other words that no country can have freedom which cannot obtain it for itself and that foreign interference can only at best produce a change of masters    but this is by the way all i have to do at present with mr bs charge is to shew the point of view in which he regards or pretends to regard the opinions of eighty thousand of those people of britain who by virtue of their pecuniary situations are licenced to think on politics this together with what he says of the talents and capacities of these men will form the first branch of what i shall venture to call burkes new syllogism of massacre i have a good opinion says he of the general abilities of the jacobins—in his very last publication they were a herd of fools aspiring to be knaves and the reader cannot have forgotten his vehement declamations at the beginning of the contest with france against the vilest the most despicable the most ignorant of mankind who unlike the english revolutionists of the last century—for they were men of genius and intelligence—that was a struggle of talents for their natural ascendency—a transfer of power from the aristocracy of birth to the aristocracy of mind but these men on the contrary had overthrown all distinctions and transferred dominion not to the wisdom and the intellect but to the folly and ignorance of the nation† but now i    have a good opinion of the general abilities of jacobins who knows but that byeandby he may take another turn and entertain a good opinion of their principles change is with him no inconsistency mr b and the weathercock are only out of character when they are fixed strong passions says he awaken the faculties they suffer not a particle of the man to be lost the spirit of enterprise gives to this description the full use of all their native energies and again in his second letter†—it is a dreadful truth but it is a truth that cannot be concealed in ability in dexterity in the distinctness of their views the jacobins are our superiors they saw the thing right from the very beginning c—such is the picture drawn by this sublime politician of that great and formidable minority not gentle reader the whig minority of the house of commons of whom he wishes to put the men of family and property in terror that he may put them into blood to complete the picture in the true style and colouring of alarm he adds i do not know whether if i aimed at the total overthrow  0 of a kingdom i should wish to be encumbered with a larger body of partizans they are more easily disciplined and directed than if the number were greater nay and so disciplined and so directed does he conceive us to be that he ascribes to us a sort of omnipresence and supernatural power of metamorphosis—passing from place to place with incredible velocity and diversifiying our character and description so as to be capable of mimicking the general voice† and what has all this to do you will naturally enquire with the argument against a regicide peace will the government by exhausting the resources of the nation be better enabled to struggle against such a faction admitting its existence will the increase of burthens the beggary misery and consequent discontents growing out of the prolongation of war make such a faction less formidable though not anxious myself for peace i argue the question openly and fairly in cases so momentous there ought to be no disguise would the unthinking the desperate the fickle and the wavering be the less likely to fall into the hands and be rendered instrumental to the views of such men from the accumulating miseries which from such prolongation    must inevitably result mr b is not such an ideot as to believe it his hyperbolical statement might indeed supernaturally account for a general exclamation without admitting a general desire for peace supposing indeed that such general exclamation had been raised but this i deny the moderates the patchworkmen—placehunters and dupes of placehunters wish for peace i believe and such of the monied men as have no advantage from loans and contracts or as dread the consequences of a fresh loan but as for the jacobins—indeed mr burke maugre all your profound penetration they are very indifferent about the matter they know as you do that peace under existing circumstances could only be a hollow truce that the overburthened labourer would still continue to be taxed for enormous sums to be squandered in foreign intrigue to disturb the tranquillity and irritate the government of france and that what now stands for a government in england    i mean pitt and hawkesburys discordant cabal has injured the french republic too outrageously ever to forgive it in short they know that there is no peace for europe so long as the unnatural alliance between the funding system and the boroughmongering system lasts and that therefore any thing in how questionable a shape soever it may come would be ultimately a blessing that should bring this unnatural alliance to the crisis of a divorce sooner or later this crisis i believe must come and when it does come perish the boroughmongers i say for one and let the public creditor be secured—in other words let corruption be destroyed—let plunderers and ruffians be dismissed from power let pensions be abolished sinecures be totally abrogated and the salaries of all offices reduced to a level with the mere necessary expences of the table and the library of a man of science and public business let simplicity and virtue be substituted for ostentatious debauchery and thus let the peasant and the manufacturer be redeemed from misery and at the same time the thousands and tens of thousands of virtuous families whose wellearned competence is now vested in government securities be preserved from hideous ruin thus it is and only thus that the joint object can be attained and the jarring interests    of the stockholder and the productive labourer be united but if mr bs extravagant picture of british jacobinism has nothing to do with the argument on regicide peace it has something to do with that which is of infinitely more importance it has something to do with our palladium trial by jury it has something to do with all the yetremaining fences of our little little liberty—with all that stands between the head of the patriot and the axe of ministerial vengeance but take it not upon credit trust not to my assertion read the book yourselves—or rather the books for the parts in which they differ and the parts in which they agree are equally important to the just display of the temper and views with which they were composed consider the whole compare together the respective parts and if ever you execrate again the names of robespierre and marat without glowing with superior detestation for edmund burke it is only because it is in the nature of man that reason should be the fool of imagination and that guilt should lose its guiltiness in our eyes when impotence prevents the perpetration of its malice hear for example his affected lamentations over the total relaxation of all authority    the inefficiency of tribunals the backwardness of whose most essential members the juries i suppose he means to execute the bloody mandates of a minister is described with insidious obscurity as a disowning of the government see also his furious attack upon the house of lords because that highest tribunal of all would not indulge his rhetorical spleen with the condemnation of warren hastings there was no evidence it is true no case made out but what of that mr burke can have no idea of the reason and equity and justice of that severe and aweful—living law to which he so pompously appeals unless trial and condemnation are one and the same thing and accusation sentence and execution follow each other with as mechanical a certitude as the conclusions of a mathematical problem result from its premises—without this it is dead and putrid insufficient to save the state but potent to infect and to kill but the very storm and tempest of his rage are reserved for the treasonable acquittals—for treason it seems it was that we should be acquitted that lords and commons should have joined together in votes of prejudication—that ministers    and crown lawyers should have projected and planned such elaborate prosecutions and twisted and twined and distorted all law and common sense till the very statutes of the realm and the english language itself were turned inside out and logic and jurisprudence walked topsyturvy like the captive king of the antipodeans in chrononhotonthologos—that his own most sublime and inventive genius should have been employed in arranging drawing out garbelling and embellishing reports of secret committees—that courts of special commission should have been adorned with such pomp and circumstance—bedlam bridewell and the stews so ransacked for collateral evidence and natures loose analogies explored for moonshine links of unconnected facts that judges counsel and witnesses should have been so well chosen and so well paid† and juries    so carefully selected with such due proportions on each pannel of contractors police magistrates and tradesmen to the royal family and yet after all that we should come off with our heads upon our shoulders and the crown retire disgraced and defeated from its courts with only the solitary ambiguous consolation of executing one of its own spies—this   is grief too fierce for nerves like his to bear   and claims the horrors of a last despair he raves till he foams again like a wounded elephant his enemies having escaped he turns his fury upon his friends—upon himself—upon those very pavillions and edifices of state he was armed and caparisoned to defend and four dread pages† of splendid ruins are covered over with froth and blood    the highest tribunal of all is deprived of all dignity and efficiency—public prosecutions are become little better than schools for treason of no use but to improve the dexterity of criminals i e reformers in the mystery of evasion i e of avoiding the society of perjured spies to shew with what complete impunity men may conspire against the common wealth that is to say in plain english against the corruptions of a gang of boroughmongers—the plunder of a hord of placemen and pensioners to shew with what safety assassins may attempt its awful head there is a gradation it seems in honourable obloquy but surely we are now at the ladders top mr windham made us whitewashed felons lord grenville stained us with moral guilt and mr b has dubbed us assassins it would be curious to know what epithet this gentleman would give to those ruffians mostly in the pay of government who were concerned in the meditated attempted massacres of lynn and yarmouth—in the mean time i wonder how juries relish these things but it matters not they are not to be used any more i suppose on such occasions having exhausted his stock of newgate wit the metaphorical proteus now turns his hand to medicine and surgery and cures low fevers with amputation and the caustic it must be confessed    however that his language is sufficiently scientific whilst the distempers of a relaxed fibre prognosticate and prepare all the morbid force of convulsion in the body of the state the steadiness of the physician is overpowered c the doctor of the constitution shrinks from his own operation he doubts and questions the salutary but critical terrors of the cautery and the knife the doctor thus disgraced anon he becomes a soldier learns the brunswick march and takes a poor credit even from defeat then again he is an eulogist a politician a lawyer a resurrectionman dealing in rotten carcases a jurist a letterfounder and a printers devil an engrosser of parchment rolls and an engraver of brazen tablets and all in one single page and now he is a dancing master whimsically enough employed in bowing to the enemy abroad which it is sagaciously remarked is not the way to subdue the conspirator who is breaking the fiddle at home having displayed these harlequin tricks in his own person he proceeds to try his dagger of lath upon other objects in ten little lines anarchy is a rattlesnake a focus endowed with magnetic powers a venomous and blighting insect that    blasts and shrivels and burns up the promise of the year occasions salutary and beautiful institutions to yield dust and smut and turns the harvest of the law to stubble at last to crown the whole tired of agriculture and natural history and having panted round the whole circle of metaphor he returns like a hare to the squat he started from takes up his old profession of physic again and gives us an emetic of pustles and blotches and eruptive diseases which sink in and reappear by fits the malady however which is now under his care whatever it may be has somehow or other a conversable faculty—a sort of intellectual fuel which holds treasonable correspondence with the source of regicide and cunningly waits for the favourable moment of a freer communication to exert and to encrease its force this is really the most intelligent artful intriguing philosophising disease i ever heard of what a loss to the readers of medical transactions that the doctor has not favoured us with its name its diagnosis and the peculiar characteristics of its exterior symptoms wonderful man most incongruous and most brilliant phenomenon of genius how hast thou the power to make even nonsense fascinating and give charms to sheer malevolence thou art indeed a compound at once strange and terrible  0 but it must be confessed thou art an entertaining mongrel full of beauty and of ferocity as the royal beast of bengal and driven onward by the same blind impulse of rage and ravin—thy hideous roar is ever prophetic of blood but the tyger is frequently lost in the ape and indignation is disarmed by splendid absurdity—while the tricks and antics of a wild extravagant frantic imagination have a sort of witching charm that defies the sober severity of judgment and occasions even the absurdity itself to be accepted as a sort of atonement for the depravity we should else abhor but let us not forget—for if we should there are others who will remember that these tropes and metaphors and allegories however wild and incoherent in themselves all point to one determinate object—all lead to one conclusion namely that the eighty thousand jacobins more or less who are so firmly grounded in the truth and purity of their sentiments that no sophistical reasoning no hackney argument of prejudice or corruption no example of government spies caught in their own vile nooze no venerable authority can have the slightest influence upon them and whose conduct is so strictly consonant with benevolence and justice that when the crown that is to say the minister    brings them before a jury howsoever selected and of whomsoever composed it retires from its courts defeated and disgraced—that these detestable jacobins—these eighty thousand criminals against whom no crime can be proved—these conspirators who never yet conspired—these assassins whose only dagger is reason and whose only sword is truth—the meridian sun itself being their dark lanthorn and publicity their only cloak—these are to be submitted to the prompt execution of the cautery and the knife to be cut and burnt away like warts from the eruptive body all all who dare to complain though oppression were heaped upon oppression till it oertoppd olympus—all all who dare to wish for change though tyranny grew black as thickest night and corruption stank in our very pottage all are to be swept away jurors unless juries can be regulated by some new fashion must no more be trusted with such conspirators for jurors are conspirators themselves—the acquittal of the conspirators is a proof of the extent to which the conspiracy had spread juries will not do our present tribunals are not efficient they were instituted    for the purpose of chastising criminal acts—they cannot reach opinions with sufficient certainty—but the sword can out the word came and it never went back nor ever can get back mr b indeed soon repented that he had let it out and endeavoured to recal it but in vain it had escaped into the hands of mr owen and by means of a fortunate quarrel between the apostate politician and the apostate bookseller behold—we have it it is before the world it is in print the type is black and legible and both the letter and the spirit are clear i have formerly heard says he† with more surprise than satisfaction that opinions are things out of human jurisdiction—that you can never extirpate opinion without extirpating a whole nation he then proceeds to argue both the practicability and the propriety of this forcible extirpation maintaining the justice of war against opinion‡ and even affirming in round terms when i am told it is a war of opinions i am told it is the most important of all wars§ he does not however neglect the opportunity of exposing the inconsistency of his antagonists i am glad he does not i    would not have the intemperance or the injustice of either party spared all persecution from whatever quarter it come and i call all war upon opinion all prosecution for opinion persecution is equally detestable nay if the thing in itself is capable of aggravation that aggravation it receives when it is appealed to by the friends of liberty let priests and tyrants take shelter in their inquisitions their starchambers and their courts of law where their blind deity with the twoedged sword uplifts her scales in pageant mockery but strikes as power directs we have a goddess of more perfect organ—farseeing reason of steadier balance and unweaponed hand but yet of force that cannot fail of victory if we have faith and trust in her omnipotence why should any advocate for freedom have lost his temper or his consistency on account of any nonsense which mr reeves might choose or be hired to write about the trunk or the branches of a rotten tree in the name of wonder what can we wish for more than that such talents should be employed in such a cause i at least have never suspected mr reeves of being one who if the thames were a fire would know where to run for water to put out the flames but if ever it should please the gods to enable him to write any thing worth answering let us hope that pen ink and paper will not be wanting write away then    justice reeves and support your cause scalp headless wights with grubstreet tomahawks and indite new thoughts for men who never think i meanwhile proceed to examine the arguments of your more potent coadjutor as to the mere matter of extirpation says he of all kinds of opinions whether right or wrong without the extirpation of a people†—o certainly it is not necessary to extirpate the whole people cut but the throats of that portion of a people who hold the obnoxious opinion—saint bartholomise them—nay that informed discussing portion of them—that awakened able energetic band such as the proscribed eighty thousand of this country over whom no example however terrible no venerable authority can have the slightest influence—do but bartholomise them and the business appears to be done and this says the oracle of aristocratical abhorrence of massacre and cruelty—this is a thing so very common that would be clouded and obscured rather than illustrated by examples mr b was very much in the right to save himself from the confusion in which particular statements would have involved him by this round and general assertion for certainly if he had    come to close quarter with facts none of the particular statements would have answered his purpose certainly the massacre of the protestants by the humane and politic old despotism of france would not though for this our serious machiavel for the italian did but jest could perhaps assign a reason the thing was not thoroughly done it is true that the grand monarque having determined to exert a vigour beyond the law and having given orders accordingly there were killed in the city of paris that day and the next above ten thousand whereof above five hundred were barons knights and gentlemen who were purposely met together from all parts to honour the king of navars marriage—it is true gasper de coligny the famous admiral one of the leaders of the hugonots was pulled out of the stable and cruelly abused by the fury of the common people this was a royalist mob—a mob hired instigated marshalled by the regular constituted government who detesting his very name tore his head from his shoulders cut off his hands and dragging him through the streets to the place of execution left him hanging by    one of his feet upon the gallows and a few days after these were royalist cannibals they set fire to it upon the same gallows half burning it with barbarous rejoicings their cruelty finding no end till two servants of the mareshal de momorancy stole away the relics of his miserable carcase and buried them secretly at chantilly it is true also that the day before this terrible execution the king dispatched posts into divers parts of the kingdom commanding the governors of cities and provinces to do the like—it is true that on the same night at meaux and the days ensuing at orleans rouën bourges angiers thoulouse and many other places but above all at lyons there was a most bloody slaughter of the hugonots without any respect of age or sex or quality of persons but it is true also that through the great extent and out of the whole population of france there were only forty thousand men women and children put to the sword there ought to have been eighty thousand reasoning discoursing enquiring adults even if the population of france had only equalled that of britain hence perhaps it was that hugonot jacobinism and hugonot infidelity or hugonot heresy—for with established priests they are essentially the same instead of being extirpated from the vicinage of europe have been gaining    ground ever since both in number of proselytes and extent of principle neither will the wars of charles v and his successors against this same hugonotism better support his cause as indeed he confesses though at the same time he cautiously observes that whether those wars might or might not be justified is a matter of historical criticism nor yet will he be able to quote among his cloud of examples the early persecutions of the christian system of innovation and reform a system which whatever mr bs mode of faith may suggest went much greater lengths with respect to a very tender subject than the wildest atheism either of the french or english jacobins the primitive christians as every scholar knows both upheld and practised not only equality of rights but community of goods a wild and absurd scheme i confess and not practicable upon any large scale but i speak to the doctrinal and historical fact nor can the man who has seriously considered the essential doctrines of that religion view without contempt the ostentatious mockery of a modern congregation who call it christianity to keep the poor the halt and the blind standing at due distance in the aisles while the welldressed classes are closeted up in pews lined elevated and embellished according to the rank and station of the occupants listening to a drawler    in an awkward habit and cooped up in a mahogany box to soothe the pride of greatness with obsequious exhortations and terrify the abject and oppressed into trembling subordination and reverence for their betters edifices thus set out are pagan theatres hot christian churches what degree of persecution this system met with in pagan countries is a subject of so much controversy among the learned that i shall not venture to decide however that it was persecuted in that centre and focus of innovation judea where it first broke out is evident and that with tolerable severity it was persecuted christ became popular his doctrines became popular—how could doctrines fail of popularity which contained so many elementary political truths and vindicated so directly in many respects at least the rights of man he did not spare corruptions either in church or state he exposed the doctrines and the practices of the priests and the aristocrats the pharisees and the sadducees the powerful the wealthy and the great he collected the people together in great numbers and lectured them against existing abuses in the streets in the wilderness in the fields and on the neighbouring hills the government was alarmed they sought to destroy him and when they could not lay hold of his words they set gangs of ruffians upon him to knock him on the    head with bludgeons and stones but he escaped out of their hands and got away in the midst of these persecutions the number of his proselytes continually encreased and some of the great men among the jews like the great man i had mentioned in the narrative of my arrest and treatment thought that men who had a heap of people running after them were best in a place of security he was secured a certain apostate his name was neither edmund burke william pitt nor william windham—it was judas iscariot took it into his head to persecute the doctrines he had formerly supported betrayed the cause and accepted a pension for his public services in short jesus christ was crucified as joseph gerrald has been transported for exposing the corruption and degeneracy of the times and preaching a great reform but it was all in vain hang transport and crucify as long as you please the spirit of a great reformer martyrd for a glorious principle will rise again the phœnix mind springs triumphant from the pyre and the winds that scatter the ashes of the martyr propagate the principles for which he fell thus fared it with christianity the persecutions it suffered by drawing attention to its doctrines  0 many of which particularly in the state of society then prevailing were excellently calculated to impress the general mind contributed more than all the tales of prophecies and miracles with which it became incorporated to spread the system not only through judea but through all the surrounding vicinage it did continue to spread so long as persecution continued and never was overthrown till politic emperors finding it a useful instrument of ambition established the name and destroyed the principle but says mr b opinions may not only be forced you may even force men into the forcible persecution of their own opinions—instances enough may be furnished of people who have enthusiastically and with force propagated those opinions which some time before they resisted with their blood true but it is a truth which makes terribly against one part of his argument and nothing for the other—for it tends to shew if brought to the test of facts the great advantages which new opinions have over the old when driven to the issue of coercion the proselytizing army is always encreasing the army of establishments always falling away many thousands in every longcontinued struggle begin with resisting opinions with their    blood on account of their novelty which they conclude with propagating even enthusiastically and with force from a conviction of their truth an arnold or a dumourier may be dragged from the retreats of infamy to prove that the champions of liberty may be bought by its foes but the examples are worth but little in the scale of argument and i speak it with glowing satisfaction they are but few as for the voluntary and unbought recantations they are all on the other side in short in the event of a struggle settled governments may rest almost assured that they must conquer immediately or not at all it is therefore a serious thing to bring matters to such an issue i rather suppose however that mr b had his eye upon examples of another kind for specimens of which not to burthen the reader with quotations especially as i have cited the passage in a former publication i refer to burnets summary of affairs before the restoration† there he will find lutherans catholics and calvinists—that is to say lutheran catholic and calvinist princes—electors dukes and palatines in abundance changing and rechanging their religion as policy of state directed and propagating with force at one time those opinions    which before they resisted with their blood—that is to say with the blood which they regarded as their property—the blood of their subjects the fact being that like princes and statesmen in general they had no settled opinion of any kind except that whatever tended to gratify their usurping ambition was to be pursued and that every thing was to be judged by moral prudence of which they were sole umpires and not by any abstract principle of right but continues the advocate of extirpation—rarely have ever great changes in opinion taken place without the application of force more or less† true mr b—and for this plain reason—governments have rarely wanted such counsellors as yourself to persuade them to drive the question to that issue establishments however pure in the outset have never failed in process of time to be infected with innumerable corruptions these the governors have an interest in perpetuating and indeed for the sake of that interest the corruptions have been generally introduced to them the beauty of all constitutions consists in those very corruptions of which others complain‡ for it is by the latter not    the former that their ambition is flattered their rapacity indulged their patronage extended and places and pensions heaped upon themselves their families and dependants these corruptions are therefore artfully confounded and incorporated with the original institutions and the institutions themselves under one pretence or other are artfully abrogated by their pretended supporters till at last the whole is infected and nothing but corruption remains the enormity of the evil produces complaint remonstrance rejected and despised provokes to keener discussion and more bold enquiry new theories and new systems are started more consonant with the nature of man and principles of justice and the old corrupted disjointed patchworks of obsolete institution and newfangled usurpation are attacked with all the strength of argument and the ardour of principled conviction but corruption cannot stand the test of enquiry it shrinks from the galling probe of truth its strength consists in the morbid force of convulsion not in the conscious energies of temperate health it therefore flies from argument and appeals to force leaving to the proscribed reformers only the sad alternative of perishing in thousands according to the example of the hugonots and the advice of burke and windham by a vigour beyond the law or of repelling force by force with    death or victory on their banners and on their hearts such has been the case in many a nation—in genoa—in switzerland—in holland twice—in america and such was the case in france opinion had grown till it had burst its chains circumstances concurred that gave opinion weight the court seemed to yield but coercion was prepared monopolies gigantic in wickedness were planned and executed to put the subsistence of the people in the power of their oppressors and fresh massacres were resolved and organised but the project transpired force was repelled by force lambesque was discomfited the people flew to arms the bastille was taken broglio fled and paris escaped a second feast of saint bartholomew but still there were silverheaded traitors to the cause of man pensioned profligates at the ear of royalty advising coercion—from within or from without—it mattered not a foreign combination produced a foreign war and louis xvi who had sworn to defend the constitution of new opinions kept up as mallet du pan his confidential agent confesses in his correspondance politique pour servir a lhistoir a secret intercourse with the despots who had leagued for its destruction but surely the great changes in opinion resulting from the application    of force in these instances are not much calculated to encourage established governments to a repetition of the experiment i do not mean to assert that coercion has no influence over opinion i have not forgotten that the despotisms of china and japan despotisms in which that prompt conductor and disseminator of intellect the press is yet unknown did by nipping christianity in the very bud long before it was eighty thousand—perhaps before it was eight hundred strong exterminate that religion or more properly prevent it from taking root neither do i forget the prophet of mecca and his armed apostles who carried conviction on the sabres edge propounding circumcision or death but mahomet and his arabs also war against mr b for here the new opinion prevailed and why did the new opinion prevail the answer is a dreadful warning to old establishments not to be eager for contests of blood the new opinion prevailed because there is an incalculable distance between the energy and enthusiasm of a new conviction and the science and mechanism of ancient habits because it is the former alone that rouses the full force of intellect and valour    and suffers not a particle of the man to be lost because the old opinion depends upon rotine the new upon intrepidity and merit because in one the mass feel that they are nothing in the other they may be every thing they dare because the establishment takes its leaders and must take them by a sort of lottery from the court cabal the innovation selects them from the ranks in one case commands are conferred that laurels may be reaped in the other laurels are reaped that commands may be obtained such in the event of a struggle are the advantages in favour of the innovating army and mr b sees and has acknowledged them in all their strength yet still this champion of old systems maintains that new opinions may be and ought to be extirpated by force they ought to be extirpated for three reasons   because opinion is the rudder of human action granted granted also that as the opinion is wise or foolish vicious or moral the cause of action is noxious or salutary but who is to judge of this wisdom or this folly—of this vice or this morality government says mr b i say no for that thing called government if there be corruption in the state is of necessity the focus of that corruption that thing called government is composed of a privileged    few who always may have and the history of the world assures us frequently have had an interest diametrically opposite to that of the state was the court of tarquin of nero of caligula domitian or hiliagabalus fit to be consulted for standards of moral and intellectual taste did they not mow down all virtue and all wisdom and propagate the most detestable vices and the most atrocious barbarism are the goverments of japan of morocco of algiers fit to be consulted as oracles upon these subjects if they are not none are and for this reason if the government were ten times blacker than all that i have instanced it would say that it was pure and the fouler it was the more dangerous to deny the dictum how then is it to be decided by precedent you say—no for precedent is infinitely diversified all things may be supported by precedent and all condemned it would therefore revert to governments to decide what precedents were good and what were bad and all my former objections recur—by antiquity and established usage no that would be to proscribe all improvement—for all improvement is change of established usage that would be to make the weakness and simplicity of childhood a standard for the vigour and intelligence of maturity and to prohibit all the advantages of experience as lord    bacon observes in this respect we who live now are in reality the ancients they are the younger generations that have passed before every thing useful to man has resulted from this great principle every improvement every invention is an innovation resting upon the substantial data—that by having all the experience of our ancestors with the addition of our own we are wiser than they and have a right not only to imitate like apes but to improve—to alter—to choose and to change as men and is political science alone upon whose improvement depend the happiness and the lives of millions and the creation as it were of new worlds of population whose embryons are now perishing in the dark and comfortless chaos of devouring despotism—is political science alone to be an exception to the rule and never to be breeched in manhood because it has formerly been encumbered with swathingbands and long coats certainly and for this obvious reason that the nurses who hold the leading strings have a profit in its weakness and must lose their places and their perquisites by such a change the case of governments and of arts and sciences in this respect are said to be essentially different but the difference consists in this alone and if we had a government of tanners and a priesthood of sawyers i have no doubt that it would be high    treason to dress a hide after a new fashion and blasphemy to invent machines for splitting timber   it has ever been the great primary object of speculative and doctrinal philosophy to regulate opinion certainly and this object has always been and of necessity must be most effectually answered when opinion is most free as indeed the very terms speculative and doctrinal philosophy when used in any sense of approbation take for granted every body knows that philosophy means the love of wisdom and that to speculate is to conjecture and pry and enquire with a view to the discovery of truths as yet unknown so that speculative philosophy evidently means the love of that wisdom which consists in making enquiries and conjectures with a view to the discovery of new truths while doctrinal philosophy or the philosophy of teaching must of necessity mean that love of wisdom which displays itself in imparting to mankind the truths which in the process of our conjectures and enquiries we may have discovered now how can we speculate without the liberty of speculation how can truths hitherto unknown be discovered if we are not at liberty to conjecture and enquire—and how can new truths be taught if the philosopher is not at liberty to communicate what his conjectures and enquiries have led him to regard as true in short how can  0 there be any such thing as speculative and doctrinal philosophy if opinion is not left unshackled it is not by coercion but by discussion that opinion is to be regulated and the desirable effects of morality and good conduct are to be obtained but   it is the great object of political philosophy to promote that opinion which is sound certainly it is the duty of the political philosopher and of every philosopher by every motive of reason and every opportunity of discussion to promote whatever appears to him to be sound but the disposition to decide between soundness and unsoundness by the faggot and the axe comes not from the schools of philosophy but from those of theological contention what follows therefore and to extirpate what is mischievous and which directly tends to render men bad citizens in the community and mischievous neighbours out of it is a sophism both in terms and substance it is a sophism in substance in as much as the statement being general vague and hypothetical furnishes no just foundation for the particular conclusion meant to be inferred it is a sophism in terms in as much as the phrase extirpating what is mischievous being spoken in reference to the antecedent political philosophy demands assent only to the propriety of extirpating the supposed mischievous opinion by philosophical means—that    is to say by means of reason or setting one opinion against another while the whole tenor of the argument would apply this assent not to extirpation by philosophy but by the sword—in this sense of the word therefore i deny the proposition a proposition indeed which absolutely begs the question and affirms the very point it pretends to argue i on the other hand affirm that political philosophy has no right according to mr bs jargon to extirpate by force any opinion whatever—no not even the opinion that it is a mans duty to take from me my goods and to kill me if i resist him the sophist who should propound such a doctrine would be easily confuted to say that he could not is to admit that he is right or to affirm that falsehood is more convincing than truth a dictum that destroys all morals he who should act upon the doctrine would undoubtedly be hanged but so long as indolence or fear restrains him from action the opinion however absurd is perfectly harmless and society ought to be satisfied it is sufficient for the law that we fear the gallows our friends and companions it is true the guardians of our interests and the instructors of our children we would seek among men who act upon more generous principles as for pulling down governments—in addition to the preceding arguments i shall only add that no man can pull down a government but when    not a man but a people wills a grand renovation to feel the will is also to be conscious of the power and when the will and the power cooperate sophists may string syllogisms like beads upon a rosiary but while they are reasoning the thing is done fortunately for mankind this will is not lightly inspired it is not to be produced by declamations or logic the speculative few will have their preferences their theories and their projected improvements sir thomas moore had his eutopia and hume himself sketched a sort of groundplot for the french republic but to the mass even of those who have some tolerable leisure for discussion and some means of information so long as their grievances are not very galling that which is will generally appear to be best merely because it is and because that spirit of nationality which belongs to the whole species occasions us to imbibe with our very nutriment a prejudice in favour of our national institutions nay even the speculative few themselves from their very love of speculation till roused by some extraordinary provocative prefer the very establishments they disapprove to the dangers and the trouble of a change—humes commonwealth slept for sixty years and the eutopia for whole centuries on the shelves of the learned and even the popular language    of thomas paine would not have provoked any very alarming discussion if the general condition of mankind had not predisposed them to exclaim—we are wretthed—let us enquire the cause in short in all the pages of history i have perused there is not a single instance and most assuredly i have not forgotten france of a great popular revolution taking place till grinding and longcontinued oppression had rendered it absolutely necessary—till groaning nature called for the dire relief it is not therefore by the extermination of eighty thousand malcontents and theoretical reformers but by the alleviation of burthens and the restoration of equal justice that such revolutions are to be avoided it is not by the persecution of new opinions but by the reform of old abuses that contentment can be restored and tranquillity preserved to a state and governors secured from the terrors of retributive justice but says mr b i do not mean to persecute all new doctrines theological opinions for example whether sound or erroneous do not go directly to the wellbeing of social of civil or of politic society if i were disposed to give a clue to one sort of persecution while i reprobate another i could mention some theological opinions which appear to me at least to go more directly to the destruction of all social moral and    political virtue than any thing of which atheism itself was ever accused if i were the deity says plutarch who by the way was himself a priest—but he was also a philosopher—a moral philosopher—if i were the deity i would rather that men should deny my existence than say that i was cruel jealous lascivious or revengeful the theological dogmatists he continues did not preach vices or crimes how mr b—did they not preach the crusade did they not preach murder assassination poisoning deposition of kings the axe the halter and the faggot and did they not practise what they preached—but i forget myself—with the single exception of deposing kings all that i have objected instead of vices and crimes are virtues in mr bs politicomoral code nay even such deposition itself provided the power be transferred only to the privileged bodies and feudal proprietories of the old germanic or gothic custumary may be perfectly innocent and even praiseworthy for indeed the force and form of the institution called states continued in greater perfection in those republican communities in which the classes orders and distinctions such as before subsisted or nearly such were still left than under monarchies† the parties says he the    religionists disputed on the best means of promoting virtue religion and morals and what do the atheist and the christian dispute about—why whether religion is or is not the best instrument for promoting morals and virtue men may differ upon this point as well as upon the question of which sort of religion from the egyptian faith in calves and onions to the orthodox metaphysicians in an incomprehensible immaterial triune deity and yet both parties may be good members of society do you try our lives by our opinions or our opinions by our lives neither would be just for man is an incongruous animal but surely the latter were the more candid and upon this foundation i would be bound to bring atheists into court before whom the pious impetuous hireling apostate of beaconsfield must hide his head in confusion opinions certainly have their tendencies with respect to moral character but opinions are multitudinous they proceed not from any one common stock they spring up from many a wildly scattered seed they blossom on innumerable stems detested therefore be the bigotry that condemns the whole soil on account of one rank weed that from a particular doctrine however erroneous would argue the immorality of a general character    but is there no distinction between an innocent and moral liberty and opinions that are the direct highway to every crime and every vice—must government either throw the bridle on the neck of headlong nature or tie it up for ever to the post the sophism is stated with most plausible subtilety and the smile is truely fascinating and when mankind shall acknowledge themselves to be horses—or that their governments are created for the express purpose of riding them then will it strictly apply then will it be right that opinion should be lashed round the stationpost till it is brokenin to the taste of the rider but so long as men and their governors are animals of the same order—so long as the great body of the people have a common weal and that little corporation called government a particular one—so long as rulers have an interest and betray an inclination to consider every thing as an innocent and moral liberty which tends to pamper their ambition and rapacity or encrease their power and to represent all opinion inconsistent with their views and hostile to their corrupt and despotic pride as the downhill way to every crime and every vice—so long that is to say as long as political society exists will it be much more dangerous to the peace and welfare of the universe to give the reins to that dread warhorse    constituted power—whose neck is clothed with thunder the glory of whose nostrils is terrible and who swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage than to throw them loose on the neck of the headlong colt opinion who though he may snort and curvet and frolic through a thousand extravagancies will never unless cruelly lashed and goaded commit any serious depredations or do irreparable mischief either to himself or others this metaphor is however an important part of mr burkes statement inasmuch as it proves that his observations on the forcible extirpation of opinion are intended to apply not only to the foreign war but also to the domestic enemy here then the argument as far as relates to the development of the mind and object of the writer is complete—and thus it stands there are in this country eighty thousand jacobins utterly incapable of amendment over whom no argument no example no venerable authority can have the slightest influence these jacobins have been tried in the persons of their supposed leaders but the tribunals have been found inefficient the juries by finding them not guilty have disowned the government and public prosecutions have become mere schools of treason    but opinions if they cannot otherwise be checked ought to be extirpated by force the practicability of which may be proved by a cloud of examples ergo—eighty thousand jacobins are to be forcibly got rid of at any rate by the caustic and the knife by fire and sword—by mock trial without juries to disown the government—or by the murderous tumults of lynn and yarmouth bludgeonmen such my fellowcitizens are the propositions and denunciations of the confidential hireling of a court which yet fills the world with senseless howlings against cannibal philosophy and affected exaggerations of revolutionary massacres and to shew you that the insinuations of mr b are not rashly or unadvisedly made—to shew you the object of his insinuations—and that these hints do actually and bona fide come from the governing powers for the purpose of preparing the public mind for some fresh member of that previously digested plan or series of measures hinted at in the memorable debates of the last session essential parts of the language of these pamphlets—important branches of this syllogism of massacre are incessantly propounded by all the members and dependants of the government no opportunity is neglected of insulting and reprobating the juries who were guilty of the deplored acquittal the    circumstance is openly connected with every motion and proposition for encreasing the military force and mr pitt even since these sheets have been at the press in a debate oct    upon that very subject affirms that notwithstanding the issue of the trials ninetenths of the nation are convinced of our guilt the inference is plain it is a commentary a tremendous commentary coming from such a quarter on the intricate yet not obscure text of the archapostate to aristocratic moderation the ordinary physic of the state cannot cure the disease even extraordinary potions have been administered without effect and as soon as the body politic that is to say the body of political citizens—the privileged four hundred thousand can be properly prepared for the operation recourse must be had to the cautery and the knife if this is not sufficient to open your eyes the last trumpet alone can awaken you if this is not sufficient to rouse you to fresh vigilance fresh exertion closer intercourse and intrepid unanimity ye are dead—ye are lost not only in the oblivious pool but   in bottomless perdition there to dwell   in adamantine chains think i conjure you what is the prospect held out to you—for yourselves—unqualified  0 submission or the prompt and destroying vengeance of some new mode of legalized massacre or military execution—for your children—the tombstones of progenitors who though born to a degree of freedom which they were bound to improve and had no right to alienate yet relinquished the patrimony with criminal supineness and left to them for their inheritance beggary and accumulating chains rouse then once more to the investigation of your rights for if ye will be ignorant ye must be slaves trust not your hopes to a blind fatality repose not in the indolent expectation that the corruption of the system will work its own cure that corruption will i believe inevitably destroy itself but the destruction of the tyranny is not of necessity the emancipation of the slave almost all are tyrants when they have the power and the being or the nation that knows not how to maintain its freedom when one yoke is broken will find that another is prepared even if a continuation of the war or the windingup of a peace should bring affairs to a crisis—if as is not unlikely ere the close of this century of ambition usurpation and carnage prodigal expenditure should come to open bankruptcy and the obstinate infatuation of courtly pride should bring at once to their catastrophe    a system of horrors and a ministry of crimes how shall ye be assured of benefitting by the event—how shall ye secure yourselves from new modes of corruption and new systems of oppression how but by vigilent discussion and wellgrounded principles awake then once more to the important enquiry compare what ye are with what ye have a right to be compare your powers and your faculties with your condition the bounty of nature with your scanty enjoyments and unsatisfied wants the wealth resulting from your productive labour and the abject wretchedness of your general state compare these things and consider well the causes trace them to their sources in the nature of some and the corruptions of other of those very institutions of the old germanic or gothic custumary at the prospect of whose approaching overthrow the volcanic imagination of burke pours out such deluges of flame and smoke contrast the gloomy intricacy of these oppressive systems—these antique temples of fraud and violence with the simple plans of reason and of nature and learn what to avoid and what to pursue in the furtherance of this great enquiry despise not the warnings nor reject the assistance of a friend whose sincerity at least has been more than once tried in the balance and has not    been wanting and who still unsubdued by persecutions unawed by the daggers of assassins unchilled by the cold neglect of an unsocial world and forgetful of his own misfortunes and his own personal cares incorporates himself with the public and with the warm enthusiasm of conviction proceeds to advocate the cause of man against the usurpations of establishments among the vindicators of these abuses the most formidable assuredly is edmund burke—nay he is the only one who in any literary point of view can be regarded as formidable at all for the talents of this country are generally speaking pure they have not been debauched by court favour nor rendered dependant by the liberal patronage of an administration of mecænases and medici in brilliancy of imagination extent of general knowledge and richness and versatility of talents mr b is however by himself a host though at the same time such a host as no champion of reason of an inductive mind and an enthusiastic impression of truth need be

advantages the improved felicity and extended intellect which would result from the more simple and equitable systems dictated by the laws and by the rights of nature in the pamphlet or rather pamphlets i am replying to there are three important objects of discussion   the spirit of jacobinism in this country and the manner in which it ought to be disposed of or extirpated   the excellency of the old established systems of government as now administered and the folly wickedness and profligacy of attempting to shake them either by sudden or progressive change   the justice and propriety of the present war the capability of this country to pursue it till what is affectedly styled regicide and atheism by establishment shall be utterly destroyed and the virtue the wisdom and even the necessity of staking our national existence upon that issue of these the first only which though artfully incorporated with the rest forms in reality a distinct subject is particularly examined in this letter to which i have given entirely a controversial form as the nature of mr bs attack in reality necessitated me to do the other two belong to the comparison of the respective systems    i shall therefore in the following letters proceed to a sort of systematical development of the rights of nature and genuine objects of social institution and shall of course controvert the axioms and declamations of the archchampion of feudal barbarism which he calls polished society as they fall in with the respective heads and shall thus endeavour to present in living colours the contracted pictures of the usurping establishments which court sycophants would have you worship and those natural and inalienable rights against which they entertain such inveterate abhorrence end of letter i    advertisement there is a class of readers to whom it may perhaps appear necessary to apologize for somewhat of a different temper exhibited towards mr b in the present pamphlet from that which has been admitted on all hands to have distinguished my answer to his former letter but the apology must be sought in the publications of my antagonist himself if i have become more warm it is because the sentiments of mr b have become more atrocious his former attack was upon individuals this is an outrage upon human nature and he who can seek excuses to palliate the enormous profligacy of a wretch who would extirpate opinions by the sword and devote eighty thousand of his fellowcitizens to judicial or military massacre must be deficient in that ardent benevolence which while it pants for the happiness of man cannot but detest the sanguinary ferocity that yelps for wholesale carnage some however may think that i am not without a sense of personal interest to stir me on this occasion
