mdcclxxvi  to george colman esquire sir as you have done me the honor to make me the subject of your dramatic satire in doing which you have flown off in a direct tangent from the circle of science you will excuse me if in returning the compliment i have at any time apparently deviated from the line of mathematical truth in modelling the figures of poetical fiction the force of metaphorical expressions is not to be estimated so precisely as the momentum of mechanic powers and yet there may be as much veracity couched under the moral of an allegory as in the most demonstrable proposition of euclid of this at least i am certain that my characters are as justly drawn and my allusions as apt and applicable as yours save and except indeed your incomparable parallels which at the same time as they preserve their parallelism diverge with a true poetical license like rays from a common center see the spleen or islington spa act i also the london review for april last  happy oxonians to

celebrated writer wrote or rather compiled a periodical paper entitled the connoisseur which was first published some years past at oxford the latter having written a number of this work which he particularly admired requested his colleague to go post with it to oxford and to correct it with his own hand on coleys arrival jackson the printer informed him that the publication must inevitably be stopped if he had not the copy in two hours at farthest here was an offer of immortality the poet could not forego he replied that having been a bon vivant the preceding evening he was but indifferently prepared for the task yet if he would furnish him with a room pen ink and paper he would see what could be done being accommodated to his wishes he transcribed his friend thorntons essay and delivered it for the press in little more than an hour jackson was astonished at the rapidity of his genius and this identical paper making a considerable noise in the world at that time the printer as in duty bound proclaimed the velocity of his authors fancy a circumstance which procured him that merited fame he never after could be persuaded or even forced to resign bate this anecdote

support the dullness of bad ones and enforce the villainous impositions of managers on these occasions justice fieldings thieftakers and other ruffians have been introduced by our hero and planted in every part of the house to cram down his own crudities and damn the productions of others  were an author or actor particularly if a manager the greatest blockhead or scoundrel in nature or even the most unnatural rascal imaginable a papered house would have the power to protect him and persuade the public his protection was due to their candor anonymous had turned his brain the little brain
