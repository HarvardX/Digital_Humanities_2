the wives revenged a comic opera in one act as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  london printed for g kearsly no    fleet street mdcclxxviii  advertisement the following little piece is an imitation of the french comic operas of one act which are generally characterized either by their natural simplicity or some single striking incident and little or nothing more is designed  it is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the english theater as containing excellent situations for light airs  on the french stage notwithstanding all their merit they tire in the length of time taken for representation and were they spun out to the common length of our afterpieces it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient  the subject matter therefore being wholly preserved and the dialogue both varied and compressed they are with every deference submitted to public judgment  c dibdin  characters men mr vermilion mr mattocks alderman
