a political romance addressed to   esquire of york to which is subjoined a key  ridiculum acri fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat res york printed in the year mdcclix price one shilling  a political romance etc sir in my last for want of something better to write about i told you what a world of fending and proving we have had of late in this little village of ours about an oldcastpairofblackplushbreeches which john our parishclerk about ten years ago it seems had made a promise of to one trim who is our sexton and dogwhipper  to this you write me word that you have had more than either one or two occasions to know a good deal of the shifty behavior of this said master trim  and that you are astonished nor can you for your soul conceive how so worthless a fellow and so worthless a thing into the bargain could become the occasion of such a racket as i have represented  now though you do not say expressly you could wish to hear any more about it yet i see plain enough that i have raised your curiosity and therefore from the same motive that i slightly mentioned it at all in my last letter i will in this give you a full and very circumstantial account of the whole affair  but before i begin i must first set you right in one very material point in which i have missled you as to the true cause of all this uproar amongst us  which does not take its rise as i then told you from the affair of the breeches  but on the contrary the whole affair of the breeches has taken its rise from it  to understand which you must know that the first beginning of the squabble was not between john the parishclerk and trim the sexton but betwixt the parson of the parish and the said master trim about an old watchcoat which had many years hung up in the church which trim had set his heart upon and nothing would serve trim but he must take it home in order to have it converted into a warm underpetticoat for his wife and a jerkin for himself against winter which in a plaintive tone he most humbly begged his reverence would consent to  i need not tell you sir who have so often felt it that a principle of strong compassion transports a generous mind sometimes beyond what is strictly right  the parson was within an ace of being an honorable example of this very crime  for no sooner did the distinct words  petticoat  poor wife  warm  winter strike upon his ear  but his heart warmed  and before trim had well got to the end of his petition being a gentleman of a frank and open temper he told him he was welcome to it with all his heart and soul but trim says he as you see i am but just got down to my living and am an utter stranger to all parishmatters know nothing about this old watchcoat you beg of me having never seen it in my life and therefore cannot be a judge whether it is fit for such a purpose or if it is in truth know not whether it is mine to bestow upon you or not  you must have a week or ten days patience till i can make some inquiries about it  and if i find it is in my power i tell you again man your wife is heartily welcome to an underpetticoat out of it and you to a jerkin was the thing as good again as you represent it  it is necessary to inform you sir in this place that the parson was earnestly bent to serve trim in this affair not only from the motive of generosity which i have justly ascribed to him but likewise from another motive and that was by way of making some sort of recompense for a multitude of small services which trim had occasionally done and indeed was continually doing as he was much about the house when his own man was out of the way for all these reasons together i say the parson of the parish intended to serve trim in this matter to the utmost of his power all that was wanting was previously to inquire if any one had a claim to it  or whether as it had time immemorial hung up in the church the taking it down might not raise a clamor in the parish these inquiries were the very thing that trim dreaded in his heart  he knew very well that if the parson should but say one word to the churchwardens about it there would be an end of the whole affair for this and some other reasons not necessary to be told you at present trim was for allowing no time in this matter  but on the contrary doubled his diligence and importunity at the vicaragehouse  plagued the whole family to death  pressed his suit morning noon and night and to shorten my story teazed the poor gentleman who was but in an ill state of health almost out of his life about it  you will not wonder when i tell you that all this hurry and precipitation on the side of master trim produced its natural effect on the side of the parson and that was a suspicion that all was not right at the bottom  he was one evening sitting alone in his study weighing and turning this doubt every way in his mind and after an hour and a halfs serious deliberation upon the affair and running over trims behavior throughout  he was just saying to himself it must be so  when a sudden rap at the door put an end to his soliloquy  and in a few minutes to his doubts too for a labourer in the town who deemed himself past his fiftysecond year had been returned by the constable in the militialist  and he had come with a groat in his hand to search the parish register for his age  the parson bid the poor fellow put the groat into his pocket and go into the kitchen  then shutting the study door and taking down the parish register  who knows says he but i may find something here about this selfsame watchcoat  he had scarce unclasped the book in saying this when he poppd upon the very thing he wanted fairly wrote on the first page pasted to the inside of one of the covers whereon was a memorandum about the very thing in question in these express words  memorandum  the great watchcoat was purchased and given above two hundred years ago by the lord of the manor to this parish church to the sole use and behoof of the poor sextons thereof and their successors for ever to be worn up them respectively in winterly cold nights in ringing complines passingbells etc which the said lord of the manor had done in piety to keep the poor wretches warm and for the good of his own soul for which they were directed to pray etc etc etc etc just heaven said the parson to himself looking upwards what an escape have i had i give this for an underpetticoat to trim s wife i would not have consented to such a desecration to be primate of all england nay i would not have disturbed a single button of it for half my tithes    scarce were the words out of his mouth when in pops trim with the whole subject of the exclamation under both his arms  i say under both his arms  for he had actually got it rippd and cut out ready his own jerkin under one arm and the petticoat under the other in order to be carried to the tailor to be made up  and had just stepped in in high spirits to show the parson how cleverly it had held out  there are many good similies now subsisting in the world but which i have neither time to recollect or look for which would give you a strong conception of the astonishment and honest indignation which this unexpected stroke of trims impudence impressed upon the parsons looks  let it suffice to say that it exceeded all fair description  as well as all power of proper resentment  except this that trim was ordered in a stern voice to lay the bundles down upon the table  to go about his business and wait upon him at his peril the next morning at eleven precisely  against this hour like a wise man the parson had sent to desire john the parishclerk who bore an exceeding good character as a man of truth and who having moreover a pretty freehold of about eighteen pounds a year in the township was a leading man in it and upon the whole was such a one of whom it might be said  that he rather did honor to his office  than that his office did honor to him  him he sends for with the churchwardens and one of the sidesmen a grave knowing old man to be present  for as trim had withheld the whole truth from the parson touching the watchcoat he thought it probable he would as certainly do the same thing to others though this i said was wise the trouble of the precaution might have been spared  because the parsons character was unblemished  and he had ever been held by the world in the estimation of a man of honor and integrity  trims character on the contrary was as well known if not in the world yet at least in all the parish to be that of a little dirty pimping pettifogging ambidextrous fellow  who neither cared what he did or said of any provided he could get a penny by it  this might i say have made any precaution needless  but you must know as the parson had in a manner but just got down to his living he dreaded the consequences of the least ill impression on his first entrance amongst his parishioners which would have disabled him from doing them the good he wished  so that out of regard to his flock more than the necessary care due to himself  he was resolved not to lie at the mercy of what resentment might vent or malice lend an ear to  accordingly the whole matter was rehearsed from first to last by the parson in the manner i have told you in the hearing of john the parishclerk and in the presence of trim  trim had little to say for himself except that the parson had absolutely promised to be friend him and his wife in the affair to the utmost of his power that the watchcoat was certainly in his power and that he might still give it him if he pleased  to this the parsons reply was short but strong that nothing was in his power to do but what he could do honestly  that in giving the coat to him and his wife he should do a manifest wrong to the next sexton the great watchcoat being the most comfortable part of the place  that he should moreover injure the right of his own successor who would be just so much a worse patron as the worth of the coat amounted to  and in a word he declared that his whole intent in promising that coat was charity to trim but wrong to no man that was a reserve he said made in all cases of this kind  and he declared solemnly in verbo sacerdotis that this was his meaning and was so understood by trim himself  with the weight of this truth and the great good sense and strong reason which accompanied all the parson said upon the subject  poor trim was driven to his last shift  and begged he might be suffered to plead his right and title to the watchcoat if not by promise at least by services  it was well known how much he was entitled to it upon these scores that he had blackd the parsons shoes without count and greased his boots above fifty times  that he had run for eggs into the town upon all occasions  whetted the knives at all hours  catched his horse and rubbed him down  that for his wife she had been ready upon all occasions to charr for them  and neither he nor she to the best of his remembrance ever took a farthing or any thing beyond a mug of ale  to this account of his services he begged leave to add those of his wishes which he said had been equally great  he affirmed and was ready he said to make it appear by numbers of witnesses he had drank his reverences health a thousand times by the bye he did not add out of the parsons own ale that he not only drank his health but wished it and never came to the house but asked his man kindly how he did that in particular about half a year ago when his reverence cut his finger in paring an apple he went half a mile to ask a cunning woman what was good to stanch blood and actually returned with a cobweb in his breeches pocket  nay says trim it was not a fortnight ago when your reverence took that violent purge that i went to the far end of the whole town to borrow you a closestool  and came back as my neighbors who flouted me will all bear witness with the pan upon my head and never thought it too much  trim concluded his pathetick remonstrance with saying he hoped his reverences heart would not suffer him to requite so many faithful services by so unkind a return  that if it was so as he was the first so he hoped he should be the last example of a man of his condition so treated  this plan of trims defense which trim had put himself upon  could admit of no other reply but a general smile  upon the whole let me inform you that all that could be said pro and con on both sides being fairly heard it was plain that trim in every part of this affair had behaved very ill  and one thing which was never expected to be known of him happening in the course of this debate to come out against him  namely that he had gone and told the parson before he had ever set foot in his parish that john his parishclerk  his churchwardens and some of the heads of the parish were a parcel of scoundrels  upon the upshot trim was kicked out of doors and told at his peril never to come there again  at first trim huffd and bounced most terribly  swore he would get a warrant  then nothing would serve him but he would call a byelaw and tell the whole parish how the parson had misused him  but cooling of that as fearing the parson might possibly bind him over to his good behavior and for aught he knew might send him to the house of correction  he let the parson alone and to revenge himself falls foul upon his clerk who had no more to do in the quarrel than you or i  rips up the promise of the oldcastpairofblackplushbreeches and raises an uproar in the town about it notwithstanding it had slept ten years  but all this you must know is looked upon in no other light but as an artful stroke of generalship in trim to raise a dust and cover himself under the disgraceful chastisement he has undergone  if your curiosity is not yet satisfied  i will now proceed to relate the battle of the breeches in the same exact manner i have done that of the watchcoat  be it known then that about ten years ago when john was appointed parishclerk of this church this said master trim took no small pains to get into johns good graces in order as it afterward appeared to coax a promise out of him of a pair of breeches which john had then by him of black plush not much the worse for wearing  trim only begging for gods sake to have them bestowed upon him when john should think fit to cast them  trim was one of those kind of men who loved a bit of finery in his heart and would rather have a tattered rag of a better bodys than the best plain whole thing his wife could spin him  john who was naturally unsuspicious made no more difficulty of promising the breeches than the parson had done in promising the great coat and indeed with something less reserve  because the breeches were johns own and he could give them without wrong to whom he thought fit  it happened i was going to say unluckily but i should rather say most luckily for trim for he was the only gainer by it  that a quarrel about some six or eight weeks after this broke out between the late parson of the parish and john the clerk somebody and it was thought to be nobody but trim had put it into the parsons head that johns desk in the church was at the least four inches higher than it should be  that the thing gave offense and was indecorous inasmuch as it approached too near upon a level with the parsons desk itself this hardship the parson complained of loudly  and told john one day after prayers  he could bear it no longer  and would have it altered and brought down as it should be john made no other reply but that the desk was not of his raising  that twas not one hair breadth higher than he found it  and that as he found it so would he leave it  in short he would neither make an encroachment nor would he suffer one  the late parson might have his virtues but the leading part of his character was not humility so that johns stiffness in this point was not likely to reconcile matters  this was trims harvest  after a friendly hint to john to stand his ground  away hies trim to make his market at the vicarage  what passed there i will not say intending not to be uncharitable so shall content myself with only guessing at it from the sudden change that appeared in trims dress for the better  for he had left his old ragged coat hat and wig in the stable and was come forth strutting across the churchyard yclad in a good creditable cast coat large hat and wig which the parson had just given him  ho ho hollo john cries trim in an insolent bravo as loud as ever he could bawl  see here my lad how fine i am  the more shame for you answered john seriously  do you think trim says he such finery gained by such services becomes you or can wear well  fie upon it trim  i could not have expected this from you considering what friendship you pretended and how kind i have ever been to you  how many shillings and sixpences i have generously lent you in your distresses  nay it was but the other day that i promised you these black plush breeches i have on  rot your breeches quoth trim for trims brain was half turned with his new finery  rot your breeches says he  i would not take them up were they laid at my door  give em and be dd to you to whom you like  i would have you to know i can have a better pair at the parsons any day in the week  john told him plainly as his word had once passed him he had a spirit above taking advantage of his insolence in giving them away to another  but to tell him his mind freely he thought he had got so many favors of that kind and was so likely to get many more for the same services of the parson that he had better give up the breeches with good nature to some one who would be more thankful for them  here john mentioned mark slender who it seems the day before had asked john for em not knowing they were under promise to trim  come trim says he let poor mark have em  you know he has not a pair to his a besides you see he is just of my size and they will fit him to a t whereas if i give em to you  look ye they are not worth much and besides you could not get your backside into them if you had them without tearing them all to pieces  every tittle of this was most undoubtedly true for trim you must know by soul feeding and playing the good fellow at the parsons was grown somewhat gross about the lower parts if not higher so that as all john said upon the occasion was fact trim with much ado and after a hundred hums and hahs at last out of mere compassion to mark signs seals and delivers up all right interest and pretensions whatsoever in and to the said breeches thereby binding his heirs erecutors administrators and assigns never mere to call the said claim in question  all this renunciation was set forth in an ample manner to be in pure pity to marks nakedness  but the secret was trim had an eye to and firmly expected in his own mind the great green pulpitcloth and old velvet cushion which were that very year to be taken down  which by the bye could he have wheedled john a second time out of em as he hoped he had made up the loss of his breeches sevenfold  now you must know this pulpitcloth and cushion were not in johns gift but in the churchwardens etc  however as i said above that john was a leading man in the parish trim knew he could help him to them if he would  but john had got a surfeit of him  so when the pulpitcloth etc were taken down they were immediately given  john having a great say in it to william do who understood very well what use to make of them  as for the old breeches poor mark slender lived to wear them but a short time and they got into the possession of lorry slim an unlucky wight by whom they are still worn  in truth as you will guess they are very thin by this time  but lorry has a light heart and what recommends them to him is this that as thin as they are he knows that trim let him say what he will to the contrary still envies the possessor of them  and with all his pride would be very glad to wear them after him  upon this footing have these affairs slept quietly for near ten years  and would have slept for ever but for the unlucky kickingbout which as i said has rippd this squabble up afresh so that it was no longer ago than last week that trim met and insulted john in the public town  way before a hundred people  taxed him with the promise of the oldcastpairofblackbreeches notwithstanding trims solemn renunciation twitted him with the pulpitcloth and velvet cushion  as good as told him he was ignorant of the common duties of his clerkship adding very infolently that he knew not so much as to give out a common psalm in tune   john contented himself with giving a plain answer to every article that trim had laid to his charge and appealed to his neighbors who remembered the whole affair  and as he knew there was never any thing to be got in wrestling with a chimneysweeper  he was going to take leave of trim for ever  but hold  the mob by this time had got round them and their high mightinesses insisted upon having trim tried upon the spot  trim was accordingly tried and after a full hearing was convicted a second time and handled more roughly by one or more of them than even at the parsons  trim says one are you not ashamed of yourself to make all this rout and disturbance in the town and set neighbors together by the ears about an oldwornoutpairofcastbreeches not worth half a crown  is there a castcoat or a place in the whole town that will bring you in a shilling but what you have snappd up like a greedy hound as you are  in the first place are you not sexton and dogwhipper worth three pounds a year  then you begged the churchwardens to let your wife have the washing and darning of the surplice and churchlinen which brings you in thirteen shillings and four pence  then you have six shillings and eight pence for oiling and winding up the clock both paid you at easter  the pinders place which is worth forty shillings a year  you have got that tooyou are the bailiff which the late parson got you which brings you in forty shillings more  besides all this you have six pounds a year paid you quarterly for being molecatcher to the parish  aye says the luckless wight abovementioned who was standing close to him with his plush breeches on you are not only molecatcher trim but you catch stray conies too in the dark and you pretend a license for it which i trow will be looked into at the next quarter sessions i maintain it i have a license says trim blushing as red as scarlet  i have a license  and as i farm a warren in the next parish i will catch conies every hour of the night  you catch conies cries a toothless old woman who was just passing by   this set the mob a laughing and sent every man home in perfect good humor except trim who waddled very slowly off with that kind of inflexible gravity only to be equalled by one animal in the whole creation  and surpassed by none i am  sir yours etc etc  finis postscript i have broke open my letter to inform you that i missed the opportunity of sending it by the messenger who i expected would have called upon me in his return through this village to york so it has laid a week or ten days by me   i am not sorry for the disappointment because something has since happened in continuation of this affair which i am thereby enabled to transmit to you all under one trouble  when i finished the above account i thought as did every soul in the parish trim had met with so thorough a rebuff from john the parish  clerk and the towns folks who all took against him that trim would be glad to be quiet and let the matter rest  but it seems it is not half an hour ago since trim sallied forth again and having borrowed a sowgelders horn with hard blowing he got the whole town round him and endeavored to raise a disturbance and fight the whole battle over again  that he had been used in the last fray worse than a dog  not by john the parishclerk  for i should not quoth trim have valued him a rush single hands  but all the town sided with him and twelve men in buckram set upon me all at once and kept me in play at swords point for three hours together  besides quoth trim there were two misbegotten knaves in kendal green who lay all the while in ambush in johns own house and they all sixteen came upon my back and let drive at me together  a plague says trim of all cowards  trim repeated this story above a dozen times  which made some of the neighbors pity him thinking the poor fellow crackbraind and that he actually believed what he said after this trim dropped the affair of the breeches and begun a fresh dispute about the readingdesk which i told you had occasioned some small dispute between the late parson and john some years ago  this readingdesk as you will observe was but an episode wove into the main story by the bye  for the main affair was the battle of the breeches and great watchcoat  however trim being at last driven out of these two citadels  he has seized hold in his retreat of this readingdesk with a view as it seems to take shelter behind it  i cannot say but the man has fought it out obstinately enough  and had his cause been good i should have really pitied him for when he was driven out of the great watchcoat  you see he did not run away  no  he retreated behind the breeches  and when he could make nothing of it behind the breeches  he got behind the readingdesk  to what other hold trim will next retreat the politicians of this village are not agreed  some think his next move will be toward the rear of the parsons boot  but as it is thought he cannot make a long stand there  others are of opinion that trim will once more in his life get hold of the parsons horse and charge upon him or perhaps behind him  but as the horse is not easy to be caught the more general opinion is that when he is driven out of the readingdesk he will make his last retreat in such a manner as if possible to gain the closestool and defend himself behind it to the very last drop if trim should make this movement by my advice he should be left besides his citadel in full possession of the field of battle  where it is certain he will keep every body a league off and may pop by himself till he is weary besides as trim seems bent upon purging himself and may have abundance of foul humors to work off i think he cannot be better placed  but this is all matter of speculation  let me carry you back to matter of fact and tell you what kind of a stand trim has actually made behind the said desk  neighbors and townsmen all i will be sworn before my lord mayor that john and his nineteen men in buckram have abused me worse than a dog for they told you that i played fast and goloose with the late parson and him in that old dispute of theirs about the readingdesk and that i made matters worse between them and not better  of this charge trim declared he was as innocent as the child that was unborn that he would be booksworn he had no hand in it he produced a strong witness  and moreover insinuated that john himself instead of being angry for what he had done in it had actually thanked him aye trim says the wight in the plush breeches but that was trim the day before john found thee out  besides trim there is nothing in that  for the very year that thou wast made towns pinder thou know well that i both thanked thee myself and moreover gave thee a good warm supper for turning john lunds cows and horses out of my hardcorn close which if thou had not done as thou toldst me i should have lost my whole crop whereas john lund and thomas patt who are both here to testify and will take their oaths on it that thou thyself wast the very man who set the gate open and after all  it was not thee trim  twas the blacksmiths poor lad who turned them out so that a man may be thanked and rewarded too for a good turn which he never did nor ever did intend  trim could not sustain this unexpected stroke  so trim marched off the field without colors flying or his horn sounding or any other ensigns of honor whatever  whether after this trim intends to rally a second time  or whether trim may not take it into his head to claim the victory  no one but trim himself can inform you  however the general opinion upon the whole is this  that in three several pitched battles trim has been so trimmed as never disastrous hero was trimmed before him  the key this romance was by some mischance or other dropped in the minsteryard york and picked up by a member of a small political club in that city where it was carried and publicly read to the members the last club night  it was instantly agreed to by a great majority that it was a political romance but concerning what state or potentate could not so easily be settled amongst them  the president of the night who is thought to be as clear and quicksighted as any one of the whole club in things of this nature discovered plainly that the disturbances therein set forth related to those on the continent  that trim could be nobody but the king of france by whose shifting and intriguing behavior all europe was set together by the ears  that trims wife was certainly the empress who are as kind together says he as any man and wife can be for their lives  the more shame for em says an alderman low to himself  agreeable to this key continues the president  the parson who i think is a most excellent character  is his most excellent majesty king gearge  john the parishclerk is the king of prussia who by the manner of his first entering saxony showed the world most evidently  that he did know how to lead out the psalm and in tune and time too notwithstanding trims vile insult upon him in that particular  but who do you think says a surgeon and manmidwife who sat next him whose coatbutton the president in the earnestness of this explanation had got fast hold of and had thereby partly drawn him over to his opinion who do you think mr president says he are meant by the churchwardens sidesmen mark slender lorry slim etc  who do i think says he why  why sir as i take the thing  the churchwardens and sidesmen are the electors and the other princes who form the germanick body  and as for the other subordinate characters of mark slim  the unlucky wight in the plush breeches  the parsons man who was so often out of the way etc etc  these to be sure are the several marshals and generals who fought or should have fought under them the last campaign  the men in buckram continued the president are the gross of the king of prussias army who are as stiff a body of men as are in the world  and trims saying they were twelve and then nineteen is a wipe for the brussels gazetteer who to my knowledge was never two weeks in the same story about that or any thing else  as for the rest of the romance continued the president it sufficiently explains itself  the oldcastpairofblackplushbreeches must be saxony which the elector you see has left off wearing  and as for the great watchcoat which you know covers all it signifies all europe comprehending at least so many of its different states and dominions as we have any concern with in the present war  i protest says a gentleman who sat next but one to the president and who it seems was the parson of the parish a member not only of the political but also of a musical club in the next street  i protest says he if this explanation is right which i think it is  that the whole makes a very fine symbol  you have always some musical instrument or other in your head i think says the alderman  musical instrument replies the parson in astonishment  mr alderman i mean an allegory and i think the greedy disposition of trim and his wife in ripping the great watchcoat to pieces in order to convert it into a petticoat for the one and a jerkin for the other is one of the most beautiful of the kind i ever met with and will show all the world what have been the true views and intentions of the houses of bourbon and austria in this abominable coalition  i might have called it whoredom  nay says the alderman it is downright adulterydom or nothing  this hypothesis of the presidents explained every thing in the romance extremely well and withal was delivered with so much readiness and air of certainty as begot an opinion in two thirds of the club that mr president was actually the author of the romance himself but a gentleman who sat on the opposite side of the table who had come pipinghot from reading the history of king williams and queen annes wars and who was thought at the bottom to envy the president the honor both of the romance and explanation too gave an entire new turn to it all he acquainted the club that mr president was altogether wrong in every supposition he had made except that one where the great watchcoat was said by him to represent europe or at least a great part of it  so far he acknowledged he was pretty right but that he had not gone far enough backwards into our history to come at the truth he then acquainted them that the dividing the great watchcoat did and could allude to nothing else in the world but the partitiontreaty which by the bye he told them was the most unhappy and scandalous transaction in all king williams life it was that false step and that only says he rising from his chair and striking his hand upon the table with great violence it was that false step says he knitting his brows and throwing his pipe down upon the ground that has laid the foundation of all the disturbances and sorrows we feel and lament at this very hour and as for trims giving up the breeches look ye it is almost word for word copied from the french king and dauphins renunciation of spain and the west indies which all the world knew as was the very case of the breeches were renounced by them on purpose to be reclaimed when time should serve  this explanation had too much ingenuity in it to be altogether slighted and in truth the worst fault it had seemed to be the prodigious heat of it which as an apothecary who sat next the fire observed in a very low whisper to his next neighbor was so much incorporated into every particle of it that it was impossible under such fermentation it should work its desired effect  this however no way intimidated a little valiant gentleman though he sat the very next man from giving an opinion as diametrically opposite as east is from west  this gentleman who was by much the best geographer in the whole club and moreover second cousin to an engineer was positive the breeches meant gibraltar for if you remember gentlemen says he though possibly you dont the ichnography and plan of that town and fortress it exactly resembles a pair of trunkhose the two promontories forming the two slops etc etc  now we all know continued he that king george the first made a promise of that important pass to the king of spain  so that the whole drift of the romance according to my sense of things is merely to vindicate the king and the parliament in that transaction which made so much noise in the world  a wholesale tailor who from the beginning had resolved not to speak at all in the debate  was at last drawn into it by something very unexpected in the last persons argument  he told the company frankly he did not understand what ichnography meant  but as for the shape of a pair of breeches as he had had the advantage of cutting out so many hundred pairs in his lifetime he hoped he might be allowed to know as much of the matter as another man  now to my mind says he there is nothing in all the terraqueous globe a map of which it seems hung up in his workshop so like a pair of breeches unmade up as the island of sicily  nor is there any thing if you go to that quoth an honest shoemaker who had the honor to be a member of the club so much like a jackboot to my fancy as the kingdom of italy  what the duce has either italy or sicily to do in the affair cries the president who by this time began to tremble for his hypothesis  what have they to do  why answered the partitiontreaty gentleman with great spirit and joy sparkling in his eyes  they have just so much sir to do in the debate as to overthrow your suppositions and to establish the certainty of mine beyond the possibility of a doubt for says he with an air of sovereign triumph over the presidents politics  by the partitiontreaty sir both naples and sicily were the very kingdoms made to devolve upon the dauphin  and trims greasing the parsons boots is a devilish satirical stroke  for it exposes the corruption and bribery made use of at that juncture in bringing over the several states and princes of italy to use their interests at rome to stop the pope from giving the investitures of those kingdoms to any body else  the pope has not the investiture of sicily cries another gentleman  i care not says he for that  almost every one apprehended the debate to be now ended and that no one member would venture any new conjecture upon the romance after so many clear and decisive interpretations had been given but hold  close to the fire and opposite to where the apothecary sat there sat also a gentleman of the law who from the beginning to the end of the hearing of this cause seemed no way satisfied in his conscience with any one proceeding in it this gentleman had not yet opened his mouth but had waited patiently till they had all gone through their several evidences on the other side  reserving himself like an expert practitioner for the last word in the debate when the partitiontreatygentleman had finished what he had to say  he got up  and advancing toward the table told them that the error they had all gone upon thus far in making out the several facts in the romance  was in looking too high which with great candor he said was a very natural thing and very excusable withal in such a political club as theirs for instance continues he you have been searching the registers and looking into the deeds of kings and emperors  as if nobody had any deeds to show or compare the romance to but themselves  this continued the attorney is just as much out of the way of good practice as if i should carry a thing slapdash into the house of lords which was under forty shillings and might be decided in the next county court for six shillings and eightpence  he then took the romance in his left hand and pointing with the forefinger of his right toward the second page he humbly begged leave to observe and to do him justice he did it in somewhat of a forensic air that the parson john and sexton showed incontestably the thing to be tripartite now if you will take notice gentlemen says he these several persons who are parties to this instrument are merely ecclesiastical that the readingdesk pulpitcloth and velvet cushion are tripartite too and are by intendment of law goods and chattles merely of an ecclesiastic nature belonging and appertaining only unto them and to them only  so that it appears very plain to me that the romance neither directly nor indirectly goes upon temporal but altogether upon church matters  and do not you think says he softening his voice a little and addressing himself to the parson with a forced smile  do not you think doctor says he that the dispute in the romance between the parson of the parish and john about the height of johns desk is a very fine panegyric upon the humility of churchmen  i think says the parson it is much of the same fineness with that which your profession is complimented with in the pimping dirty pettyfogging character of trim  which in my opinion sir is just such another panegyric upon the honesty of attorneys  nothing whets the spirits like an insult  therefore the parson went on with a visible superiority and an uncommon acuteness  as you are so happy sir continues he in making applications  pray turn over a page or two to the black lawletters in the romance  what do you think of them sir  nay  pray read the grant of the great watchcoat  and trims renunciation of the breeches  why there is downright lease and release for you  it is the very thing man  only with this small difference  and in which consists the whole strength of the panegyric  that the author of the romance has conveyed and reconveyd in about ten lines  what you with the glorious prolixity of the law could not have crowded into as many skins of parchment  the apothecary who had paid the attorney the same afternoon a demand of three pounds six shillings and eightpence for much such another jobb  was so highly tickled with the parsons repartee in that particular point  that he rubbed his hands together most fervently  and laughed most triumphantly thereupon  this could not escape the attorneys notice any more than the cause of it did escape his penetration  i think sir says he dropping his voice a third you might well have spared this immoderate mirth since you and your profession have the least reason to triumph here of any of us  i beg quoth he that you would reflect a moment upon the cobweb which trim went so far for and brought back with an air of so much importance in his breeches pocket to lay upon the parsons cut finger  this said cobweb sir is a finespun satyr upon the flimsy nature of one half of the shopmedicines with which you make a property of the sick the ignorant and the unsuspecting  and as for the moral of the closestoolpan sir it is too plain  does not nine parts in ten of the whole practice and of all you vend under its colors pass into and concenter in that one nasty utensil  and let me tell you sir says he raising his voice  had not your unseasonable mirth blinded you you might have seen that trims carrying the closestoolpan upon his head the whole length of the town without blushing is a pointed raillery  and one of the sharpest sarcasms sir that ever was thrown out upon you  for it unveils the solemn impudence of the whole profession who i see are ashamed of nothing which brings in money  there were two apothecaries in the club besides the surgeon mentioned before with a chemist and an undertaker who all felt themselves equally hurt and aggrieved by this discourteous retort  and they were all five rising up together from their chairs with full intent of heart as it was thought to return the reproof valiant thereupon  but the president fearing it would end in a general engagement he instantly called out to order  and gave notice that if there was any member in the club who had not yet spoke and yet did desire to speak upon the main subject of the debate  that he should immediately be heard  this was a happy invitation for a stammering member who it seems had but a weak voice at the best and having often attempted to speak in the debate but to no purpose had sat down in utter despair of an opportunity  this member you must know had got a sad crush upon his hip in the late election which gave him intolerable anguish  so that in short he could think of nothing else  for which cause and others he was strongly of opinion that the whole romance was a just gird at the late york election and i think says he that the promise of the breeches broke may well and truly signify somebodys else promise which was broke and occasioned so much disturbance amongst us   thus every man turned the story to what was swimming uppermost in his own brain  so that before all was over there were full as many satyrs spun out of it  and as great a variety of personages opinions transactions and truths found to lay hid under the dark veil of its allegory as ever were discovered in the thricerenowned history of the acts of gargantua and pantagruel  at the close of all and just before the club was going to break up  mr president rose from his chair and begged leave to make the two following motions which were instantly agreed to without any division  first gentlemen says he as trims character in the romance of a shuffling intriguing fellow  whoever it was drawn for is in truth as like the french king as it can stare  i move that the romance be forthwith printed  for continues he if we can but once turn the laugh against him and make him ashamed of what he has done it may be a great means with the blessing of god upon our fleets and armies to save the liberties of europe  in the second place i move that mr attorney our worthy member be desired to take minutes upon the spot of every conjecture which has been made upon the romance by the several members who have spoke which i think says he will answer two good ends   st it will establish the political knowledge of our club for ever and place it in a respectable light to all the world  in the next place it will furnish what will be wanted that is a key to the romance  in troth you might have said a whole bunch of keys quoth a whitesmith who was the only member in the club who had not said something in the debate but let me tell you mr president says he that the right key if it could but be found would be worth the whole bunch put together
