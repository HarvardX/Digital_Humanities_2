prithee philosopher what grand affair is transacting upon earth there is something of importance going forward i am sure for mercury flew over the styx this morning without paying me the usual compliments   aesop i will tell thee charon this is the anniversary of the rape of proserpine on which day for the future pluto has permitted her to demand from him something for the benefit of mankind   char i understand you  his majestys passions by a long possession of the lady are abated and so like a mere mortal he must now flatter her vanity and sacrifice his power to atone for deficiencies  but what has our royal mistress proposed in behalf of her favorite mortals   aesop as mankind you know are ever complaining of their cares and dissatisfied with their conditions the generous proserpine has begged of pluto that they may have free access to the waters of lethe as a sovereign remedy for their complaints  notice has been already given above and proclamation made mercury is to conduct them to the styx you are to ferry em over to elysium and i am placed here to distribute the waters   char a very pretty employment i shall have of it truly if her majesty has often these whims i must petition the court either to build a bridge over the river or let me resign my employment do their majestys know the difference of weight between souls and bodies however i will obey their commands to the best of my power i will row my crazy boat over and meet em but many of them will be relieved from their cares before they reach lethe   aesop how so charon   char why i shall leave half of em in the styx and any water is a specific against care provided it be taken in quantity   enter mercury mer away to your boat charon there are some mortals arrived and the females among em will be very clamorous if you make em wait   cha i will make what haste i can rather than give those fair creatures a topic for conversation  noise within boat boat boat coming  coming  zounds you are in a plaguey hurry sure  no wonder these mortal folks have so many complaints when there is no patience among em if they were dead now and to be settled here for ever they would be damned before they would make such a rout to come over  but care i suppose is thirsty and till they have drenched themselves with lethe there will be no quiet among em therefore i will even to work

immediately relieve real objects and only divert myself with pretenders   mer act as your wisdom directs and conformable to your earthly character and we shall have few murmurers   aesop i still retain my former sentiments never to refuse advice or charity to those that want either flattery and rudeness should be equally avoided folly and vice should never be spared and though by acting thus you may offend many yet you will please the better few and the approbation of one virtuous mind is more valuable than all the noisy applause and uncertain favors of the great and guilty   mer incomparable aesop both men and gods admire thee we must now prepare to receive these mortals and lest the solemnity of the place should strike em with too much dread i will raise music shall dispel their fears and embolden them to approach   song i ye mortals whom fancies and troubles perplex whom folly misguides and infirmities vex whose lives hardly know what it is to be blessed who rise without joy and lie down without rest obey the glad summons to lethe repair drink deep of the stream and forget all your care ii old maids shall forget what they wish for in vain and young ones the

complaints without the acknowledgment of one single vice  here he comes  if one may guess at his cares by his appearance he really wants the assistance of lethe   enter poet poet sir your humble servant  your humble servant  your name is aesop  i know your person intimately though i never saw you before and am well acquainted with you though i never had the honor of your conversation   aesop you are a dealer in paradoxes friend   poet i am a dealer in all parts of speech and in all the figures of rhetoric  i am a poet sir  and to be a poet and not acquainted with the great aesop is a greater paradox than  i honor you extremely sir you certainly of all the writers of antiquity had the greatest the sublimest genius the    aesop hold friend i hate flattery   poet my own taste exactly  i assure you sir no man loves flattery less than myself   aesop so it appears sir by your being so ready to give it away   poet you have hit it mr aesop you have hit it  i have given it away indeed  i did not receive one farthing for my last dedication and yet would you believe it  i absolutely gave all the virtues in heaven to one of the lowest reptiles upon earth   aesop it is hard indeed to do dirty work for nothing   poet ay sir to do dirty work and still be dirty oneself is the stone of sysiphus and the thirst of tantalus  you greek writers indeed carried your point by truth and simplicity  they will not do now adays  our patrons must be tickled into generosity  you gained the greatest favors by showing your own merits we can only gain the smallest by publishing those of other people  you flourished by truth we starve by fiction tempora mutantur   aesop indeed friend if we may guess by your present plight you have prostituted your talents to very little purpose   poet to very little upon my word  but they shall find that i can open another vein  satire is the fashion and satire they shall have  let em look to it i can be sharp as well as sweet  i can scourge as well as tickle i can bite as    aesop you can do any thing no doubt but to the business of this visit for i expect a great deal of company  what are your troubles sir   poet why mr aesop i am troubled with an odd kind of a disorder  i have a sort of a whistling  a singing  a whizzing as it were in my head which i cannot get rid of    aesop our waters give no relief to bodily disorders they only affect the memory   poet from whence all my disorder proceeds  i will tell you my case sir  you must know i wrote a play some time ago presented a dedication of it to a certain young nobleman  he approved and accepted of it but before i could taste his bounty my piece was unfortunately damned  i lost my benefit nor could i have recourse to my patron for i was told that his lordship played the best catcall the first night and was the merriest person in the whole audience   aesop pray what do you call damning a play    poet you cannot possibly be ignorant what it is to be damned mr aesop   aesop indeed i am sir  we had no such thing among the greeks   poet no sir  no wonder then that you greeks were such fine writers  it is impossible to be described or truly felt but by the author himself  if you could but get a leave of absence from this world for a few hours you might perhaps have an opportunity of seeing it yourself  there is a sort of a new piece comes upon our stage this very night and i am pretty sure it will meet with its deserts at least it shall not want my helping hand rather than you should be disappointed of satisfying your curiosity   aesop you are very obliging sir  but to your own misfortunes if you please   poet envy malice and party destroyed me  you must know sir i was a great damner myself before i was damned  so the frolicks of my youth were returned to me with double interest from my brother authors  but to say the truth my performance was terribly handled before it appeared in public   aesop how so pray   poet why sir some squeamish friends of mine pruned it of all the bawdy and immorality the actors did not speak a line of the sense or sentiment and the manager who writes himself struck out all the wit and humor in order to lower my performance to a level with his own   aesop now sir i am acquainted with your case what have you to propose   poet notwithstanding the success of my first play i am strongly persuaded that my next may defy the severity of critics the sneer of wits and the malice of authors   aesop what have you been hardy enough to attempt another   poet i must eat sir  i must live  but when i sit down to write and am glowing with the heat of my imagination then  this damned whistling  or whizzing in my head that i told you of so disorders me that i grow giddy  in short sir i am haunted as it were with the ghost of my deceased play and its dying groans are for ever in my ears  now sir if you will give me but a draught of lethe to forget this unfortunate performance it will be of more real service to me than all the waters of helicon   aesop i doubt friend you cannot possibly write better by merely forgetting that you have written before besides if when you drink to the forgetfulness of your own works you should unluckily forget those of other people too your next piece will certainly be the worse for it   poet you are certainly in the right  what then would you advise me to   aesop suppose you could prevail upon the audience to drink the water their forgetting your former work might be of no small advantage to your future productions   poet ah sir if i could but do that  but i am afraid  lethe will never go down with the audience   aesop well since you are bent upon it i shall indulge you  if you please to walk in that grove which will afford you many subjects for your poetical contemplation till i have examined the rest i will dismiss you in your turn   poet and i in return sir will let the world know in a preface to my next piece that your politeness is equal to your sagacity and that you are as much the fine gentleman as the philosopher exit poet   aesop oh your servant sir  in the name of misery and mortality what have we here   enter an old man supported by a servant old man oh la oh bless me i shall never recover the fatigue  ha what are you friend are you the famous aesop and are you so kind so very good to give people the waters of forgetfulness for nothing   aesop i am that person sir but you seem to have no need of my waters for you must have already outlived your memory   old man my memory is indeed impaired it is not so good as it was but still it is better than i wish it at least in regard to one circumstance there is one thing which sits very heavy at my heart and which i would willingly forget   aesop what is it pray   old man oh la  oh  i am horribly fatigued  i am an old man sir turned of ninety  we are all mortal you know so i would fain forget if you please  that i am to die   aesop my good friend you have mistaken the virtue of the waters they can cause you to forget only what is past but if this was in their power you would surely be your own enemy in desiring to forget what ought to be the only comfort of one so poor and wretched as you seem what i suppose now you have left some dear loving wife behind that you cannot bear to think of parting with   old man no no no i have buried my wife and forgot her long ago   aesop what you have children then whom you are unwilling to leave behind you   old man no no i have no children at present  hugh  i dont know what i may have   aesop is there any relation or friend the loss of whom    old man no no i have outlived all my relations and as for friends  i have none to lose    aesop what can be the reason then that in all this apparent misery you are so afraid of death which would be your only cure   old man  oh lord  i have one friend and a true friend indeed the only friend in whom a wise man places any confidence  i have  get a little farther off john  servant retires i have to say the truth a little money  it is that indeed which causes all my uneasiness   aesop thou never spokst a truer word in thy life old gentleman  aside but i can cure you of your uneasiness immediately   old man shall i forget then that i am to die and leave my money behind me   aesop no  but you shall forget that you have it  which will do altogether as well  one large draught of lethe to the forgetfulness of your money will restore you to perfect ease of mind and as for your bodily pains no waters can relieve them   old man what does he say john  eh  i am hard of hearing   john he advises your worship to drink to forget your money   old man what  what  will his drink get me money does he say   aesop no sir the waters are of a wholsomer nature  for they will teach you to forget your money   old man will they so  come come john we are got to the wrong place  the pool old fool here does not know what he says  let us go back again john  i will drink none of your waters not i  forget my money come along john  exeunt aesop was there ever such a wretch if these are the cares of mortals the waters of oblivion cannot cure them   reenter old man and servant old man lookee sir i am come a great way and am loath to refuse favors that cost nothing  so i dont care if i drink a little of your waters  let me see  ay  i will drink to forget how i got my money  and my servant there he shall drink a little to forget that i have any money at all  and do you hear john  take a hearty draught if my money must be forgot why even let him forget it   aesop well friend it shall be as you would have it  you will find a seat in that grove yonder where you may rest yourself till the waters are distributed   old man i hope it will not be long sir for thieves are busy now  and i have an iron chest in the other world that i should be sorry any one peeped into but myself  so pray be quick sir  exeunt aesop patience patience old gentleman  but here comes something tripping this way that seems to be neither man nor woman and yet an odd mixture of both   enter a fine gentleman fine gent harkee old friend do you stand drawer here   aesop drawer young fop do you know where you are and who you talk to   fine gent not i them me but it is a rule with me wherever i am or whoever i am with to be always easy and familiar   aesop then let me advise you young gentleman to drink the waters and forget that ease and familiarity   fine gent why so daddy would you not have me well bred   aesop yes but you may not always meet with people so polite as yourself or so passive as i am and if what you call breeding should be construed impertinence you may have a return of familiarity may make you repent your education as long as you live   fine gent well said old drybeard egad you have a smattering of an odd kind of a sort of a humor but come come prithee give me a glass of your waters and keep your advice to yourself   aesop i must first be informed sir for what purpose you drink em   fine gent you must know philosopher i want to forget two qualities  my modesty and my goodnature   aesop your modesty and goodnature   fine gent yes sir  i have such a consummate modesty that when a fine woman which is often the case yields to my addresses egad i run away from her and i am so very goodnatured that when a man affronts me egad i run away too   aesop as for your modesty sir i am afraid you are come to the wrong waters  and if you will take a large cup to the forgetfulness of your fears your goodnature i believe will trouble you no more   fine gent and this is your advice my dear eh   aesop my advice sir would go a great deal farther  i should advise you to drink to the forgetfulness of every thing you know   fine gent the devil you would then i should have traveled to a fine purpose truly you dont imagine perhaps that i have been three years abroad and have made the tour of europe   aesop yes sir i guessed you had traveled by your dress and conversation but pray with submission what valuable improvements have you made in these travels   fine gent sir i learnt drinking in germany music and painting in italy dancing gaming and some other amusements at paris and in holland  faith nothing at all i brought over with me the best collection of venetian ballads two eunuchs a french dancer and a monkey with toothpicks pictures and burlettas  in short i have skimd the cream of every nation and have the consolation to declare i never was in any country in my life but i had taste enough thoroughly to despise my own   aesop your country is greatly obliged to you  but if you are settled in it now how can your taste and delicacy endure it   fine gent faith my existence is merely supported by amusements i dress visit study taste and write sonnets by birth travel education and natural abilities i am entitled to lead the fashion i am principal connoisseur at all auctions chief arbiter at assemblies professed critic at the theaters and a fine gentleman  every where    aesop critic sir pray what is that   fine gent the delight of the ingenious the terror of poets the scourge of players and the aversion of the vulgar   aesop pray sir for i fancy your life must be somewhat particular how do you pass your time the day for instance   fine gent i lie in bed all day sir   aesop how do you spend your evenings then   fine gent i dress in the evening and go generally behind the scenes of both playhouses not you may imagine to be diverted with the play but to intrigue and show myself  i stand upon the stage talk loud and stare about  which confounds the actors and disturbs the audience upon which the galleries who hate the appearance of one of us begin to hiss and cry off off while i undaunted stamp my foot so  loll with my shoulder thus  take snuff with my right hand and smile scornfully  thus  this exasperates the savages and they attack us with vollies of sucked oranges and half eaten pippins    aesop and you retire   fine gent without doubt if i am sober  for orange will stain silk and an apple may disfigure a feature   aesop i am afraid sir for all this that you are obliged to your own imagination for more than three fourths of your importance   fine gent damn the old prig i will bully him  aside lookee old philosopher i find you have passed your time so long in gloom and ignorance below here that our notions above stairs are too refined for you so as we are not likely to agree i shall cut matters very short with you  bottle me off the waters i want or you shall be convinced that i have courage in the drawing of a cork  dispatch me instantly or i shall make bold to throw you into the river and help myself  what say you to that now eh   aesop very civil and concise i have no great inclination to put your manhood to the trial so if you will be pleased to walk in the grove there till i have examined some i see coming well compromise the affair between us   fine gent yours as you behave  au revoir exit beau   enter mr and mrs tatoo mrs tatoo why dont you come along mr tatoo what the deuce are you afraid of   aesop dont be angry young lady the gentleman is your husband i suppose   mrs tat how do you know that eh what you ant all conjurers in this world are you   aesop your behavior to him is a sufficient proof of his condition without the gift of conjuration   mrs tat why i was as free with him before marriage as i am now i never was coy or prudish in my life   aesop i believe you madam pray how long have you been married you seem to be very young lady   mrs tat i am old enough for a husband and have been married long enough to be tired of one   aesop how long pray   mrs tat why above three months i married mr tatoo without my guardians consent   aesop if you married him with your own consent i think you might continue your affections a little longer   mrs tat what signifies what you think if i dont think so  we are quite tired of one another and are come to drink some of your le  lethaly  leithily i think they call it to forget one another and be unmarried again   aesop the waters cannot divorce you madam and you may easily forget him without the assistance of lethe   mrs tat ay how so   aesop by remembering continually he is your husband there are several ladies have no other receipt  but what does the gentleman say to this   mrs tat what signifies what he says i ant so young and so foolish as that comes to to be directed by my husband or to care what either he says or you say   mr tat sir i was a drummer in a marching regiment when i ran away with that young lady  i immediately bought out of the corpse and thought myself made for ever little imagining that a poor vain fellow was purchasing fortune at the expense of his happiness   aesop it is even so friend fortune and felicity are as often at variance as man and wife   mr tat i found it so sir  this high life as i thought it did not agree with me i have not laughed and scarcely slept since my advancement and unless your wisdom can alter her notions i must even quit the blessings of a fine lady and her portion and for content have recourse to eightpence a day and my drum again   aesop pray who has advised you to a separation   mrs tat several young ladies of my acquaintance who tell me they are not angry at me for marrying him but being fond of him now i have married him and they say i should be as complete a fine lady as any of em if i would but procure a separate divorcement   aesop pray madam will you let me know what you call a fine lady   mrs tat why a fine lady and a fine gentleman are two of the finest things upon earth   aesop i have just now had the honor of knowing what a fine gentleman is so pray confine yourself to the lady   mrs tat a fine lady before marriage lives with her papa and mama who breed her up till she learns to despise em and resolves to do nothing they bid her this makes her such a prodigious favorite that she wants for nothing   aesop so lady   mrs tat when once she is her own mistress then comes the pleasure    aesop pray let us hear   mrs tat she lies in bed all morning rattles about all day and sits up all night she goes every where and sees every thing knows every body and loves no body ridicules her friends coquets with her lovers sets em together by the ears tells fibs makes mischief buys china cheats at cards keeps a pugdog and hates the parsons she laughs much talks aloud never blushes says what she will does what she will goes where she will marries whom she pleases hates her husband in a month breaks his heart in four becomes a widow slips from her gallants and begins the world again  there is a life for you what do you think of a fine lady now   aesop as i expected  you are very young lady and if you are not very careful your natural propensity to noise and affectation will run you headlong into folly extravavagance and repentance   mrs tat what would you have me do   aesop drink a large quantity of lethe to the loss of your acquaintance and do you sir drink another to forget this false step of your wife for whilst you remember her folly you can never thoroughly regard her and whilst you keep good company lady as you call it and follow their example you can never have a just regard for your husband so both drink and be happy   mrs tat well give it me whilst i am in humor or i shall certainly change my mind again   aesop be patient till the rest of the company drink and divert yourself in the mean time with walking in the grove   mrs tat well come along husband and keep me in humor or i shall beat
