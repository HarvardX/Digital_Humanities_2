oculus britanniae an herpanegyrical poem on the university of oxford  illustrated with diverse beautiful similes and useful digressions   juvat antiquos exquirere fontes  london printed for r francklin under tomscoffeehse covent garden      price oneshilling  to thomas p  r  t esquire doctor of civil law and fellow of st j  s c  e in o  d sir i believe you are a gentleman who is not unwilling that his actions should be faithfully transmitted to posterity and as nobody can have a more sensible regard for your great virtues and abilities than my self i beg leave to make the world acquainted with them in the following dedication  you came into the world sir under the influence of a lucky planet being born of an ancient and worthy family to a plentiful fortune as well as great natural endowments and hereditary virtues all which you have since improved by a liberal education under the care of one of the ablest pillars of our church and as his ingenious friend mr mist emphatically styles him the brightest ornament of the brightest body in the world by his precepts and example you have finished in your self one of the finest gentlemen and greatest scholars of our age  transplanting one by one into your life his bright perfections till you shine like him it is impossible that one thus richly endowed by nature and improved by art should not make a very extraordinary figure you discovered the earliest marks of a great genius and at an age when we say of others that they are promising youths you were arrived at the highest perfection and maturity of manhood you brought with you from school a thorough knowledge of the classical writers and the learned languages so that you had nothing to interrupt your stricter academical studies by which means and a close application you soon became a deep logician a profound philosopher and an excellent mathematician in short you grew a complete master of most arts and sciences particularly necromancy and metaphysics and no part of learning has entirely escaped your knowledge  nor have you cultivated your head only which in this age is the least part of a liberal character but even your heels sir discover the marks of an academical education that pretty flutter in your gait that careless swing of your arms and that polite turn of your head may to some people seem only to be the natural effect of well proportioned limbs and a regular body but to a nice observer every motion will appear syllogistical and strictly conformable to mode and figure how often have i seen you come into a room in barbara and salute the company in darii how often do you pay your devotions in ferio and dance in baralipton as this is an art perhaps peculiar to yourself and the author of mathematical rules for dancing it is no wonder that you have gained the character of the politest gentleman in the university and triumphed over all your rivals in the affections of the ladies  but i must not dwell too long upon one of your most trifling qualifications considering how many there are still behind and how narrow a compass my bookseller has prescribed me to celebrate them in  give me leave therefore learned sir in a cursory manner to mention your humanity candor and public spirit your acute wit unbiased judgment and penetrating understanding your nice sense of honor magnanimity and intrepid courage your chastity sobriety and unspotted virtue but above all your unshaken loyalty in the true sense of the word your invincible orthodoxy and strict adherence to the catholic church  your intimate acquaintance with the modern languages and your profound skill in modern history are so well known that it would be matter of great astonishment to me how you could escape being nominated to a certain prof  ip lately established if i did not consider how some people  i can hardly keep it in notwithstanding all their pains and penalties but we were pretty even with them at last and i am sure it is no disappointment to you who choose to do good and propagate knowledge without any reward  with all these shining accomplishments however you may be despised elsewhere you could not fail of acquiring a very popular reputation in the famous university of oxford which amidst the general depravity of mankind and the lamentable increase of fanaticism both in church and state has maintained its ancient purity in the worst of times even as our ingenious professor of poetry once observed whilst armed forces were within our walls accordingly you have proceeded in the regular method prescribed by our statutes too slow indeed for your aspiring merit to the highest degree which our university can confer and whenever you shall please to oblige the world with any of those valuable manuscripts which enrich your cabinet you may dignify the title page with fellow of a college and doctor of civil law  having said thus much which is much too little of you my present most honored patron give me leave sir with the imputation of as little vanity as possible to say something of my self and my following performance  you must know sir that i have been several years a matriculated son of this ancient university and though for want of the same natural talents and the same application i have not done the good old lady half the honor which you have done nor received half so many honors from her hands yet i shall never forget the obligations which i lie under to her for that small portion of learning which i possess and that little figure which i make in the world a due sense of these obligations joined with a violent indignation to see her traduced and vilified by some persons who ought to know and practice better has occasioned the following sheets in which i have endeavored to perpetuate her name and to raise up a column of my own gratitude that it may not be said of me in future ages as i fear it will be of too many that i would not look to the rock from whence i was hewn nor to the pit from whence i was dug  i cannot in this place forbear assuring you that when i first resolved upon this undertaking you jumped immediately into my head as the fittest person to patronize it and i have not been able with all my deliberation to alter my opinion ever since so that you see it was by a sort of inspiration that i desire your protection of this work  i know the conclusion of my poem where i presage my own future glory will be particulary cavild at and i shall be called a vain conceited coxcomb for my pains but in answer to this without insisting on the examples of horace and ovid in the same case i say that it is an intolerable grievance upon modern authors to be restrained from commending their own works no body expects that the good wives of ilingsgate should cry stinking fish or that any vintner in town should tell you that his wine is sour nay every surly rascal of a shoemaker shall take the liberty to look you saucily in the face when he puts you to execrable torture with a pair of new shoes and swear that they sit as easy as your mistresss gloves whereas it is expected of an author that he should cry down his own ware and though he publishes a better poem than ever homer or virgil did should make a thousand excuses for troubling the world with such indifferent stuff as he is obliged to call it to the manifest hinderance of his market and against the fullest conviction of his own mind i think therefore every manufacturer of the brain ought to rise up against this growing evil and assert the same right with all other tradesmen and artificers to warrant his goods and thereby promote the sale of them as much as he can  for my part though i do not think my self vainer than other men i will venture to affirm in defiance of all the critics and ignorant carping rascals in england that the following poem is a perfect finished piece according to the strictest rules of aristotle and longinus whom i will be again bold to say no body has studied more or understands better than my self i maintain that the model is just and regular the diction truly sublime and the panegyric well hit off if it be objected that i have now and then introduced little sarcasms and strokes of satire i have virgil horace and all the best authors both ancient and modern to justify me in such occasional deviations  i have also their authority as i could easily prove from a multitude of instances to apologize for the many beautiful similes and useful digressions with which i have thought fit to illustrate and diversify the whole they are all on my side and so i have no apprehensions from them but i am terribly afraid of a certain merry gentleman in this town who frequently says that there is nothing in the world so unlike as similes he might with the same reason add and i hope he will do it that nothing is so pertinent as digressions this will make us some amends and give us with one hand what he takes away with the other  as for my self i have labored to make my similes as like and my digressions as pertinent as possibly i could i am sure it has cost me a great deal of pains as i doubt not it has most authors to bring them in and make them look pat to the purpose nay i could not with all my pains lug in some which i was not a little fond of and particularly the following distich  so barren chalk which no production yields burnt into lime manures the neighboring fields you must allow sir that this is a very pretty simile and if it could but be handsomely applied would make a good figure in my poem but after the strictest examination i could not hedge it in any where in the following pages and being loath that so uncommon a thought should be lost i have inserted it in this place making it my request that if you or any of my candid readers can think of any method to introduce it properly into the body of my work you will oblige me with the hint and the favor shall be gratefully acknowledged in the second edition  i had also a mind to foist in a digression against the late bills for inspecting drugs medicines etc and for excising of tea coffee and chocolate but not being able to discover any relation which they have to the university of oxford i was obliged to reserve it for a more proper occasion  sir i was going on to acquaint you with some more of my projects but my bookseller is just come in and tells me that i must break off immediately and that he cannot afford a line more for a shilling which is the price we have agreed to fix upon this summerpiece of entertainment for gentlemen and ladies what therefore i have farther to say to you upon this and all other occasions must be deferred till another opportunity which you may depend upon shall not be neglected by  learned sir your unknown admirer and devoted servant philomusus oxford july         oculus britanniae etc matron of arts and to the british youth thou shining pillar of religious truth sprung from primaeval kings and saints divine

celestial art and with the same devotion fire my heart enough enough  through every kindling vein thy godlike fury shoots and fires my brain the same strong impulse and religious flame which in the pulpit shakes thy goodly frame and which sometimes provokes thy righteous heel to kick obdurate whigs in rampant zeal like yours methinks my eyes in lightning roll like yours tumultuous raptures lift my soul inspired i soar beyond my common flight and i am either fit to rhyme or fight in this divine delirium to my eyes abstracted forms and fancied objects rise whilst the pleased muse in thoughtful silence roves through the cool shades and academick groves in the clear fountains and the silvan springs sees the young cygnets dip their snowy wings observes the streams of science roll along here floats a syllogism there a song here unborn poems tune the warbling tide and problems there instead of gudgeons glide through these religious valleys as i stray what crowds of ancient worthies throng

horrible and wan whose meagre looks declare the quondam man hail mighty scotus hail unrivaled sage the pride and glory of the monkish age reverse of bookworm which on books is fed for books devoured

logic flows and so profound no common plummet can the bottom sound thy pride it was to sift the darkest themes to hoodwink truth and reconcile extremes selfcontradicting tenets to maintain and prove

his eye and damns his sovereign as he passes by some minion of the court from favor thrown and lo his form bespeaks the butchers son in every look great wolsey stands confessed see how the rising passion heaves his breast see how his eyes with reddening vengeance glow and how with hasty strides he spurns the sand below fall down ye sons of christchurch at his feet and gratefully your benefactor greet for o remember to his bounteous hand how much indebted and obliged you stand he first with large endowments did intail your loins of mutton and your butts of ale to him you owe the soft engaging art of pretty songs and epigrams so smart twas he that took you from the rural plains and made you scholards who had else been swains instead of jolly canons you had now perhaps some livery worn or followed plow perhaps some painful servile life have led or in the shambles like himself been bred malicious tongues indeed with censures loud style him imperious turbulent and proud revengeful cruel of a ruthless mind to persecution and to rage inclined in whoredom and pollution uncontrolled and to a proverb arrogantly bold a public drunkard and a college thief in act a brute an atheist in belief to lust they say he sacrificed his breath and perished of the foul venereal death such heavy loads of infamy and shame our bold reformers charge on wolseys name proud of their northern heresies deride his priestly grandeur and religious pride hand down his vices to succeeding times and make his function aggravate his crimes but fiddes by sublimer views inspired and with a churchmans indignation fired lists in this great unhappy prelates cause and by more candid rules his picture draws solves all objections which historians make and screens his failings for his functions sake behold him now by fiddes varnished over unlike the monstrous fiend you shunned before his magic pages wipe off every taint the atheist and the brute becomes a saint his drunkenness is only natures slip for who alas can from temptation keep his impudence in courtly language dressed the sea his life of wolsey p       great ascendant happily expressed his rage is only zeal for romish

collegefrauds it must be understood were well designed and for the public good to finish towers old steeples to repair and build religious castles in the air nor is he last of all that godly crowd to whom this candid plea has been allowed that of the pox he died and such like stuff great fiddes says it is false and that is enough so laud by heylin filled and polished bright shines forth an angel of unspotted light shakes off the rust of threescore gloomy years and in his volume like a god appears one pious work o fiddes still remains a theme well worthy your immortal pains and since in vindications you abound as wolsey and his grace see his vindication of a late epitaph have lately found to one great churchman more your aid afford and let unhappy judas be the third in his defense at least it may be said that what he did alas he did for bread and erred poor man as modern swearers cant to save a numerous family from want doctor twill do the pious task begin clear up his case and

that frugal head who grudges even himself his daily bread of so penurious provident a sense he curses human life for its expense and often wishes he was under ground rather than lose a penny in the pound candles are dear and therefore he thinks best still with the setting sun to go to rest unless to finish something for his shop fletcher will pay him well for sitting up yet few i fear will think it worth their while so languid is his matter and his style to publish all the volumes he could write poor whstr was alas half ruined by it with half a fowl and half a penny small he makes a sober dinner in the hall such slender meals suffice his famished nerves and the minced fragment for his supper serves stooping with age he dodders as he goes from his red eyes a rheumy torrent flows like winter fruit his yellow riveld skin dams up the little blood that creeps within threescore and ten have quenched his vital heat and his decaying pulses scarcely beat yet thus disabled for the longing dame he feels the pangs of love though not the flame fair raggabel that near his collegegate fine china sells and tea and chocolate or mends old tattered gowns with matchless art shines in his eye and triumphs in his heart often to her shop the feeble lecher strays toys with her hand or with her bubbies plays on her dear face he rolls his doting eyes as she weighs coffee or the needle plies one evening prostrate on his tottering knees the sapless dotard spoke in words like these behold o fairest of those gentle maids who with their beauty grace these learned shades behold what conquests thy perfections gain a reverend aged doctor wears thy chain me whom a college for its head obeys to whom each fellow servile homage pays thy beauty captivates thy charms inthral even at these years a slave to love i fall and o my dearest raggy do not quite break my old heart or judge my torments slight unlike raw boys who tell you fulsome lies adore this moment and the next despise ripened with age my passion cannot change nor will my years permit my heart to range smile on me then and with thy blooming charms bless my desiring my impatient arms one evening at my lodgings let me prove with how much truth and constancy i love the damsel though with wit not overstockd with this severe reply his reverence shocked what pity is it that desire should last and the good will to sin when youth is past thy passions still remain thrice holy drone and ah i grieve to think the sting is gone yes i behold thee with a pitying eye and for my sake good man thou shall not dye since at your lodgings you request my sight i will wait upon you there to morrow night safe in thy hands my virtue i will trust and do dear doctor do thy very worst be not so mighty smart the don replied nor judge so rashly ever my strength is tried in me the emblem of a leek is seen white though my head be turned my tail is green but whither does the muse erroneous stray by tales of love diverted from her way gardener upbraids my ears with cold neglect and from the muse demands his due respect forbear great man restrain thy flowing gall wherefore on me do all these censures fall why should thou hope for honor from my lays when thy own young forgets to sing thy praise what shall a patriot lose his due reward because ill used by one ungrateful bard your pardon sir the reasoning i allow and with these honors deck your lofty brow if size and stature raise a deathless name how vast your praise how bulky is your fame without a rival sir the streets you tread thou greatest wittiest man now tadloes dead since that huge atlas fell you reap alone the thanks of all the alluding to the following epigram when tadloe walks the streets the paviers cry god bless you sir and throw their rammers by  paviers in the town nor must thy praise o taffy be forgot another college prince and tyrant sot to g  d  r next in learning and in size somewhat more honest and almost as wise his sanguine cheeks with deep vermilion glow with antientbritish blood his veins overflow his countrys native ire inflames his breast and hostile leeks nod dreadful on his crest like proud plinlimmons height he seems to move and his broad shoulders prop the clouds above heaven to this man unusual vigor gave to rule a college obstinately brave youths all endued with more than vulgar flame and stubborn as the rocks from whence they came hard to restrain by nature prone to rage no common arm their fury can assuage so much with sparks of vengeance they abound they knock opposing bargemen to the ground and like a tempest hurl destruction round fain would i next great d  son rehearse and greet him with new honors in my verse o might i call him by that awful name which his soul covets and his merits claim how would it touch the cockles of my heart in ordinance to see him bear his part against upstart masters wage confederate war and a place so called where the sculls of colleges meet about business golgotha receive another star full well he knows this office to acquit and must be owned for college business fit oer passive fellows skilled to domineer and grant to few the favor of his ear from brazen and d  e he learnt the arts to pick their pockets while he gains their hearts to be adored for breaking all their laws and tyrannize with safety and applause so romish priests esteem and reverence gain by bidding penance and imposing pain the wellfloggd zealots bless their fathers voice and in raw backs and aching bones rejoice but ah within our walls dissension reigns and modern feuds disturb the laureled plains pert upstart patriots with rebellious pride spurn at their heads and golgotha deride in bold confederate clubs and plots engage and youthful whims oppose to thoughtful age each day the hoary sages sink in power and presidents and provosts sway no more with grumbling tories factious whigs combine and against d  n  n perversely join resolved to baulk him of the darling power and ancient rights of charlots successor who after these shall animate the lyre m  th  r the present worthy v  c  r of oxford do thou my flagging verse inspire instruct the muse thy praises to rehearse and with thy shining deeds adorn my verse do thou for surely none besides can tell no mortal knows thy merits half so well but i perceive you frown upon my lays and sullenly reject the proffered praise content to wither in obscure retreat and unobserved in plenty drink and eat over awkward college pedants to preside with private grandeur and monastic pride in indolence and ease to live unknown and nod like eastern tyrants on their throne nor do thou only choose this mongrel life blessed with collegiate honors and  no wife sundry besides thy brethren of the gown like thee despising fame and wide renown preferring stated meals and frequent prayers to worldly bustles and domestic cares within their humble cells indulge the spleen men never talked of and but rarely seen with their obsequious fellows they debate in their own cloisters all affairs of state con over mist and shatter once a week and by their love of kings and statesmen speak in the same tract of commonplace they move and learn from them to censure and approve others there are  but studious of her fame fain would the muse conceal her mothers shame sore loath i am to speak the mournful truth that modern heads corrupt the lettered youth that bold fanatics full of sturdy zeal for brunswicks house disturb our commonweal grave loyal wretches of their monarch proud to collegepowr advanced infect the crowd through these unhappy walls their poison spread and strike even golgotha it self with dread since first our grannum cropped the fatal tree no spot of earth is from pollution free briers and thorns infest the richest ground and tares amongst the choicest wheat are found the fruitful nile destructive monsters breeds and even an ancient name of oxford and the country which surrounds it bellositum pruduces weeds yet bring them forth my muse to public shame and in thy numbers brand each hated name each bold apostate son who durst disgrace with heterogeneous thoughts his venerable race here wickliff first the northern errors framed and cranmer ever with abhorrence named here latimer his novel doctrines taught and ridley here for gospel license fought presumptuous prelates could they hope to live and over the ruins of the church survive how could they dare oppose such mighty odds and rashly strive with romes unnumberd gods within these walls a sacrifice they fell and in their death forestalled the pains of hell from hence degenerate from the common throng even men of sense and probity have sprung here lock the second stagyrite was bred of modern reasoning whigs the boasted head here hales of evermemorable fame and chillingworth acquired a deathless name here kennet first disclosed his godlike soul and hough a tyrants pleasure did control marsham from hence his piercing genius drew and lloyd in these abodes immortal grew here guibbons late with aesculapian skill preserved more lives than modern empericks kill friend to mankind and to his healing art joined candor and benevolence of heart on health

followed and in some degree scarce is a college from infection free to propagate this rank contagious weed even brunswick joins and sows the pregnant seed with illtimed gifts maliciously divine shakes our aversion to his german line shows that his breast with love of science burns smiles on our hate and good for ill returns from such ungrateful topics gentle muse divert thy song and nobler objects choose with more exalted themes thy numbers grace in more exalted numbers sing the place where g  l with unspotted virtue shines and at  ry formed his great designs o prelate of the church thou burning light through all thy sufferings eminently bright in vain illfortune strives to make thee less great in thy self but greater in distress transfused into thy soul by power divine lauds active zeal and wolseys spirit shine like them pursued by a corrupted age and sacrificed to wild fanatic rage ordained a living martyrdom to feel and in exotic climates broach thy zeal how in thy praise could i dilate my song but fate and rigid laws restrain my tongue our stately rising buildings set to view say how we furbish old and model new our theaters musaeums printing domes and libraries replete with folio tomes our greasy kitchens and large halls extol and vaulted cellars stored with double college ale coll our towering steeples painful to behold our roaring bells and altars daubed with gold say how our stables charm the jockys eyes and boghouses like palaces arise say farther how the cause of faction thrives for james how ready to devote our lives our hierogliphick almanacks

names in mighty numbers sing for sure no bards abound with thoughts so bright nor with the genius of our poets write to prove this truth seraphick sternhold read and withers both the right oxonian breed on sherleys comic pages cast your eyes and hear how settles lofty strains surprise our modern wits with equal luster shine angelick cotes and catcot the divine rich catheral tristram amhurst wilkes and names which rhyme and equalmeasurd verse disclaims what numbers would such rugged sounds compose which even offend the ear pronounced in prose with the same ease i could in verse sublime make a welsh pedigree harmonious chime or put the russian army into rhyme unhappy bards but others may be found whose gentle names in verse melodious sound bacon in easy numbers glides along and trap and wharton melt upon the tongue egregious wits and critics both sublime whose kindred talents so exactly chime that hard it is to say in verse or prose which happy genius more divinely flows in this alone the former does excel that trap writes most but wharton writes as well but above all record the female race the reigning toasts and beauties of the place whether in the drury lane of oxford bullockslane they choose to rove or a public house near oxford dedicated to love kidneyhall the soft retreat of love their shining virtues and their charms rehearse and vindicate their names from a scandalous libel upon the oxford toasts strephons verse in love too often interest sways the mind and sordid riches our affections blind some squeamish fops fantastically nice for virtue sigh and puke at modish vice others for titles languish and would scorn even beautys goddess if obscurely born by no such borrowed charms nor spurious arts our oxford ladies reign over youthful hearts in their own native naked charms they shine smug chambermaids and sempstresses divine smart laundresses on saturdays so clean and bedmakers on every day between the beggars offspring to the parish left and college bastards of their sires bereft nymphs without smocks our tender hearts surprise and deities in rags attract our eyes unhappy coburne lately laid in dust how to thy ashes shall the muse be just for to

aught but kings before in hymns of woe let every college join in social grief let every voice combine let every heart with bursting sighs approve our sorrow as diffusive as her love while she survived indulgent to our cause we bilkd our founders and defied their laws those grave old blockheads whose religious pride would quench loves flame and check old natures tide assuage hot blood explode the

left dejected weep wreaths and festoons the labored stone shall grace and this inscription fill the middle space  reared at the public cost this stately shrine  does the choice ashes of a bard confine  who in the first prevailing georges days  tuned his old british harp to almas praise  and in a course of bold scholastic rhimes  dared all the insults of those factious times  while marble can endure
