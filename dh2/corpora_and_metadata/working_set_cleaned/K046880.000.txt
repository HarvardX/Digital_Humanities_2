allied presumes to throw her self at the feet of your royal highness for protection the character of that excellent lady as it is delivered down to us in history is very near the same with the picture i have endeavored to draw of her and if in the poetical coloring i have aimed at heightning and improving some of the features it was only to make her more worthy of those illustrious hands to which i always intended to present her  as the british nation in general is infinitely indebted to your royal highness so every particular person amongst us ought to contribute according to their several capacitys and abilitys toward the discharging that public obligation  we are your debtors madam for the preference you gave us in choosing to wear the british rather than the imperial crown for giving the best daughter to our king and the best wife to our prince it is to your royal highness we owe the security that shall be delivered down to our childrens children by a most hopeful and beautiful as well as a numerous royal issue these are the bonds of our civil duty ut your royal highness has said us under others yet more sacred and engaging i mean those of religion you are not only the brightest ornament ut the patroness and defender of our holy faith  nor is it britain alone but the world t the present and all succeeding ages ho shall bless your royal name for the greatest example that can be given of a disinterested piety and unshaken conancy  this is what we may certainly reckon amongst the benefits your royal highness has conferred upon us tho  the same time how partial soever we ay be to our selves we ought not to believe you declined the first crown of europe in regard to britain only no madam it is in justice to your royal highness that we must confess you had more excellent motives for so great an action as that was since you did it in obedience to the dictates of reason and conscience for the sake of true religion and for the honor of god all things that are great have been offered to you and all things that are good and happy as well in this world as a better shall become the reward of such exalted virtue and piety the blessings of our nation the

sacred name shall be dear to remembrance and almighty god who alone is able shall bestow upon you the fullness of recompense  amongst the several offerings of duty which are made to you here be grasiously pleased to accept of this unworthy trifle which is with the greatest repect and lowest submission presented to your royal highness by  madam your royal highnesss most obedient most devoted and most faithful humble servant n row  preface tho i have very little inclination to writ preface before works of this nature yet upon this particular occasion i cannot but think my self obliged to give some short account of this play  justice to my self as to a very learned and ingenious  man my friend who is dead the person  mr smith of christchurch oxon one whose  i could with great pleasure enter into if it was  very well known to the world as i had the happiness to be intimately acquainted with him he often told me  signed writing a tragedy upon the story of the lady jane gray and if he had lived i should never have ought  meddling with it my self but as he died without doing  in the beginning of the last summer i resolved to undertake  and indeed the hopes i had of receiving some considerable assistances from the papers he left behind him were one of  principal motives that induced me to go about it these papers were in the hands of mr ducket to whom my fri mr tho burnett was so kind to write and procure em for me the least return i can make to those gentlemen is this public acknowledgment of their great civility on the occasion i must confess before those papers came to my and i had entirely formed the design or fable of my own play and when i came to look em over i found it was very different from that which mr smith intended the plan of his being drawn after that which is in print of mr banks at least i thought so by what i could pick out of his papers to say the truth i was a good deal surizd and disappointed at the sight of em i hoped to have et with great part of the play written to my hand or at ast the whole design regularly drawn out instead of that  found the quantity of about two quires of paper written over  odd pieces blotted interlind and confused what was ntaind in em in general was loose hints of sentiments  short obscure sketches of scenes but how they were  be applied or in what order they were to be ranged i uld not by any diligence of mine and i looked em very refully over more than once come to understand one cene there was and one only that seemed pretty near perct in which lord guilford singly persuades the lady ne to take the crown from that i borrowed all that i uld and inserted it in my own third act but indeed the er and turn of his fable was so different from mine  i could not take above five and twenty or thirty lines at  most and even in those i was obliged to make some alration i should have been very glad to have come into a rtnership of reputation with so fine a writer as mr smith  but in truth his hints were so short and dark many em marked even in shorthand that they were of little  service to me they might have served as indexes  own memory and he might have formed a play out of em but i dare say no body else could in one part of  design he seemed to differ from mr banks whose tale  generally designed to follow since i observed in many of those short sketches of scenes he had introduced queen mary he seemed to intend her character pitiful and inclining to mercy but urged on to cruelty by the rage and  dispositions of bonner and gardener this hint  wise taken from the late bishop of salisburys  the reformation who lays and i believe very  horrible cruelties that were acted at that time  charge of that persecuting spirit by which the  then animated than to the queens own natural disp  many people believed or at least said that mr smi left a play very near entire behind him all that i am  for is that it was not so in fact i should have  scruple of taking three four or even the whole five  from him but then i hope i should have had the  to let the world know they were his and not take  mans reputation to my self  this is what i thought necessary to say as well  own account as in regard to the memory of my friend  for the play such as it is i leave it to prosper  can i have resolved never to trouble the world with  public apologies for my writings of this kind as much  have been provoked to it i shall turn this my young child out into the world with no other provision tha saying which i remember to have seen before  mrs behns va mon enfant prend ta fortune  prologue
