to him who dies for british valor was displayed not more on niles proud flood than helders barren shore the chance of war the bravest may control but leaves untouched the courage of the soul and england gives her heroes ever dear the shout of triumph or the starting tear not so the bard  with him success is all when fortune frowns his airbuilt castles fall but if she smiles he sails with prosperous breeze like the small nautilus over summer seas whose little oars on oceans bosom sweep fearless of all the monsters of the deep after a pause often at this bar our author has been tried where english judges take the prisners side guilty of faults no doubt he will appear but human errors find acquittal here  where even the friendless always meet support from honest juries and an upright court critics who rule over politics and plays if you are adverse vain the poets lays you who with equal hands the balance hold whose just decision never was bought or sold but who to every

employment here   dame oh no sir nobody can make it in these parts but myself  mrs grundy indeed pretends  but poor woman she knows no more of it than you do   handy jun than i do that is vastly well

your native land has given additional luster to your charms  aside if my wife looked so  ah but where can bob be  you must know miss my son is a very clever fellow you will not find him wasting his

importations and only restored to us our native excellence   miss b i assure you sir i am eager to seize my birthright the pure and envied immunities of an english woman   handy jun then i trust madam you will be patriot enough to agree with me that a a nation is poor whose only wealth is importation  that therefore the humble native artist may ever hope to obtain from his countrymen those fostering smiles without which genius must sicken and industry decay but it requires no valet de place to conduct you through the purlieus of fashion for now the way of the world is for every one to pursue their own way and following the fashion is differing as much as possible from the rest of your acquaintance   miss b but surely sir there is some distinguishing feature by which the votaries of fashion are known   handy jun yes but that varies extremely  sometimes fashionable celebrity depends on a high waist  sometimes on a low carriage  sometimes on high play and sometimes on low breeding

christmas the struggle was tremendous mrs rowley powley had the best of it by five pecks and a half but it having been unfortunately proved that at her ball there was room to dance and eat conveniently  that n lady received a black eye and no coachman was killed the thing was voted decent and comfortable and scouted accordingly   miss b is comfort then incompatible with fashion   handy jun certainly  comfort in high life would be as preposterous as a lawyers bag crammed with truth or his wig decorated with coquelicot ribbons no  it is not comfort and selection that is sought but numbers and confusion so that a fashionable party resembles smithfield market only a good one when plentifully stocked  and ladies are reckoned by the score like sheep and their husbands by droves like horned cattle   miss b ha ha and the conversation    handy jun oh like the assembly  confused vapid and abundant as how do maam  no accident at the door  he he  only my carriage broke to pieces  i hope you had not your pocket picked  will not you sit down to faro  have you many tonight  a few about six hundred  were you at lady overalls  oh yes a delicious crowd and plenty of peace he he  and thus runs the fashionable race   sir abel yes and a precious run it is  full gallop all the way first they run on  then their fortune is run through  then bills are run up  then they are run hard  then they have a run of luck  then they run out and then they run away  but i will forgive fashion all it is follies in consideration of one of its blessed laws   handy jun what may that be   sir abel that husband and wife must never be seen together   enter servant serve miss blandford your father expects you   miss b i hope i shall find him more composed   handy jun is sir philip ill   miss b his

miss b yes as soon as the contest was over henry presented himself i was surprised at seeing a young man so handsome and elegant as henry is  then i placed the medal round henrys neck and i was told that poor henry    sir philip henry  so my love this is your account of mr robert handy   miss b yes papa  no papa  he came afterward dressed so ridiculously that even henry could not help smiling   sir philip henry again   miss b then we had a dance   sir philip of course you danced with your lover   miss b yes papa   sir philip how does mr handy dance   miss b oh he did not dance till    sir

at me as you do who i am sure love me when our eyes met he withdrew his and cast them on the ground   sir philip and these are the reasons which make you conclude he does not love you   miss b yes papa   sir philip and probably you could adduce proof equally convincing that you dont love him   miss b oh yes  quite for in the dance he sometimes paid attention to other young women and i was so angry with him now you know papa i love you  and i am sure i should not have been angry with you had you done so   sir philip but one question more  do you think mr handy loves you   miss b i have never thought about it papa   sir philip i am satisfied   miss b yes i knew i should convince you   sir philip oh love malign and subtle tyrant how falsely art thou painted blind it is thy votaries

henry i defy its power  you are in england sir where the man who bears about him an upright heart bears a charm too potent for tyranny to humble can your frown wither up my youthful vigor no  can your malediction disturb the slumbers of a quiet conscience no can your breath stifle in my heart the adoration it feels for that pitying angel oh no   sir philip wretch you shall be taught the difference between us   henry i feel it now proudly feel it  you hate the man that never wronged you  i could love the man that injures me  you meanly triumph over a worm  i make a giant tremble   sir philip

country i lest it with a heart lacerated by every wound that the falsehood of others or my own conscience could inflict hateful to myself i became the victim of dissipation  i rushed to the gaming table and soon became the dupe of villains  my ample fortune was lost i detected one in the act of sraud and having brought him to my feet he confessed a plan had been laid for my ruin that he was but an humble instrument for that the man who by his superior genius stood posseffed of all the mortgages and securities i had given was one mortington   miss b i have heard your name him before did you not know this morrington   sir philip no he like his deeds avoided the light  ever dark subtle and mysterious collecting the scattered remnant of my fortune i wandered wretched and desolare till in a peaceful village i first beheld thy mother humble in birth but exalted in virtue the morning after our marriage she received a packet containing these words the reward of virtuous love presented by a repentant villain and which also contained bills and notes to the high amount of ten thousand pounds   miss b and no name   sir philip none nor could i ever guess at the generous donor i need not tell thee what my heart suffered when death deprived me of her thus circumstanced this good man sir abel handy proposed to unite our families by marriage and in consideration of what he termed the honor of our alliance agreed to pay off every encumbrance on my estates and settle them as a portion on you and his son yet still another wonder remains  when i arrive i find no claim whatever has been made either by morrington or his agents what am i to think can morrington have perished and with him his large claims to my property or does he withhold the blow to make it fall more heavily   miss b it is very strange very mysterious but my father has not told me what misfortune led him to leave his native country   sir philip greatly agitated ha   miss b may i not know it   sir philip oh never never
