tamerlane a tragedy  tamerlane a tragedy  as it is acted at the new theater in little lincolns  inn  fields by her majestys servants  written by n row esquire   magnus ad altum fulminat euphraten bello victorque volentes per populos dat jura viamque affectat olympo virg georg   the second edition  london printed for jacob tonson and sold by william davis at the black bull over against the royal exchange in cornhill   0   to the right honorable william lord marquess of hartington my lord every body is now so full of business that things of this kind which are generally taken for the entertainment of leisure hours only look like impertinence and interruption i am sure it is a reason why i ought to beg your lordships pardon for troubling you with this tragedy not but that poetry has always been and will still be the entertainment of all wise men that have any delicacy in their knowledge yet at so critical a juncture as this is i must confess i think your lordship ought to give entirely into those public affairs which at this time seem to demand you it is that happy turn which your lordship has to business that right understanding of your countrys interest and that constant zeal to pursue it that just thinking that strong and per suasive elocution that firm and generous resolution which upon all occasions you have shown in parliaments and to add that which is the crowning good quality your lordships continual adherence and unshaken loyalty to his present majesty which make you at this time so necessary to the public i must confess though there is no part in your lordships character but what the world should be fond of i cannot help distinguishing the last instance very particularly it is doing methinks such a justice to goodness to greatness and to right reason that posterity will believe there could be no man of good sense but what must have agreed with your lordship in it when the next age shall read the history of this what excuse can they make for those who did not admire a prince whose life has been a series of good offices done to mankind when they shall reckon up his labors from the battle of seneff to some glorious action which shall be his last and which i therefore hope is very far removed from the present time will they ever believe that he could have been too well loved or too faithfully served and defended the great things which he did before we had that immediate interest in him which we now happily have is a noble and just subject for panegyric but as benefits done to others can never touch us so sensibly as those we receive our selves though the actions may be equally great so methinks i can hardly have patience to run back to his having saved his own country when i consider he has since done the same for us let that be sufficient to us for all we can say of him or do for him what dangers and difficulties has he not struggled through for the honor and safety of these kingdoms it is a common praise and what every one speaks to say he has continually exposed his life for his people but there are some things more particular in his character some things rarely found amongst the policies of princes a zeal for religion moderated by reason without the rage and fire of persecution a charitable compassion for those who cannot be convinced and an unalterable perseverance in those principles of whose truth he is satisfied a desire of war for the sake of peace and of peace for the good and honor of his subjects equally with his own a pious care for composing factions though to foment them might make him arbitrary and a generous ambition that only aims at power to enable him to do good to all the rest of the world i might add here that inviolable and religious observance of his royal word which the best part of the powers of europe have so frequently and so happily for themselves depended upon in the greatest emergencies but as this virtue is generally reckoned as no more than that common honesty which the meanest man would blush to be without so it can hardly claim a place amongst the more particular excellencies of a great prince it were to be wished indeed that the world were honest to such a degree and that there were not that scandalous defect of common morality certainly nothing can be more shocking to humanity to the peace and order of the world nothing can approach nearer to that savage state of nature in which every man is to eat his fellow if he can master him than an avowed liberty of breaking through all the most solemn engagements of public faith it is something that brands a man with an infamy which nothing can extenuate or wipe out he may protest and pretend to explain his meaning but the world has generally too much indignation for the affront to bear it at that easy rate ministers and secretaries of state may display their own parts in memorials with as much pomp and flourish as they please i fancy the common answer upon such occasions will always be you have deceived us grossly and we neither can nor will trust you any more when this vice comes amongst men of the first rank it is the more shocking and i could wish there were none such to whose charge it might be laid  some people who do me a very great honor in it have fancied that in the person of tamerlane i have alluded to the greatest character of the present age i dont know whether i ought not to apprehend a great deal of danger from avowing a design like that it may be a task indeed worthy the greatest genius which this or any other time has produced but therefore i ought not to stand the shock of a parallel least it should be seen to my disadvantage how far the hero has transcended the poets thought there are many features it is true in that great mans life not unlike his majesty his courage his piety his moderation his justice and his fatherly love of his people but above all his hate of tyranny and oppression and his zea lous care for the common good of mankind  large resemblance of him several incidents are alike in their stories and there wants nothing to his majesty but such a deciding victory as that by which tamerlane gave peace to the world that is yet to come but i hope we may reasonably expect it from the unanimity of the present parliament and so formidable a force as that unanimity will give life and vigor to  if your lordship can find any thing in this poem like a prince who is so justly the object of your lordships and indeed of the worlds veneration i persuade my self it will prevail with you to forgive every thing else that you find amiss you will excuse the faults in writing for the goodness of the intention i hope too your lordship will not be displeased that i take this opportunity of renewing the honor which i formerly had to be known to your lordship and which gives me at once the pleasure of expressing those just and dutiful sentiments i have for his majesty and that strong inclination which i have always had to be thought  my lord your lordships most obedient humble servant n row  prologue spoke by mr betterton of all the muses various labors none have lasted longer or have higher flown than those

survives like him though much unequal to his flame our author makes a pious prince his theme high with the foremost names in arms he stood had fought and suffered for his countrys good yet sought not fame but peace in fields of blood safe under him his happy people sat and grieved at distance for their neighbors fate whilst with success a turkish monarch crowned like spreading flame deformed the nations round with sword and fire he forced his impious way to lawless power and universal sway some abject states for fear the tyrant join others for gold their liberties resign and venal princes sold their right divine till heaven the growing evil to redress sent tamerlane to give the world a peace the hero roused asserts the glorious cause and to the field the cheerful soldier draws around

action of our lives and say let it be thus in spite of fate or partial fortune then i had not been the wretch i am  tam the brave meet every accident with equal minds think nobler of thy foes than to account thy chance in war an evil  mon far far from that i rather hold it grieveous that i was forced even but to seem your enemy nor think the baseness of a vanquished slave moves me to slatter for

our greek emperors rolled down to me feeds the bright flame of glory in my heart  tam even that that princely tie should bind thee to me if virtue were not more than all alliance  mon i have a sister oh severe remembrance our noble houses nay her sexes pride nor think my tongue too lavish if i speak her fair as the fame of virtue and yet chaste as its cold precepts wise beyond her sex and blooming youth soft as forgiving mercy yet greatly brave and jealous for her honor such as she was to say i barely loved her is poor to my souls meaning from our infancy there grew a mutual tenderness between us till not long since her vows were kindly plighted to a young lord the equal of her birth the happy day was fixed and now approaching when faithless bajazet upon whose honor in solemn treaty given the greeks depended with sudden war broke in upon the country secure of peace and for defense unready  tam let majesty no more be held divine since kings who are called gods profane themselves  mon among the wretches whom that deluge swept away to slavery my self and sister then passing near the frontiers to the court which waited for her naptials were surpised and made the captives of the tyrants power soon as we reached his court we found our usage beyond what we expected fair and noble twas then the storm of your victorious arms looked black and seemed to threaten when he pressed me by often repeated instances to draw my sword for him but when he found my soul disdained his purpose he more fiercely told me that my arpasia my loved sisters fate depended on my courage shown for him i had long learnt to hold my self at nothing but for her sake to ward the blow from her i bound my service to the man i hated six days are past since by the sultans order i left the pledge of my return behind and went to guard this princess to his camp the rest the brave axallas fortune tells you  tam wisely the tyrant strove to prop his cause by leaguing with thy virtue but just heaven has torn thee from his side and left him naked to the avenging bolt that drives upon him forget the name of captive and i wish i could as well restore that fair ones freedom whose loss hangs heavy on thee yet ever night perhaps we may deserve thy friendship nobler the approaching storm may cast thy shipwrecked wealth back to thy arms till that be past since war though in the justest cause is ever doubtful i will not ask thy sword to aid my victory lest it should hurt that hostage of thy valor our common foe detains  mon let bajazet bend to his yoke repining slaves by sorce you sir have found a nobler way to empire lord of the willing world  tam oh my axalla thou have a tender soul apt for compassion and art thy self a lover and a friend does not this princes fortune move thy temper  ax yes sir i mourn the brave moneses fate the merit of his virtue hardly matched with disadventrous chance yet prince allow me allow me from the experience of a lover to say one person whom your story mentioned if he survive is far beyond you wretched you named the bridegroom of your beauteous sister  mon i did oh most accursed  ax think what he feels dashed in the fierceness of his expectation then when the approaching minute of possession had wound imagination to the height think if he lives   mon he lives he does it is true he lives but how to be a dog and dead were paradise to such a state as his he holds down life as children do a potion with strong reluctance and convulsive strugglings whilst his misfortunes press him to disgorge it  tam spare the remembrance it is a useless grief and adds to the misfortune by repeating it the revolution of a day may bring such turns as heaven it self could scarce have promised far far beyond thy wish let that hope cheer thee haste my axalla to dispose with safety thy beauteous charge and on the foe revenge the pain which absence gives thy other care honor and arms now summon thy attendance now do thy office well my soul remember

sud in moving sounds for pity she frowned rarely but blushing heard me tell the gentle tale nay even confessed and told me softly sighing she thought there was no guilt in love like mine  sell young and unskilful in the worlds false arts i suffered love to steal upon my softness and warm me with a lambent guiltless flame yes i have heard thee swear a thousand times and call the conscious powers of heaven to witness the tenderest truest everlasting passion but oh it is past and i will charge remembrance to banish the sond image from my soul since thou art sworn the foe of royal bajazet i have resolved to hate thee  ax is it possible hate is not in thy nature thy whole frame is harmony without one jarring atom why do thou sorce thy eyes to wear this coldness it damps the springs of life oh bid me die much rather bid me die if it be true that thou have sworn to hate me   sell let life and death wait the decision of the bloody field nor can thy fate my conqueror depend upon a womans hate
