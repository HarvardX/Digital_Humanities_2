the peckham frolic or nell gwyn  a comedy in three acts  london printed for j hatchard opposite burlington house piccadilly        advertisement the following dramatic whim having afforded some amusement to a small but polished and enlightened circle the author is tempted to offer it to the candor of a more extensive tribunal  characters the king lord rochester sir charles sedley thomas killigrew sir oliver luke ann killigrew afterward lady luke nell gwyn servants etc the scene is laid at peckham in surry where charles the second frequently resided with some select companions  act i enter nell gwyn and killigrew killigrew the king i find is not expected today   nell gwyn my hero is gone to the olympic games at newmarket nor do i know when he will return   killigrew that is unfortunate for i understand that sir oliver luke the formal knight who was created by cromwell is coming here to present a petition by the kings appointment   nell gwyn it is very true   killigrew what can we do with this ragged remnant of the commonwealth   nell gwyn i intend to keep him till the king returns   killigrew he will be a projecting rock and break the flowing course of our merriment   nell gwyn perhaps not i have been forming a scheme in the prosecution of which i must beg your assistance i mean to sacrifice this cromwelian calf at the altar of hymen   killigrew who is to be the priestess at this altar   nell gwyn your maiden aunt ann killigrew   killigrew impossible you cannot be serious   nell gwyn i beg your attention for a moment  ann killigrew has been invariably my friend long before i was the infantas deputy she was zealous in my service she encouraged my propensity to comedy flattered my feeble talent and obtained my admission to the stage   killigrew but what has this to do with her marrying sir oliver   nell gwyn suppress your impatience  you shall know in a moment my friend has laughed away    years inattentive to her interest and careless of her income which like a glittering bubble glided down the stream so fast till at length if burst i propose that in this shipwreck of her fortune the oliverian knight shall save her from sinking  thus i have an opportunity offered me of repaying her friendship   killigrew this is one of your whimsical flights an airy child of your creation  a chimera   nell gwyn no chimera i assure you sir oliver will most certainly apply to the intervention of my good offices for the success of his memorial i shall freely promise him my interest and shall intimate to him at the same time that a matrimonial connection with some royalist would smooth every obstacle to his petition as it would be a proof to the king of the truth of his political conversion   killigrew i allow that the avaricious knight will be governed by his interest but how will you induce the lady to connect herself with this formal old bachelor take my word she will never relish a seast composed of such obsolete ingredients   nell gwyn the person my dear killigrew who waits for dinner till it is very late without having taken any intervening refreshment is not exacting or fastidious concerning the cookery direct the application to ann killigrew and you will not i think despair of my obtaining her consent i hear a carriage it is most likely the knight with his formality and his memorial i beg you will receive him and inform him of my royal injunction to stay here till the arrival of his majesty as to the matrimonial negotiation leave that entirely to me   killigrew depend upon it you will not succeed in assimilating such incongruities as the formal knight and the laughterloving dame ann killigrew   nell gwyn if i do not succeed the negociating part will divert me in the comedy of life as well as of the theater i require some under plot beside the main design  adieu   exit killigrew though i have nothing to do with the negotiation i may perhaps be able to chissel away some rough parts of the moving statue   enter servant and announces sir oliver luke killigrew i am ordered sir oliver to do the honors of this mansion and to welcome you to peckham  my name is killigrew   sir oliver i am proud to form an acquaintance with so celebrated a young gentleman   killigrew i did not expect flattery from the lips of sir oliver luke but you speak the language of the country you now honor with your presence   sir oliver there mr killigrew you touch the difficulty under which i labor to the language of peckham its manners its usages its habits i am an ignorant foreigner   killigrew do not be disheartened on that account we shall be happy to naturalise you among us in the first place i have to inform you that the beautiful lady of this mansion insists upon your remaining here till his majesty returns   sir oliver business of great importance i presume detains him as his majesty appointed me to be here this morning   killigrew my good sir oliver as you are not a shepherdess you must not expect the royal shepherd to be scrupulously exact to his appointment with you and as you are a going to be a member of the peckham club i will take the liberty of asking a few preliminary questions which compose as it were a qualifying test to your initiation   sir oliver i am ready and proud to answer any question made me by mr killigrew   killigrew can you sir oliver pour down a bumper to the kings health without coughing   sir oliver i can assure you i am a perfect proselyte as to that ceremony   killigrew can you bear the sight of a bishop   sir oliver i must confess mr killigrew that my mind still revolts at the lawn sleeve but i presume i shall not meet with any of that order in this mansion   killigrew most assuredly not the queen of peckham is rather a diffenter in that particular she has no communication with the episcopacy   sir oliver i should imagine it would be of use to me to study with some attention the royal almanac   killigrew i shall beg leave to recommend to your notice a court calendar that i am compiling in which you will meet with innumerable red letterdays and holy days but no saints some martyrs and scarce one virgin   sir oliver you there gave a specimen of the idiom that obtains under this roof of which i do not possess the first elements   killigrew the language spoken here is the same as is used at whitehall and it is a language acquired without much difficulty as it is not very copious for example we have but two vowels which govern our whole alphabet and they are u and i but u is always kept in slavish subjection to i   sir oliver i am not so dull but what i can guess a little at your meaning and shall avail myself of your instructions   killigrew here then concludes our first lesson but before we are interrupted permit me sir oliver to make you an offer of my interest with his majesty with whom i am in the habit of intimacy   sir oliver my gratitude binds me to you for ever i regret it is not in my insignificant power to make you a return   killigrew indeed my dear sir oliver you have it in your power to serve me i am now going to speak in the most undisguised manner and i must tell you that although i reside at whitehall and bask as it were in the very rays of royalty i am sorry to add that no silver rivulets refresh the torrid region  no golden showers descend the pipes and conductors of the royal stream sleep in disgraceful repose  the playful fountains of royal remuneration glitter no more to the garish day  indeed my dear sir oliver you have it in your power to serve me i am now going to speak in the most undisguised manner and i must tell you that although i reside at whitehall and bask as it were in the very rays of royalty i am sorry to add that no silver rivulets refresh the torrid region  no golden showers descend the pipes and conductors of the royal stream sleep in disgraceful repose  the playful fountains of royal remuneration glitter no more to the garish day   sir oliver i beg mr killigrew you will indulge me with a commentary for i do not comprehend one word of your text   killigrew i am at present like the rest of my brethren the courtiers not in a state of the greatest affluence and if i could obtain from your generosity the sum of five hundred pounds you would essentially serve me this act of complacency would operate in your regard like a magician it would immediately mature our commencing friendship and invigorate my zeal for your interest   sir oliver aside what must i do with this beggarly royalist i must not let his intimacy with the king act to my disfavour   killigrew well sir oliver have you lost the powers of speech i hope his majesty will not take up so much considering time in granting the object of your memorial   sir oliver i accede to your request and will in a few days supply you with the sum you demand   killigrew which sum i will repay in as many months upon my honor   sir oliver that is sufficient   enter sir charles sedley killigrew give me leave sir charles to present you to my worthy friend sir oliver luke   sir charles sedley the queen of our society sent me here on purpose to have that honor   killigrew sir oliver this is the gentleman of whom rochester says sedley has that prevailing gentle art that can with a resistless charm impart the soster wishes to the chastest heart    sir oliver i am proud to take sir charles sedley by the hand i know he is one of the most splendid stars of the court   sir charles sedley i am in doubt whether or no i shall be vain of that compliment for since sir oliver you denominate us courtiers stars it seems as if you thought our whole crowded constellation made at most a brilliant night since the sun of the commonwealth is gone down   sir oliver indeed sir charles i meant no such thing   killigrew sedley you are too severe with my friend sir oliver acknowledges his past errors he wishes to be a convert and has chosen me for his confessor   sir charles sedley let me also put a hand to this good work i think killigrew between you and me our catechumen will soon acquire the necessary qualifications   sir oliver i am sure under such professors even a scholar as dull as myself cannot fail of making a rapid progress   sir charles sedley and if you should not make a rapid progress it matters not since your masters take no entrance money   sir oliver aside that is not strictly true one master has made me pay five hundred pounds entrance   killigrew suppose sedley we give our pupil a cursory knowledge of the current expressions in our society which are stamped with our peculiar meaning for example sir oliver when we speak of a ladys monster we always mean the ladys husband   sir charles sedley you will frequently hear us say such a lady has a short memory observe this has nothing to do with the retentive faculty in general it only signifies that the lady is inadvertent to one small unimportant article of the matrimonial state  that is to say the vow of fidelity   sir oliver i am apt to believe the ladies at whitehall are not peculiarly gifted with memory   killigrew bravo sir oliver you are an apt scholar   sir charles sedley if you should hear us by chance call a man an unicorn the meaning we apply to that term is that the gentleman is possessed of a wife who has only once deviated from the conjugal path and therefore he is not entitled to the full honors of the fraternity   killigrew i think it is quite superfluous to load sir olivers memory with that term for i smcerely believe that among the whole herd of courtiers there is not one single unicorn   sir charles we have other expressions which we admit though like bad coin they scarce amount to half the value they pretend to  when any person among us says i promise you such a thing we interpret that expresson into a conditional value that is to say the person intends to keep his promise unless some intervening objection should arise  is it not so killigrew   killigrew most assuredly promises with us dissolve as easily as snow into water when the sun shines   sir charles again suppose a man borrows money of you and he solemnly declares that he will repay it upon his honor we explain that affirmative negatively   sir oliver how negatively   sir charles that he means never to return the money   sir oliver indeed   sir charles you appear ruffled sir at what i say   killigrew confused sir charles you talk a little at random in the last instance   sir charles what the devil is the matter you both seem so confounded   sir oliver i have no reason to be distrubed since mr killigrew tells me that a promise in the circle of whitehail dissolves like snow before the sun   enter nell gwyn sir charles here comes the fair deity of our temple   nell gwyn i make no apology sir oliver for not waiting upon you sooner as i knew you was in such agreeable company   sir oliver indeed madam these young gentlemen have been extremely entertaining and have also condescended to give me some instructions of which i shall avail myself   sir charles sedley you are too courteous any information you may have received from me is not worth the value of a groat   sir oliver i ask your pardon sir charles your information is to me worth  00l   killigrew you affix sir oliver too literal a meaning to what sedley just now advanced   nell gwyn gentlemen you must take another time to settle your dispute i beg you will leave me alone with my new acquaintance as i have something to communicate to sir oliver of a private nature   sir charles and killigrew we obey your commands   exeunt sir oliver aside what would our reverend elders say if they knew i was teteatete with nell gwyn   nell gwyn i am apprised of the object of the paper you have to present to a certain great personage and you may rely on the influence i may possess with regard to his majesty   sir oliver your affability equals your beauty   nell gwyn i must however inform you that my warm wishes for your success will not be powerful enough to persuade his majesty to accede to a grant of such magnitude without some strong assurance of your being a sincere and contrite convert to the royal cause   sir oliver emphatically i renounce the commonwealth   nell gwyn yes like the shardborn beetle that creeps out of a ruin but to throw off the veil of disguise i assure you sir oliver that nothing would strengthen your interest with the king so much as the entering into a matrimonial contact with some lady of the court   sir oliver what young lady of the court would stoop to a knight of the late commonwealth whose age is fiftyeight   nell gwyn there are ladies who have passed their meridian and whose years amounting to the number i will suppose of fortytwo would easily assimilate with the number fiftyeight the two separate numbers thus coupled would summed up make exactly      which union carries with it a good omen for it is the number that came up the first prize in the last years lottery   sir oliver i am afraid madam you are bantering with your humble servant   nell gwyn i never was more in earnest in my life i have a lady in view who would suit you in every respect she is about the age i mentioned displaying a rich show of autumnal beauty attended by all the charms that affability courteousness sprightliness and innocence can bestow   sir oliver you will forgive me if i interpose a doubt concerning the last article of the inventory   nell gwyn her innocence i suppose you mean   sir oliver i do   nell gwyn the last article of the inventory is as much her property as her other good qualities and it is an additional merit to have lived so many years in the warm climate of whitehall without singeing the ermine of her innocence lord rochester frequently compares her to an isicle hanging over the mouth of a volcano  and take notice sir oliver that rochester is of great authority on a subject of this nature   sir oliver but this immaculate lady whoever she may be knows nothing of your humble servant   nell gwyn i will perform the part of cupid in this business i will lay the cornerstone of this new temple of love   sir oliver if it was the first day of april i should be apt to think madam that you intended to  you understand what i mean   nell gwyn indeed sir oliver if i had a mind to be severe i might say that the first of april need not take the trouble of coming for the purpose you allude to as it would find the work already done but i once more assure you that i never was more resolutely in earnest the marrying a lady for whom the king entertains the highest regard will be the means the only means of promoting the success of your memorial the coming into a matrimonial contact with a lady of the court will be a passport to the royal favor  it will like the waters of lethe wash out of remembrance your original spot of republicanism   sir oliver i begin to think you are giving me wholesome advice  but may i not inquire who the fair incognita is you intend for my bride   nell gwyn i am happy to obsserve this youthful impatience in you  nevertheless you shall not know who your bride is till you are introduced to her which will be in the course of a few hours   sir oliver i confess there is something romantic in all this which does not displease me   nell gwyn you shall have reason to boast the power of your attraction the isicle which did not melt as it hung over the whitehall volcano shall dissolve before the firebrand of the commonwealth dont knit your brow sir oliver it does not become you  indulge my frolicksome manner of talking no reproach no retrospective censure was intended look upon me as your friend  adieu i advise you sir oliver to go into the garden and meditate among the flowers the persume of the aromatic tribe sostens the heart and disposes it to love it stimulates the imagination and tinges it with all the bright diversity of coloring  to the following lines sir john davies attempered his lyre in the days of the virgin queen  it is said that odours purify the brain awake the fancy and the soul refine hence old devotion incense did ordain to make mans spirits apt for thoughts divine  end of the first act act ii enter ann killigrew and nell gwyn ann killigrew it is impossible not to laugh at this mad scheme of yours   nell gwyn you ought to laugh for you are the winner  consider his immense fortune   ann killigrew how came the knight so easily into your toils   nell gwyn i led him to think that his marrying a lady of the court would be the only method of accomplishing the object of his petition   ann killigrew but i beg you will give me a short catalogue of the qualities of my bridegroom   nell gwyn in the sirst place he has the character of good nature as for his wit i have not much to boast of you my dear have enough of that commodity to serve you both   ann killigrew how is his person   nell gwyn his person observes a strict neutrality between invitation and disgust   ann killigrew well as long as he is rich and perfectly good humoured    nell gwyn i make no doubt but your dexterity will enable you to mould this republican lump into any form you please i must however not forget to acquaint you that he made a very penetrating inquiry into your moral character and though he hesitated belief i convinced him at last of the purity of your conduct   ann killigrew indeed my dear i cannot but smile at the having you for a witness of my virgin innocence   nell gwyn this witness however has effectually served you my friendship in this instance triumphed over all my suspicions   ann killigrew i am obliged to your friendship but not to your suspicions   nell gwyn pretty innocent are then my suspicions groundless   ann killigrew though it is impossible to refrain from laughing at the arch look you now assume and the significant tone of voice you gave to the last question yet the giddy laughterloving ann killigrew can with truth assirm that your suspicions are not founded in fact   nell gwyn to indulge that easy unrestricted flow of conversation which peculiarly distinguishes our friendship i must confess that i cannot easily comprehend how you have escaped every snare that art and ingenuity prepared for you in the younger part of your life   ann killigrew you allude i suppose to the report concerning the duke of buckingham   nell gwyn i do and also to the report relative to sir john suckling st evremond rochester and even old waller   ann killigrew i must own i had some felicitous escapes from these gentlemen i must however except against one person on your list i mean sir john suckling with whom i never was a favorite   nell gwyn there are enough remaining on the list after sir john is erased   ann killigrew as for buckingham he was very assiduous and extremely in earnest he called upon me one day when he was a candidate for my favor at a time when in the heat of his canvass he presumed of his election he found me reading the poem of absalom and achitophel then recently published in which you know buckingham is excellently pourtrayed under the denomination of zimri i asked his grace in what character he paid me the honor of a visit  whether as a lover a painter a chemist a fiddler or a buffoon  this i suppose enraged him for he abruptly withdrew and never returned  so much for buckingham   st evremond was also very pressing to obtain my favor he brought with him that refined civilisation that elegance of manners that playful converse that enamelled wit so characteristic of his countrymen he talked a philosophical jargon which i did not comprehend though it pleased me he laughed at the folly of the restrictive virtues and sent them all to miltons paradise of fools but his ugliness unfascinated the powers of his eloquence my guardian angel sat astride on the large wen on his forehead and saved me from ruin  so much for st evremond   nell gwyn laughing i think your memoirs exceedingly entertaining i beg you will continue your narrative   ann killigrew old waller used also to shoot at me but his bullets being nothing more than poetical sugarplumbs no mischief ensued but the most formidable battle that ever i was engaged in was against rochester it was some years ago when he acted the part of a german conjuror in the city the celebrity of the german fortune tellers excited my curiosity for i had not the smallest intimation who it was  but i tire you perhaps   nell gwyn quite the reverse i am impatience to hear the remainder of your story   ann killigrew i dressed myself in the most simple manner in the costume of a village girl and stole away at night into the city in a hackney coach as soon as i was introduced to the venerable necromancer he accosted me in these words  my beautiful little rustic you will most certainly be wedded to the youth you love  to which gracious prophecy i returned a very humble awkward and cottagelike curtesey he added  i perceive however my dear girl that the stars will not consent to the marriage you have so much at heart till you have made some other person happy first and the sooner you make some person happy the sooner you will possess the youth of your affection he next put a portugal piece into my hand then locked the door threw away his necromantic garment tore off his whiskers dismissed his hoary locks and suddenly the german doctor was transformed into the gay the daring the amorous rochester   nell gwyn i begin to tremble for you   ann killigrew in that alarming moment where was my governess she had run off with a captain of the guards the day before my three maiden aunts where were they  the three scarecrow guardians of the hesperian fruit they were caterwauling round some card table where was my poor grandmother she was at rest with my ancestors in the honorable vault of the killigrews   nell gwyn where was your virginity   ann killigrew secure in the circle of six watchmen who broke open the door attended by constables who came with a warrant to seize the german doctor under the notion of his being a spy i applied to the reverend watchmen for protection and they conducted me through maidenalley to a coach  so much for rochester   enter sir charles sedley sir charles sedley i have to tell miss ann killigrew that her inamorato will wait upon her immediately he has almost finished his toilet i left him adjusting his new black perriwig whose virgin curls have never been kissed by the amorous gales he has been scenting his bushy eyebrows with the essence of jessamine   ann killigrew do you envy his destiny   sir charles sedley upon my soul i think he is a lucky dog and i rejoice to find you are going to honor the married state an unmarried woman is an instrument without a musician   nell gwyn a ravishing lute without a lutist   sir charles sedley or as an old lady obseryed to me the other day  we unmarried women said she are the roses without a thorn   ann killigrew but why sir charles dont you practice the doctrine you recommend you are a widower but as you do not appear a disconsolate one why do you not resume the conjugal yoke   sir charles sedley it is my intention i look upon myself a pierre dattente a cornerstone left out from a building to be connected with another edifice   ann killigrew i really am of opinion the marriage state has several advantages   nell gwyn particularly if the husband be as rich as sir oliver   ann killigrew i mean independent of that consideration   nell gwyn it secures one from temptation   sir charles sedley from which one is never secure in a state of celibacy not even in a nunnery i have an old aunt a nun at antwerp who is frequently troubled with temptations the abbess proposed that she should ring the church bell whenever she was tempted to give notice to the community to pray for her and sometimes the old lady is ringing the whole day long   nell gwyn bravo sir charles this is a most excellent family anecdote   enter sir oliver and killigrew nell gwyn sir oliver give me leave to present you to miss ann killigrew my most intimate friend whom i propose as an amiable companion for the remainder of your journey through life   sir oliver bows offers to speak but cannot procced sir charles sedley sir oliver i perceive is tonguetied with ecstasy   ann killigrew i suppose it is incumbent on me sir oliver to express my gratitude for the flattering distinction with which you are going to honor me   nell gwyn my dear ann i beg you will not be rhetorical and attempt any flourishing speech  as the conversation of lovers affects solitude let me advise you to accompany sir oliver in the long shady arbor   ann killigrew i certainly can have no objection to what you propose   sir oliver i cherish the proposal and should wish to have some private conference with this lady give me leave to attend you   offers his hand nell gwyn miss killigrew i wish you a pleasant walk i hope my dear you will not stand in need of your friends the watchmen upon this occasion    excunt ann killigrew and sir oliver well i must own i take a pride in having accomplished this business  killigrew this business is not so near being accomplished as you imagine sir oliver just now assured me that he would defer the ceremony till he had the approbation of the match from the king himself   nell gwyn i am displeased to hear this it is quite uncertain when the king will be here and if the knight should go from hence before the ceremony has taken place we shall lose him without hope for should he return to his roundheaded relations    killigrew they would laugh him out of conceit with this marriage   nell gwyn i ask your pardon they never laugh but they will sigh and groan him out of conceit with this union and absolutely dissuade him from a courtly monarchical irreligious connection   enter lord rochester lord rochester queen eleanor i am the most faithful of your subjects i find i am come to assist at a wedding is it possible as i am this instant informed that you are meditating so incongruous an assimilation as to ingraft the savage oliverian crab on the luscious pineapple   nell gwyn even so but there is a difficulty which has just now occurred the knight will not accept it seems of the hand of my friend without the kings concurrence or rather his command and as i do not expect the king i am afraid the republican bear will break through my toils   lord rochester i have a remedy at hand i will ply him rapidly with the circling bottle after dinner and make him so amorous that i will charm from him a promise to marry the lady tomorrow morning   nell gwyn no no i have a better inventive head at a crisis that your lordship as you have performed the part of a conjurer with such success suppose you try how you can act the king the cromwelian knight has no personal knowledge of you and has never seen his majesty it will consequently be no difficult matter to impose upon him   lord rochester i am ready to perform the part you assign to me in this new comedy as it is for the benefit of ann killigrew   nell gwyn when the knight is presented to your majesty you will express to him your full approbation of the match and then i will attend upon the willing pair to town and desire one of the kings chaplains to tie the knot immediately   killigrew it is a most excellent stratagem   nell gwyn sir charles i beg you will run to the kings apartment and bring back with you the garter and the blue ribband    exit sir charles sedley lord rochester but will not his majesty be displeased at the liberty i am now going to assume   nell gwyn i will take upon myself the whole impropriety of this transaction i am certain it will excite his laughter and the king will lament that he did not come time enough to be a partaker of the frolic   enter sir charles sedley nell gwyn let me invest your majesty   she takes the ribband and gives it to lord rochester who puts it on now gird your knee with this little badge which i am apt to pronounce a whimsical badge of honor since if history speaks the truth it was invented in memorial of a young slovenly countess who did not know how to tie her garters   sir charles sedley bowing may your majestys short reign be a prosperous one   nell gwyn go you two directly to the lovers you sir charles inform the knight of his majestys arrival and you killigrew whisper in the ear of my friend the stratagem that is carrying on and order the carriage to be got ready immediately    exeunt sir charles and killigrew lord rochester do not be offended if under the sanction of my transitory royal prerogative i address you in a language i never dared utter before  venus has many cupids which at once denote her empire and the extent of her benevolence   nell gwyn for shame rochester is this acting a generous part toward your absent friend the king if i had any pretensions to the title of venus my cupids should not be linkboys to thrust their torches in every face   lord rochester i intended no offense  it was only my libertine way of talking   nell gwyn the man who now possesses my undivided attachment shall ever hold undivided possession he is the final object of my wishes my home my constant residence i beg you will look upon my former frailties as stations in my journey to the abode from which i will never never depart   lord rochester excellently most excellently said you have long gained my admiration you have now conquered my esteem   nell gwyn the esteem of rochester i fear is a coin of doubtful value however such as it is i will accept it  enter sir oliver luke ann killigrew sir charles sedley and killigrew permit me sir oliver to present you to his majesty   sir oliver kneels and kisses lord rochesters hand sir oliver much confused this honor sire  this accumulated honor most religious sovereign  owing to her ladyship i ask pardon i mean mrs gwyn  i crave forgiveness i should say miss eleanor gwyn   lord rochester it is impossible for me sir oliver to do justice to your elegant harangue by my own words  so i will only say that i am happy to commence an acquaintance with you   sir oliver here is the petition which your majesty knows i was to deliver into your royal hands   lord rochester my royal hands will put the petition into my royal pocket and shall consider the contents at some other time and in some other place for business is excluded from this spot and only mirth and love are admitted and therefore i rejoice to find you are going to add to the festivity of peckham by espousing my good friend ann killigrew   sir oliver i am overjoyed to hear my intended marriage meets with the royal approbation   lord rochester it meets with my most decided approbation and will be a strong argument with me in favor of your petition   nell gwyn i told you so sir oliver   lord rochester i hope before apollo reclines on the lap of thetis you will conduct the fair nymph to the hymeneal temple   sir oliver are your royal words addressed to me   lord rochester my meaning is sir oliver that i hope before the close of day my friend will be entitled to the honorable appellation of lady luke   sir oliver i am your majestys most obedient subject   lord rochester if you please sir oliver i will write a note to my worthy friend juxon the archbishop and order him to perform the ceremony   sir oliver by no means  by no means  by no means   nell gwyn an inferior dignitary will answer the purpose as effectually   lord rochester why did sir oliver start at my proposal   nell gwyn sir oliver is afflicted with an hereditary disease called the antimitralantipathy which time only can eradicate   enter the king the king heyday what are you masquerading in the morning   nell gwyn runs up to the king and whispers lord rochester aside i fear i am going to be dethroned   killigrew aside this sudden arrival will put an end to the wedding   ann killigrew aside to sir charles sedley i begin to fear i must still perform as you call it the irksome function of a vestal   the king advancing toward lord rochester i ask your majestys pardon i did not at sirst perceive you was here   lord rochester i am this instant arrived   the king to nell gwyn i little imagined the king would have been at peckham before me   nell gwyn taking the king by the hand give me leave sir oliver luke to present this brother knight sir charles stuart to you   sir oliver i am happy in forming an acquaintance with sir charles stuart i presume you received the honor of knighthood from his present majesty   the king i cannot say i did   sir oliver then i suppose your honors flow from the same fountain as mine   the king you mean the protector   sir oliver yes sir charles stuart   the king my title does not stream from so immaculate a fountain my family is not under any particular obligations to the protector   nell gwyn sir charles stuart you must not engross your new acquaintance for as i just informed you he is going to be married the carriage is at the door killigrew and i will attend sir oliver and miss killigrew to town and we will bring them back in the evening bride and bridegroom   the king i assure you sir oliver you are going to be united with the most amiable woman in england if i had not been unluckily yoked in marriage with a d  d portugal merchants daughter i should myself have proposed to her give me leave miss killigrew to have the honor of handing you to your carriage   end of the second act act iii enter the king sir charles sedley and lord rochester lord rochester at your command i retain the honor of being your majestys usurper   the king i beg the farce may be continued till the bride and bridegroom are introduced did not you say sedley they were returned   sir charles sedley they are now coming up stairs   lord rochester is the reigning monarch or the pretender to salute the bride

wishes   sir oliver methinks sir charles stuart you are too free with his majesty   the king my dear brother knight you will perceive presently that i shall take a still greater freedom with his

much obliged to you sir oliver   sir charles i would be obliged to him lady luke if i was you and take him at his word   lord rochester and comfort me  a poor dethroned monarch   nell gwyn it is now time to put an end to this idle merriment i direct my discourse to you sir oliver and now inform you that the innocent stratagem which has been played upon you was my invention for the purpose of securing to my friend so honorable a partner for life   lord rochester it is very true   sir oliver to lord rochester are you not sir the king   lord rochester for the misfortune of england i am not   sir oliver who then is king   lord rochester your brother knight sir charles stuart   lady luke indeed sir oliver that gentleman speaks the truth he is lord rochester and the person whom you imagine to be sir charles stuart is upon my word his most gracious majesty to whose protection i now consign my husband sir oliver luke    leading sir oliver to the king sir oliver do i dream or have i lost my senses to day   the king not more at present than any other day but i trust you will indulge this peckham frolic and i can assure you that your brother knight sir charles stuart will prompt king charles to grant to sir oliver the object of his petition   sir oliver bowing i am your majestys truly devoted subject   the king as the table is prepared and spread with a splendid collation let us sit down in harmony and goodhumour dismiss the servants and let the dumbwaiters who have long had the character of being very discreet have the full benefit of our convivial wit and merriment    they sit down to table lord rochester i perfectly concur with his majesty concerning the advantage of dumbwaiters the ease and freedom of convivial festivity is thus betrer ascertained with all the gay privileges of commensality   the king i never before heard the word commensality   lord rochester it is an expressive word invented by my friend sir thomas brown the celebrated physician at norwich   nell gwyn is it possible lord rochefter that you should call that man your friend wicked profane man he wishes in his religio medici these are his very words that we might procreate like trees without conjunction   sir charles sedley this is treason against the enthroned majesty of nature   killigrew what does lady brown say to such a contemptuous declaration   lord rochester she like a loving wife obtained his pardon from the queen of nature on condition that he should make an amend honorable to which it seems he has consented for he is the father of ten children   the king as i am not a disciple of sir thomas brown nor consequently a friend to the arboreal procreation i propose a bumper to the happiness of the bride and bridegroom   lord rochester i second the proposal   they drink to the bride and bridegroom the king now tell me rochester what is become of your hebdomadal seraglio i saw lately monday and saturday walking arm in arm together   sir charles sedley your majesty will see them no more   lord rochester i beg sedley you will not say any thing of this affair   the king now my curiosity is excited i must entreat you sedley to proceed   sir charles sedley i shall most certainly obey your commands and shall first inform my audience that rochester in the plenitude of extravagance collected seven nymphs which he denominated by the days of the week the beautiful hours that draw the car in guidos famous picture were not to be compared to the days of rochester they were however not halcyon days sunday monday tuesday and wednesday were tempestuous thursday was a peevish ungenial day friday was sullen and cloudy and saturday thundered like a scold   nell gwyn poor rochester   sir charles sedley to conclude my narrative debts were incurred the treasury of rochester not being adequate to the expenditure of the seven days yesterday morning horresco referrens the whole week was sent to jail   lord rochester lazy extravagant gypsies they deserve their fate   sir oliver indeed lord rochester the epithet of lazy is ill applied it appears to me that it was a very industrious week for i do not meet with one holy day in it   the king bravo sir oliver i give you credit for that pun   sir oliver i am bold to tell your majesty that i seldom offer at a smart saying but when i do it is my own  i do not borrow from others   the king you are then sir oliver like a country squire who lives upon his own farm who kills his own calf and plucks his own geese   nell gwyn with your majestys permission i will call for a song  i should wish to hear the soldiers catch  the words by sir charles sedley   sir charles lord rochester and killigrew sing the soldiers catch if some blood we have spilt to compound for the guilt in loves camp well do double duty mankind well repair with the leave of the fair and pay our arrears to true beauty the king most excellently performed observe sir oliver as you have been a soldier the moral of the song seems particularly pointed at you   sir oliver i am happy to see your majesty so facetious   nell gwyn as we have already drank to the bride and bridegroom i beg leave to propose my favorite toast   sir oliver looks at his watch lord rochester sir oliver it is against the canon law of this society to look at a watch   the king i think sir oliver should be exempted from the rule it denotes no drowsiness in sir oliver  his looking at his watch is the same thing as looking at the countenance of lady luke but i give you notice sir oliver that if you look again at your watch i shall obey your intimation and adjourn the court   sir oliver i hope i have committed no indecorum i am now all impatience madam for your favorite toast   nell gwyn rising every body except his majesty must stand up while my toast is going round   lifting up her glass i drink to the royal oak which when the hellhounds of rebellion were in full chase spread around its hospitable arms and sheltered from destruction the monarch of my heart hail to the royal oak  omnes hail to the royal oak   the king it becomes me now to rise and make my acknowledgments to the company for the honor they have conferred upon my good friend the oak now i will beg leave to offer a toast of my own which the mistress of the house can witness is the one that i constantly give   lord rochester then sir your toast is not a woman   nell gwyn i ask your pardon lord rochester it is a woman   sir charles sedley it is then a beautiful woman you frequently see before your glass   nell gwyn no sir it is a lady i never saw in my life and as there is an interesting circumstance annexed to her i humbly entreat his majesty to relate it to the company   the king i am very willing to comply with your request  at that eventful period of my life when i was obliged to wander in disguise it happened that at the close of day tortured with hunger and overpowered with fatigue i adventured to approach the door of a magnificent seat in order to solicit the charity of a little food a young man who by his emotion appeared to know me begged he might introduce me to the respectable lady of the mansion  a widow whose name was wyndham and who was impatient he said of the honor of receiving me beneath her roof he then led me into an antique hall where sat in an oaken richly carved chair the aged lady a pleasurable air of affability illumed her countenance still did her faded check display a lingering grace a winter flower then slowly rising from her seat the venerable form advanced and thus she accosted me  three sons my valiant sons were slain in battle fighting in your fathers cause and at their side my little grandson scarce fourteen my lovely my endearing henry fell  since that sad day oppressed with the weight of maternal affliction i have daily implored the great dispenser of events to remove me from this scene of misery but at this moment i thank my god that he decrees i still should linger on this side the grave for the purpose of administering some little comfort to your unfortunate situation the tear that now weeps down my cheek is not the effusion of parental sorrow it is the gush of wounded affection for my afflicted sovereign she then attempted to salute my hand which i declined and yielding to the warm impulse of nature with a grateful heart i threw my arms around her neck and wept  i now pour a libation to the venerable dame see hume    rochester i presume it is now my turn to propose a toast   nell gwyn i will tell you who you shall give   rochester i accede to your proposal   nell gwyn you shall give us the country girl whose fortune you told when you was the german conjurer   rochester how is it possible you should know any thing of that incident   nell gwyn the confusion you are in betrays you   lady luke i hope you did not seduce the poor silly country girl   rochester i scorn your idea   lady luke have you never seen her since   lord rochester never   lady luke you have often seen her and have frequently spoken to her   lord rochester never never   lady luke suppose i tell you that you have been speaking to her this moment   mimicking the country girl good christian doctor tell me when i am to be married   lord rochester confusion i recollect that voice had i known it had been you    lady luke however you will bear testimony to the innocence of the poor girl   lord rochester yes but not to her integrity for she robbed me of a guinea   lady luke that guinea was well distributed among the watchmen who protected her   sir oliver what are you talking of lady luke   nell gwyn we allude to a disguise her ladyship once assumed to deceive lord rochester   the king i never heard of this frolic   nell gwyn i will tell you the whole circumstance some other time   the king let me ask you rochester if you have lately displayed any flashes of wit if you have uttered any bon mot worth being recorded without raising a blush on the female cheek   lord rochester the latter part of your question is superfluous respecting blushes for though we live among the fair creation and may very properly denominate them flowers we cannot so properly give them the poetical appellation of blushing roses   the king very good   lord rochester with regard to your majestys general inquiry i must own i have been dull and melancholy of late   killigrew rochester was delivered of a tolerable bon mot yesterday we were walking sir together and we met shadwell the poet he accosted us and said  gentlemen i wonder to see you abroad in such bad weather to which rochester replied i believe you and i are walking from different motives i walk in order to get an appetite to my dinner and you perhaps mr shadwell to procure a dinner for your appetite and therefore you shall dine with me   nell gwyn i think there is as much illnature as wit in that bon mot   lord rochester however the bard drank copiously of the viny helicon till big with the god he reeled with poetic majesty into my carriage which conveyed him home   sir charles sedley give me leave to inform your majesty that sir oliver is stealing again a glance at his watch   the king then i will keep my word and adjourn the court    they all rise the king goes to lady luke and salutes her sir charles sedley are we sir to follow your example   the king by no means i am in this instance only sir olivers taster before we part i will repeat to the bridegroom four lines written some time ago by sir charles sedley addressed to the bride   were i apollo no i would not choose the gay ann killgrew for my darling muse let other nymphs the learned mount ascend she should be thetis  and the day should end now i imagine sir oliver that you are apollo here is thetis and the day is ended  adieu   the king retires  the gentlemen follow nell gwyn i will now as your ladyships bridemaid attend you to your bedchamber where like a poor hare after various windings you will be taken on the very spot from which you sat out   lady luke you never can be serious   nell gwyn what has happened you appear suddenly depressed   lady luke it is impossible for me in the present moment not to be agitated   nell gwyn what does the spirited ann killigrew yield to visionary fears   lady luke i beg you will suppress your jocularity for the present   nell gwyn i will only add a few words more as we both have gargled our mind with a little sputtering of the latin tongue i will disperse your apprehensions with a line from martials epigrams  poet non dolet   the end of the third and last act lately published by j hatchard the fourth edition of the welsh heiress  a comedy in five acts
