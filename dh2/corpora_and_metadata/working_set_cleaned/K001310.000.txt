daniel defoe     advice to all parties  by the author of the trueborn englishman  london printed and are to be sold by benj bragg at the blueball in avemarylane mdccv  the preface these sheets having with their unhappy author fallen into the barbarous and unjust hands of the late ministry had never seen the light had not providence seemed to reserve them for two ends    as a standing monument of the dextrous management of a certain most exquisite statesman whose strictest scrutiny all these papers past and yet came home as things relating to the authors private concerns and with them several other manuscripts which no body but such an overvigilant minister would have parted with    as a subject for which there was yet a more proper juncture coming when it would be more than ordinary useful   bition of all his actions he is sure it cannot be  rinciple is the good of  country they that want advice it may do good to they that want it not  can do no harm to  the tendency of this as of all he writes is the general peace of parties a subject never to be sufficiently pursued and embraced by all honest men in this nation as that without which we are undone at home ruined abroad and must at last fall a prey to the invading power of popery and foreigners  advice to all parties he that gives his advice before it is asked expects no fee for his counsel and so the author of these sheets stands clear from the scandal of bribery  if the gifts of the spirit qualify a man for teaching his neighbors by the same rule if any man knows more than another he may tell him his mind and then every one is free to do what he pleases  the author though he is no professed statesman may pass for a gifted brother that way if he says nothing to the purpose yet hear him and if he says any thing that is to the purpose hear him and no more  whatever the world may say of him they cannot imagine him to be such a fool as to think he shall please every body what suits the wise man will not please the fool if the honestman is contented the knaves will murmur peace will not please the soldier nor plenty the farmer truth will please the wiseman and he that cannot discern it is a fool worth no bodys notice  the world is made up of a conjunction of contraries and the harmony is the more admirable so the times dilcover a conjunction of opposite parties which if they can be brought to keep the peace the union would be something wonderful  before we come to talk with the gentlemen concerned will be needful to separate the parties sheep and goats birds of a feather set every sort by themselves with their characters and descriptions that all people may look out and know them and look in and know which sort they belong to  we are at present the most divided nation in europe the jest of all the world the polanders are fools to us we have among us as some have observed three or four and thirty sorts of religions and twelve or thirteen severals in politics in religion here are christians and jews papists and protestants heathens pagans idolaters and atheists worse than any of them deists antideists socinians arminians pelagians gnostics donatists adamites sweetsingers enthusiasts families of love arians antinomians freewillers seventhday men universal redemptioners asgelites quietists lutherans calvinists hugonots church of england men of several sorts puritans presbyterians independants anabaptists quakers fifthmonarchymen and the d and all  if but one sort of these are in the right god knows which sort that is and the lord have mercy on all the rest if all sorts may be in the right than it is no matter what sort a mans of and there is no need of any strife about the matter  in matters of politics the numerous kinds have obtained the sirnames of courtparty and countryparty tories whigs trimmers loyalist royalist commonwealthsmen williamites jacobites high church low church and no church nonjurants or churchdissenters church whigs and abundance of other sorts which the custom of the times have been pleased to give titles to  but when all these names are made use of with many more by way of contempt upon one another to show our want of goodnature as well as want of manners the real unhappy differences of this nation seem to lie among the parties at court that lately had the ministry and those that have it now between the furiosos in the church who are for carrying all before them and the moderate men in the church who are for peace joined with the dissenters who are for the liberty they enjoy being preserved  to these gentlemen the following advice is directed if they think it is good they will accept the hint or come under the class of solomons fools that hate instruction if they contemn it they ought to show a reason for it or else they are in solomons reach again he that judges of a matter before he hears it it is folly and shame unto him  temerity in politics is certainly the most impolitick thing in the world too much haste may do harm but seldom does good and and one would think the late reign of king james might be a memento mori to all the sons of jehu either in church or state  he is certainly the friend of such men who advises them to check their career before they go too far because such tempers always run on to their own confusion as well as other peoples  but to tell who i mean without going far about there is a sort of people among us who after their tears of joy for the death of king william were dried up began to be comforted very early with the halcyon days of queen ann and as if they had made their conditions with her before hand they gave a loose to their passions and discover their satisfaction in the country coffeehouses in terms like these  well boys now we shall have brave times again brave times says his honest neighbor who was melancholy still for the nations lois why what is the matter matter why we have got a church of england queen and all these damned phanaticks will go down again well have them all turned out now well have no more canting within the noise of our church bells no tubpreaching no barnmeeting no whiggish justices now that a poor man cannot get a cup of beer in his crown of a sunday after sermon but his neighbor shall be plaguing him with the stocks and if he happen to swear an oath or so to be teased with informers that a man cannot take a glass of wine after sermon but he shall be fined and exposed for it here has been such a plutter with your reformation of manners and your dutch government we have an english queen and a true church of england queen and down you go well have your meeting houses about your ears quickly  that this is matter of fact that this was the discourse not in the mouths of here and there a fool but of a whole party i will at any time set my name to the charge and i suppose no body need put me upon the proof  nor was her majestys declaration to her council or speeches to the parliament or her answers to the dissenters addresses of any weight with these sort of people though her majesty took exceeding care on all occasions to make all her subjects easy by giving them assurances first that she would be a religious observer of her royal word and then giving her royal word that she would maintain the toleration and give her protection to the dissenters  let me tell those gentlemen that they are guilty of two crimes first great indiscretion in showing their teeth before the muzzle which the laws have put upon them is taken off and that they have no power to bite secondly so much want of manners and respect that should the author write half so much satyr upon the queen in this book it is to be thought he would write himself into newgate and very well he would deserve it  what can the english of such language be other than this that the queen made such promises of protection to the dissenters and continuing the toleration only to quiet their minds at her first accession and till she is settled in the throne or perhaps till the war abroad is over but she does not design to keep her promise with them but they shall all be suppressed as soon as opportunity offers and truly gentlemen her majesty is very much beholden to you  the short advice the author thinks fit to give such people is to hold their tongues and have more manners than affront the queen at so impudent a rate and since they have shown their good will let them be quiet till their  comes  her majesty being informed of their rudeness should think fit to give the nation a further assurance of her justness to her promises by punishing them for their raising a scandal upon her veracity  a second sort of people which the author pretends to give advice to are such as upon the queens dissolving her first parliament and calling a new one pretended to tell us what brave things that approaching parliament would do for them  we have now gotten a churchparliament a loyal churchof england parliament say they and now we will do your business and this parliament shall  us all to rights again now well dismount the two bulwarks of whiggish hopes for this parliament shall repeal the  of toleration and the settlement of the crown they shall leave the english throne to be as it always was hereditary and let right line and descent take place that english loyalty may flourish and the prerogatives of princes be no more invaded nor the nation be governed by dutchmen and foreigners  i believe no body will dispute with me the truth of fact that this was the talk not of a single person or of a few but of a party their common their table their coffeehouse discourse  how to comment upon such insolence i hardly know this is an iniquity to be punished by the judge  and if the house of commons did not take cognizance of such people it was because they restrained their resentment of such affronts more than any house of commons ever did before them  as to the last parliament the author has no business to say any thing of their religion but i think all our parliaments have been churchparliaments nor is there any doubt but they always will be so but what sort of doings is this with parliaments if they are to be anticipated led by a party and told beforehand what they shall do  if this sort of people conferred with the members and concerted with them beforehand what should or should not be done if so we had then such a parliament as never was before  but if these gentlemen did this only to inflame parties only to let us see what they would have done what design they were driving at it is time for the nation to open their eyes and examine who they are  the act of settlement is the foundation on which the nation stands it is the sacred pillar of the present government and on it may be very well placed the scotch motto nemo me impune lacessit it is the sanctum sanctorum near which no man may approach without a blast from the breath of the whole community this is the ark of our israel before which the dagon of the jure divino men is fallen with his head and his hands knocked off it is the pedestal of the english throne which if it be removed the whole column of the government sinks and the capital which is the present queen must fall with it her present majesty can have no right to the crown if king james left a son but by the act of settlement  now it is worthy of remark that the gentlemen who talk of repealing the act of settlement dont do it barely because the crown is not thereby limited to their liking but they are for repealing it as a thing not legal in its own nature they would have the parliament disown the right of limiting the crown and acknowledge a right of succession jure divino that kings of all religions or principles must be submitted to if they come of the race that the right line must succeed and it is not in the power of the people of england either collectively or representatively to question their princes or to oppose their oppressive unjust proceedings  the latent consequences of this will come in at the last viz that the late revolution was an act of rebellion against god and the king that it was a violence offered to gods vicegerent against justice and allegiance that king william was an invader of another mans right an usurper and a tyrant and so we are all acomming gentlemen to the old point against passive obedience nonresistance dispensing power and all the absurdities and ridiculous contradictions of the late reigns come into play again and we have spent thirteen years war a mass of english money and a sea of english blood to a fine purpose  this is one design in striking at the act of settlement another is to supplant the house of hanover because forsooth they dont like them they are ashamed to own what they would have but the case is so plain that it needs no comment a late author has published the life of king james and taking no notice of this act says king james died and left one son and two daughters now what is the language of this party if we must submit to the queens reigning before her brother because she is crowned and has possession we cannot help it but we are next oars and there is no reason to expel the rest of his family here is a son and a daughter we may have them home make protestants of them and never run up into germany for an old woman and her dutch progeny to reign over us  here is the plain english of the design a design which aims at the root and fundamental part of our constitution and though there is no great danger of the thing yet it is plain they push at it with all their might  as to this act of settlement first the queen who reigns by virtue of such a settlement has not once but several times given her royal promise to maintain it so that if ever such an unhappy time should come that a parliament should offer to disannul it we have her majestys honor which we trust will never forsake her to have recourse to as a check to the fatal mischief and if both queen and parliament should be so mistaken and so much blindness from above should in judgment to them be their portion the native original right of the people of england as the fountain of power and government will come up and give a negative to the execution what will any new settlements of the crown that may be made amount to if the people of england who have an undoubted right to the government themselves should contradict them at the time they would enter upon the possession with this general negative we will not have this man to reign over us  the safety of the english nation rests in and depends upon themselves the people of england are a security to the people of england for a preservation of all their own essential right and among the rest this is the chief to be governed by princes of their own nomination and laws of their own making no prince can reign here but by the consent of the people and by no laws but such as become laws by the consent of the people it has been in vain attempted to bugbare the nation into villenage and vassalage but the liberties of england has always been like the stone in the gospel whosoever has fallen against them has been broken to pieces and on whomsoever they have fallen has been ground to powder  the english nation has not many more liberties than they had before but they know them better than they did  we know now that our princes are circumscribed by the laws and constitutions of the nation are obliged to govern justly and perform the stipulation of government declared in two acts of parliament we know that if they issue out illegal commands it is no treason to disobey if a prince should levy money by arbitrary authority any freeholder may refuse to pay it and be guilty of no crime if it is levied by force he may oppose it with force and yet be no rebel  we know the very parliament themselves cannot dispense with the law but in a parliamentary way no law can cease to be a law till repealed by the same power that made it and nothing can have the force of a law in england but what has the peoples consent in parliament  the power of parliament and how far the members are accountable to their principals is not for me to determine but this i venture to say that without doubt a member of parliament is to have some regard in honor to the inclination of the people he serves at least not to act what he knows is contrary to their desire  it is plain that the act of settlement is the most valuable thing in the government as the security we have against future slavery it is the account we are to give to our children of our care for their safety it is the bulwark of the nation against popery and tyrany and none but the enemies of our liberties can wish to see it repealed it is our double security first as it is an acknowledgment of the peoples power to limit the crown and secondly as it has effectually declared the right of the subject their liberties and just priviledes under such as shall reign hereafter  some have thought that the party in a certain house who made it their business to limit thwart and affront the late king william particularly as to the matter of the army and afterward the grants of lands in ireland while they carried on their private pique at the king involuntarily and unwarily set their hands to the peoples liberties and made such declarations of the rights of the subject as they would be glad to have now undone if they could if they were led into this by another party they were tricked with a vengeance but a learned gentleman who was formerly a great jure divino man was pleased to say of it with an oath we are going to make our selves all kings only to cross one king  but let the design have been what it will the peoples liberties were recognized by some gentlemen who if it should have been told them formerly that they should have done so and so would have answered with the assyrian captain is thy servant a dog that he should do these things  to these and all the gentlemen of that party who aim at altering the act of settlement our advice is short have a care gentlemen what you do methinks you should not have the face to expect or the impudence to desire the queen to break her word the parliament men to act contrary to the interest and inclination of the people that chose them a papist set upon the throne a rupudiated impostor acknowledged an abjured race received it is true all acts of parliament may as acts be repealed by parliament but some things are in their own nature to be continued this cannot be repealed if the queen should break her word which it is base to suppose even if the parliament should consent who shall absolve us of an abjuration oath who shall reconcile the nation to a french and popish prince the meaning is only confusion and distraction and the end will certainly be the destruction of all that shall ever attempt it and therefore i think it as kind a piece of counsel as can be given gentlemen have a care for you will certainly miscarry in the attempt popery and slavery will never go down with this nation popery is so formidable a thing that the very name of it would set the whole nation in an uproar those that do not understand it hate it by tradition and i believe there is a hundred thousand plain countryfellows in england would spend their blood against popery that do not know whether it be a man or a horse  let such people therefore have a care the people of england provoked are not easily appeased let them remember the consternation they were in    years ago when the resentment of the people of england hung over the heads of a whole party and let them rest assured  the act of settlement and limitation of the crown with the recognition of the peoples rights are the very things the war the revolution and the dismission of king james were made for these were the port the whole nation steered for and this nation will never part with them now they are safe they can never have any tyrant but by their own consent and if they are slaves again they must do it themselves and no body will pity them  the next sort of people to whom these sheets are directed by way of caution or advice are first the late ministry  to you gentlemen the author directs himself without any thing of satyr which considering how you treated him you might reasonably expect but stating your case as it really is refers you to your selves to reflect upon the profound policy of your ways  her majesty taking you for wise men as well as honest men comcommitted to your conduct the guiding of her affairs war abroad peace at home her majestys glory the nations happiness were all in your power you had what solomon calls a price put into your hands and solomon not i shall tell you what you ought to be thought for not making such improvement of it as god and the nation expected from you  that you were the honest men the queen expected you to be let the answers you gave to the proposals for relieving the camisars the expedition to cadiz the management of the victualingoffice the army and navy in too many particulars to be innumerated here speak for you if they can the forfeiture of your honor and word on sundry occasions the connived correspondencies with the enemy and the like let them answer for the matter that your consummate wisdom deceived her majesty whose goodness had entertained better thoughts of you than your merit gave reason for will too plainly appear in the weak attempts made to cover the farther dishonesty of your designs in pushing this nation into all manner of feuds heats animosities and strife of parties to the no small confusion of the public affairs and hazarding the public peace  how you would have extricated her majesty and this nation out of the labyrints of error and the impolicies you were driving the public affairs into we thank her majestys prudence that she did not think fit to expect not thinking it safe to run the risque of calling you fools at the price of some mischiefs too gross to be born with and too late to be remedied  it is sufficient that her majesty finding both the dishonesty and folly of your management and foreseeing the precipiece on which you had brought the public affairs had both the wisdom and the courage to take the reins out of your hands before you had quite overturnd the chariot of the state and before you had hurried both us and your selves into gulfs of irretrievable confusions  the humble advice of the author of these sheets to you is to sit down and be quiet thank god on your knees night and day that you had a mild a merciful and a gentle mistress that let you fall softly and did not tie the weight of the law to your heels which would have sunk you to the bottom of that gulf in which false favorites have generally fallen in all ages of the world  thank god and the queen that her majesty did not give you time to ruia your selves but took the knife out of your hand before you did that mischief with it that must at last have fallen with a double weight on your own heads  madmen and fools are always taken care of by their friends mischievous weapons taken from them and if they are not peaceably disposed are frequently locked up from any capacity of injuring themselves or others  her majesty could never have answered it to her own known prudence and judgment to have committed the power of your own ruin and the nations disturbance any longer to you for when once the statefrenzy appeared and all the fatal plaguetokens of lunacy and national distraction broke out in your behavior the queen as a true nursing mother to you gave you a recess from public employment that you might have time to shave your understandings discipline your tempers and put your politic capacities under a course of state physic might recover your senses a little and if possible with time and reflections come to your selves again  how kind has her majesty been to you gentlemen that when you had absolutely hanged your selves in the statenoose had actually tied the rope of causes and consequences about your necks and had you gone on but a few moments more must have been hampered irretrievably and been quite strangled with the extension of your own politics at once the kind hand of your sovereign cut you down before your breath was quite gone brought you to life again and delivered you from those dangerous wildernesses and mazes of state affairs the conduct of which you never understood and has now given you the happiness of a calm recess and fair warning not to meddle any more with things out of your sphere  keep the anniversary of your deliverance gentlemen and let it never be forgotten remember it with thankfulness to the queen to the glory of her majestys lenity and tenderness and think sometimes how impossible it had been but that the mischiefs and distractions you were pushing this nation upon must have ended in committing you the instruments of it to the hands of that justice which some of you by the unexpected happiness of revolutionclemency had the good fortune to escape from once before  my third advice is to the church of england  possibly the clergy may disdain to be advised at least by me as persons whose province it is to give not receive admonition but none ought to refuse advice but he that has never been mistaken and i hope gentlemen you will not pretend to be the men you have now your day as ashton said lately every body has the queen has declared her self of your side and that though others shall have her protection you shall have her favor  the humble advice to you gentlemen is first to deserve it secondly be contented with it  deserve it by being faithful to her and to your native country for it is a most certain truth no man can be a faithful subject to the queen who is not entirely in the interest of his native country  by this i mean for i desire to be understood no man can be a faithful subject to the present queen and deserve her favor who designs or desires to overthrow the peace of the nation she governs to overthrow the foundation on which it stands that would endeavor to bring in a popish race to reign over us and consequently involve the nation in blood and confusion it is not enough to say they design no alteration during the queens life but to keep out foreigners there is nothing so foreign to this nation as popery the church of england were the men which threw it out and how it can be that the church of england men should run a venture of its returning is past my understanding  it is true every thing that is done by the members of the church of england is not done by the church a lame shift lately made use of by a certain gentleman to throw off the scandal of passiveobedience  but with submission to that gentleman he might have answered the author of the new test of the churchs loyalty better than so or he had as good have said nothing for i think in arguing we may take the principles of a church from the writings of her doctors who are the explainers of them as well as from her confession of faith now he owns that the doctors of the church have preached such a doctrine if it be a doctrine not agreeable to the canon then they ought to have been reproved by the diocesan and punished by suspension or otherwise but however it is sufficient to the argument and therefore the distinction was needless that whether it is an article of the churchs faith or no it is a doctrine was preached by the learned doctors of the church universally received by the members of the church defended openly professed and acknowledged by those gentlemen that have been and are still esteemed fathers and pillars of the church and this is sufficient to the point  now in this respect what is done by the members of the church of england and none else is in the sense of the argument done by the church though it be not a public act of convocation or an act of delegates from the church  in this sense the church of england deposed k james and yet they never made an act of convocation for it but twas the church of england part of the nation did it and thus i am to be understood here without putting any one to the trouble of exercising his logic upon the point  in this sense too i desire to be understood of the church of england in all i shall say of em or to em i am not discussing their articles of faith i like them very well and wish they would stick close to them themselves nor am i singling out their clergy to reproach them with their immoralities of which perhaps there may be cause enough aye and in other clergy too but i am directing my discourse to the whole body of this nation who call themselves of the church of england and it is to them i say that whoever goes about to introduce a popish succession to the crown of this protestant nation whosoever designs to restore the abdicated line of the late king cannot deserve the favor which her majesty has promised them and which i cannot but suppose she promised them with a subintelligitur of their faithfulness to her and the nation  the protestant succession is the foundation on which her majesty and the nation now stands and without which they cannon stand of which may be said without profaneness as is said of the gospel other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid    as i would advise the church of england to deserve this favor of their prince so i advise them to be contented with it  it seems a manifest affront to the queens declaration that when she has promised them her favor and the dissenters her protection they should not be contented with the first without depriving the other of the last what shall we say that while the queen declares she will protect her dissenting subjects in their liberty of worship it shall be hindered from the pulpit and afterward from the collegiate press at oxford that it is the duty of all true chur of england men to erect a flag of defiance against the dissenters or phanaticks till they are rooted from off the face of the land why what is the matter gentlemen will not you let the queen keep her word with them she has promised upon her royal word to preserve the toleration and you declare she shall not this is very scoundrel usage of her majesty and a sorry return for the favor she has promised you i question not but you will come in with the shift just now mentioned that this is not an act of the church of england but gentlemen as you ought to be ashamed of it let us see you correct it or else we suppose your tacit acknowledgments is an assent  here are in england by a modest estimation above two millions of dissenters i would fain ask the hottest headed church of england man in town what he would have done with them  hanged all hanged says furioso ay sir if you could fight as well as talk it may be you might do it but they will not be hanged and how will you make them twas tried once and nothing was got by it but blows and that two for one  suppose you would banish them and suppose they would go twoud ruin you all to part with them see what a condition spain brought it self to by sending   0000 families of marescoes away  they are not only numerous but wealthy your trade would remove with em they would carry with em so much of your cash and wealth you would be in a worse case than the israelites left the egyptian ladies in without their jewels  i cannot see the policy of the church of england men in suppressing the dissenters it is certainly more for the nations good to unite all parties there can be but one thing in it convert them they cannot i never read of any conversion brought about by persecution but in france and what are new converts turned to only to submit for fear  now without pretending to prophesy i may say the dissenters in england are not to be brought to that the only thing that remains is they would have the restraint of the law taken off that they may be loose upon them to harrass and plunder them this is what is aimed at  well gentlemen when you have this liberty you dare not put it in practice further than the law will give you leave if you do the law gives them leave to resist you and in either there is half your own party will be against you nay those who are properly the chapter of england will be against it all the men of honor conscience charity and mercy will be against harrassing and dragging their neighbors about for points of conscience nay the mob of your own party will stone your informers and who are you that are left if the other should stand neuter can you force the queen to break her word are ye able to fright her into it and if you could when you have driven all the nation into confusion can you defend your selves against the laws and the party  to what purpose than is all this huffing is it not only that you want to be plundring your neighbors why if you are for plunder take arms a gods name and go and plunder the french  but i ask pardon i forgot your principles you are for plunder without fighting  the farther confirmation of this advice is drawn from the plain conviction which the powerful arguments of peace temper and moderation have forced on the minds of men  you now see gentlemen the queen the head of your own church the bishops a numerous part of your own body the men of the gown they are all convinced  it is impossible for wise men to resist demonstration the consequence of things has brought i had almost said all the wise men of the church and i would to god it were true to see the absolute necessity of peace to see that a union of parties is the only step to this nations settlement that a recess from party rage and healing the wounds of the state is the only method to prevent the nations falling into convulsions fevers calenturs and death  and why gentlemen will you stand out it were to be wished you would a little consider how is it possible you can erect your own judgments against a whole nation the queen the nobility thousands of your best parishoners born bred in and ever true to the church are convinced and will you not be moved to examine the case  what prospect of injury or mischief can you see in peace what damage can accrue to the church or state to put but a negative upon your zeal and not suffer it to outrun the law or fight with your knowledge  as you love the church your prince and your country listen to peace listen to the voice of the nation and of the queen and the voice of reason and the nature of the things all concur to call upon you to unite with your brethren and no more let small things divide us no more let our enemies beat us with our own hands and destroy us by our own assistance  if you will not give ear to this cordial advice give the author leave to determine two things which without any pretense to the spirit of prophesy he thinks he may presume to assure you of    this nation whose eyes are now open to their own safety and deliverance will do the work without you the people of england aided by the laws encouraged by the nobility the principal gentry a great body of the clergy and backed by the queen joining in this mighty work this glorious attempt to establish a party peace will do the work without you    you will fix this eternal brand of infamy on the english clergy that they were the principal opposers of the nations peace that in contempt of the blessed healing and heavenly spirit of peace in spite of the royal exhortations and invitations of their sovereign in defiance of the noble example of their brethren they even they only are at this day the wideners of our breaches the encouragers of divisions and the daily prompters of the ignorant people to abhor their brethren to hate their neighbors and to keep up the unnatural divisions of this nation  a blessed memorandum this will be to the honor and glory of our inferior clergy to remain to posterity when our children shall say we had been a happy nation if the clergy of the church had not hindered the general peace in   0  when the queen the nobility the gentry nay and the very bishops offered to join in a happy union when they all invited them to it when all circumstances concurred to make them easy and when the want of it let in slavery and bondage upon our fathers and entailed it upon us their postery  to the moderate gentlemen of the church the author of this sees but little occasion to speak the whole need not the physicians he that is in the right way needs no guide peace has brought some scandal upon you but it is from such mouths whose breath is all scandal and whose throaths is an open sepulcher  pursue gentlemen with the same courage and candor the same happy resolutions and successful measures you have begun how easy is the work of peace in england when by wise hands back with the encouragement of power it is once set on foot  go on gentlemen with success peace is always the first act of wise counsels what confusions have our state mountebanks runs us into our nms our smours hs bms grals rors and the rabble of jehus politicians whither were they hurrying this nation by civil confusions while at the same time we were involved in a cruel a formidable and threatening war abroad  you have rescued the nation god almighty by infusing principles of peace moderation union and temper into the heads and hearts of the queen and you has saved us from the ruin contrived for us by the devil and unwarily propogated to treat them with charity by our own impolitick and thoughless managers  the dissenters are another branch of those who this author with submission to their politics thinks may accept of some advice though perhaps they may be of another opinion  however whether they will hear or forbear he takes the freedom to speak to them though in general only referring a further explication of his meaning to another place  you have always and above all parties pretended to peace now show the reality of your design  you are divided in some steps which you think needful from the church let the spirit of charity remain and divide no farther than you really know to be needful  in matters of religion enjoying your liberty be content with it and study to let there be no more difference between you and the church than there really is  we are all christians all protestants all englishmen let us be all brethren and act like such on all occasions  the church of england and the dissenters have but one interest one foundation and but one end the moderate churchmen and the charitable dissenter are the same denomination of christians and all the difference which now looked at near the eye shows large if viewed at the distance of heaven shows not it self neither will catholic christianity in that realm of light appear in any partycolored garment  in civil affairs it is your interest your safety and your glory that the government should be in the church of england and even this is a security to the dissenters against all that clamor raised at them of their pulling down the church the dissenters cannot wish the downfall of the church of england governments without proving themselves lunatic and all the sense of their own interest must forsake them  in all occasions therefore with all possible cheerfulness join with the men
