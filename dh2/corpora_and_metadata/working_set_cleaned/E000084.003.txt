washington      george washington   july      answer to an address of the provincial congress of massachusetts    july      gentlemen your kind congratulations on my appointment and arrival demand my warmest acknowledgments and will ever be retained in grateful remembrance   in exchanging the enjoyments of domestic life for the duties of my present honorable but arduous station i only emulate the virtue and public spirit of the whole province of the massachusetts bay which with a firmness and patriotism without example in modern history have sacrificed all the comforts of social and political life in support of the rights of mankind and the welfare of our common country my highest ambition is to be the happy instrument of vindicating those rights and to see this devoted province again restored to peace liberty and safety the short space of time which has elapsed since   my arrival does not permit me to decide upon the state of the army the course of human affairs forbids an expectation that troops formed under such circumstances should at once possess the order regularity and discipline of veterans whatever deficiencies there may be will i doubt not soon be made up by the activity and zeal of the officers and the docility and obedience of the men these qualities united with their native bravery and spirit will afford a happy presage of success and put a final period to those distresses which now overwhelm this once happy country    i most sincerely thank you gentlemen for your declaration of readiness at all times to assist me in the discharge of the duties of my station they are so complicated and extended that i shall need the assistance of every good man and lover of his country i therefore repose the utmost confidence in your aid in return for your affectionate wishes to myself permit me to say that i earnestly implore that divine being in whose hands are all human events to make you and your constituents as distinguished in private and public happiness as you have been by ministerial oppression and private and public distress    george washington  0 july      cambridge james warren to james warren president of the provincial congress of massachusetts headquarters cambridge  0 july      sir after much difficulty and delay i have procured such returns of the state of the army as will enable us to form a judgment of its strength it is with great concern i find it inadequate to our general expectations and the duties that may be required of it the number of men fit for duty in the forces raised in this province including all the outposts and artillery does not amount to nine thousand the troops raised in the other colonies are more complete but   yet fall short of their establishment so that upon the whole i cannot estimate the present army at more than fourteen thousand five hundred men capable of duty i have the satisfaction to find the troops both in camp and quarters very healthy so that the deficiency must arise from the regiments never having been filled up to the establishment and the number of men on furlough but the former cause is by much the most considerable under all these circumstances i yesterday called a council of war and enclosed i send you an extract of our determinations so far as they respect the province of massachusetts bay  your own prudence will suggest the necessity of secrecy on this subject as we have the utmost reason to believe that the enemy suppose our numbers   much greater than they are an error which it is not our interest to remove the great extent of our lines and the uncertainty where may be the point of attack added to the necessity of immediate support have induced me to order that horses ready saddled should be kept at several posts in order to bring the most early intelligence of any movement of the enemy for this purpose i should be glad that ten horses may be provided as soon as possible i have the honor to be sir c p s as i am informed that the congress proposes to rise immediately i should be glad to know what committees are left or upon whom the executive business devolves    george washington july  0      cambridge to the president of congress  camp at cambridge july  0      sir i arrived safe at this place on the  d inst after a journey attended with a good deal of fatigue and retarded by necessary attentions to the successive civilities which accompanied me in my whole rout upon my arrival i immediately visited the several posts occupied by our troops and as soon as the weather permitted reconnoitred those of the enemy i found the latter strongly entrenchd on bunkers hill about a mile from charlestown and advanced about half a mile from the place of the last action with their centries extended about   0 yards on this side of the narrowest part of the neck leading from this place to charlestown   floating batteries lay in mystick river near their camp and one  0 gun ship below the ferry place between boston and charlestown they have also a battery on copse hill on the boston side which much annoyed our troops in the late attack upon the neck they are also deeply entrenched and strongly fortified their advanced guards till last saturday morning occupied browns houses about a mile from roxbury meeting house and  0 roods from their lines but at that time a party from general thomass camp surprized the guard drove them in and burnt the houses  the bulk of their army commanded by a b   genl howe lays on bunkers hill and the remainder on roxbury neck except the light horse and a few men in the town of boston on our side we have thrown up intrenchments on winter and prospect hills the enemies camp in full view at the distance of little more than a mile  such intermediate points as would admit a landing i have since my arrival taken care to strengthen down to sewalls farm where a strong entrenchment has been thrown up at roxbury general thomas has thrown up a strong work on the hill about  00 yards above the meeting house which with the brokenness of the ground and great number of rocks has made that pass very secure  the troops raised in new hampshire with a regiment from rhode island occupy winter hill a part of those from connecticut under general puttnam are on prospect hill  0 the troops in this town are intirely of the massachusetts the remainder of the rhode island men are at sewalls farm two regiments of connecticut and   of the massachusetts are at roxbury the residue of the army to the number of about  00 are posted in several small towns along the coast to prevent the depredations of the enemy upon the whole i think myself authorized to say that considering the great extent of line and the nature of the ground we are as well secured as could be expected in so short a time and under the disadvantages we labour these consist in a want of engineers to construct proper works and direct the men a want of tools and a sufficient number of men to man the works in case of an attack you will observe by the proceedings of the council of war which i have the honor to enclose that it is our unanimous opinion to hold and defend these works as long as possible the discouragement it would give the men and its contrary effects on the ministerial troops thus to abandon our incampment in their face formd with so much labor added to the certain destruction of a considerable and valuable extent of country and our uncertainty of finding a place in all respects so capable of making a stand are leading reasons for this determination at the same time we are very sensible of the difficulties which attend the defence of lines of so great extent and the dangers which may ensue from such a division of the army  the above facsimile shows the rough heads of subjects to be treated of in the letter to congress of  0 july      and is interesting as a key to the manner in which all of washingtons correspondence was probably prepared by the courtesy of the publishers of winsors narrative and critical history of america i am allowed to use this facsimile my earnest wishes to comply with the instructions    of the congress in making an early and complete return of the state of the army has led into an involuntary delay in addressing you which has given me much concern having given orders for this purpose immediately on my arrival and unapprized of the imperfect obedience which had been paid to those of the like nature from general ward i was led from day to day to expect they would come in and therefore detained the messenger they are not now so complete as i could wish but much allowance is to be made for inexperience in forms and a liberty which has been taken not given on this subject these reasons i flatter myself will no longer exist and of consequence more regularity and exactness in future prevail this with a necessary attention to the lines the movements of the ministerial troops and our immediate security must be my apology which i beg you lay before the congress with the utmost duty and respect we labor under great disadvantages for want of tents for tho they have been helpd out by a collection of now useless sails from the sea port towns the number is yet far short of our necessities the colleges and houses of this town are necessarily occupied by the troops which affords another reason for keeping our present situation but i most sincerely wish the whole army was properly provided to take the field as i am well assured that besides greater expedition and activity in case of alarm it would highly conduce to health and discipline as materials are not to be had here i would beg leave    to recommend the procuring a farther supply from philadelphia as soon as possible  i should be extremely deficient in gratitude as well as justice if i did not take the first opportuny to acknowledge the readiness and attention which the provincial congress and different committees have shewn to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as possible but there is a vital and inherent principle of delay incompatible with military service in transacting business thro such numerous and different channels i esteem it therefore my duty to represent the inconvenience that must unavoidably ensue from a dependence on a number of persons for supplies and submit it to the consideration of the congress whether the publick service will not be best promoted by appointing a commissary general for these purposes we have a striking instance of the preference of such a mode in the establishment of connecticut as their troops are extremely well provided under the direction of mr trumbull and he has at different times assisted others with various articles should my sentiments happily coincide with those of your honors on this subject i beg leave to recommend mr trumbull as a very proper person for this department in the arrangement of troops collected under such circumstances and upon the spur of immediate necessity    several appointments are omitted which appear to be indispensably necessary for the good government of the army particularly a quartermaster general a commissary of musters and a commissary of artillery these i must earnestly recommend to the notice and provision of the congress  i find myself already much embarrassed for want of a military chest these embarrassments will increase every day i must therefore request that money may be forwarded as soon as possible the want of this most necessary article will i fear produce great inconveniences if not prevented by an early attention i find the army in general and the troops raised in massachusetts in particular very deficient in necessary cloathing  upon inquiry there appears no probability of obtaining any supplies in this quarter and the best consideration of this matter i am able to form i am of opinion that a number of hunting shirts not less than  0000 would in a great degree remove this difficulty in the cheapest and quickest manner i know nothing in a speculative view more trivial yet if put in practice would have a happier tendency to unite the men and abolish those provincial distinctions which lead to jealousy and dissatisfaction in a former part of this letter i mentioned the want of    engineers i can hardly express the disappointment i have experienced on this subject the skill of those we have being very imperfect and confined to the mere manual exercise of cannon whereas—the war in which we are engaged requires a knowledge comprehending the duties of the field and fortifications  if any persons thus qualified are to be found in the southern colonies it would be of great publick service to forward them with all expedition upon the article of ammunition i must reecho the former complaints on this subject we are so exceedingly destitute that our artillery will be of little use without a supply both large and seasonable what we have must be reserved for the small arms and that managed with the utmost frugality i am sorry to observe that the appointments of the general officers in the province of massachusetts bay have by no means corresponded with the judgement    and wishes of either the civil or military the great dissatisfaction expressed on this subject and the apparent danger of throwing the army into the utmost disorder together with the strong representations of the provincial congress have induced me to retain the commissions in my hands untill the pleasure of the congress should be farther known except general puttnams which was given the day i came into camp and before i was apprized of these uneasinesses  in such a step i must beg the congress will do me the justice i believe that i have been actuated solely by a regard to the publick good i have not nor could have any private attachments every gentleman in appointment was an intire stranger to me but from character i must therefore rely upon the candor of the congress for their favorable construction of my conduct in this particular general spencer was so much disgusted at the preference given to general puttnam that he left the army without visiting me or making known his intentions in any respect  general pomroy had also retired before my arrival occasioned as is said by some disappointment from the provincial congress  general thomas is much    esteemed and earnestly desired to continue in the service and as far as my opportunities have enabled me to judge i must join in the general opinion that he is an able good officer and his resignation would be a publick loss the postponing him to pomroy and heath whom he has commanded would make his continuance very difficult and probably operate on his mind as the like circumstance has done on that of spencer  the state of the army you will find ascertained with tolerable precision in the returns which accompany this letter  upon finding the number of men to fall so far short of the establishment and below all expectation i immediately called a council of the general officers whose opinion as to the mode of filling up the regiments and providing for the present exigency i have the honor of inclosing together with the best judgment we are able to form of the ministerial troops from the number of boys deserters and negroes which have been inlisted in the troops of this province i entertain some doubts whether the number required can be raised here and all the general officers agree that no dependance can be put on the militia for a continuance    in camp or regularity and discipline during the short time they may stay  this unhappy and devoted province has been so long in a state of anarchy and the yoke of ministerial oppression been laid so heavily on it that great allowances are to be made for troops raised under such circumstances the deficiency of numbers discipline and stores can only lead to this conclusion that their spirit has exceeded their strength but at the same time i would humbly submit to the consideration of the congress the propriety of making some farther provision of men from the other colonies if these regiments should be completed to their establishment the dismission of those unfit for duty on account of their age and character would occasion a considerable reduction and at all events they have been inlisted upon such terms that they may be disbanded when other troops arrive but should my apprehensions be realized and the regiments here not filled up the publick cause would suffer by an absolute dependance upon so doubtful an event    unless some provision is made against such a disappointment  it requires no military skill to judge of the difficulty of introducing proper discipline and subordination into an army while we have the enemy in view and are in daily expectation of an attack but it is of so much importance that every effort will be made which time and circumstance will admit in the mean time i have a sincere pleasure in observing that there are materials for a good army a great number of able bodied men active zealous in the cause and of unquestionable courage  i am now sir to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the   th inst inclosing the resolutions of the congress of the   th ult and a copy of a letter from the committee of albany to all which i shall pay due attention general gates and sullivan have both arrived in    good health my best abilities are at all times devoted to the service of my country but i feel the weight importance and variety of my present duties too sensibly not to wish a more immediate and frequent communication with the congress i fear it may often happen in the course of our present operations that i shall need that assistance and direction from them which time and distance will not allow me to receive   0 since writing the above i have also to acknowledge your favour of the  th inst by fessenden and the receipt of the commission and articles of war the former are yet  00 short of the number required this deficiency you will please supply as soon as you conveniently can among the other returns i have also sent one of our killed wounded and missing in the late action but have been able to procure no certain account of the loss of the ministerial troops my best intelligence fixes it at about  00 killed and   or  00 wounded but it is no more than conjecture the utmost pains being taken on their side to conceal it  p s having ordered the commanding officer to give me the earliest intelligence of every motion of the enemy by land or water discoverable from the heighths of his camp i this inst as i was closing my letter received the enclosed from the brigade major the design of this manuœvre i know not perhaps it may be to make a descent some where along the coast it may be for new york or it may be practised as a deception on us i thought it not improper however to mention the matter to you i    have done the same to the commanding officer at new york and i shall let it be known to the committee of safety here so that the intelligence may be communicated as they shall think best along the sea coast of this government george washington  0 july      cambridge richard henry lee to richard henry lee in congress camp at cambridge  0 july      dear sir i was exceeding glad to receive a letter from you as i always shall be whenever it is convenient though perhaps my hurry till such time as matters are drawn a little out of the chaos they appear in at present will not suffer me to write you such full and satisfactory answers or give such clear and precise accounts of our situation and views as i could wish or you might expect after a journey a good deal retarded principally by the desire of the different townships through which i travelled of showing respect to the general of your armies i arrived here on this day week since which i have been laboring with as much assiduity by fair and threatening means to obtain returns of our strength in this camp and roxbury and their dependencies as a man could do and never have been able to accomplish the matter till this day and now i will not answer for the correctness of them although i have sent several of the regimental returns back more than once to have mistakes rectified i do not doubt but the congress will think me very    remiss in not writing to them sooner but you may rely on it yourself and i beg you to assure them that it has never been in my power till this day to comply with their orders could i have conceived that what ought and in a regular army would have been done in an hour would employ eight days i should have sent an express on the second morning after i arrived with a general account of things but expecting in the morning to receive the returns in the evening and in the evening surely to find them in the morning and at last getting them full of imperfections i have been drilled on from day to day till i am ashamed to look back at the time which has elapsed since my arrival here you will perceive by the returns that we have but about sixteen thousand effective men in all this department whereas by the accounts which i received from even the first officers in command i had no doubt of finding between eighteen and twenty thousand out of these there are only fourteen thousand fit for duty so soon as i was able to get this state of the army and came to the knowledge of our weakness i immediately summoned a council of war the result of which you will see as it is enclosed to the congress between you and me i think we are in an exceedingly dangerous situation as our numbers are not much larger than we suppose those of the enemy to be from the best accounts we are able to get they are situated in such a manner as to be drawn to any point of attack without our having an hours previous notice of it if the general will keep his own counsel    whereas we are obliged to be guarded at all points and know not where with precision to look for them i should not i think have made choice of the present posts in the first instance although i believe the communication between the town and country could not have been so well cut off without them and as much labor has been bestowed in throwing up lines and making redoubts as cambridge roxbury and watertown must be immediately exposed to the mercy of the enemy were we to retreat a little further into the country as it would give a general dissatisfaction to this colony dispirit our own people and encourage the enemy to remove at this time to another place we have for these reasons resolved in council to maintain our ground if we can our lines on winter and prospect hills and those of the enemy on bunkers hill are in full view of each other a mile distant our advance guards much nearer and the sentries almost near enough to converse at roxbury and boston neck it is the same between these we are obliged to guard several of the places at which the enemy may land they have strongly fortified or will fortify in a few days their camps and bunkers hill after which and when their newly landed troops have got a little refreshed we shall look for a visit if they mean as we are told they do to come out of their lines their great command of artillery and adequate stores of powder give them advantages which we have only to lament the want of the abuses in this army i fear are considerable and the new modelling of it in the face of an enemy    from whom we every hour expect an attack is exceedingly difficult and dangerous if things therefore should not turn out as the congress would wish i hope they will make proper allowances i can only promise and assure them that my whole time is devoted to their service and that as far as my judgment goes they shall have no cause to complain  i need    not tell you that this letter is written in much haste the fact will sufficiently appear from the face of it i thought a hasty letter would please you better than no letter and therefore i shall offer no further apology but assure you that with sincere regard for my fellow laborers with you and dr shippens family i am dear sir your most affectionate servant    george washington    july      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull  cambridge    july      sir it is with no small concern that i find the arrangement of general officers made by the honorable continental congress has produced much dissatisfaction    as the army is upon a general establishment their right to supersede and control a provincial one must be unquestionable and in such a cause i should hope every post would be deemed honorable which gave a man opportunity to serve his country a representation from the congress of this province    with such remarks as occurred to me on this subject is now before the continental congress  in the mean time i beg leave to assure you that unbiassed by any private attachments i shall studiously endeavor to reconcile their pretensions to their duty and so dispose them as to prevent as far as possible any inconvenience to the public service from this competition i have the honor to be c  george washington    july      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge    july      sir since i did myself the honor of addressing you the   th instt i have received advice from govr trumbull that the assembly of connecticut had voted and that they are now raising two regiments of  00 men each in consequence of an application from    the provincial congress of massachusetts bay the rhode island assembly has also made an augmentation for this purpose  these reinforcements with the riffle men who are daily expected and such recruits as may come in to fill up the regiments here will i apprehend compose an army sufficiently strong to oppose any force which may be brought against us at present i am very sensible that the heavy expence necessarily attendant upon this campaign will call for the utmost frugality and care and would therefore if possible avoid inlisting one unnecessary man as this is the first certain account of the destination of these new raised troops i thought proper to communicate my sentiments as early as possible least the congress should act upon my letter of the  0th and raise troops in the southern colonies which in my present judgment may be dispensd with in these   days past there have been no movements in either camp of any consequence on our side we have continued the works without any intermission and they are now so far advanced as to leave us little to apprehend on that score on the side of the enemy they have also been very industrious in finishing their lines both on bunkers hill and roxbury neck in this interval also their transports have arrived from new york and they have been employed in landing and stationing their men i have been able to collect no certain account of the  0 numbers arrived but the inclosed letter wrote tho not signed by mr sheriff lee and delivered me by capt darby who went express with an account of the lexington battle will enable us to form a pretty accurate judgment the increase of tents and men in the town of boston is very obvious but all my accounts from thence agree that there is a great mortality occasioned by the want of vegetables and fresh meat and that their loss in the late battle at charles town from the few recoveries of their wounded is greater than at first supposed the condition of the inhabitants detained in boston is very distressing they are equally destitute of the comfort of fresh provisions and many of them are so reduced in their circumstances as to be unable to supply themselves with salt such fish as the soldiery leave is their principal support added to all this such suspicion and jealousy prevails that they can scarcely speak or even look without exposing themselves to some species of military execution i have not been able from any intelligence i have received to form any certain judgment of the future operations of the enemy some times i have suspected an intention of detaching a part of their army to some part of the coast as they have been building a number of flat bottomd boats capable of holding  00 men each but from their works and the language held at boston there is reason to think they expect the attack from us and are principally engaged in preparing themselves against it    i have ordered all the whale boats along the coast to be collected and some of them are employed every night to watch the motions of the enemy by water so as to guard as much as possible against any surprize upon my arrival and since some complaints have been preferrd against officers for cowardice in the late action on bunkers hill though there were several strong circumstances and a very general opinion against them none have been condemned except a captn callender of the artillery who was immediately cashierd  i have been sorry to find it    an uncontradicted fact that the principal failure of duty that day was in the officers tho many of them distinguishd themselves by their gallant behavior the soldiers generally shewd great spirit and resolution next to the more immediate and pressing duties of putting our lines in as secure a state as possible attending to the movements of the enemy and gaining intelligence my great concern is to establish order regularity and discipline without which our numbers would embarass us and in case of action general confusion must infallibly ensue in order to this i propose to divide the army into three divisions at the head of each will be a general officer—these divisions to be again subdivided into brigades under their respective brigadiers  but the difficulty arising from the arrangement of the general officers and waiting the farther proceedings of the congress on this subject has much retarded my progress in this most necessary work i should be very happy to receive their final commands as any determination would enable me to proceed in my plan     general spencer returned to the camp two days ago and has consented to serve under puttnam rather than leave the army intirely i have heard nothing from general pomroy should he wholly retire i apprehend it will be necessary to supply his place as soon as possible general folsom proposes also to retire in addition to the officers mentioned in mine of the  0 instt i would humbly propose that some provision should be made for a judge advocate and provost marshal—the necessity of the first appointment was so great that i was obliged to nominate a mr tudor who was well recommended to me and now executes the office under an expectation of receiving a captains pay an allowance in my opinion scarcely adequate to the service in new    raised troops when there are court martials every day however as that is the proportion in the regular army and he is contented there will be no necessity of an addition i must also renew my request as to money and the appointment of a paymaster i have forbore urging matters of this nature from my knowledge of the many important concerns which engage the attention of the congress but as i find my difficulties thicken every day i make no doubt suitable regard will be paid to a necessity of this kind the inconvenience of borrowing such sums as are constantly requisite must be too plain for me to enlarge upon and is a situation from which i should be very happy to be relieved upon the experience i have had and the best consideration of the appointment of the several offices of commissary genl muster master genl quarter master genl paymaster genl and commissary of artillery i am clearly of opinion that they not only conduce to order despatch and discipline but that it is a measure of oeconomy the delay the waste and unpunishable neglect of duty arising from these offices being in commission in several hands evidently show that the publick expence must be finally enhanced i have experienced the want of these officers in completing the returns of men ammunition and stores the latter are yet imperfect from the number of hands in which they are dispersd i have inclosed the last weekly return which is more accurate than the former and hope in a little time we    shall be perfectly regular in this as well as several other necessary branches of duty i have made inquiry into the establishment of the hospital and find it in a very unsettled condition there is no principal director or any subordination among the surgeons of consequence disputes and contention have arisen and must continue untill it is reduced to some system i could wish it was immediately taken into consideration as the lives and health of both officers and men so much depend upon a due regulation of this department  i have been particularly attentive to the least symptoms of the small pox and hitherto we have been so fortunate as to have every person removed so soon as not only to prevent any communication but any alarm or apprehension it might give in the camp we shall continue the utmost vigilance against this most dangerous enemy in an army properly organized there are sundry offices of an inferior kind such as waggon master master carpenter c but i doubt whether my powers are sufficiently extensive for such appointments if it is thought proper to repose such a trust in me i shall be governed in the discharge of it by a strict regard to oeconomy and the publick interest my instructions from the hon congress direct that no troops are to be disbanded without their express direction nor to be recruited to more than double the number of the enemy upon this subject    i beg leave to represent that unless the regiments in this province are more successful in recruiting than i have reason to expect a reduction of some of them will be highly necessary as the publick is put to the whole expense of an establishment of officers while the real strength of the regiment which consists in the rank and file is defective in case of such a reduction doubtless some of the privates and all the officers would return home but many of the former would go into the remaining regiments and having had some experience would fill them up with useful men i so plainly perceive the expence of this campaign will exceed any calculation hitherto made that i am particularly anxious to strike off every unnecessary charge you will therefore sir be pleased to favor me with explicit directions from the congress on the mode of this reduction if it shall appear necessary that no time may be lost when such necessity appears yesterday we had an account that the light house was on fire—by whom and under what orders i have not yet learned but we have reason to believe it has been done by some of our irregulars you will please to present me to the congress with the utmost duty and respect p s capt darbys stay in england was so short that he brings no other information than what the inclosed letter and the news papers which will accompany this contain —general gages dispatches    had not arrived and the ministry affected to disbelieve the whole account—treating it as a fiction or at most an affair of little consequence the fall of stocks was very inconsiderable  george washington    july         july      five oclock p m since closing the letters which accompany this i have received an account of the destruction of the    light house a copy of which i have the honor to inclose  p s i have also received a more authentick account of the loss of the enemy in the late battle than any yet received dr winship who lodged in the same house with an officer of the marines assures me they had exactly  0   killed and wounded    of whom  00 fell on the field or died within a few hours many of the wounded are since dead  george washington    july      general thomas to general thomas     july      sir the retirement of a general officer possessing the confidence of his country and the army at so critical a period appears to me to be big with fatal consequences both to the public cause and his own reputation while it is unexecuted i think it my duty to use this last effort to prevent it and your own virtue and good sense must decide upon it in the usual contests of empire and ambition the conscience of a soldier has so little share that he may very properly insist upon his claims of rank and extend his pretensions even to punctilio—but in such a cause as this when the object is neither glory nor extent of territory but a defence of all that is dear and valuable in  0 private and public life surely every post ought to be deemed honorable in which a man can serve his country what matter of triumph will it afford our enemies that in less than one month a spirit of discord should show itself in the highest ranks of the army not to be extinguished by any thing less than a total desertion of duty how little reason shall we have to boast of american union and patriotism if at such a time and in such a cause smaller and partial considerations cannot give way to the great and general interest these remarks not only affect you as a member of the great american body but as an inhabitant of massachusetts bay your own province and the other colonies have a peculiar and unquestionable claim to your services and in my opinion you cannot refuse without relinquishing in some degree that character of public virtue and honor which you have hitherto supported if our cause is just it ought to be supported but when shall it find support if gentlemen of merit and experience unable to conquer the prejudices of a competition withdraw themselves in the hour of danger i admit sir that your just claims and services have not had due respect—it is by no means a singular case—worthy men of all nations and countries have had reasons to make the same complaint but they did not for this abandon the public cause—they nobly stifled the dictates of resentment and made their enemies ashamed of their injustice and can america afford no such instances of magnanimity for the sake of your bleeding country—your devoted province—your    charter rights—and by the memories of those brave men who have already fallen in this great cause i conjure you to banish from your mind every suggestion of anger and disappointment your country will do ample justice to your merits—they already do it by the regret and sorrow expressed on this occasion and the sacrifice you are called to make will in the judgment of every good man and lover of his country do you more real honor than the most distinguished victory you possess the confidence and affection of the troops of this province particularly—many of them are not capable of judging the propriety and reasons of your conduct—should they esteem themselves authorized by your example to leave the service the consequences may be fatal and irretrievable there is reason to fear it from the personal attachment of the officers and men and the obligations that are supposed to arise from these attachments but sir the other colonies have also their claims upon you not only as a native of america but an inhabitant of this province they have made common cause with it they have sacrificed their trade loaded themselves with taxes and are ready to spill their blood in vindication of the rights of massachusetts bay while all the security and profit of a neutrality have been offered them but no acts or temptations could seduce them from your side and leave you a prey to a cruel and perfidious ministry sure these reflections must have some weight with a mind as generous and considerate as yours how will you    be able to answer it to your country and to your own conscience if such a step should lead to a division of the army or the loss and ruin of america be ascribed to measures which your counsels and conduct would have prevented before it is too late i entreat sir you would weigh well the greatness of the stake and upon how much smaller circumstances the fate of empires has depended of your own honor and reputation you are the best and only judge but allow me to say that a people contending for life and liberty are seldom disposed to look with a favorable eye upon either men or measures whose passions interests or consequences will clash with those inestimable objects as to myself sir be assured that i shall with pleasure do all in my power to make your situation both easy and honorable and that the sentiments i have here expressed flow from a clear opinion that your duty to your country your posterity and yourself most explicitly require your continuance in the service the order and rank of the commissions is under the consideration of the continental congress whose determination will be received in a few days it may argue a want of respect to that august body not to wait that decision but at all events i shall flatter myself that these reasons with others which your own good judgment will suggest will strengthen your mind against those impressions which are incident to humanity and laudable to a certain degree and that the result will be your resolution to assist your country and friends in this day of distress that you may reap    the full reward of honor and public esteem which such a conduct deserves is the sincere wish of sir yours c—     george washington    july      cambridge john augustine washington to john augustine washington camp at cambridge about   miles from boston    july      dear brother on the  nd instant i arrived at this place after passing through a great deal of delightful country covered with grass although the season has been dry in a very different manner to what our lands in virginia are i found a mixed multitude of people here under very little discipline order or government i found the enemy in possession of a place called bunkers hill on charles town neck strongly intrenched and fortifying themselves i found part of our army on two hills called winter and prospect hills about a mile and a quarter from the enemy on bunkers hill in a very insecure state i found another part of the army at this village and a third part at roxbury guarding the entrance in and out of boston my whole time since i came here has been employed in throwing up lines of defence at these three several places to secure in the first instance our own troops from any attempts of the enemy and in the next place to cut off all communication between their troops and the country to do this and to prevent them from penetrating into the country with fire and sword and to harass them if they do is all that is expected of me and if effected must totally overthrow the designs of administration as the whole force of great britain in the town and harbor of boston can answer no other end than to sink her under the disgrace and weight of the expense their force    including marines tories c are computed from the best accounts i can get at about twelve thousand men  ours including sick absent c at about sixteen thousand but then we have a semicircle of eight or nine miles to guard to every part of which we are obliged to be equally attentive whilst they situated as it were in the center of the semicircle can bend their whole force having the entire command of the water against any one part of it with equal facility this renders our situation not very agreeable though necessary however by incessant labor sundays not excepted we are in a much better posture of defence now than when i first came the enclosed though rough will give you some small idea of the situation of boston and bay on this side as also of the post they have taken on charles town neck bunkers hill and our posts by very authentic intelligence lately received out of boston from a person who saw the returns the number of regulars including i presume the marines the morning of the action on bunkers hill amounted to      men their killed and wounded on that occasion amounted to  0   whereof    were officers our loss was     killed    missing and     wounded the enemy are sickly and scarce of fresh provisions beef which is chiefly got by slaughtering their milch cows in boston sells from one shilling to eighteen pence sterling per pound  and that it may    not get cheaper or more plenty i have drove all the stock within a considerable distance of this place back into the country out of the way of the menofwars boats in short i have done and shall continue to do every thing in my power to distress them the transports are all arrived and their whole reinforcement is landed so that i can see no reason why they should not if they ever attempt it come boldly out and put the matter to issue at once if they think themselves not strong enough to do this they surely will carry their arms having ships of war and transports ready to some other part of the continent or relinquish the dispute the last of which the ministry unless compelled will never agree to do  our works and those of the enemy are so near and quite open between that we see every thing that each other is doing i recollect nothing more worth mentioning i shall therefore conclude with my best wishes    and love to my sister and family and compliments to any inquiring friend your most affectionate brother     george washington    july      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler camp at cambridge    july      dear sir i wrote you yesterday by way of new york and in two hours afterwards was favored with yours of the   th and   th instant with their respective enclosures i was extremely glad to find your first apprehensions of an incursion by the indians in some degree removed by the later advices at the same time i think it is evident from the spirit and tenor of colonel johnsons letter that no art or influence will be left untried by him to engage them in such an enterprise should he once prevail upon them to dip their hands in blood mutual hostilities will most probably ensue and they may be led to take a more decisive part all accounts i think agree that the canadians are very averse to engage in this unnatural contest but i am persuaded you will not abate in the least your vigilance to expedite every movement in that quarter notwithstanding their present pacific appearances     i am much easier with respect to the public interest since your arrival at ticonderoga as i am persuaded those abilities and that zeal for the common welfare which have led your country to repose such confidence in you will be fully exerted from my own experience i can easily judge of your difficulties to introduce order and discipline into troops who have from their infancy imbibed ideas of the most contrary kind it would be far beyond the compass of a letter for me to describe the situation of things here on my arrival perhaps you will only be able to judge of it from my assuring you that mine must be a portrait at full length of what you have had a miniature confusion and disorder reigned in every department which in a little time must have ended either in the separation of the army or fatal contests with one another the better genius of america has prevailed and most happily the ministerial troops have not availed themselves of their advantages till i trust the opportunity is in a great measure past over the arrangement of the general officers in massachusetts and connecticut has been very unpopular indeed i may say injudicious it is returned to the congress for further consideration and has much retarded my plan of discipline however we mend every day and i flatter myself that in a little time we shall work up these raw materials into a good manufacture i must recommend to you what i endeavor to practise myself patience and perseverance as to your operations my dear sir i can suggest nothing which your own good judgment will not either anticipate or control from  0 your immediate view of things and the instructions of the continental congress  the express from hence to england with the account of the commencement of hostilities at lexington has returned it was far from making the impression generally expected here stocks fell but one and a half per cent general gages account had not arrived and the ministry affected to treat it as a fiction parliament had been prorogued two days but it was reported that it would be immediately recalled our enemy continues strongly posted about a mile from us both at bunkers hill and roxbury but we are not able to get any information of their future intentions part of the riflemen are come in and the rest daily expected i did not expect your returns would be very complete at first but i must beg your attention to reforming them as soon as possible and i beg leave to add that i would have you scrutinize with exactness    into the application of provisions and stores i have the utmost reason to suspect irregularities and impositions here you will be fortunate if the contagion does not reach you general lee has removed about four miles from me but i will take the first opportunity to make your kind wishes known to him col r eed and major m ifflin join me in the best wishes for your health and success i am c  george washington    july      cambridge to general court of massachusetts bay camp at cambridge    july      sir i have considerd the application  made me yesterday from the general court with all the attention due to the situation of the people in whose behalf it is made  the respect due to such a recommendation    upon referring to my instructions and consulting with those members of congress who are present as well as the general officers they all agree that it would not be consistent with my duty to detach any part of the army now here on any particular provincial service it has been debated in congress and settled that the militia or other internal strength of each province is to be applied for defence against those small and particular depredations which were to be expected  to which they were supposed to be competent this will appear the more proper when it is considerd that every town  indeed every part of our sea coast which is exposed to these depredations would have an equal claim upon this army it is the misfortune of our situation which exposes us to these ravages against which in my judgment no such temporary relief would possibly secure us the great advantage the enemy has of transporting troops by being masters of the sea will enable them to harrass us by diversions of this kind and should we be tempted to pursue them upon every alarm the army must either be so weakend as to expose it to destruction or a great part of the coast be still left unprotected nor indeed does it appear to me that such a pursuit would be attended with the least effect the first notice of such an incursion would be its actual execution and long before any troops could reach the scene of action the enemy would have an opportunity to accomplish their purpose  retire it would give me great pleasure to have it in my    power to extend protection and safety to every individual but the wisdom of the general court will anticipate me in the necessity of conducting our operations on a general and impartial scale so as to exclude any first cause of complaint and jealousy  i beg sir you will do me the honor to communicate these sentiments to the general court and to apologize for my involuntary delay as we were alarmd this morning by the enemy  my time taken up with giving the necessary directions i shall be happy in every opportunity of shewing my very great respect and regard for the general court of massachusetts bay  george washington   august      cambridge deputy governor cooke to deputy governor cooke of rhode island camp at cambridge   august      sir i was yesterday favored with yours of the   st july we have yet no certain account of the fleet which sailed out of boston on the   th but if our conjectures and information are just we may expect to hear of it every hour    i am now sir in strict confidence to acquaint you that our necessities in the articles of powder and lead are so great as to require an immediate supply i must earnestly entreat you will fall upon some measures to forward every pound of each in the colony which can possibly be spared it is not within the propriety or safety of such a correspondence to say what i might upon this subject it is sufficient that the case calls loudly for the most strenuous exertions of every friend of his country and does not admit of the least delay no quantity however small is beneath notice and should any arrive i beg it may be forwarded as soon as possible  but a supply of this kind is so precarious not only    from the danger of the enemy but the opportunity of purchasing that i have revolved in my mind every other possible chance and listened to every proposition on the subject which could give the smallest hope among others i have had one mentioned which has some weight with me as well as the general officers to whom i have proposed it one harris is lately come from bermuda where there is a very considerable magazine of powder in a remote part of the island and the inhabitants well disposed not only to our cause in general but to assist in this enterprise in particular we understand there are two armed vessels in your province commanded by    men of known activity and spirit one of which it is proposed to despatch on this errand with such assistance as may be requisite harris is to go along as the conductor of the enterprise and to avail ourselves of his knowledge of the island but without any command i am very sensible that at first view the project may appear hazardous and its success must depend on the concurrence of many circumstances but we are in a situation which requires us to run all risks no danger is to be considered when put in competition with the magnitude of the cause and the absolute necessity we are under of increasing our stock enterprises which appear chimerical often prove successful from that very circumstance common sense and prudence will suggest vigilance and care where the danger is plain and obvious but where little danger is apprehended the more the enemy will be unprepared and consequently there is the fairest prospect of success  mr brown  has been mentioned to me as a very proper person to be consulted upon this occasion you will judge of the propriety of communicating it to him in part or the whole and as soon as possible favor me with your sentiments and the steps you may have taken to forward it if no immediate and safe opportunity offers you will please to do it by express    should it be inconvenient to part with one of the armed vessels perhaps some other might be fitted out or you could devise some other mode of executing this plan so that in case of a disappointment the vessel might proceed to some other island to purchase my last letter from the honorable continental congress recommends my procuring from the colonies of connecticut and rhode island a quantity of tow cloth for the purpose of making indian or huntingshirts for the men many of whom are very destitute of clothing a pattern will be sent you and i must request you to give the necessary directions throughout your government that all the cloth of the above kind may be bought up for this use and suitable persons set to work to make it up as soon as any number is made worth the conveyance you will please to direct them to be forwarded it is designed as a species of uniform both cheap and convenient we have had no transactions in either camp since my last but what are in the public papers and related with tolerable accuracy the enemy still continue to strengthen their lines and we have reason to believe intend to bombard ours with the hopes of forcing us out of them our poverty in ammunition prevents our making a suitable return since writing the above colonel porter has undertaken to assist in the matter or to provide some suitable person to accompany harris to you who will communicate all the circumstances i am c     george washington   august      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge   august      sir i am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the   th july accompanied by     commissions which are yet much short of the necessary number i am much honored by the confidence reposing in me of appointing the several officers recommended in mine of the  0th ult and shall endeavor to select such persons as are best qualified to fill those important posts general thomas has accepted his commission and i have heard nothing of his retirement since so that i suppose he is satisfied in the renewal of those commissions some difficulties occur in which i should be glad to know the pleasure of the honbl congress the general officers of the massachusetts have regiments those of connecticut have both regiments and companies and the other field officers have companies each from rhode island the general officer has no regimt but the field officers have companies but i do not find they have or expect pay under more than one commission should the commission now to be delivered supercede these different establishments there will be a distinction between    general and field officers of the same rank in order to put new hampshire massachusetts and rhode island upon a line with connecticut it would be necessary to dismiss a number of officers in possession of commissions without any fault of theirs on the other hand to bring the connecticut generals and field officers to the same scale with the others will add to the number of officers and may be deemed inconsistent with the terms on which they entered into the service altho you add nothing to the expence except in the article of provisions upon the whole it is a case which i would wish the honbl congress to consider and determine col gridley of this province who is at the head of the artillery has the rank of major genl from the provincial congress will it be proper to renew his commission here in the same manner it is proper here to remark that in this case he will take rank of all the brigadiers general and even the majors general whose commissions are subsequent in date and can answer no good purpose but may be productive of many bad consequences  these are matters of some importance but i am embarrassed with a difficulty of a superior kind the estimate made in congress supposed all the regiments to be formed upon one establishment but they are different in different provinces and even vary in the same province in some particulars in massachusetts some regiments have ten companies  0 others eleven the establishment of the former is   0 men officers included of the latter     the establishment of rhode island and new hampshire is   0 to a regiment officers included connecticut has  000 men to a regiment should the massachusetts regiments be completed with the new levies from rhode island and connecticut and the riffle men the number will exceed   000 if they should not be completed as each regiment is fully officerd there will be a heavy expense to the publick without an adequate service the reduction of some of them seems to be necessary and yet is a matter of much delicacy as we are situated i most earnestly request it may be taken into immediate consideration and the time and mode of doing it pointed out by the honbl congress by an estimate i have made from the general return when the new levies arrive and the regiments are completed there will be     0 men on the pay and provision of the united colonies some of the recruiting officers who have been out on that service have returned with very little success so that we may safely conclude the number of  0   now wanting to complete will rather increase than diminish there are the regiment of artillery consisting of     men and one under col sergeant who has not received any commission altho he had orders to raise a regiment from the provincial congress here which are not included in the above estimate this last regiment consists of     men by the last return but a company has since joined    by adverting to the general return which i have the honor of inclosing no    it will be seen what regiments are most deficient if the congress does not chuse to point out the particular regiments but the provinces in which the reduction is to be made the several congresses and assemblies may be the proper channell to conduct this business which i should also conceive the most adviseable from their better acquaintance with the merits terms and time of service of the respective officers reducing some regiments and with the privates thereof filling up others would certainly be the best method of accomplishing this work if it were practicable but the experiment is dangerous as the massachusetts men under the priviledge of chusing their own officers do not conceive themselves bound if those officers are disbanded as general gage is making preparations for winter by contracting for quantities of coal it will suggest to us the propriety of extending our views to that season i have directed that such huts as have been lately made of boards should be done in    such a manner that if necessary they may serve for covering during the winter but i need not enlarge upon the variety of necessities such as clothing fuel c—both exceedingly scarce and difficult to be procured which that season must bring with it if the army or any considerable part of it is to remain embodied from the inactivity of the enemy since the arrival of their whole reinforcement their continual addition to their lines and many other circumstances i am inclined to think that finding us so well prepared to receive them the plan of operations is varied and they mean by regular approaches to bombard us out of our present line of defence or are waiting in expectation that the colonies must sink under the weight of the expence or the prospect of a winters campaign so discourage the troops as to break up our army if they have not some such expectations the issue of which they are determined to wait i cannot account for the delay when their strength is lessened every day by sickness desertions and little skirmishes of these last we have had only two worthy of notice having some reason to suspect they were extending their lines at charles town i last saturday evening ordered some of the riffle men down to make a discovery or bring off a prisoner they were accidentally discovered sooner than they expected by the guard coming to relieve and obliged to fire upon them we have reason to believe they killed several they brought in two prisoners whose    acct confirmed by some other circumstances removed my suspicions in part since that time we have on each side drawn in our centries and there have been scattering fires along the line this evening we have heard of three captains who have been taken off by the riffle men and one killed by a cannon shot from roxbury besides several privates but as the intelligence is not direct i only mention it as a report which deserves credit the other happened at the light house a number of workmen have been sent down to repair it with a guard of    marines and a subaltern major tupper last monday morning about   clock landed there with about  00 men attackd them killed the officer and   privates but being detained by the tide in his return he was attackd by several boats but he happily got through with the loss of one man killed and another wounded the remainder of the ministerial troops three of which are badly wounded he brought off prisoners with  0 tories all of whom are on their way to springfield gaol the riffle men in this skirmish lost one man who we hear is a prisoner in boston gaol the enemy in return endeavored to surprise our guard at roxbury but they being apprized of it by a deserter had time to prepare for it but by some negligence or misconduct in the officer of the guard they burnt the george tavern on the neck and have every day since been cannonading us from their lines both at roxbury and charles town but with no other effect than the loss of two men on our part except    straggling fires from the small arms about the lines which we endeavor to restrain we have made little or no return our situation in the article of powder is much more alarming than i had the most distant idea of having desired a return to be made out on my arrival of the ammunition i found  0 ½ bbbls of powder mentioned as in the store but on ordering a new supply of cartridges yesterday i was informed to my very great astonishment that there was no more than    bbbls of the massachusetts store which with the stock of rhode island new hampshire and connecticut makes      lb—not more than   rounds a man as there had been no consumption of powder since that could in any degree account for such a deficiency i was very particular in my inquiries and found that the committee of supplies not being sufficiently acquainted with the nature of a return or misapprehending my request sent in an account of all the ammunition which had been collected by the provinces so that the report included not only what was in hand but what had been spent upon discovering this mistake i immediately went up to confer with the speaker of the house of representatives upon some measures to obtain a supply from the neighboring townships in such a manner as might prevent our poverty being known as it is a secret of too great consequence to be divulged in the general court some individual of which might perhaps indiscreetly suffer it to escape him so as to find its way to the enemy the consequences of which are terrible even    in idea i shall also write to the governors of rhode island and connecticut and the committee of safety in new hampshire on this subject urging in the most forcible terms the necessity of an immediate supply if in their power i need not enlarge on our melancholy situation it is sufficient that the existence of the army and the salvation of the country depends upon something being done for our relief both speedy and effectual and that our situation be kept a profound secret in the inclosures no   and   i send the allowance of provisions c made by the provinces of connecticut and massachusetts the mode and quantity are different from what has fallen within my experience and i am confident must prove very wasteful and expensive if any alteration can be safely made which i much doubt there might be a great saving to the publick a gentleman of my family  assisted by a deserter who has some skill in fortification has by my direction sketchd out two draughts of our respective lines at charles town and roxbury which with the explanation will convey some idea of our situation and i hope prove acceptable to the members of the honorable congress they are the inclosures no   and   since i had the honor of addressing you last i have been applied to by a committee of the general court for a detachment of the army to protect    the inhabitants of the eastern parts of this province from some apprehended depredations on their coasts i could have wishd to have complied with their request but after due consideration and consulting the general officers together with those members of congress who are here i thought it my duty to excuse myself the application and my answer are the inclosures no   and   which i hope will be approved by the honorable congress since i began this letter the original of which the inclosure no   is a copy fell into my hands as the writer is a person of some note in boston and it contains some advices of importance not mentioned by others i thought proper to forward it as i received it by comparing the handwriting with another letter it appears the writer is one belcher noyes a person probably known to some of the gentlemen delegates from this province who can determine from his principles and character what credit is due to him the army is now formed into three grand divisions under the command of the generals ward lee and puttnam each division into two brigades consisting of about   regiments each commanded by generals thomas and spencer at roxbury heath at cambridge sullivan and greene at winter hill by this you will please to observe there is a deficiency of one brigadier general occasioned by mr pomroys not acting under his commission which i beg may be filled up as soon as possible i observe the honbl congress have also favored me with the    appointment of three brigade majors i presume they have or intend to appoint the rest soon as they cannot be unacquainted that one is necessary to each brigade and in a new raised army it will be an office of great duty and service general gage has at length liberated the people of boston who land in numbers at chelsea every day the terms on which the passes are granted as to money effects and provisions correspond with mr noyess letter we have several reports that general gage is dismantling castle william and bringing all the cannon up to town but upon a very particular inquiry accounts are so various that i cannot ascertain the truth of it i am sorry to be under a necessity of making such frequent examples among the officers when a sense of honor and the interest of their country might be expected to make punishment unnecessary since my last capt parker of massachusetts for frauds both in pay and provisions and capt gardiner of rhode island for cowardice in running away from his guard on an alarm have been broke as nothing can be more fatal to an army than crimes of this kind i am determined by every motive of reward and punishment to prevent them in future on the first instt a chief of the cagnewaga tribe  who lives about   miles from montreal came in here    accompanied by a col bayley of cohoss  his accounts of the temper and disposition of the indians are very favorable he says they have been strongly sollicited by gov carleton to engage against us but his nation is totally averse threats as well as intreaties have been used without effect  that the canadians are well disposed to the english colonies and if any expedition is meditated against canada the indians in that quarter will give all their assistance i have endeavored to cherish these favorable dispositions and have recommended to him to cultivate them on his return what i have said i enforced with a present which i understood would be agreeable to him and as he is represented to be a man of weight and consequence in his own tribe i flatter myself his visit will have a good effect his accounts of gov carletons force and situation at st johns correspond with what we have already had from that quarter the accession of georgia to the measures of the congress is a happy event and must give a sincere pleasure to every friend of america august  th we have accounts this morning of two explosions at the castle so that its destruction may now be supposed certain    i have this morning been alarmed with an information that two gentlemen from philada mr hitchbourn and capt white with letters for general lee and myself have been taken by capt ayscough at rhode island the letters intercepted and sent forward to boston with the bearers as prisoners that the captain exulted much in the discoveries he had made and my informer who was also in the boat but released understood them to be the letters of consequence i have therefore dispatchd the express immediately back tho i had before resolved to detain him till fessendens return i shall be anxious till i am relieved from the suspence i am in as to the contents of those letters it is exceedingly unfortunate that gentlemen should chuse to travel the only road on which there is danger let the event of this be what it will i hope it will serve as a general caution against trusting any letter that way in future nothing of consequence has occurrd in the camp these two days the inhabitants of boston continue coming out at chelsea but under a new restriction that no men shall come out without special licence—which is refused to all mechanicks since the tory laborers were taken at the light house   0 george washington   august      cambridge lewis morris to lewis morris  camp at cambridge   august      dear sir i have been favored with your letter of the   th ulto by messrs ogden and burr and wish it was in my power to do that justice to the merits of those gentlemen which you think them entitled to whenever it is i shall not be unmindful of your recommendations the two or three appointments with which i have been honored by congress were partly engaged before i received your letter and you will please recollect that the ultimate appointment of all other officers is vested in the governments in which the regiments were originally raised i can venture to pronounce therefore that few commissions in this army will be disposed of out of the four new england governments the good policy and justice of which you may judge of as well as i can as volunteers from any other colonies however deserving they may be of notice or to be considered on account of the expence which they are run to will stand little chance whilst there is an application from any person of the government from whence the regiment came admitting this to be the case and i believe hardly any one will doubt it had not the congress better reserve these appointments in their own hands it will be putting the matter upon a much larger bottom and giving merit a better chance nor do i see any inconvenience arising from it as it is highly presumable that during the continuance of    these disturbances the congress will be chiefly sitting or acting by a committee from whence commissions might be as easily obtained as from a provincial assembly or congress i have taken the liberty of suggesting this matter as i conceive the service will be infinitely promoted thereby as merit only without a regard to country will entitle a man to preferment when and so often as vacancys may happen—having wrote fully to the congress respecting the state of publick affairs i shall refer you to that and am c george washington   august      cambridge joseph palmer to j palmer cambridge   august      sir your favor of yesterday came duely to my hands as i did not consider local appointments as having any operation upon the general one i had partly engaged at least in my own mind the office of quartermastergenl before your favor was presented to me in truth sir i think it sound policy to bestow officers indiscriminately among the gentlemen of the different governmts for as all bear a proportionable part toward the expence of this war if no gentlemen out of these four governments come in for any share of the appointments it may be apt to create jealousies which will in the end give disgust for this reason i would earnestly recommend to your board to provide for some of the volunteers who are come from    philadelphia with very warm recommendations tho strangers to me— in respect to the boats c from salem i doubt in the first place whether they can be brought over by land—in the second i am sure nothing could ever be executed here by surprize as i am well convinced that nothing is transacted in our camp or lines but what is known in boston in less than    hours—indeed circumstanced as we are it is scarce possible to do otherwise unless we were to stop the communication between the country  our camp  lines in which case we shd render our supplies of milk vegetables c difficult  precarious—we are now building a kind of floating battery when that is done  the utility of it discovered i may possibly apply for timber to build more as circumstances shall require i remain with great esteem sir c  george washington   august      to the president of the council of massachusetts bay headquarters   august      sir by the general return made to me for last week i find there are great numbers of soldiers and noncommissioned officers who absent themselves from duty the greater part of whom i have reason to believe are at their respective homes in different parts of the country some employed by their officers on their farms and others drawing pay from the public while they are working on their own plantations    or for hire my utmost exertions have not been able to prevent this base and pernicious conduct i must therefore beg the assistance of the general court to coöperate with me in such measures as may remedy this mischief i am of opinion it might be done either wholly or in part by the committees in your several towns making strict and impartial inquiry of such as are found absent from the army upon whose account they have left it by whose leave and for what time requiring such as have no impediment of sickness or other good reason to return to their duty immediately or in case of failure sending an account of their names and the company and regiment to which they belong that i may be able to make examples of such delinquents  i need not enlarge upon the ruinous consequences of suffering such infamous deserters and defrauders of the public to go unnoticed or unpunished nor use any arguments to induce the general court to give it immediate attention the necessity of the case does not permit me to doubt the continued exertions of that zeal which has distinguished the general court upon less important occasions i have the honor to be c    george washington   august      cambridge to the provincial congress of new york camp at cambridge   august      gentlemen it must give great concern to any considerate mind that when this whole continent at a vast expense of blood and treasure is endeavoring to establish its liberties on the most secure and solid foundations not only by a laudable opposition of force to force but denying itself the usual advantages of trade there are men among us so basely sordid as to counteract all our exertions for the sake of a little gain you cannot but have heard that the distresses of the ministerial troops for fresh provisions and many other necessaries at boston were very great it is a policy justifiable by all the laws of war to endeavor to increase them desertions discouragement and a dissatisfaction with the service besides weakening their strength are some of the natural consequences of such a situation and if continued might afford the fairest hope of success without further effusion of human blood a vessel cleared lately out of new york for st croix with fresh provisions and other articles has just gone into boston instead of pursuing her voyage to the west indies i have endeavored to discover the name of the captain or owner but as yet without success the owner it is said went to st croix before the vessel from which and her late arrival i make no doubt you will be able to discover and expose the villain and if you could fall upon some effectual measures to prevent the like in future it    would be doing a signal service to our common country  i have been endeavoring by every means in my power to discover the future intentions of our enemy here i find a general idea prevailing throughout the army and in the town of boston that the troops are soon to leave the town and go to some other part of the continent new york is generally mentioned as the place of their destination i should think a rumor or suggestion of this kind worthy of very little notice if it were not confirmed by some corresponding circumstances but four weeks of total inactivity with all their reinforcements arrived and recruited the daily diminution by desertion sickness and small skirmishes induce an opinion that any effort they propose to make will be directed elsewhere  i thought it proper just to hint to you what is probably intended and you will then consider what regard is to be paid to it and what steps it will be expedient    for you to take if any i am with great respect and regard gentlemen c  george washington    august      cambridge to a committee of the general court of massachusetts bay camp at cambridge    august      gentlemen i have considered the papers you left with me yesterday  as to the expedition proposed against nova scotia by the inhabitants of machias i cannot but applaud their spirit and zeal but after considering the reasons offered for it several objections occur which seem to me unanswerable i apprehend such an enterprise to be inconsistent with the general principle upon which the colonies have proceeded that province has not acceded it is true to the measures of congress and therefore it has been excluded from all commercial intercourse with the other colonies but it has not commenced hostilities against them nor are any to be apprehended to attack it therefore is a measure of conquest rather than defence and may be attended with very dangerous consequences    it might perhaps be easy with the force proposed to make an incursion into the province and overawe those of the inhabitants who are inimical to our cause and for a short time prevent their supplying the enemy with provisions but to produce any lasting effects the same force must continue as to the furnishing vessels of force you gentlemen will anticipate me in pointing out our weakness and the enemys strength at sea there would be great danger that with the best preparations we could make they would fall an easy prey either to the menofwar on that station or to some which would be detached from boston i have been thus particular to satisfy any gentleman of the court who should incline to adopt the measure i could offer many other reasons against it some of which i doubt not will suggest themselves to the honorable board but it is unnecessary to enumerate them when our situation as to ammunition absolutely forbids our sending a single ounce of it out of the camp at present i am gentlemen c  george washington    august      cambridge lieutenantgeneral gage to lieutenantgeneral gage headquarters cambridge    august      sir i understand that the officers engaged in the cause of liberty and their country who by the fortune of war have fallen into your hands have been thrown    indiscriminately into a common gaol appropriated for felons that no consideration has been had for those of the most respectable rank when languishing with wounds and sickness that some have been even amputated in this unworthy situation let your opinion sir of the principle which actuates them be what it may they suppose they act from the noblest of all principles a love of freedom and their country but political principles i conceive are foreign to this point the obligations arising from the rights of humanity and claims of rank are universally binding and extensive except in case of retaliation these i should have hoped would have dictated a more tender treatment of those individuals whom chance or war had put in your power nor can i forbear suggesting its fatal tendency to widen that unhappy breach which you and those ministers under whom you act have repeatedly declared you wished to see for ever closed my duty now makes it necessary to apprize you that for the future i shall regulate my conduct towards those gentlemen who are or may be in our possession exactly by the rule you shall observe towards those of ours now in your custody if severity and hardship mark the line of your conduct painful as it may be to me your prisoners will feel its effects but if kindness and humanity are shown to ours i shall with pleasure consider those in our hands only as unfortunate and they shall receive from me that treatment to which the unfortunate are ever entitled    i beg to be favored with an answer as soon as possible and am sir your very humble servant   0 george washington    august      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull camp at cambridge    august      sir your favors of the  th  th and   th inst are all received the detention of the new raised levies has happily coincided with my intentions respecting them in the present uncertainty i think it best they should continue where they are and i hope their officers will be assiduous in disciplining and improving them in the use of their arms upon the subject of powder i am at a loss what to say—our necessities are so great and it is of such importance that this army should have a full supply that nothing but the most urgent and pressing exigence would make it proper to detain any on its way—i have been informed that    hhds were lately landed at new york and that farther supplies were daily expected both there and at connecticut should there be any arrivals i beg no time may be lost in forwarding this from hartford and what can be spared from the necessary colony stock—indeed at present i should chuse you to forward one of these waggons and the other may remain where it is till we see the issue of our expectations on this head the removal from boston i consider as very precarious by no means deserving to have so much stress laid    on it we begin to feel a scarcity of lead and as i do not learn that we are to expect any from the southward—i have concluded that a part of the stock found at ticonderoga should be brought down and for this purpose have wrote to genl schuyler i am not sufficiently master of the geography of the country to know the easiest mode of conveyance—but from the time in which letters have come thro your hands i apprehend thro connecticut must be the best  most expeditious you will therefore be pleased to give us your assistance and take the direction of this matter into your own hands to which i have not the least doubt you will attend as well to the expence as other circumstances conducive to the publick service nothing new in the camp for several days past—three deserters have come in within these    hours but they bring no intelligence of any consequence i am sir c since writing the above i have been informed there is a lead mine in your colony which may be workd to advantage cut off from all foreign supplies every internal resource is worthy of attention  i make no doubt if my information is just some proper steps may be taken to turn this to the publick advantage george washington    august      deputygovernor cooke to deputygovernor cooke    august      sir your favors of the   and   th instt are duly received the former i laid before the general court of this province but one of the delegates having    communicated to them what mr ward did to you of the proceedings of the continental congress touching this powder nothing was done towards the providing of specie that the vessel might proceed to other places in case of a disappointment at the first i am of opinion that the collection of any considerable sum here would be difficult in the time proposed and i think there is the less necessity for it as there are few colonies who have not some vessel out on this errand and will probably bring all that is at market—having conversed with col porter and farther considered the matter i am of opinion it ought to be prosecuted on the single footing of procuring what is in the magazine the voyage is short our necessity is great the expectation of being supplied by the inhabitants of the island under such hazards as they must run is slender so that the only chance of success is by a sudden strike there is a great difference between acquiescing in the measure and becoming principals the former we have great reason to expect the latter is doubtful the powder by all our information is publick property so that as you observe it may be settled with our other accounts the draughting of men from hence would be very difficult and endanger a discovery of the scheme i am not clear that i have power to send them off the continent and to engage them as volunteers it would be necessary to make their destination known i should suppose the captain who is to have the direction of this enterprize would rather chuse to have men whom he knew and in    whom he could confide in preference to strangers from what col parks informs me i do not see that harriss presence is absolutely necessary and as his terms would add considerably to the expence after obtaining from him all the intelligence he could give his attendance might be dispensed with—the vessel lately sent out to cruise for powder seems to me the properest for this voyage and as the ten days will soon be out if no objection occurs to you she might be dispatched i have given directions respecting the lead at ticonderoga which i am of opinion with you is the surest mode of supply in that article i have sent by this oppy a huntingshirt as a pattern i should be glad you would inform me of the number you think i may expect i have flattered myself that the vigilance of the inhabitants on the islands and coasts would have disappointed the enemy in their late expedition after live stock i hope nothing will be omitted by the several committees and other persons to guard against any future attempts by removing all the stock from those places where their shipping can protect them in plundering i do assure you sir that it would be rendering a most essential service to the publick interest their distresses before were very great and if renewed after their present supply is exhausted must be productive of very great advantage     george washington    august      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler camp at cambridge    august      sir i received your favor of the   st of july  informing me of your preparations to cross the lake and enclosing the affidavits of john shatforth and john duguid  several indians of the tribe of st francis came in here yesterday and confirm the former accounts of the good dispositions of the indian nations and canadians to the interests of america a most happy event on which i sincerely congratulate you     i am glad to relieve you from your anxiety respecting troops being sent from boston to quebec these reports i apprehend took their rise from a fleet being fitted out about fourteen days ago to plunder the islands in the sound of their live stock an expedition which they have executed with some success and are just returning but you may depend on it no troops have been detached from boston for canada or elsewhere among other wants of which i find you have your proportion we feel that of lead most sensibly and as we have no expectation of a supply from the southward i have concluded to draw upon the stock found at ticonderoga when it fell into our hands i am informed that it is considerable and that a part of it may be spared without exposing you to any inconvenience in consequence of this i have wrote to governor trumbull to take the direction of the transportation of it supposing the conveyance through connecticut the most safe and expeditious i expect he will write you on this subject by this opportunity i have nothing new my dear sir to write you    we are precisely in the same situation as to the enemy as when i wrote last nor can i gain any certain intelligence of their future intentions the troops from the southward are come in very healthy and in good order  tomorrow i expect a supply of powder from philadelphia which will be a most seasonable relief in our present necessity god grant you health and success equal to your merit and wishes favor me with intelligence as often as you can and believe me with very sincere regard dear sir yours c george washington  0 august      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler headquarters cambridge  0 august      dear sir since my last of the   th instant i have been favored with yours of the  th i am much concerned to find that the supplies ordered have been so much delayed by this time i hope colonel mcdougall whose zeal is unquestionable has joined you with every thing necessary for prosecuting your plan several of the delegates from philadelphia who have visited our camp assure me that powder is forwarded to you and the daily arrivals of that article give us reason to hope that we shall soon have a very ample supply  animated with the goodness of    our cause and the best wishes of your countrymen i am sure you will not let any difficulties not insuperable damp your ardor perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages  in my last a copy of which is enclosed i sent you an account of the arrival of several st francis indians in our camp and their friendly dispositions you have also a copy of the resolution of congress by which you will find it is their intention to seek only a neutrality of the indian nations unless the ministerial agents should engage them in hostilities or enter into an offensive alliance with them  i have been therefore embarrassed in giving them an answer when they have tendered their services and assistance as your situation enables you best to know the notions of the governor  and the agents    i proposed to him the chief to go home by way of ticonderoga referring him to you for an answer which you would give according to the intelligence you have had and the judgment you have formed of the transactions among the indians but as he does not seem in any hurry to leave our camp your answer by the return of this express may possibly reach me before he returns and alter his route four of his company still remain in our camp and propose to stay some time with us  the design of this express is to communicate to you a plan of an expedition which has engaged my thoughts for several days it is to penetrate into canada by way of kennebec river and so to quebec by a route ninety miles below montreal i can very well spare a detachment for this purpose of one thousand or twelve hundred men and the landcarriage by the route proposed is too inconsiderable to make an objection if you are resolved to proceed which i gather from your last letter is your intention it would make a diversion that would distract carleton and facilitate your views he must either break up and follow this party to quebec by which he will    leave you a free passage or he must suffer that important place to fall into our hands an event that would have a decisive effect and influence on the public interests there may be some danger that such a sudden incursion might alarm the canadians and detach them from that neutrality which they have hitherto observed but i should hope that with suitable precautions and a strict discipline preserved any apprehensions and jealousies might be removed the few whom i have consulted upon it approve it much but the final determination is deferred until i hear from you you will therefore by the return of this messenger inform me of your ultimate resolution if you mean to proceed acquaint me as particularly as you can with the time and force what late accounts you have had from canada and your opinion as to the sentiments of the inhabitants as well as those of the indians upon a penetration into their country what number of troops are at quebec and whether any menofwar with all other circumstances which may be material in the consideration of a step of such importance not a moments time is to be lost in the preparation for this enterprise if the advices received from you favor it with the utmost expedition the season will be considerably advanced so that you will dismiss the express as soon as possible while the three new hampshire companies remain in their present station they will not be considered as composing a part of the continental army but as a militia under the direction and pay of the colony whose inhabitants they are or for whose defence  0 they are stationed so that it will not be proper for me to give any orders respecting them we still continue in the same situation as to the enemy as when i wrote you last but we have had six tons and a half of powder from the southward which is a very seasonable supply we are not able to learn any thing further of the intentions of the enemy and they are too strongly posted for us to attempt any thing upon them at present my best wishes attend you and believe me with much truth and regard my dear sir your very obedient humble servant george washington  0 august      cambridge lieutenantgeneral gage to lieutenantgeneral gage headquarters cambridge  0 august      sir i addressed you on the   th instant in terms which gave the fairest scope for that humanity and politeness which were supposed to form a part of your character i remonstrated with you on the unworthy treatment shown to the officers and citizens of america whom the fortune of war chance or a mistaken confidence had thrown into your hands whether british or american mercy fortitude and patience are most preeminent whether our virtuous citizens whom the hand of tyranny has forced into arms to defend their wives their children and their property or the mercenary instruments of lawless domination avarice and revenge best deserve the appellation of rebels and the punishment of that cord which your affected clemency has forborne to inflict whether the authority under which i act is    usurped or founded upon the genuine principles of liberty were altogether foreign to the subject i purposely avoided all political disquisition nor shall i now avail myself of those advantages which the sacred cause of my country of liberty and of human nature give me over you much less shall i stoop to retort and invective but the intelligence you say you have received from our army requires a reply i have taken time sir to make a strict inquiry and find it has not the least foundation in truth not only your officers and soldiers have been treated with a tenderness due to fellow citizens and brethren but even those execrable parricides whose counsels and aid have deluged their country with blood have been protected from the fury of a justly enraged people far from compelling or permitting their assistance i am embarrassed with the numbers who crowd to our camp animated with the purest principles of virtue and love to their country you advise me to give free operation to truth to punish misrepresentation and falsehood if experience stamps value upon counsel yours must have a weight which few can claim you best can tell how far the convulsion which has brought such ruin on both countries and shaken the mighty empire of britain to its foundation may be traced to these malignant causes you affect sir to despise all rank not derived from the same source with your own i cannot conceive one more honorable than that which flows from the uncorrupted choice of a brave and free people the purest source and original fountain of all power far from making it a plea for cruelty a mind of true    magnanimity and enlarged ideas would comprehend and respect it what may have been the ministerial views which have precipitated the present crisis lexington concord and charlestown can best declare may that god to whom you then appealed judge between america and you under his providence those who influence the councils of america and all the other inhabitants of the united colonies at the hazard of their lives are determined to hand down to posterity those just and invaluable privileges which they received from their ancestors i shall now sir close my correspondence with you perhaps for ever if your officers our prisoners receive a treatment from me different from that which i wished to show them they and you will remember the occasion of it i am sir your very humble servant  george washington    augst      cambridge joseph palmer to j palmer cambridge    augst      sir in answer to your favor of yesterday i must inform you that i have often been told of the advantages of point alderton with respect to its command of the shipping going in and out of boston harbor    and that it has before now been the object of my particular enquiries—that i find the accts differ exceedingly in regard to the distance of the ship channel—and that there is a passage on the outer side of the light house island for all vessels except ships of the first rate my knowledge of this matter would not have rested upon enquires only if i had found myself at any time since i came to this place in a condition to have taken such a post but it becomes my duty to consider not only what place is advantageous but what number of men are necessary to defend it how they can be supported in case of an attack how they may retreat if they cannot be supported and what stock of ammunition we are provided with for the purpose of self defence or annoyance of the enemy in respect to the first i conceive our defence must be proportioned to the attack of genl gages whole force leaving him just enough to man his lines on charles town neck  roxbury and with regard to the second and most important object we have only     barrls of powder in all which is not sufficient to give  0 musket cartridges a man  scarce enough to serve the artillery in any brisk action a single day     would it be prudent then in me under these circumstances to take a post  0 miles distant from this place when we already have a line of circumvaleation at least ten miles in extent any part of which may be attacked if the enemy will keep their own council without our having one hours previous notice of it—or is it prudent to attempt a measure which necessarily would bring on a consumption of all the ammunition we have thereby leaving the army at the mercy of the enemy or to disperse  the country to be ravaged and laid waste at discretion—to you sir who is a well wisher to the cause and can reason upon the effects of such a conduct i may open myself with freedom because no improper discoveries will be made of our situation but i cannot expose my weakness to the enemy tho i believe they are pretty well informed of every thing that passes by telling this and that man who are daily pointing out this—that—and tother place of all the motives that govern my actions notwithstanding i know what will be the consequence of not doing it—namely that i shall be accused of inattention to the publick service— perhaps with want of spirit to prosecute it—but this shall have no effect upon my mind and i will steadily as far as my judgment will assist me pursue such measures as i think most conducive to the interest of the cause  rest satisfied of    any obloquy that shall be thrown conscious of having discharged my duty to the best of my abilities i am much obliged to you however as i shall be to every gentleman for pointing out any measure which is thought conducive to the publick good and chearfully follow any advice which is not inconsistent with but corrispondant to the general plan in view  practicable under such particular circumstances as govern in cases of the like kind in respect to point alderton i was no longer ago than monday last talking to genl thomas on this head  proposing to send colo putnam down to take the distances c but considered it could answer no end but to alarm  make the enemy more vigilant unless we were in condition to possess the post to effect i thought it as well to postpone the matter a while i am sir c  george washington    august      cambridge william howe to sir william howe  camp at cambridge    august      sir i flatter myself you have been misinformed as to the conduct of the men under my command complained    of in yours of yesterday it is what i should highly disapprove and condemn i have not the least objection to put a stop to the intercourse between the two camps either totally or partially it obtained through the pressing solicitations of persons cruelly separated from their friends and connexions and i understood was mutually convenient i am sir your most obedient humble servant george washington    august      cambridge richard henry lee to richard henry lee camp at cambridge    august      dear sir your favor of the first inst by mr randolph  came safe to hand—the merits of this young gentleman added to your recommendation and my own knowledge of his character induced me to take him into my family as an aid de camp in the room of mr mifflin whom i have appointed quarter master genel from a thorough perswasion of his integrity—my own experience of his activity—and finally because he stands unconnected with either of these governments or with this that or tother man for between you and i there is more in this than you can easily immagine as we have now nearly compleated our lines of defence we have nothing more in my opinion to fear from the enemy provided we can keep our men to their duty and make them watchful and vigilant but it is among the most difficult tasks i ever undertook    in my life to induce these people to believe that there is or can be danger till the bayonet is pushed at their breasts not that it proceeds from any uncommon prowess but rather from an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people which believe me prevails but too generally among the officers of the massachusets part of the army who are nearly of the same kidney with the privates and adds not a little to my difficulties as there is no such thing as getting of officers of this stamp to exert themselves in carrying orders into execution—to curry favor with the men by whom they were chosen  on whose smiles possibly they may think they may again rely seems to be one of the principal objects of their attention i submit it therefore to your consideration whether there is or is not a propriety in that resolution of the congress which leaves the ultimate appointment of all officers below the rank of generals to the governments where the regiments originated now the army is become continental—to me it appears improper in two points of view first it is giving that power and weight to an individual colony which ought of right to belong only to the whole and next it damps the spirit and ardor of volunteers from all but the four new england governments as none but their people have the least chance of getting into office—would it not be better therefore to have the warrants which the commanderinchief is authorized to give protempore approved or disapproved by the continental congress or a committee    of their body which i should suppose in any long recess must always sit in this case every gentleman will stand an equal chance of being promoted according to his merits in the other all officers will be confined to the inhabitants of the   new england governments which in my opinion is impolitick to a degree i have made a pretty good slam among such kind of officers as the massachusets government abound in since i came to this camp having broke one colo and two captains for cowardly behavior in the action on bunkers hill—two captains for drawing more provisions and pay than they had men in their company—and one for being absent from his post when the enemy appeared there and burnt a house just by it besides these i have at this time—one colo one major one captn  two subalterns under arrest for tryal—in short i spare none yet fear it will not all do as these people seem to be too inattentive to every thing but their interest     i have not been unmindful of that part of your letter respecting point alderton—before the receipt of it it had become an object of my particular enquiry but the accts of its situation differ exceedingly in respect to the command it has of the ship channel but my knowledge of this matter would not have been confined to enquiries only if i had ever been in a condition since my arrival here to have taken possession of such a post but you well know my good sir that it becomes the duty of an officer to consider some other matters as well as a situation—namely what number of men are necessary to defend a place—how it can be supported— how furnished with ammunition— in respect to the first i conceive our defence of this place point alderton must be proportioned to the attack of genl gages whole force leaving him just enough to man his lines on boston  charlestown necks— with regard to the second and most important as well as alarming object we have only     barls of powder in all including the late supply from philadelphia wch is not sufficient to give    muskets cartridges to each man and scarcely to serve the artillery in any brisk action one single day—under these circumstances i dare say you will agree with me that it would not be very eligible to take a post  0 miles distant by land from this place when we have already a line of circumvallation round boston of at least  0 miles in extant to  00 defend any part of which may be attacked without our having if the enemy will keep their own council an hours previous notice of it and that it would not be prudent in me to attempt a measure which would necessarily bring on a consumption of all the ammunition we have thereby leaving the army at the mercy of the enemy or to disperse and the country to be ravaged and laid waste at discretion—to you sir i may account for my conduct but i cannot declare the motives of it to every one notwithstanding i know by not doing it that i shall stand in a very unfavorable light in the opinion of those who expect much and will find little done without understanding or perhaps giving themselves the trouble of enquiring into the cause—such however is the fate of all those who are obliged to act the part i do i must therefore submit to it under a consciousness of having done my duty to the best of my abilities on saturday night last we took possession of a hill advanced of our lines  within point blank shot of the enemy on charles town neck—we worked incessantly the whole night with   00 men  before morning got an intrenchment in such forwardness as to bid defiance to their cannon about nine oclock on sunday they began a heavy cannonade which continued through the day without any injury to our work and with the loss of four men only two of which were killed through their own folly—the insult of the cannonade however we were obliged to submit to with impunity not daring to make use of  0  artillery on acct of the consumption of powder except with one nine pounder placed on a point with which we silenced  indeed sunk one of their floating batteries— this move of ours was made to prevent the enemy from gaining this hill and we thought was giving them a fair challenge to dispute it as we had been told by various people who had just left boston that they were preparing to come out but instead of accepting of it we learn that it has thrown them into great consternation which might be improved if we had the means of doing it—yesterday afternoon they began a bombardment without any effect as yet— there has been so many great and capital errors  abuses to rectify—so many examples to make— so little inclination in the officers of inferior rank to contribute their aid to accomplish this work that my life has been nothing else since i came here but one continued round of annoyance  fatigue in short no pecuniary recompense could induce me to undergo what i have especially as i expect by shewing so little countenance to irregularities  publick abuses to render myself very obnoxious to a greater part of these people—but as i have already greatly exceeded the bounds of a letter i will not trouble you with matters relative to my own feelings  as i expect this letter will meet you in philadelphia  0  i must request the favor of you to present my affecte  respectful compliments to doctr shippen his lady and family my brothers of the delegation and any other enquiring friends— at the same time do me the justice to believe that i am with a sincere regard george washington  0 august      cambridge caesar rodney thomas mckean to caesar rodney and thomas mckean  camp at cambridge  0 august      gentlemen i have endeavored to pay the best attention in my power to your recommendation of mr parke  by  0  making him an assistant quartermastergeneral an office indispensably necessary in discharge of that important and troublesome business i wish it was in my power to provide for more of the young gentlemen who at their own expence have travelled and now continue here from pennsylvania and elsewhere but the congress seems to have put it out of their own power to do this leaving by their instructions to me the ultimate appointment of all officers as high as a colonel to the government in which the regiments originated the obvious consequence of which is that every commission will be monopolized by these four new england governments the good policy and justice of which i submit to your better judgment but should give it as my own opinion that as the whole troops are now taken into the pay of the united colonies the congress which i presume will either by themselves or a committee of their own body always be sitting ought to reserve the filling up of all vacancies themselves in order that volunteers from every government may have an equal chance of preferment instead of confining all offices to a few governments to the total exclusion of the rest i have dropt these thoughts by way of hints which you may improve or reject as they shall appear to have or want weight  for the occurrences of the camp  0  the state of the army c i refer to my publick letters addressed to mr hancock and with great respect and gratitude for your good wishes contained in your letter i remain c george washington    august      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    august      sir the enclosed letter came under such a direction and circumstances as led me to suppose it contained some interesting advices either respecting a supply of powder or the clothing lately taking at philadelphia i therefore took the liberty of breaking the seal for which i hope the service and my motives will apologize as the filling up the place of vacant brigadiergeneral will probably be of the first business of the honorable congress i flatter myself it will not be deemed assuming to mention the names of two gentlemen whose former services rank and age may be thought worthy of attention on this occasion of the one i can speak from my own knowledge of the other only from character the former is colonel john armstrong of pennsylvania he served during the last war in most of the campaigns to the southward  0  was honored with the command of the pennsylvania forces and his general military conduct and spirit much approved by all who served with him besides which his character was distinguished by an enterprise against the indians which he planned with great judgment and executed with equal courage and success  it was not till lately that i had reason to believe he would enter again on public service and it is now wholly unsolicited and unknown on his part the other gentleman is colonel frye of massachusetts bay he entered into the service as early as      and rose through the different military ranks in succeeding wars to that of colonel until last june when he was appointed a majorgeneral by the congress of this province  from these circumstances together with the favorable report made to me of him i presume he sustained the character of a good officer though i do not find it distinguished by any peculiar service either of these gentlemen or any other whom the honorable congress shall please to favor with this appointment will be received by me with the utmost deference and respect   0  the late adjournment having made it impracticable to know the pleasure of the congress as to the appointment of brigade majors beyond the number of three which they were pleased to leave to me and the service not admitting of further delay i have continued the other three which i hope their honors will not disapprove these latter were recommended by the respective corps to which they belong as the properest persons for these offices until further direction and have discharged the duty ever since they are the majors box scammell and samuel brewer last saturday night we took possession of a hill considerably advanced beyond our former lines  which brought on a very heavy cannonade from bunkers hill and afterwards a bombardment which has been since kept up with little spirit on their part or damage on ours the work having been continued ever since is now so advanced and the men so well covered as to leave us under no apprehenions of much farther loss in this affair we had killed one adjutant one volunteer  and two privates the scarcity of ammunition does not admit of our availing ourselves of the situation as we otherwise might do but this evil i hope will soon be remedied as i have been informed of the arrival of a large quantity at new york some at new london and more hourly expected at different places i need not add to what i have already said on this subject our  0  late supply was very seasonable but far short of our necessities    the treatment of our officers prisoners in boston induced me to write to general gage on that subject his answer and my reply i have the honor to lay before the congress since which i have heard nothing from him i remain with the greatest respect and regard c  george washington   september      cambridge brigadiergeneral wooster to brigadiergeneral wooster  camp at cambridge   september      sir i have just received your favor of the   th ultimo by express i am very sensible that the situation of the inhabitants of long island as well as of all those on the coast exposes them greatly to the ravages of the enemy and it is to be wished that general protection could be extended to them consistent with the prosecution of those great plans which have been adopted for the common safety this was early foreseen  0  and the danger provided for by a resolution of congress that each province should depend on its own internal strength against these incursions the prejudice arising from them even if successful not being equal to that of separating the army into a number of small detachments which would be harassed in fruitless marches and countermarches after an enemy whose convayance by shipping is so advantageous that they might keep the whole coast in constant alarm without our being able perhaps at any time to give them vigorous opposition upon this principle i have invariably rejected every application made to me here to keep any detachments on the coast for these purposes i should therefore most probably have thought it my duty to order the three companies mentioned in your letter as having joined your army to aid in the general service had they not been under command from general schuyler to join him but as it is i can by no means interfere he is engaged in a service of the greatest importance to the whole continent his  0  strength and appointments being far short of his expectations and to give any counter orders may not only defeat his whole plan but must make me responsible to the public for the failure instead therefore of their further stay i would have them march immediately i fear the delay of the ten days may have very bad effects as by my last advice from ticonderoga general schuyler was to march in a few days for canada and it is highly probable he may depend upon these companies to occupy the posts of communication which otherwise he must weaken his army to do no provincial congress can with any propriety interfere with the disposition of troops on the continental establishment much less control the orders of any general officer so that in this instance the congress at new york have judged properly in declining to counteract general schuylers orders i wish i could extend my approbation equally to the whole line of their conduct before you receive this letter you will most probably be able to judge how far your continuance on long island will be farther necessary if the fleet which last sailed was destined for those coasts it must be arrived if it is not it is certainly gone to the eastward and your present station is no longer necessary the importance of preserving the communication of the north river and many other reasons induce me to wish you were returned to your former post the late transactions at new york furnish additional reasons for your being as near that city as is consistent with the discipline and convenience of your troops your next therefore i flatter myself will inform me of your   0 having resumed your former station i am sir with much regard and esteem c  george washington   september      cambridge to the inhabitants of the island of bermuda  camp at cambridge   miles from boston   september      gentlemen in the great conflict which agitates this continent i cannot doubt but the assertors of freedom and the     right of the constitution are possessed of your most favorable regards and wishes for success as descendants of freemen and heirs with us of the same glorious inheritance we flatter ourselves that though divided by our situation we are firmly united in sentiment the cause of virtue and liberty is confined to no continent or climate it comprehends within its capacious limits the wise and good however dispersed and separated in space or distance     you need not be informed that the violence and rapacity of a tyrannic ministry have forced the citizens of america your brother colonists into arms we equally detest and lament the prevalence of those counsels which have led to the effusion of so much human blood and left us no alternative but a civil war or a base submission the wise disposer of all events has hitherto smiled upon our virtuous efforts those mercenary troops a few of whom lately boasted of subjugating this vast continent have been checked in their earliest ravages and are now actually encircled in a small space their arms disgraced and suffering all the calamities of a siege the virtue spirit and union of the provinces leave them nothing to fear but the want of ammunition the applications of our enemies to foreign states and their vigilance upon our coasts are the only efforts they have made against us with success under these circumstances and with these sentiments we have turned     our eyes to you gentlemen for relief we are informed there is a very large magazine on your island under a very feeble guard we would not wish to involve you in an opposition in which from your situation we should be unable to support you we know not therefore to what extent to solicit your assistance in availing ourselves of this supply but if your favor and friendship to north america and its liberties have not been misrepresented i persuade myself you may consistently with your own safety promote and further this scheme so as to give it the fairest prospect of success be assured that in this case the whole power and exertion of my influence will be made with the honorable continental congress that your island may not only be supplied with provisions but experience every mark of affection and friendship which the grateful citizens of a free country can bestow on its brethren and benefactors i am c      george washington   september      cambridge to the major and brigadier generals camp at cambridge   september      gentlemen as i mean to call upon you in a day or two for your opinions upon a point of very great importance to the welfare of this continent in general and this colony in particular i think it proper indeed an incumbent duty on me previous to this meeting to intimate to you the end and design of it that you may have time to consider the matter with that deliberation and attention which the importance of it requires it is to know whether in your judgment we cannot make a successful attack upon the troops at boston by means of boats coöperated by an attempt upon their lines at roxbury the successs of such an enterprise depends i well know upon the allwise disposer of events and it is not within the reach of human wisdom to foretell the issue but if the prospect is fair the undertaking is justifiable under the following among other reasons which might be assigned the season is now fast approaching when warm and comfortable barracks must be erected for the security of the troops against the inclemency of winter large and costly provision must be made in the article of wood for the supply of the army and after all that can be done in this way it is but too probable that fences woods orchards and even houses themselves will fall a sacrifice to the want of fuel before the end of winter a very considerable difficulty if not expense must accrue on account of clothing for     the men now engaged in the service and if they do not enlist again this difficulty will be increased to an almost insurmountable degree blankets i am informed are now much wanted and not to be got how then shall we be able to keep soldiers to their duty already impatient to get home when they come to feel the severity of winter without proper covering if this army should not incline to engage for a longer time than the  st of january what consequences more certainly can follow than that you must either be obliged to levy new troops and thereby have two sets or partly so in pay at the same time or by disbanding one before you get the other expose the country to desolation and the cause perhaps to irretrievable ruin these things are not unknown to the enemy perhaps it is the very ground they are building on if they are not waiting for a large reinforcement and if they are waiting for succorers ought it not to give a spur to the attempt our powder not much of which will be consumed in such an enterprise without any certainty of a supply is daily wasting and to sum up the whole in spite of every saving that can be made the expense of supporting this army will so far exceed any idea that was formed in congress of it that i do not know what will be the consequences these among many other reasons which might be assigned induce me to wish a speedy finish of the dispute but to avoid these evils we are not to lose sight of the difficulties the hazard and the loss that may accompany the attempt nor what will be the probable consequences of a failure that every circumstance for and against this measure may be duly weighed that there may be time for doing it and nothing of this importance resolved on but after mature deliberation i give this previous notice of the intention of calling you together on monday next at nine oclock at which time you are requested to attend at headquarters it is not necessary i am persuaded to recommend secrecy the success of the enterprise if undertaken must depend in a great measure upon the suddenness of the stroke i am with great esteem etc      george washington   september      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler camp at cambridge   september      dear sir i have received your favor of the   st of august i am much engaged in sending off the detachment under colonel arnold upon the plan contained in mine of the  0th ultimo a variety of obstacles has retarded us since the the express returned with yours of the   th august from albany but we are now in such forwardness that i expect they will set out by sunday next at farthest i shall take care in my instructions to colonel arnold that in case there should be a junction of the detachment with your army you shall have no difficulty in adjusting the scale of command you seem so sensible of the absolute necessity of preserving the friendship of the canadians that i need say nothing on that subject but that a strict discipline and punctual payment for all necessaries brought to your camp will be the most certain means     of attaining so valuable and important an end i shall inculcate the same principle most strongly on our troops who go from hence as that on which their safety success and honor entirely depend i am truly concerned that your supplies and appointments are so far short of your expectations but trust you will have a feeble enemy to contend with and a whole province on your side two circumstances of great weight in the scale your situation for some time must be so critical and interesting that i hope you will not fail giving me constant information of your motions and success  believe me with much truth and regard dear sir your obedient and humble servant george washington   september      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull camp at cambridge   september      sir upon the receipt of this you will please to give directions that all the new levies march immediately to this camp by a resolution of congress the troops on the continental establishment were not to be employed for the defence of the coasts or of any particular province the militia being deemed competent     to that service  when i directed these troops to remain in their own province i had some reason to expect a remove from boston to new york in which case they would have been able to give them a more speedy opposition but as that suspicion now appears groundless there will be an impropriety in continuing them where they now are considering the above resolve the detachment which i mentioned in my last will march in two days and i shall have occasion for the troops from you to fill their places the ministerial expedition must i apprehend by this time have come to some issue they are either returned with disappointment or have succeeded in their errand in either case the men can be spared without danger to the country but should this not be the case and they are still hovering on the coast it is to make no difference in their march so that i shall at all events expect them here next week for which you will please to give the necessary orders i am c george washington  0 september      cambridge john augustine washington to john augustine washington camp at cambridge  0 september      dear brother so little has happened since the date of my last that i should scarce have given you the trouble of reading this letter did i not imagine that it might be some satisfaction to you to know that we are well and in no fear or dread of the enemy being in     our own opinion at least very securely intrenched and wishing for nothing more than to see the enemy out of their strongholds that the dispute may come to an issue the inactive state we lie in is exceedingly disagreeable especially as we can see no end to it having had no advices lately from great britain to form a judgment upon in taking possession about a fortnight ago of a hill within pointblank cannonshot of the enemys lines on charles town neck we expected to bring on a general action especially as we had been threatened by reports from boston several days before that they that is the enemy intended an attack upon our intrenchments nothing however followed but a severe cannonade for a day or two and a bombardment afterwards for the like time which however did us no other damage than to kill two or three men and to wound as many more both are now at an end as they found that we disregarded their fire and continued our works till we had got them completed unless the ministerial troops in boston are waiting for reinforcements i cannot devise what they are staying there for nor why as they affect to despise the americans they do not come forth and put an end to the contest at once they suffer greatly for want of fresh provisions notwithstanding they have pillaged several islands of a good many sheep and cattle they are also scarce of fuel unless according to the account of one of their deserters they mean to pull down houses for firing in short they are from all accounts suffering all the inconveniences   0 of a siege it is true by having the entire command of the sea and a powerful navy and moreover as they are now beginning to take all vessels indiscriminately we cannot stop their supplies through that channel but their succors in this way hath not been so powerful as to enable them to give the common soldiers much fresh meat as yet by an account from boston of the  th instant the cattle lately brought in there sold at public auction from fifteen to thirtyfour pounds ten shillings sterling apiece and the sheep from thirty to thirtysix shillings each and that fowls and every other species of fresh provisions went in proportion the expense of this one would think must soon tire them were it not that they intend to fix all the expense of this war upon the colonies—if they can i suppose we shall add i am just sending off a detachment of one thousand men to quebec by the way of kennebec river to coöperate with general schuyler who by this is i expect at or near st johns on the north end of lake champlain and may for aught i know have determined the fate of his army and that of canada as he left crown point the   st of last month for the isleauxnoix within twelve miles of st johns where governor carletons principal force lay if he should succeed there he will soon after be in montreal without opposition and if the detachment i am sending from hence though late in the season should be able to get posession of quebec the ministrys plan in respect to that government will turn out finely      i have only to add my love to my sister and the little ones and that i am with the greatest truth your most affectionate brother george washington   th day of september      cambridge benedict arnold to colonel benedict arnold instructions   you are immediately on their march from cambridge to take the command of the detachment from the continental army against quebec and use all possible expedition as the winter season is now advancing and the success of this enterprise under god depends wholly upon the spirit with which it is pushed and the favorable dispositions of the canadians and indians   when you come to newburyport you are to make all possible inquiry what menofwar or cruisers there may be on the coast to which this detachment may be exposed on their voyage to kennebec river and if you should find that there is danger of your being intercepted you are not to proceed by water but by land taking care on the one hand not to be diverted by light and vague reports and on the other not to expose the troops rashly to a danger which by many judicious persons has been deemed very considerable   you are by every means in your power to endeavor to discover the real sentiments of the canadians towards our cause and particularly as to this expedition bearing in mind that if they are averse to it and will not coöperate or at least willingly acquiesce it must fail of success in this case you are by no means to prosecute the attempt the expense of the expedition and the disappointment are not to be put in competition with the dangerous consequences which may ensue from irritating them against us and detaching them from that neutrality which they have adopted   in order to cherish those favorable sentiments to the american cause that they have manifested you are as soon as you arrive in their country to disperse a number of the addresses you will have with you particularly in those parts where your     route shall lie and observe the strictest discipline and good order by no means suffering any inhabitant to be abused or in any manner injured either in his person or property punishing with exemplary severity every person who shall transgress and making ample compensation to the party injured   you are to endeavor on the other hand to conciliate the affections of those people and such indians as you may meet with by every means in your power convincing them that we come at the request of many of their principal people not as robbers or to make war upon them but as the friends and supporters of their liberties as well as ours and to give efficacy to these sentiments you must carefully inculcate upon the officers and soldiers under your command that not only the good of their country and their honor but their safety depend upon the treatment of these people   check every idea and crush in its earliest stage every attempt to plunder even those who are known to be enemies to our cause it will create dreadful apprehensions in our friends and when it is once begun no one can tell where it will stop i therefore again most expressly order that it be discouraged and punished in every instance without distinction   any kings stores which you shall be so fortunate as to possess yourself of are to be secured for the continental use agreeably to the rules and regulations of war published by the honorable congress the officers and men may be assured that any extraordinary services performed by them will be suitably rewarded   spare neither pains nor expense to gain all possible intelligence on your march to prevent surprises and accidents of every kind and endeavor if possible to correspond with general schuyler so that you may act in concert with him this i think may be done by means of the st francis indians   in case of a union with general schuyler or if he should be in canada upon your arrival there you are by no means to consider yourself as upon a separate and independent command but are to put yourself under him and follow his directions upon this occasion and all others i recommend most earnestly     to avoid all contention about rank in such a cause every post is honorable in which a man can serve his country  0 if lord chathams son should be in canada and in any way should fall into your power you are enjoined to treat him with all possible deference and respect you cannot err in paying too much honor to the son of so illustrious a character and so true a friend to america any other prisoners who may fall into your hands you will treat with as much humanity and kindness as may be consistent with your own safety and the public interest be very particular in restraining not only your own troops but the indians from all acts of cruelty and insult which will disgrace the american arms and irritate our fellow subjects against us    you will be particularly careful to pay the full value for all provisions or other accommodations which the canadians may provide for you on your march by no means press them or any of their cattle into your service but amply compensate those who voluntarily assist you for this purpose you are provided with a sum of money in specie which you will use with as much frugality and economy as your necessities and good policy will admit keeping as exact an account as possible of your disbursements    you are by every opportunity to inform me of your progress your prospects and intelligence and upon any important occurrence to send an express    as the season is now far advanced you are to make all possible despatch but if unforeseen difficulties should arise or if the weather should become so severe as to render it hazardous to proceed in your own judgment and that of your principal officers whom you are to consult—in that case you are to return giving me as early notice as possible that i may render you such assistance as may be necessary    as the contempt of the religion of a country by ridiculing any of its ceremonies or affronting its ministers or votaries has ever been deeply resented you are to be particularly careful to restrain every officer and soldier from such imprudence and folly and to punish every instance of it on the other hand as far as lies in your power you are to protect and support the free     exercise of the religion of the country and the undisturbed enjoyment of the rights of conscience in religious matters with your utmost influence and authority given under my hand at headquarters cambridge this   th day of september      george washington    september      cambridge benedict arnold to colonel benedict arnold camp at cambridge    september      sir you are entrusted with a command of the utmost consequence to the interest and liberties of america upon your conduct and courage and that of the officers and soldiers detached on this expedition not only the success of the present enterprise and your own honor but the safety and welfare of the whole continent may depend i charge you therefore and the officers and soldiers under your command as you value your own safety and honor and the favor and esteem of your country that you consider yourselves as marching not through the country of an enemy but of our friends and brethren for such the inhabitants of canada and the indian nations have approved themselves in this unhappy contest between great britain and america and that you check by every motive of duty and fear of punishment every attempt to plunder or insult the inhabitants of canada should any american soldier be so base and infamous as to injure any canadian or indian in his person or property i do most earnestly enjoin you to bring him to such severe and exemplary punishment as the enormity of the crime may require should it extend     to death itself it will not be disproportioned to its guilt at such a time and in such a cause but i hope and trust that the brave men who have voluntarily engaged in this expedition will be governed by far different views and that order discipline and regularity of behavior will be as conspicuous as their valor i also give it in charge to you to avoid all disrespect of the religion of the country and its ceremonies prudence policy and a true christian spirit will lead us to look with compassion upon their errors without insulting them while we are contending for our own liberty we should be very cautious not to violate the rights of conscience in others ever considering that god alone is the judge of the hearts of men and to him only in this case they are answerable upon the whole sir i beg you to inculcate upon the officers and soldiers the necessity of preserving the strictest order during the march through canada to represent to them the shame disgrace and ruin to themselves and their country if they should by their conduct turn the hearts of our brethren in canada against us and on the other hand the honors and rewards which await them if by their prudence and good behavior they conciliate the affections of the canadians and indians to the great interests of america and convert those favorable dispositions they have shown into a lasting union and affection thus wishing you and the officers and soldiers under your command all honor safety and success i remain sir your most obedient humble servant     george washington to the inhabitants of canada  friends and brethren the unnatural contest between the english colonies and great britain has now risen to such a height that arms alone must decide it the colonies confiding in the justice of their cause and the purity of their intention have reluctantly appealed to that being in whose hands are all human events he has hitherto smiled upon their virtuous efforts the hand of tyranny has been arrested in its ravages and the british arms which have shone with so much splendor in every part of the globe are now tarnished with disgrace and disappointment generals of approved experience who boasted of subduing this great continent find themselves circumscribed within the limits of a single city and its suburbs suffering all the shame and distress of a siege while the freeborn sons of america animated by the genuine principles of liberty and love of their country with increasing union firmness and discipline repel every attack and despise every danger above all we rejoice that our enemies have been deceived with regard to you they have persuaded themselves they have even dared to say that the canadians were not capable of distinguishing between the blessings of liberty and the wretchedness of slavery that gratifying the vanity of a little circle of nobility would blind the people of canada by such artifices they hoped to bend you to their views but they have been deceived instead of finding in you a poverty of soul and baseness of spirit they see with a chagrin equal to our joy that you are enlightened generous and virtuous that you will not renounce your own rights or serve as instruments to deprive your fellow subjects of     theirs come then my brethren unite with us in an indissoluble union let us run together to the same goal we have taken up arms in defence of our liberty our property our wives and our children we are determined to preserve them or die we look forward with pleasure to that day not far remote we hope when the inhabitants of america shall have one sentiment and the full enjoyment of the blessings of a free government incited by these motives and encouraged by the advice of many friends of liberty among you the grand american congress have sent an army into your province under the command of general schuyler not to plunder but to protect you to animate and bring into action those sentiments of freedom you have disclosed and which the tools of despotism would extinguish through the whole creation to coöperate with this design and to frustrate those cruel and perfidious schemes which would deluge our frontiers with the blood of women and children i have detached colonel arnold into your country with a part of the army under my command i have enjoined it upon him and i am certain that he will consider himself and act as in the country of his patrons and best friends necessaries and accommodations of every kind which you may furnish he will thankfully receive and render the full value i invite you therefore as friends and bretheren to provide him with such supplies as your country affords and i pledge myself not only for your safety and security but for an ample compensation let no man desert his habitation let no one flee as before an enemy the cause of america and of liberty is the cause of every virtuous american citizen whatever may be his religion or descent the united colonies know no distinction but such as slavery corruption and arbitrary dominion may create come then ye generous citizens range yourselves under the standard of general liberty against which all the force and artifices of tyranny will never be able to prevail     george washington    september      cambridge thomas everhard to thomas everhard virginia camp at cambridge    september      dear sir as i believe it will be three years next december since some of my ohio lands under the proclamation of      were patented and as they are not yet improved agreeably to the express letter of the law it behoves me to have recourse in time to the common expedient of saving them by means of a friendly petition my distance from williamsburg and my ignorance of the mode of doing this lays me under the necessity of calling upon some friend for assistance will you then my good sir aid me in this work i shall acknowledge it as a singular favor if you will and unless you discourage me i shall rely on it i have already been at as much expense in attempting to seat and improve these lands as would nearly if not quite have saved them agreeable to our act of assembly had it been laid out thereon in march      i sent out more than twenty odd servants and hirelings with a great number of tools nails and necessaries for this purpose but hostilities commencing with the indians they got no further than the redstone settlement where the people dispersed my goods got seized and lost and the whole expedition which i suppose stood me in at least three hundred pounds came to nothing  in march last     i again purchased a parcel of servants hired men at considerable wages and sent out a second time but   0 what they have done i neither know nor have heard further than that after buying tools and provisions     at most exorbitant prices and not being able for money to procure a sufficiency of the latter my     servants for the most part had run away and the manager with a few negroes and hirelings left in an almost starving condition  this sir is my situation and to avoid a total loss of the land as i conceive there are some peculiar circumstances attending the matter on account of other claims and to prevent involving myself in any disagreeable controversy in defence of my property having already had a great deal of trouble about it i am desirous of adopting in time the method of petitioning the enemy and we are very near neighbors our advanced works are not more than five or six hundred yards from theirs and the main bodies of the two armies scarce a mile we see every thing that passes and that is all we can do as they keep close on the two peninsulas of boston and charlestown both of which are surrounded by ships of war floating batteries c and the narrow necks of land leading into them fortified in such a manner as not to be forced without a very considerable slaughter if practicable at all i am c     george washington    september      deputy governor cooke to deputy governor cooke    september      sir your favors of the  th   th and    instant have been duly received the readiness of the committee to cooperate with me in procuring the most authentick intelligence and dispatching captain whipple for this purpose is peculiarly satisfactory and i flatter myself will be attended not only with success but the happiest consequences to the publick cause i should immediately have sent you notice of the paragraph in the philadelphia papers which is all the account i have of the taking the powder at bermudas but i supposed it must have come to your hands before it reached ours i am inclined to think it sufficient to suspend captain whipples voyage at least till farther intelligence is procured from philadelphia as it is scarce supposable these vessels would leave any quantity behind worth the risque and expence of such a voyage as this enterprize will therefore most probably be laid aside for the present it may be proper for captain whipple to keep his station a few days longer for the packet it must be remembered they generally have long passages and we are very sure she has not yet arrived at boston nor do i find she is expected there the voyage to bayonne is what i should approve and recommend the person sent to governor trumbull has not yet called upon me but the scheme appears so feasible that i should be glad to see it executed at the same time i must add that i am in some doubt as to the     extent of my powers to appropriate the publick moneys here to this purpose i could wish you would communicate it to the congress for which you will have sufficient time and i make no doubt of their concurrence in fact the state of our treasury here at present is so low that it would be impracticable to be of any service to the expedition if all other objections were obviated we have no news either in the camp or from boston except a piece of intelligence from the latter that the enemy are pulling down the south end of the town in order to continue a work across from river to river your chearful concurrence with me in publick measures and zeal for the service calls for my best thanks—you will please to accept them and believe me to be with much truth and esteem etc p s—no southern mail arriving last saturday we are apprehensive it has again fallen into the enemys hands if it was not attended with too much trouble should be glad you would cause inquiry to be made if by any accident the letters are at providence you will please to forward them by express—      george washington    september      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull cambridge    september       sir it gives me real concern to observe by yours of the   th instant that you should think it necessary to distinguish between my personal and public character and confine your esteem to the former upon a reperusal of mine of the  th instant i cannot think the construction you have made one and unless it     was i should have hoped that the respect i really have and which i flattered myself i had manifested to you would have called for the most favorable in the disposition of the continental troops i have long been sensible that it would be impossible to please not individuals merely but particular provinces whose partial necessities would occasionally call for assistance i therefore thought myself happy that the congress had settled the point and apprehended i should stand excused to all for acting in the line which not only appeared to me to be that of policy and propriety but of express and positive duty if to the other fatigues and cares of my station that is to be added of giving reasons for all orders and explaining the grounds and principles on which they are formed my personal trouble will perhaps be of the least concern the public would be most affected you may be assured sir nothing was intended that might be construed into disrespect and at so interesting a period nothing less ought to disturb the harmony so necessary for the happy success of our public operations the omission of acknowledging in precise terms the receipt of your favor of the  th instant was purely accidental the subject was not so new to me as to require long consideration i had had occasion fully to deliberate upon it in consequence of applications for troops from cape ann machias new hampshire and long island where the same necessity was as strongly pleaded and in the two last instances the most peremptory orders were necessary to prevent the     troops from being detained i foresaw the same difficulty here i am by no means insensible to the situation of the people on the coast i wish i could extend protection to all but the numerous detachments necessary to remedy the evil would amount to a dissolution of the army or make the most important operations of the campaign depend upon the piratical expeditions of two or three menofwar and transports the spirit and zeal of the colony of connecticut are unquestionable and whatever may be the hostile intentions of the menofwar i hope their utmost efforts can do little more than alarm the coast i am with great esteem and regard for both your personal and public character sir c  george washington    september      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge    september       sir i have been in daily expectation of being favored with the commands of the honorable congress on the subject of my two last letters the season now advances so fast that i cannot any longer defer laying     before them such further measures as require their immediate attention and in which i wait their direction the mode in which the present army has been collected has occasioned some difficulty in procuring the subscription of both officers and soldiers to the continental articles of war their principal objection has been that it might subject them to a longer service than that for which they engaged under their several provincial establishments it is in vain to attempt to reason away the prejudices of a whole army often instilled and in this instance at least encouraged by their officers from private and narrow views i have therefore forbore pressing them as i did not experience any such inconvenience from their adherence to their former rules as would warrant the risk of entering into a contest upon it more especially as the restraints necessary for the establishment of essential discipline and subordination indisposed their minds to every change and made it both duty and policy to introduce as little novelty as possible with the present army i fear such a subscription is impracticable but the difficulty will cease with this army  the connecticut and rhode island troops stand engaged to the  st of december only and none longer than the  st of january a dissolution of the present army therefore will take place unless some early provision is made against such an event most     of the general officers are of opinion that the greater part of them may be reënlisted for the winter or another campaign with the indulgence of a furlough to visit their friends which may be regulated so as not to endanger the service how far it may be proper to form the new army entirely out of the old for another campaign rather than from the contingents of the several provinces is a question which involves in it too many considerations of policy and prudence for me to undertake to decide it appears to be impossible to draw it from any other source than the old army for this winter and as the pay is ample i hope a sufficient number will engage in the service for that time at least but there are various opinions of the temper of the men on the subject and there may be great hazard in deferring the trial too long in the continental establishment no provision has been made for the pay of artificers distinct from that of the common soldiers whereas under the provincial such as found their own tools were allowed one shilling per diem advance and particular artisans more the pay of the artillery also now differs from that of the province the men have less the officers more and for some ranks no provision is made as the congress will please to observe by this list which i have the honor to enclose these particulars though seemingly inconsiderable are the source of much complaint and dissatisfaction which i endeavor to compose in the best manner i am able by the returns of the rifle companies and that   0 battalion they appear to exceed their establishment very considerably i doubt my authority to pay these extra men without the direction of the congress but it would be deemed a great hardship wholly to refuse them as they have been encouraged to come  the necessities of the troops having required pay i directed that those of the massachusetts should receive for one month upon their being mustered and returning a proper roll but a claim was immediately made for pay by lunar months and several regiments have declined taking up their warrants on this account as this practice was entirely new to me though said to be warranted by former usage     here the matter now waits the determination of the honorable congress  i find in connecticut and rhode island this point was settled by calendar months in massachusetts though mentioned in the congress it was left undetermined which is also the case of new hampshire  the enclosure no   is a petition from the subalterns respecting their pay where there are only two of these in a company i have considered one as an ensign and ordered him pay as such as in the connecticut forces i must beg leave to recommend this petition to the favor of the congress as i am of opinion the allowance is inadequate to their rank and service and is one great source of that familiarity between the officers and men which is so incompatible with subordination and discipline  many valuable     officers of those ranks finding themselves unable to support the character and appearance of officers i am informed will retire as soon as the term of service is expired if there is no alteration  for the better regulation of duty i found it necessary to settle the rank of the officers and to number the regiments and as i had not received the commands of the congress on the subject and the exigence of the service forbade any further delay the general officers were considered as having no regiments an alteration which i understand is not pleasing to some of them but appeared to me and others to be proper when it was considered that by this means the whole army is put upon one footing and all particular attachments are dissolved  among many other considerations which the approach of winter will demand that of clothing appears to be one of the most important so far as regards the preservation of the army from cold they may be deemed in a state of nakedness many of the men have been without blankets the whole campaign and     those which have been in use during the summer are so much worn as to be of little service in order to make a suitable provision in these articles and at the same time to guard the public against imposition and expense it seems necessary to determine the mode of continuing the army for should these troops be cloathed under their present engagement and at the expiration of the term of service decline renewing it a set of unprovided men may be sent to supply their places i cannot suppose it to be unknown to the honorable congress that in all armies it is an established practise to make an allowance to officers of provisions and forage proportionate to their rank as such an allowance formed no part of the continental establishment i have hitherto forbore to issue the orders for that purpose but as it is a received opinion of such members of the congress as i have had an opportunity of consulting as well as throughout the army that it must be deemed a matter of course and implied in the establishment of the army i have directed the following proportion of rations being the same allowance in the american armies last war— major general    major   brigadier general    captain   colonel   subaltern   lieut colonel   staff   if these should not be approved by the honorable congress they will please to signify their pleasure as     to the alterations they would have made in the whole or in part i am now to inform the honorable congress that encouraged by the repeated declarations of the canadians and indians and urged by their requests i have detached colonel arnold with a thousand men to penetrate into canada by way of kennebec river and if possible to make himself master of quebec by this manœuvre i proposed either to divert carleton from st johns which would leave a free passage to general schuyler or if this did not take effect quebec in its present defenceless state must fall into his hands an easy prey i made all possible inquiry as to the distance the safety of the route and the danger of the season being too far advanced but found nothing in either to deter me from proceeding more especially as it met with very general approbation from all whom i consulted upon it but that nothing might be omitted to enable me to judge of its propriety and probable consequences i communicated it by express to general schuyler who approved of it in such terms that i resolved to put it in immediate execution they have now left this place seven days and if favored with a good wind i hope soon to hear of their being safe in kennebec river for the satisfaction of the congress i here enclose a copy of the proposed route i also do myself the honor of enclosing a manifesto which i caused to be printed here and of which colonel arnold has taken a suitable number with him i have also forwarded a copy of his instructions from all which i hope the congress     will have a clear view of the motives plan and intended execution of this enterprise and that i shall be so happy as to meet with their approbation in it i was the more induced to make this detachment as it is my clear opinion from a careful observation of the movements of the enemy corroborated by all the intelligence we receive by deserters and others of the former of whom we have some every day that the enemy have no intention to come out until they are reinforced they have been wholly employed for some time past in procuring materials for barracks fuel and making other preparations for winter these circumstances with the constant additions to their works which are apparently defensive have led to the above conclusion and enabled me to spare this body of men where i hope they will be usefully and successfully employed the state of inactivity in which this army has lain for some time by no means corresponds with my wishes by some decisive stroke to relieve my country from the heavy expense its subsistence must create after frequently reconnoitring the situation of the enemy in the town of boston collecting all possible intelligence and digesting the whole a surprise did not appear to me wholly impracticable though hazardous i communicated it to the general officers some days before i called them to a council that they might be prepared with their opinions the result i have the honor of sending in the inclosure no   i cannot say that i have wholly laid     it aside but new events may occasion new measures of this i hope the honorable congress can need no assurance that there is not a man in america who more earnestly wishes such a termination of the campaign as to make the army no longer necessary the season advances so fast that i have given orders to prepare barracks and other accommodations for the winter the great scarcity of tow cloth in this country i fear will totally disappoint us in our expectations of procuring hunting shirts gov cooke informs me few or none are to be had in rhode island and gov trumbull gives me little encouragement to expect many from connecticut i have filled up the office of quartermastergeneral which the congress was pleased to leave to me by the appointment of major mifflin which i hope and believe will be universally acceptable it gives me great pain to be obliged to solicit the attention of the honorable congress to the state of this army in terms which imply the slightest apprehension of being neglected but my situation is inexpressibly distressing to see the winter fast approaching upon a naked army the time of their service within a few weeks of expiring and no provision yet made for such important events added to these the military chest is totally exhausted the paymaster has not a single dollar in hand the commissarygeneral assures me he has strained his credit for the subsistence of the army to the utmost the quartermastergeneral is precisely in the same situation and the greater part of the troops are in a     state not far from mutiny upon the deduction from their stated allowance  i know not to whom i am to impute this failure but i am of opinion if the evil is not immediately remedied and more punctually observed in future the army must absolutely break up i hoped i had expressed myself so fully on this subject both by letter and to those members of the congress who honored the camp with a visit that no disappointment could possibly happen i therefore hourly expected advice from the paymaster that he had received a fresh supply in addition to the hundred and seventytwo thousand dollars delivered him in august and thought myself warranted to assure the public creditors that in a few days they should be satisfied but the delay has brought matters to such a crisis as admits of no farther uncertain expectations i have therefore sent off this express with orders to make all possible despatch it is my most earnest request that he may be returned with all possible expedition unless the honorable congress have already forwarded what is so indispensably necessary i have the honor to be c      george washington    september      cambridge christopher french to major christopher french  camp at cambridge    september      sir your favor of the   th instant is now before me as well as that from the committee of hartford on the same subject when i compare the treatment you have received with that which has been shown to those brave american officers who were taken fighting gallantly in defence of the liberties of their country i cannot help expressing some surprise that you should thus earnestly contest points of mere     punctilio the appellation of rebel has been deemed sufficient to sanctify every species of cruelty to them while the ministerial officers the voluntary instruments of an avaricious and vindictive ministry claim upon all occasions the benefit of those military rules which can only be binding where they are mutual we have shown on our part the strongest disposition to observe them during the present contest but i should ill support my countrys honor and my own character if i did not show a proper sense of their sufferings by making the condition of the ministerial officers in some degree dependent upon theirs my disposition does not allow me to follow the unworthy example set me by general gage to its fullest extent you possess all the essential comforts of life why should you press for indulgences of a ceremonious kind which give general offence i have looked over all the papers sent me from philadelphia i find nothing in them upon the present subject nor do i know whether the liberty of wearing your sword was given or taken but i flatter myself that when you come to consider all circumstances you will save me the trouble of giving any positive directions you will easily conceive how much more grateful a compliance with the wishes of the people among whom your residence may be longer than you expect will appear when it is the result of your prudence and good sense rather than a determination from me i therefore should be unwilling to deprive you of an opportunity of cultivating their esteem by so small a concession as this must be   0 as i suppose your several letters to me have been communicated to others i cannot forbear considering your conduct in declaring in a high tone that had you joined your regiment you would have acted vigorously against this country and done all in your power to reduce it  as a deviation from the line of propriety and prudence which i should have expected to distinguish the conduct of so old and experienced an officer your being so entirely in our power may extinguish the resentment which a generous and enlightend mind would otherwise feel but i cannot commend the conduct which puts such a mind to the trial  i am sir your most obedient humble servant     george washington    september      joseph spencer to brigadiergeneral joseph spencer headquarters    september      sir i have perused and considered a petition or rather a remonstrance directed to you and signed by several captains and subalterns on the appointment of mr huntington to the lieutenancy of captain chesters company the decent representation of officers or even of common soldiers through the channel of their colonel or other superior officers i shall always encourage and attend to but i must declare my disapprobation     of this mode of associating and combining as subversive of all subordination discipline and order should the proper officers refuse or neglect to receive their complaints an immediate application to their general officer would be proper much as i disapprove the mode of opposition to this gentleman i disapprove the opposition itself still more to yield to it would be in effect to surrender the command of the army to those whose duty it is and whose honor it ought to be to obey commission should be ever the reward of merit not of age and i am determined never to put it out of the proper power to reward a deserving active officer whatsoever may be his standing in the army or the pretensions of those who have no other merit than that of having been born or enlisted before him in an army so young as ours the claims arising from real service are very few and the accidental circumstance of obtaining a commission a month or two sooner can with no reasonable person claim any superior regard or make such a scrutiny of any consequence this army is supported by the whole continent the establishment is entirely new all provincial customs therefore which are different in different provinces must be laid out of the question the power which has established and which pays this army has alone the right to judge who shall command in it from the general to the ensign to put it into any other hands would be a high breach of my trust and would give birth to such factions and     cabals as must soon end in the dissolution of the army and the ruin of our country as no objections are made to mr huntingtons character nor any other reason assigned than his not rising by gradation i can make no alteration in his appointment at the same time i declare that i shall upon all occasions pay a proper respect to long service and as far as lies in my power give it all the preference which is consistent with the welfare of the army and the duties of my station i make no doubt therefore when these and all other officers who in such cases are both parties and judges divest themselves of prejudice and partiality they will cheerfully acquiesce in such appointments as are made and manifest their sincere attachment to their country and the great cause in which we are engaged by a ready and hearty obedience to all orders and rules judged necessary for the general interest i am sir c george washington  0 september      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge  0 september      sir the rev mr kirkland  the bearer of this having been introduced to the honorable congress can need     no particular recommendation from me but as he now wishes to have the affairs of his mission and public employ put upon some suitable footing i cannot but intimate my sense of the importance of his station and the great advantages which have resulted and may result to the united colonies from his situation being made respectable all accounts agree that much of the favorable disposition shown by the indians may be ascribed to his labor and influence he has accompanied a chief of the oneidas to this camp which i have endeavored to make agreeable to him both by civility and some small presents  mr kirkland being also in some necessity for money to bear his travelling charges and other expenses i have supplied him with thirtytwo pounds lawful money i cannot but congratulate the honorable congress on the happy temper of the canadians and indians our accounts of which are now fully confirmed by some intercepted letters from officers in canada to general gage and others in boston which were     found on board the vessel lately taken going into boston with a donation of cattle and other fresh provisions for the ministerial army  i have the honor to be c  george washington   october      cambridge daniel morgan to captain daniel morgan camp at cambridge   october      sir i write to you in consequence of information i have received that you and the captains of the rifle companies on the detachment against quebec claim an exemption from the command of all the fieldofficers except colonel arnold i understand this claim is founded upon some expressions of mine but if you     understood me in this way you are much mistaken in my meaning my intention is and ever was that every officer should command according to his rank to do otherwise would subvert all military order and authority which i am sure you could not wish or expect now the mistake is rectified i trust you will exert yourself to support my intentions ever remembering that by the same rule by which you claim an independent command and break in upon military authority others will do the same in regard to you and of consequence the expedition must terminate in shame and disgrace to yourselves and the reproach and detriment of your country to a man of true spirit and military character farther argument is unnecessary i shall therefore recommend to you to preserve the utmost harmony among yourselves to which a due subordination will much contribute and wishing you health and success i remain your very humble servant  george washington   october      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler camp at cambridge   october      dear sir your favor of the  0th ultimo came safely to hand and i should have despatched the express much sooner but colonel arnolds expedition is so connected with your operations that i thought it most proper to detain him until i could give you the fullest     account of his progress this morning the express i sent him returned and the enclosure no   is a copy of his letter to me no   is a copy also of a paper sent me being the report of a reconnoitring party sent out some time ago  you will certainly hear from him soon as i have given him the strongest injunctions on this head inclosed no   i send you a copy of his instructions and no   is a manifesto of which i have sent a number with him to disperse throughout canada he is supplied with one thousand pounds lawful money in specie to answer his contingent charges about eight days ago a brig from quebec to boston was taken and brought into cape ann by some intercepted letters from captain gamble to general gage and major sheriff the account of the temper of the canadians in the american cause is fully confirmed the captain says that if quebec should be attacked before carleton can throw himself into it there will be a surrender without firing a shot we most anxiously hope you will find sufficient employ for carleton at st johns and its neighborhood we at last have the echo of bunkers hill from england the number of killed and wounded by general gages account nearly corresponds with what     we had vizt   00 there does not seem the least probability of a change of measures or of ministers  general gage is recalled from boston and sails tomorrow he is succeeded by general howe  we have had no material occurrence since i had the     pleasure of writing to you last our principal employ at present is preparing for the winter as there seems to be no probability of an accommodation or any such decision as to make the present army less necessary    0 i also send a copy of a letter given to colonel arnold to be communicated to the officers and men the accounts we have of your health gives us great concern not only on your own account but that of the public service which must suffer in consequence i shall most sincerely rejoice to hear of your perfect recovery and now most fervently wishing you all possible success honor and safety i am dear sir c     george washington   october      cambridge to the general officers headquarters cambridge   october      sir in a letter from the congress dated september   th information on the following points is required what number of men are sufficient for a winter campaign can the pay of the privates be reduced how much what regulations are further necessary for the government of the forces to the above queries of the congress i have to add several of my own which i also request your opinion upon viz— for how long a time ought the men in the present army should we set about enlisting them be engaged what method would you recommend as most eligible to cloathe a new raised army with a degree of decency and regularity would you advise it to be done by the continent in that case would you lower the mens wages and make no deduction for cloathing or let it stand and make stoppages and how much a month as there appears to be great irregularity in the manner of paying the men and much discontent has prevailed on this account in what manner and at what fixed periods would you advise it to be done under a new establishment what sized regiments would you recommend under this establishment that is how many men to a company how many companies to a regiment and how officered is there any method by which the best of the present officers in this army can be chosen without impeding the inlistment of the men by such choice and preference under any complete establishment even if the privates in the army were engaged again many of the present officers must be discharged as there is an overproportion of course we ought to retain the best your close attention to the foregoing points against monday ten oclock at which time i shall expect to see you at this place will much oblige sir c      george washington   october      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge   october      sir i was honored with your favor of the   th ultimo late the night before last and a meeting of the general officers having been called upon a business which will make a considerable part of this letter i took the opportunity of laying before them those parts of yours which respect the continuance and newmodelling the army the fuel clothing and other     preparations for the ensuing winter they have taken two or three days to consider and as soon as i am possessed of their opinions i shall lose no time in transmitting the result not only on the above subjects but the number of troops necessary to be kept up i have also directed the commissarygeneral and the quartermastergeneral to prepare estimates of the expense of their departments for a certain given number of men from which a judgment may be made when the number of men to be kept in pay is determined all which i shall do myself the honor to lay before the congress as soon as they are ready i have now a painful though a necessary duty to perform respecting dr church directorgeneral of the hospital about a week ago mr secretary ward of providence sent up to me one wainwood an inhabitant of newport with a letter directed to major cane in boston in characters which he said had been left with wainwood some time ago by a woman who was kept by dr church she had before pressed wainwood to take her to captain wallace  mr dudley the collector or george rome which he declined she then gave him a letter with a strict charge to deliver it to either of those gentlemen he suspecting some improper correspondence kept the letter and after some time opened it but not being able to read it laid it up where in remained until he received an obscure letter from the woman expressing an anxiety after the original letter he     then communicated the whole matter to mr ward who sent him up with the papers to me i immediately secured the woman but for a long time she was proof against every threat and persuasion to discover the author however at length she was brought to a confession and named dr church i then immediately secured him and all his papers upon his first examination he readily acknowledged the letter said it was designed for his brother fleming and when deciphered would be found to contain nothing criminal he acknowledged his never having communicated the correspondence to any person here but the girl and made many protestations of the purity of his intentions  having found a person capable of deciphering the letter i in the mean time had all his papers searched but found nothing criminal among them but it appeared on inquiry that a confidant had been among the papers before my messenger arrived i then called the general officers together for their advice the result of which you will find in the enclosure no   the deciphered letter is the enclosure no   the army and country are exceedingly irritated and upon a free discussion of the nature circumstances and consequence of this matter it has been unanimously agreed to lay it before the honorable congress for     their special advice and direction at the same time suggesting to their consideration whether an alteration of the twentyeighth article of war may not be necessary  as i shall reserve all farther remarks upon the state of the army till my next i shall now beg leave to request the determination of congress as to the property and disposal of such vessels and cargoes as are designed for the supply of the enemy and may fall into our hands there has been an event of this kind at portsmouth as by the enclosure no    in which i have directed the cargo to be brought hither for the use of the army reserving the settlement of any claims of capture to the decision of congress as there are many unfortunate individuals whose property has been confiscated by the enemy i would humbly suggest to the consideration of congress the humanity of applying in part or in the whole such captures to the relief of those sufferers after compensating any expense of the captors and for their activity and spirit i am the more induced to request this determination may be speedy as i have directed three vessels to be equipped in order to cut off the supplies and from the number of vessels hourly arriving it may become an object of some importance in the disposal of these captures for the encouragement of the officers and men i have allowed them     one third of the cargoes except military stores which with the vessel are to be reserved for the public use i hope my plan as well as the execution will be favored with the approbation of congress one mr fisk an intelligent person came out of boston on the  d instant and gives us the following advices that a fleet consisting of a sixtyfour and a twentygun ship two sloops of eighteen guns and two transports with six hundred men were to sail from boston yesterday that they took on board two mortars four howitzers and other artillery calculated for the bombardment of a town their destination was kept a profound secret  that an express sloop of war which left england the  th of august arrived four days ago that general gage is recalled and last sunday resigned his command to general howe that lord percy colonel smith and other officers who were at lexington are ordered home with gage that six ships of the line and two cutters were coming out under sir peter dennis that five regiments and a thousand marines are ordered out and may be expected in three or four weeks no prospect of an accommodation but the ministry determined to push the war to the utmost i have an express from colonel arnold and herewith send a copy of his letter and an enclosure no   and i am happy in finding he meets with no discouragement the claim of the rifle officers to be independent of all the superior officers except colonel arnold is without any countenance or authority     from me as i have signified in my last despatch both to colonel arnold and captain morgan the captain of the brig from quebec for boston informs me that there is no suspicion of any such expedition and that if carleton is not drove from st johns so as to be obliged to throw himself into quebec it must fall into our hands as it is left without a regular soldier and many of the inhabitants are most favorably disposed to the american cause and that there is the largest stock of ammunition ever collected in america in the above vessel some letters were also found from an officer at quebec to general gage and major sheriff at boston containing such an account of the temper of the canadians as cannot but afford the highest satisfaction i have thought it best to forward them they are enclosures no       i am with the greatest respect c      george washington   october      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler camp at cambridge   october      dear sir i wrote you yesterday of which the enclosed is a copy since which i have been informed that your illness has obliged you to quit the army and general wooster as the eldest brigadier will take rank and command of mr montgomery general wooster i am informed is not of such activity as to press through difficulties with which that service is environed i am therefore much alarmed for arnold whose expedition was built upon yours and who will infallibly perish if the invasion and entry into canada are abandoned by your successor      i hope by this time the penetration into canada by your army is effected but if it is not and there are any intentions to lay it aside i beg it may be done in such a manner that arnold may be saved by giving him notice and in the mean time your army to keep up such appearances as may fix carleton and prevent the force of canada being turned wholly upon arnold he expected to be at quebec in twenty days   0 from the   th of september so that i hope you will have no difficulty in regulating your motions with respect to him should this find you at albany and general wooster about taking the command i intreat you to impress him strongly with the importance and necessity of proceeding or so to conduct that arnold may have time to retreat nothing new has occurred since yesterday deserving your notice our next accounts of your health i hope will be more favorable ten thousand good wishes attend you from this quarter none more sincere and fervent than those of dear sir your most obedient c george washington   october      cambridge robert carter nicholas to robert carter nicholas virginia camp at cambridge   october      dear sir your favor of the  th ultimo came to my hands on the  d instant by mr byrd  i return you my sincere thanks for your kind congratulation on my appointment to the honorable and important post i now hold by the suffrages of this great continent my heart will ever bear testimony of my gratitude for the distinguished mark of honor which has been conferred on me by this appointment as it also will of my wishes that so important a trust had been placed in the hands of a person of greater experience and abilities than mine i feel the weight of my charge too sensibly not to make this declaration at the same time i must add that i do not want to withdraw     any services within the compass of my power from the cause we are nobly engaged in mr byrd shall not want for his pay whilst he is in this camp although as i have no cash of my own here and charge the public with my expenses only i shall be a little at a loss to know in what manner to advance it with propriety bills of exchange would answer no end here as we have not the means of negotiating them but if you would place the money in the hands of messrs willing and morris of philadelphia either in specie continental maryland or pennsylvania paper they could easily remit or draw for it but at any rate make yourself easy as mr byrd shall not want to the amount of his pay    the enemy in boston and on the heights at charlestown two peninsulas surrounded in a manner by ships of war and floating batteries are so strongly fortified as to render it almost impossible to force their lines which are thrown up at the head of each neck without great slaughter on our side or cowardice on theirs it is absolutely so we therefore can do no more than keep them besieged which they are to all intents and purposes as close as any troops upon earth can be that have an opening to the sea our advanced works and theirs are within musketshot we daily undergo a cannonade which has done no injury to our works and very little hurt to our men those insults we are obliged to submit to for want of powder being obliged except now and then giving them a shot to reserve what we have for closer work than cannondistance     my respectful compliments to mrs nicholas and the rest of your fireside and to any inquiring friends conclude me with grateful thanks for the prayers and good wishes you are pleased to offer on my account i am c  george washington    october      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge    october      sir i am honored with your several favors of the   th and  0th of september and  th of october the contents of which i shall beg leave to notice in their respective order previous to the direction of congress to consult the general officers on the best mode of continuing and providing for the army during the winter i had desired them to turn their thoughts upon these subjects and to favor me with the result by a particular day in writing in this interval the appointment of dr franklin mr lynch and colonel harrison was communicated an event which has given me the highest satisfaction as the subject was too weighty and complex for a discussion by letter this appointment made any conclusion here unnecessary as it is not probable any such arrangement would be agreed on as would not be altered in some respects upon a full and free conference this good effect will arise from the step already taken that every officer will be     prepared to give his sentiments upon these important subjects  the estimates of the commissary and quartermaster general i have now the honor of enclosing    with respect to the reduction of the pay of the men which may enter into the consideration of their support it is the unanimous opinion of the general officers that it cannot be touched with safety at present    upon the presumption of there being a vacancy in the direction of the hospital lieut col hand formerly a surgeon in the   th regiment or royal irish and dr foster late of charles town and one of the surgeons of the hospital under dr church are     candidates for that office i do not pretend to be acquainted with their respective merits and therefore have given them no further expectation than that they should be mentioned as candidates for the department i therefore need only to add upon the subject that the affairs of the hospital require that the appointment should be made as soon as possible before i was honored with your favor of the  th instant i had given orders for the equipment of some armed vessels to intercept the enemys supplies of provisions and ammunition one of them was on a cruise between cape ann and cape cod when the express arrived the others will be fit for the sea in a few days under the command of officers of the     continental army who are well recommended as persons acquainted with the sea and capable of such a service two of these will be immediately despatched on this duty and every particular mentioned in your favor of the  th instant literally complied with  that the honorable congress may have a more complete idea of the plan on which these vessels are equipped i enclose a copy of the instructions given to the captains now out  these with the additional instructions directed will be given to the captains who go into the mouth of st lawrences river as both officers and men most cheerfully engage in the service on the terms mentioned in these instructions i fear that the proposed increase will create some difficulty by making a difference between men engaged on similar service i have therefore not yet communicated this part of the plan but reserved an extra bounty as a reward for extraordinary activity there are no armed vessels in this     province and governor cooke informs me the enterprise can receive no assistance from him as one of the armed vessels of rhode island is on a long cruise and the other unfit for the service nothing shall be omitted to secure success a fortunate capture of an ordnance ship would give new life to the camp and an immediate turn to the issue of this campaign our last accounts from colonel arnold are very favorable he was proceeding with all expedition and i flatter myself making all allowances he will be at quebec the  0th instant where a gentleman from canada mr price assures me he will meet with no resistance     from the various accounts received from europe there may be reason to expect troops will be landed at new york or some other middle colony i should be glad to know the pleasure of the congress whether upon such an event it would be expected that a part of this army should be detached or the internal force of such colony and its neighborhood be deemed sufficient or whether in such case i am to wait the particular direction of congress  the fleet mentioned in my last has been seen     standing n n e so that we apprehend it is intended for some part of this province or new hampshire or possibly quebec the latest and best accounts we have from the enemy are that they are engaged in their new work across the south end of boston preparing their barracks c for winter that it is proposed to keep from five hundred to a thousand men on bunkers hill all winter who are to be relieved once a week the rest to be drawn into boston a person  who has lately been a servant to major connolly a tool of lord dunmores has given an account of a scheme to distress the southern provinces which appeared to me of sufficient consequence to be immediately transmitted i have therefore got it attested and do myself the honor of enclosing it the new levies from connecticut have lately marched into camp and are a body of as good troops as any we have so that we have now the same strength as before the detachment made under colonel arnold i am c  george washington    october      cambridge john augustine washington to john augustine washington camp at cambridge    october      dear brother your favor of the   th ultimo came to hand a few days ago by it i gladly learnt that your family were recovered of the two complaints which had seized many of them and confined my sister i am     very glad to hear also that the convention had come to resolutions of arming the people and preparing vigorously for the defence of the colony which by the latest accounts from england will prove a salutary measure  i am also pleased to find that the manufactury of arms and ammunition has been attended to with so much care a plenty of these and unanimity and fortitude among ourselves must defeat every attempt that a diabolical ministry can invent to enslave this great continent in the manufacturing of arms for public use great care should be taken to make the bores of the same size that the same balls may answer otherwise great disadvantages may arise from a mixture of cartridges the enemy by their not coming out are i suppose afraid of us whilst their situation renders any attempts of ours upon them in a manner impracticable  nothing new has happened since my last     worth communicating since finishing our own lines of defence we as well as the enemy have been busily employed in putting our men under proper cover for the winter our advanced works and theirs are within musketshot of each other we are obliged to submit to an almost daily cannonade without returning a shot from our scarcity of powder which we are necessitated to keep for closer work than cannondistance whenever the redcoat gentry please to step out of their intrenchments seeing no prospect of this i sent a detachment about a month ago into canada by the way of kennebec river under the command of a colonel arnold this detachment   0 consisted of one thousand men and was ordered to possess themselves of quebec if possible but at any rate to make a diversion in favor of general schuyler who by this is in possession i expect of montreal and st johns as i am not altogether without hopes that colonel arnold may be possessed of the capital if so what a pretty hand the ministry have made of their canada bill and the diabolical scheme which was constructed upon it i have also finding that we were in no danger of a visit from our neighbors fitted and am fitting out several privateers with soldiers who have been bred to the sea and have no doubt of making captures of several of their transports some of which have already fallen into our hands laden with provisions i am obliged to you for your advice to my wife and for your intention of visiting her seeing no great prospect of returning to my family and friends this winter i have sent an invitation to mrs washington to come to me although i fear the season is too far advanced especially if she should when my letters get home be in kent as i believe the case will be to admit this with any tolerable degree of convenience i have laid a state of difficulties however which must attend the journey before her and left it to her own choice my love to my sister and the little ones is sincerely tendered and i am with true regard your most affectionate brother      george washington    october      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge    october      sir my conjecture of the destination of the late squadron from boston in my last has been unhappily verified by an outrage exceeding in barbarity and cruelty every hostile act practised among civilized nations i have enclosed the account given me by mr jones  a gentleman of the town of falmouth of the destruction of that increasing and flourishing village he is a very great sufferer and informs me that the time allowed for the removal of effects was so small that valuable property of all kinds and to a great amount has been destroyed the orders shown by the captain for this horrid procedure by which it appears the same desolation is meditated upon all the towns on the coast made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and as extensively as possible as portsmouth was the next place to which he proposed to go general sullivan was permitted to go up and give them his assistance and advice to ward off the blow i flatter myself the like event will not happen there as they have a fortification of some strength     and a vessel has arrived at a place called sheepscot with fifteen hundred pounds of powder the gentlemen of the congress have nearly finished their business  but as they write by this opportunity i must beg leave to refer you to their letter for what concerns their commission we have had no occurrence of any consequence in the camp since i had the honor of addressing you last but expect every hour to hear that newport has shared the fate of unhappy falmouth  george washington    october      cambridge to the committee of falmouth casco bay camp at cambridge    october      gentlemen the desolation and misery which ministerial vengeance had planned in contempt of every principle of humanity and so lately brought on the town of falmouth i know not how sufficiently to commiserate nor can my compassion for the general suffering be conceived beyond the true measure of my feelings but my readiness to relieve you by complying with your request signified in your favor of the       st instant is circumscribed by my inability the immediate necessities of the army under my command require all the powder and ball that can be collected with the utmost industry and trouble the authority of my station does not extend so far as to empower me to send a detachment of men down to your assistance thus circumstanced i can only add my wishes and exhortations that you may repel every future attempt to perpetrate the like savage cruelties i have given liberty to several officers in colonel phinnys regiment to visit their connexions who may now stand in need of their presence and assistance by reason of this new exertion of despotic barbarity i am gentlemen c  george washington    october      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler camp at cambridge    october      dear sir your several favors of the   th and   th instant came safely to hand though not in the proper order of time with their several enclosures you do me justice in believing that i feel the utmost anxiety for your situation that i sympathize with you in all your distresses and shall most heartily share in the joy of your success  my anxiety extends itself to     poor arnold whose fate depends upon the issue of your campaign besides your other difficulties i fear you have those of the season added which will increase every day in the article of powder we are in danger of suffering equally with you our distresses on this head are mutual but we hope they are shortlived as every measure of relief has been pursued which human invention could suggest when you write to general montgomery be pleased to convey my best wishes and regards to him  it has been equally unfortunate for our country and yourself that your ill health has deprived the active part of your army of your presence god     almighty restore you and crown you with happiness and success colonel allens misfortune will i hope teach a lesson of prudence and subordination to others who may be too ambitious to outshine their general officers and regardless of order and duty rush into enterprises which have unfavorable effects to the public and are destructive to themselves  dr franklin mr lynch and colonel harrison delegates from the congress have been in the camp for several days in order to settle the plan for continuing and supporting the army  this commission extended to your department but upon consideration     it appeared so difficult to form any rational plan that nothing was done upon that head if your time and health will admit i should think it highly proper to turn your thoughts to this subject and communicate the result to the congress as early as possible we have had no event of any consequence in our camp for some time our whole attention being taken up with preparations for the winter and forming the new army in which many difficulties occur the enemy expect considerable reinforcements this winter and from all accounts are garrisoning gibraltar and other places with foreign troops in order to bring their former garrison to america the ministry have begun the destruction of our seaport towns by burning a flourishing town of about three hundred houses to the eastward called falmouth this they effected with every circumstance of cruelty and barbarity which revenge and malice could suggest we expect every moment to hear other places have been attempted and have been better prepared for their reception the more i reflect upon the importance of your expedition the greater is my concern lest it should sink under insuperable difficulties i look upon the interest and salvation of our bleeding country in a great degree to depend upon your success i know you feel its importance as connected not only with your own honor and happiness but the public welfare so that you can want no incitements to press on if it be possible my anxiety suggests some     doubts which your better acquaintance with the country will enable you to remove would it not have been practicable to pass st johns leaving force enough for a blockade or if you could not spare the men passing it wholly possessing yourselves of montreal and the surrounding country would not st johns have fallen of course or what would have been the probable consequence believe me dear general i do not mean to imply the smallest doubt of the propriety of your operations or of those of mr montgomery for whom i have a great respect i too well know the absurdity of judging upon a military operation when you are without the knowledge of its concomitant circumstances i only mean it as a matter of curiosity and to suggest to you my imperfect idea on the subject i am with the utmost truth and regard dear sir your most obedient servant      george washington  0 october      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge  0 october      dear sir after you left this yesterday mr tudor presented me with the enclosed as there may be some observations worthy of notice i forward it to you that it may be presented to congress but i would have his remarks upon the frequency of general courts martial considered with some degree of caution for although the nature of his office affords him the best opportunity of discovering the imperfections of the present rules and regulations for the army yet a desire of lessening his own trouble may induce him to transfer many matters from a general court martial where he is the principal actor to regimental courts where he has nothing to do i do not know that this is the case but as it may be i think it ought not to be lost sight of in your conference with mr bache be so good as to ask him whether the two posts which leave philadelphia for the southward both go through alexandria and if only one which of them it is the tuesdays or saturdays that i may know how to order my letters from this place     my letter to colonel harrison on the subject we were speaking of is inclosed and open for your perusal put a wafer under it and make what use you please of it let me know by the post or    what the world says of men and things my compliments to mrs reed and with sincere regard i remain c    0 george washington  0 october      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge  0 october      sir the information which the gentlemen who have lately gone from hence can give the congress of the state and situation of the army would have made a letter unnecessary if i did not suppose there would be     some anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the subject of the reënlistment agreeably to the advice of those gentlemen and my own opinion i immediately began by directing all such officers as proposed to continue to signify their intentions as soon as possible  a great number of the returns are come in from which i find that a very great proportion of the officers of the rank of     captain and under will retire from present appearances i may say half but at least one third it is with some concern also that i observe that many of the officers who retire discourage the continuance of the men and i fear will communicate the infection to them some have advised that those officers who decline the service should be immediately dismissed but this would be very dangerous and inconvenient i confess i have great anxieties upon the subject though i still hope the pay and terms are so advantageous that interest and i hope also a regard to their country will retain a greater portion of the privates than their officers in so important a matter i shall esteem it my indispensable duty not only to act with all possible prudence but to give the most early and constant advice of my progress  a supply of clothing equal to our necessities would greatly contribute to the encouragement and satisfaction of the men in every point of view it is so important that i beg leave to call the attention of the congress to it in a particular manner  i have the honor to be c     george washington   november      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   november      sir i could not suffer mr randolph  to quit this camp without bearing some testimony of my duty to the congress although his sudden departure occasioned by the death of his worthy relative  whose loss as a good citizen and valuable member of society is much to be regretted does not allow me time to be particular     the enclosed return shows at one view what reliance we have upon the officers of this army and how deficient we are likely to be in subaltern officers a few days more will enable me to inform the congress what they have to expect from the soldiery as i shall issue recruitingorders for this purpose so soon as the officers are appointed which will be done this day i having sent for the general officers to consult them in the choice i must beg leave to recall the attention of the congress to the appointment of a brigadiergeneral an officer as necessary to a brigade as a colonel is to a regiment and one that will be exceedingly wanted in the new arrangement  the proclamations and association herewith enclosed came to my hands on monday last  i thought it my duty to send them to you nothing of moment has happened since my last with respectful compliments     to the members of congress i have the honor to be c  george washington   november      cambridge to the general court of massachusetts cambridge   november      sir i promised the gentlemen who did me the honour to call upon me yesterday by order of your house that i would inquire of the quartermastergeneral and let them know today what quantity of wood and hay would be necessary to supply the army through the winter i accordingly did so and desired general gates this morning to inform you that it was his the quartermasters opinion it would require ten thousand cords of the first and two hundred tons of the latter to answer our demands but the hurry in which we have been all day engaged caused him to forget it till a fresh complaint brought it again to remembrance when the committee were here yesterday i told them i did not believe that we had then more than four days stock of wood beforehand i little thought that we had scarce four hours and that different regiments were upon the point of cutting each others throats for a few standing locusts near their encampments to dress their victuals with this however is the fact and unless some expedient is adopted by your honourable body to draw more teams into the service or the quartermastergeneral empowered to impress them this army if there comes a spell of rain or cold weather must inevitably     disperse the consequence of which needs no animadversion of mine it has been matter of great grief to me to see so many valuable plantations of trees destroyed i endeavored whilst there appeared a possibility of restraining it to prevent the practice but it is out of my power to do it from fences to forest trees and from forest trees to fruit trees is a natural advance to houses which must next follow this is not all the distress of the soldiers in the article of wood will i fear have an unhappy influence upon their enlisting again in short sir if i did not apprehend every evil that can result from the want of these two capital articles wood especially i should not be so importunate my anxiety on this head must plead my excuse at the same time i assure you that with great respect and esteem i am c george washington   november      cambridge josiah quincy to josiah quincy  cambridge   november      sir your favor of the   st ultimo was presented to me yesterday i thank you as i shall do every gentleman for suggesting any measure which you conceive to be conducive to the public service but in the adoption     of a plan many things are to be considered to decide upon the utility of it in the one proposed by you i shall not undertake to determine whether it be good or whether it be bad but thus much i can say that if there is any spot upon the main which has an equal command of the shipchannel to boston harbor and give me leave to add that point alderton is not without its advocates in all other respects it must have infinitely the preference because the expense of so many batteries as you propose with the necessary defences to secure the channel the communication and a retreat in the dernier resort from the east end of long island are capital objections not i confess of such importance as to weigh against the object in view if the scheme is practicable but what signifies long island point alderton and dorchester while we are in a manner destitute of cannon and compelled to keep the little powder we have for the use of the musketry the knowledge of this fact is an unanswerable argument against every place and may serve to account for my not having viewed the several spots which have been so advantageously spoken of i am not without intentions of making them a visit and shall assuredly do myself the honor of calling upon you in the mean while permit me to thank you most cordially for your polite invitation and to assure you that i am sir your most obedient humble servant     george washington   november      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge   november      dear sir your favor of the   th ultimo with the enclosures containing an account of the surrender of fort chamblee was an excellent repast but somewhat incomplete for want of montgomerys letter which a copy you omitted to enclose on the success of your enterprise so far i congratulate you as the acquisition of canada is of immeasurable importance to the cause we are engaged in no account of arnold since my last i am exceeding anxious to hear from him but flatter myself that all goes well with him as he was expressly ordered in case of any discouraging event to advertise me of it immediately  i much approve your conduct in regard to wooster my fears are at an end as he acts in a subordinate character intimate this to general montgomery     with my congratulations on his success and the seasonable supply of powder and wishes that his next letter may be dated from montreal we laugh at his idea of chasing  the royal fusileers with the stores does he consider them as inanimate or as a treasure if you carry your arms to montreal should not the garrisons of niagara detroit c be called upon to surrender or threatened with the consequences of a refusal they may indeed destroy their stores and if the indians are aiding escape to fort chartres but it is not very probable the enclosed gazette exhibits sundry specimens of the skill of the new commander in issuing proclamations and a proof in the destruction of falmouth of barbarous designs of an infernal ministry nothing new hath happened in this camp finding the ministerial troops resolved to keep themselves close within their lines and that it was judged impracticable to get at them i have fitted out six armed vessels with the design to pick up some of their storeships and transports the rest of our men are busily employed in erecting of barracks c i hope as you have said nothing of the state of your health that it is much amended and that the cold weather will restore it perfectly that it may do so and you enjoy the fruit of your summers labor and fatigue is the sincere wish dear sir of yours c generals lee and mifflin are well colonel reed gone to philadelphia   00 george washington  th day of november      john sullivan to brigadiergeneral john sullivan instructions you are to proceed immediately to portsmouth in new hampshire and complete the works already begun to secure that and the other towns at the entrance of piscataqua river from any attacks by ships of war for this purpose you are to fix fireships and firerafts in such places as you find most convenient to prevent the enemy from passing up the river as great calamities and distress are brought upon our seaport towns through the malicious endeavors and false representations of many persons holding commissions under the crown who not content with bringing destruction upon some of our principal towns are yet using every art that malice can devise to reduce others to the same unhappy state in hopes by such cruel conduct to please an arbitrary and tyrannical ministry and to receive from them in return a continuance of such places and pensions as they now hold at the expense of the blood and treasure of this distressed continent you are therefore immediately  0  upon your arrival in that province to seize such persons as hold commissions under the crown and are acting as open and avowed enemies to their country and hold them as hostages for the security of those towns which our ministerial enemies threaten to invade in case any attack should be made upon portsmouth or other seaports in that quarter you are immediately to collect such force as can be raised to repel invasion and at all hazards to prevent the enemy from landing and taking possession of any posts in that quarter when you have completed the works at portsmouth and secured the passage of the river there you are to return without delay to the army unless you find the enemy are about to make an immediate attack upon that or the neighboring towns the above is rather to be considered as matter of advice than orders as i do not conceive myself authorized to involve the continent in any expense for the defence of portsmouth or other place out of the line of the great american defence particular colonies being called upon by the congress to prepare for their own internal security given under my hand this  th day of november        0  george washington   november      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   november      sir the immediate occasion of my giving the congress the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them that in consequence of their order signified in your letter of the  0th ultimo i laid myself under a solemn tie of secrecy to captain macpherson  and proceeded to examine his plan for the destruction of the fleet in the harbor of boston with all that care and attention which the importance of it deserved and my judgment could lead to but not being happy enough to coincide in opinion with that gentleman and finding that his scheme would involve greater expense than under my doubts of its success i thought myself justified in giving into i prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to three gentlemen of the artillery in this army well versed in the knowledge and practice of gunnery by them he has been convinced that inasmuch as he set out upon wrong principles the scheme would prove abortive unwilling however to relinquish his favorite project of reducing  0  the naval force of great britain he is very desirous of building a number of rowgalleys for this purpose but as the congress alone are competent to the adoption of this measure i have advised him although he offered to go on with the building of them at his own expense till the congress should decide to repair immediately to philadelphia with his proposals where if they should be agreed to or vessels of superior force agreeable to the wishes of most others should be resolved on he may set instantly about them with all the materials upon the spot here they are to collect to him therefore i refer for further information on this head a vessel said to be from philadelphia and bound to boston with   0 pipes of wine     of which are secured stranded at a place called eastham in a gale of wind on the  d inst another from boston to halifax with dry goods c amounting per invoice to about   0£ lawful got disabled in the same gale near beverly these cargoes with the papers i have ordered to this place the vessels to be taken care of until further orders i have also an account of the taking of a wood sloop bound to boston and carried into portsmouth by one of our armed vessels—particulars not yet come to hand and this instant of two others from nova scotia to boston with hay wood live stock c by another of our armed schooners these are in plymouth these accidents and captures point out the necessity of establishing proper courts without loss of time for the decision of property and the legality of seizures  0  otherwise i may be involved in inextricable difficulties  our prisoners by the reduction of fort chamblee on which happy event i most sincerely congratulate the congress being considerably augmented and likely to be increased i submit it to the wisdom of congress whether some convenient inland towns remote from the post roads ought not to be assigned them the manner of their treatment subsistence c defined and a commissary or agent appointed to see that justice is done both to them and the public proper accounts rendered c unless a mode of this sort is adopted i fear there will be sad confusion hereafter as there are great complaints at present  i reckoned without my host when i informed the congress in my last that i should in a day or two be able to acquaint them with the disposition of the soldiery towards a new enlistment i have been in consultation with the generals of this army ever since thursday last endeavoring to establish new corps of officers but find so many doubts and difficulties to reconcile i cannot say when they are to end or what may be the consequences as there appears to be such an unwillingness in the officers of one government mixing in the same regiment with those of another and without it many must be dismissed who are willing to serve notwithstanding we are deficient on the whole i am to have another meeting  0  today upon this business and shall inform you of the result the council of officers are unanimously of opinion that the command of the artillery should no longer continue in colonel gridley  and knowing of no person better qualified to supply his place or whose appointment will give more general satisfaction i have taken the liberty of recommending henry knox esq to the consideration of the congress thinking it indispensably necessary at the same time that this regiment should consist of two lieutenantcolonels two majors and twelve companies agreeable to the plan and estimate handed in—which differing from the last establishment i should be glad to be instructed on the commissary general not being returned will apologize i hope for my silence respecting a requisition  0  of the expence of his clerks c which i was to have obtained together with others and forward i have heard nothing of colonel arnold since the   th ultimo his letter of and journal to that date will convey all the information i am able to give of him i think he must be in quebec if any mischance had happened to him he would as directed have forwarded an express no account yet of the armed vessels sent to the st lawrence i think they will meet with the stores inward or outward bound captain symons in the cerberus lately sent from boston to falmouth has published the enclosed declaration at that place and it is suspected intends to make some kind of a lodgment there i wrote immediately to a colonel phinny of this army who went up there upon the last alarm to spirit up the people and oppose it at all events falmouth is about a hundred and thirty miles from this camp  i have the honor to be c  0  p s i send a general return of the troops and manifests of the cargoes and vessels taken at plymouth george washington   november      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed philadelphia cambridge   november      dear sir the shipwreck of a vessel said to be from philadelphia to boston near plymouth with one hundred and twenty pipes of wine one hundred and eighteen of which are saved another from boston to halifax near beverly with about two hundred and forty pounds worth of dry goods the taking of a woodvessel bound to boston by captain adams and the sudden departure of mr randolph occasioned by the death of his uncle are all the occurrences worth noticing which have happened since you left this i have ordered the wine and goods to this place for sale as also the papers the latter may unfold secrets that may not be pleasing to some of your townsmen and which so soon as known will be communicated i have been happy enough to convince captain macpherson as he says of the propriety of returning to the congress he sets out this day and i am happy in his having an opportunity of laying before them a scheme for the destruction of the naval force of great britain a letter and journal of colonel arnolds to the   th ultimo are come to hand a copy of which i enclose to the congress and by application to mr thomson you can see i think he is in  0  quebec if i hear nothing more of him in five days i shall be sure of it i had like to have forgotten what sits heaviest upon my mind the new arrangement of officers although we have not enough to constitute the new corps it hath employed the general officers and myself ever since thursday last and we are nearly as we begun connecticut wants no massachusetts man in their corps massachusetts thinks there is no necessity for a rhodeislander to be introduced amongst them and new hampshire says it s very hard that her valuable and experienced officers who are willing to serve should be discarded because her own regiments under the new establishment cannot provide for them in short after a four days labor i expect that numbers of officers who have given in their names to serve must be discarded from massachusetts where the regiments have been numerous and the number in them small and connecticut completed with a fresh recruit of officers from its own government this will be departing not only from the principles of common justice but from the letter of the resolve agreed on at this place but at present i see no help for it we are to have another meeting upon the matter this day when something must be hit upon as time is slipping off my compliments to mrs reed and to all inquiring friends i am with sincerity and truth dear sir your affectionate humble servant p s i had just finished my letter when a blundering lieutenant of the blundering captain coit who  0  had just blundered upon two vessels from nova scotia came in with the account of it and before i could rescue my letter without knowing what he did picked up a candle and sprinkled it with grease but these are kind of blunders which one can readily excuse the vessels contain hay livestock poultry c and are now safely moored in plymouth harbour  george washington  0 november      cambridge william woodford to colonel william woodford  cambridge  0 november      dear sir your favor of the   th of september came to my hands on wednesday last through boston and open   0 as you may suppose it might be well to recollect by whom you sent it in order to discover if there has not been some treachery practised i do not mean to flatter when i assure you that i highly approve of your appointment the inexperience you complain of is a common case and only to be remedied by practice and close attention the best general advice i can give and which i am sure you stand in no need of is to be strict in your discipline that is to require nothing unreasonable of your officers and men but see that whatever is required be punctually complied with reward and punish every man according to his merit without     partiality or prejudice hear his complaints if well founded redress them if otherwise discourage them in order to prevent frivolous ones discourage vice in every shape and impress upon the mind of every man from the first to the lowest the importance of the cause and what it is they are contending for for ever keep in view the necessity of guarding against surprises in all your marches at times at least even when there is no possible danger move with front rear and flank guards that they may be familiarized to the use and be regular in your encampments appointing necessary guards for the security of your camp in short whether you expect     an enemy or not this should be practised otherwise your attempts will be confused and awkward when necessary be plain and precise in your orders and keep copies of them to refer to that no mistakes may happen be easy and condescending in your deportment to your officers but not too familiar lest you subject yourself to a want of that respect which is necessary to support a proper command these sir not because i think you need the advice but because you have been condescending enough to ask it i have presumed to give as the great outlines of your conduct as to the manual exercise the evolutions and manœuvres of a regiment with other knowledge necessary to a soldier you will acquire them from those authors who have treated upon these subjects among whom bland the newest edition stands foremost also an essay on the art of war instructions for officers lately published at philadelphia the partisan young and others my compliments to mrs woodford and that every success may attend you in this glorious struggle is the sincere and ardent wish of dear sir your affectionate humble servant      george washington    november      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge    november      sir i had the honor to address myself to you the  th inst by captain macpherson since which i have an account of a schooner laden chiefly with fire wood being brought into marblehead by the armed schooner lee captain manly she had on board the master a midshipman two marines and four sailors from the cerberus man of war who had made a prize of this schooner a few days before and was sending her into boston enclosed you have a copy of an act passed this session by the honorable council and house of representatives of this province  it respects such captures as may be made by vessels fitted out by the province or by individuals thereof as the armed vessels fitted out at the continental expense do not come under this law i would have it submitted to the consideration of congress to point out a more summary way of proceeding to determine the property and mode of condemnation of such prizes as have been or hereafter may be made than is specified in this act should not a court be established by authority of congress to take cognizance of prizes made by the continental vessels whatever the mode is which     they are pleased to adopt there is an absolute necessity of its being speedily determined on for i cannot spare time from military affairs to give proper attention to these matters the inhabitants of plymouth have taken a sloop laden with provisions from halifax bound to boston and the inhabitants of beverly have under cover of one of the armed schooners taken a vessel from ireland laden with beef pork butter c for the same place the latter brings papers and letters of a very interesting nature which are in the hands of the honorable council who informed me they will transmit them to you by this conveyance to the contents of these papers and letters i must beg leave to refer you and the honorable congress who will now see the absolute necessity of exerting all their wisdom to withstand the mighty efforts of our enemies the trouble i have in the arrangement of the army is really inconceivable many of the officers sent in their names to serve in expectation of promotion others stood aloof to see what advantage they could make for themselves whilst a number who had declined have again sent in their names to serve so great has the confusion arising from these and many other perplexing circumstances been that i found it absolutely impossible to fix this very interesting business exactly on the plan resolved on in the conference though i have kept up to the spirit of it as near as the nature and necessity of the case would admit of the difficulty with the soldiers is as great indeed more so if possible than with the officers they     will not enlist until they know their colonel lieutenantcolonel major captain c so that it was necessary to fix the officers the first thing which is at last in some manner done and i have given out enlisting orders you sir can much easier judge than i can express the anxiety of mind i must labor under on this occasion especially at this time when we may expect the enemy will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement part of which is already come and the remainder daily dropping in      i have other distresses of a very alarming nature the arms of our soldiery are so exceedingly bad that i assure you sir i cannot place a proper confidence in them our powder is wasting fast notwithstanding the strictest care economy and attention are paid to it the long series of wet weather which we have had renders the greater part of what has been served out to the men of no use yesterday i had a proof of it as a party of the enemy about four or five hundred taking the advantage of a high tide landed at lechmeres point which at that time was in effect an island we were alarmed and of course ordered every man to examine his cartouchbox when the melancholy truth appeared and we were obliged to furnish the greater part of them with fresh ammunition the damage done at the point was the taking of a man who watched a few horses and cows ten of the latter they carried off colonel thompson marched down with his regiment of riflemen and was joined by colonel woodbridge with a part of his and a part of pattersons regiment who gallantly waded through the water and soon obliged the enemy to embark under cover of a manofwar a floating battery and the fire of a battery on charlestown neck we have two of our men dangerously wounded by grapeshot     from the manofwar and by a flag sent out this day we are informed the enemy lost two of their men  i have the honor to be c  george washington    november      cambridge william palfrey to william palfrey portsmouth  cambridge    november      sir at a time when some of our seaport towns are cruelly and wantonly laid in ashes and ruin and devastation     denounced against others when the arms are demanded of the inhabitants and hostages required in effect to surrender of their liberties when general howe by proclamation under the threat of military execution has forbid inhabitants of boston to leave the town without his permission first had and obtained in writing when by another proclamation he strictly forbids any persons bringing out of that place more than five pounds sterling of their property in specie because truly the ministerial army under his command may be injured by it and when by a third proclamation after leaving the inhabitants no alternative he calls upon them to take arms under officers of his appointing it is evident that the most tyrannical and cruel system is adopted for the destruction of the rights and liberties of this continent that ever disgraced the most despotic ministry and ought to be opposed by every means in our power     i therefore desire that you will delay no time in causing the seizure of every officer of government at portsmouth who has given proofs of his unfriendly disposition to the cause we are engaged in and when you have secured all such take the opinion of the provincial congress or committee of safety in what manner to dispose of them in that government i do not mean that they should be kept in close confinement if either of those bodies should incline to send them to any interior towns upon their parole not to leave them until released it will meet with my concurrence for the present i shall avoid giving you the like order in respect to the tories in portsmouth but the day is not far off when they will meet with this or a worse fate if there is not a considerable reformation in their conduct of this they may be assured from sir your most humble servant    0 george washington    november      cambridge henry knox to henry knox instructions cambridge    november      sir you are immediately to examine into the state of the artillery of this army and take an account of the cannon mortars shells     lead and ammunition that are wanting when you have done that you are to proceed in the most expeditious manner to new york there apply to the president of the provincial congress and learn of him whether colonel reed did any thing or left any orders respecting these articles and get him to procure such of them as can possibly be had there     the president if he can will have them immediately sent hither if he cannot you must put them in a proper channel for being transported to this camp with despatch before you leave new york after you have procured as many of these necessaries as you can there you must go to majorgeneral schuyler and get the remainder from ticonderoga crown point or st johns if it should be necessary from quebec if in our hands the want of them is so great that no trouble or expense must be spared to obtain them i have written to general schuyler he will give every necessary assistance that they may be had and forwarded to this place with the utmost despatch i have given you a warrant to the paymastergeneral of the continental army for a thousand dollars to defray the expense attending your journey and procuring these articles an account of which you are to keep and render upon your return  george washington    november      cambridge artemas ward to majorgeneral artemas ward camp at cambridge    november      sir as the season is fast approaching when the bay between us and boston will in all probability be close shut up thereby rendering any movement upon the     ice as easy as if no water was there and as it is more than possible that general howe when he gets the expected reinforcement will endeavor to relieve himself from the disgraceful confinement in which the ministerial troops have been all the summer common prudence dictates the necessity of guarding our camps wherever they are most assailable for this purpose i wish you general thomas general spencer and colonel putnam to meet me at your quarters tomorrow at  0 oclock that we may examine the ground between your work at the mill and sewalls point and direct such batteries as shall appear necessary for the security of your camp on that side to be thrown up without loss of time i have long had it upon my mind that a successful attempt might be made by way of surprise upon castle william from every account there are not more than three hundred men in that place the whaleboats therefore which you have and such as could be sent you would easily transport eight hundred or one thousand men which with a very moderate     share of conduct and spirit might i should think bring off the garrison if not some part of the stores i wish you to discuss this matter under the rose with officers on whose judgment and conduct you can rely something of this sort may show how far the men are to be depended upon i am c      george washington    november      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge    november      sir i received your favors of the  th and  0th instant with the resolves of the honorable congress to which i will pay all due attention as soon as two capable persons can be found i will despatch them to nova scotia on the service resolved on by congress the resolve to raise two battalions of marines will if practicable in this army entirely derange what has been done it is therein mentioned one colonel for the two battalions of course a colonel must be dismissed one of the many difficulties which attended the new arrangement was in reconciling the different interests and judging of the merits of the different colonels in the dismission of this one the same difficulties will occur the officers and men must be acquainted with maritime affairs to comply with which they must be picked out of the whole army one from this corps one from another so as to break through the whole system which it has cost us so much time anxiety and pains to bring into any tolerable form notwithstanding any difficulties which will arise you may be assured sir that i will use every endeavor to comply with their resolve i beg leave to submit it to the consideration of congress if those two battalions can be formed out of this army whether this is a time to weaken our lines by employing any of the officers appointed to defend them on any other service the gentlemen who were here from congress know their vast extent they must know that we shall have occason for our     whole force for that purpose more now than at any past time as we may expect the enemy will take the advantage of the first hard weather and attempt to make an impression somewhere that this is the intention we have many reasons to suspect we have had in the last week six deserters and took two straggling prisoners they all agree that two companies with a train of artillery and one of the regiments from ireland were arrived at boston that fresh ammunition and fruits have been served out that the grenadiers and light infantry had orders to hold themselves in readiness at a moments warning as there is every appearance that this contest will not be soon decided and of course that there must be an augmentation of the continental army would it not be eligible to raise two battalions of marines in new york and philadelphia where there must be numbers of sailors now unemployed this however is matter of opinion which i mention with all due deference to the superior judgment of the congress  enclosed you have copies of two letters one from colonel arnold the other from colonel enos i can form no judgment on the latters conduct until i see him  nothwithstanding the great defection i do     not despair of colonel arnolds success he will have in all probability many more difficulties to encounter than if he had been a fortnight sooner as it is likely that governor carleton will with what forces he can collect after the surrender of the rest of canada throw himself into quebec and there make his last effort there is no late account from captains broughton and sellman sent to the river st lawrence the other cruisers have been chiefly confined to harbors by the badness of the weather the same reason has caused great delay in the building of our barracks which with a most mortifying scarcity of firewood     discourages the men from enlisting the last i am much afraid is an insuperable obstacle i have applied to the honorable house of representatives of this province who were pleased to appoint a committee to negotiate this business and notwithstanding all the pains they have taken and are taking they find it impossible to supply our necessities the want of a sufficient number of teams i understand to be the chief impediment i got returns this day from eleven colonels of the numbers enlisted in their regiments the whole amount is nine hundred and sixtysix men there must be some other stimulus besides love for their country to make men fond of the service it would be a great encouragement and no additional expense to the continent were they to receive pay for the months of october and november also a months pay advance the present state of the military chest will not admit of this the sooner it is enabled to do so the better  the commissarygeneral is daily expected in camp i cannot send you the estimate of the clerks in his department until he arrives i sincerely congratulate you upon the success of your arms in the surrender of st johns which i hope is a happy presage of the reduction of the rest of canada i have the honor to be c      george washington  0 november      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed camp at cambridge  0 november      dear sir your letters of the  th from new york  th and — from philadelphia the last by express are all before me and gave me the pleasure to hear of your happy meeting with mrs reed without any other accident than that of leaving a horse by the way the hint contained in the last of your letters respecting your continuance in my family in other words your wish that i could dispense with it gives me pain you already my dear sir knew my sentiments on this matter you cannot but be sensible of your importance to me at the same time i shall again repeat what i have observed to you before that i can never think of promoting my convenience at the expense of your interest and inclination that i feel the want of you yourself can judge when i inform you that the peculiar situation of mr randolphs affairs obliged him to leave this soon after you did that mr baylor contrary to my expectation is not in the slightest degree a penman though spirited and willing and that mr harrison though sensible clever and perfectly confidential has never yet moved upon so large a scale as to comprehend at one view the diversity of matter which comes before me so as to afford that ready assistance which every man in my situation must stand more or less in need of mr moylan it is true is very obliging he gives me what assistance he can but other business must necessarily deprive me of his aid in a very short time this is   0 my situation judge you therefore how much i wish for your return especially as the armed vessels and the capital change in the state of this army about to take place have added an additional weight to a burthen before too great for me to stand under with the smallest degree of comfort to my own feelings my mind is now fully disclosed to you with this assurance sincerely and affectionately of accompanying it that whilst you are disposed to continue with me i shall think myself too fortunate and happy to wish for a change dr morgan as director of the hospital is exceedingly wanted at this place and ought not to delay his departure for the camp a moment many regulations being delayed and accounts postponed till his arrival i have given g s and col p a hint of the prevailing reports in connecticut without intimating from what quarter they came for indeed i received them through different channels in order to put them upon their guard they both deny the charge roundly and wish for an opportunity of vindication i thought as this information had come to my ears in different ways it was best to speak to these gentlemen in terms expressive of my abhorrence of such conduct and of the consequences that might flow from it and think it will have a good effect the method you have suggested of the advanced pay i very much approve of and would adopt but for the unfortunate cramped state of our treasury which keeps us for ever under the hatches pray urge the necessity of this measure to such members as you may converse with and the     want of cash to pay the troops for the months of october and november as also to answer the demands of the commissary quartermaster and for contingencies to do all this a considerable sum will be necessary do not neglect to put that wheel in motion which is to bring us the shirts medicines c from new york they are much wanting here and cannot be had i should think upon better terms than on a loan from the best of kings so anxiously disposed to promote the welfare of his american subjects dr church is gone to governor trumbull to be disposed of in a connecticut gaol without the use of pen ink or paper to be conversed with in the presence of a magistrate only and in the english language so much for indiscretion the doctor will say your accounts of our dependence upon the people of great britain i religiously believe it has long been my political creed that the ministry durst not have gone on as they did but under the firmest persuasion that the people were with them the weather has been unfavorable however for the arrival of their transports only four companies of the seventeenth regiment and two of the artillery are yet arrived by our last advices from boston our rascally privateersmen go on at the old rate mutinying if they cannot do as they please  those     at plymouth beverly and portsmouth have done nothing worth mentioning in the prize way and no accounts are yet received from those farther eastward arnold by a letter which left him the   th ultimo had then only got to the chaudière pond and was scarce of provisions his rear division under the command of the noble colonel enos had without his privity or consent left him with three companies and his expedition inasmuch as it is to be apprehended that carleton with the remains of such force as he had been able to raise would get into quebec before him i fear in a bad way for further particulars i refer you to mr hancock who has enclosed to him copies of arnolds and enoss letters the lastnamed person is not yet arrived at this camp i thank you for your frequent mention of mrs washington i expect she will be in philadelphia about the time this letter may reach you on her way hither as she and her conductor who i expect will be mr custis her son are perfect strangers to the road the stages and the proper place to cross hudsons river by all means avoiding new york i shall be much obliged in your particular instructions and advice to her i do imagine as the roads are bad and the weather cold her stages must be short especially as i expect her horses will be pretty much fatigued as they will by the time she gets to philadelphia have performed a journey of at least four hundred and fifty miles my express finding of her     among her friends near williamsburg one hundred and fifty miles below my own house as you have mentioned nothing in your letters of the cannon c to be had from new york ticonderoga c i have in order to reduce the matter to a certainty employed mr knox to go to those places complete our wants and to provide such military stores as st johns can spare my respectful compliments to mrs reed and be assured that i am dear sir with affectionate regard c flints are greatly wanted here  george washington   th day of november      aaron willard to aaron willard instructions sir the honorable continental congress having lately passed a resolve expressed in the following words—that two persons be sent at the expense of these colonies to nova scotia to inquire into the state of that colony the disposition of the inhabitants towards the american cause the condition of the fortifications     and dockyards the quantity of artillery and warlike stores and the number of soldiers sailors and ships of war there and transmit the earliest intelligence to general washington i do hereby constitute and appoint you the said aaron willard to be one of the persons to undertake this business and as the season is late and this work of great importance i entreat and request that you will use the utmost despatch attention and fidelity in the execution of it the necessity of acting with a proper degree of caution and secrecy is too apparent to need recommendation you will keep an account of your expenses and upon your return will be rewarded in a suitable manner for the fatigue of your journey and the services you render your country by conducting and discharging this business with expedition and fidelity given under my hand this   th day of november           george washington    november      cambridge lund washington to lund washington mount vernon  cambridge    november      what follows is part of a letter written to mr lund washington the   th day of november      a copy is taken to remind me of my engagements and the exact purport of them these paragraphs follow an earnest request to employ good part of my force in clearing up swamps h hole ditching hedging c i well know where the difficulty of accomplishing these things will lie overseers are already engaged upon shares to look after my business remote advantages to me however manifest and beneficial are nothing to them and to engage standing wages when i do not know that any thing that i have or can     raise will command cash is attended with hazard for which reason i hardly know what more to say than to discover my wishes the same reason although it may in appearance have the same tendency in respect to you shall not be the same in its operation for i will engage for the year coming and the year following if these troubles and my absence continue that your wages shall be standing and certain at the highest amount that any one years crop has produced to you yet i do not offer this as any temptation to induce you to go on more cheerfully in prosecuting these schemes of mine i should do injustice to you were i not to acknowledge that your conduct has ever appeared to me above every thing sordid but i offer it in consideration of the great charge you have upon your hands and my entire dependence upon your fidelity and industry it is the greatest indeed it is the only comfortable reflection i enjoy on this score that my business is in the hands of a person in whose integrity i have not a doubt and on whose care i can rely was it not for this i should feel very unhappy on account of the situation of my affairs but i am persuaded you will do for me as you would for yourself and more than this i cannot expect let the hospitality of the house with respect to the poor be kept up let no one go hungry away if any of this kind of people should be in want of corn supply their necessities provided it does not encourage them in idleness and i have no objection to your giving my money in charity to the amount of     forty or fifty pounds a year when you think it well bestowed what i mean by having no objection is that it is my desire that it should be done you are to consider that neither myself nor wife is now in the way to do these good offices in all other respects i recommend it to you and have no doubt of your observing the greatest economy and frugality as i suppose you know that i do not get a farthing for my services here more than my expenses it becomes necessary therefore for me to be saving at home the above is copied not only to remind myself of my promises and requests but others also if any mischance happens to g washington george washington    november      cambridge richard henry lee to richard henry lee camp at cambridge    november      dear sir your favor of the   th with the enclosures for which i thank you came to this place on wednesday evening part of which that is the night i was engaged with a party of men throwing up a work upon a hill called cobble hill which in case we should ever be supplied with such things as we want may prove useful to us and could not be delayed as the earth here is getting as hard as a rock  this and the early departure of the post prevented my giving your letter an answer the next morning in answer to your inquiries respecting armed     vessels there are none of any tolerable force belonging to this government i know of but two of any kind those very small at the continental expense i have fitted out six as by the enclosed list two of which are upon the cruise directed by congress the rest ply about cape cod and cape ann as yet to very little purpose these vessels are all manned by officers and soldiers except perhaps a master and pilots but how far as they are upon the old establishment which has not more than a month to exist they can be ordered off this station i will not undertake to say but suppose they might be engaged anew belonging to providence there are two armed vessels and i am told connecticut has one which with one of those from providence is i believe upon the cruise you have directed i have no idea that the troops can remove from boston this winter to a place where no provision is made for them however we shall keep the best lookout we can and upon that and every occasion where practicable give them the best we have but their situation in boston gives them but little to apprehend from a parting blow whilst their ships can move and floating batteries surround the town nothing of importance has happened since my last for gods sake hurry the signers of money that our wants may be supplied it is a very singular case that their signing cannot keep pace with our demands i heartily congratulate you and the congress on the reduction of st johns i hope all canada is in our possession before this no accounts from arnold     since those mentioned in my last letter to the congress would it not be politic to invite them to send members to congress would it not be also politic to raise a regiment or two of canadians and bring them out of the country they are good troops and this would be entering them heartily in the cause  my best regards to the good families you are with i am very affectionately your obedient servant george washington    november      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    november      dear sir your letter of the   th by post now lyes before me  i thank you for the attention paid to my   0 memorandums the arrival of money will be an agreeable circumstance i recollect no occurrance of moment since my last except the taking possession of cobble hill on wednesday night this to my great surprize we did and have worked on ever since without receiving a single shott from bunkers hill—the ship—or floating batteries—what all this means we know not unless some capitol strike is meditating—i have caused two half moon batterries to be thrown up for occasional use between litchmores point  the mouth of cambridge river and another work at the causey going on to litchmores point to command that pass  rake the little rivulet which runs by it to pattersons fort besides these i have been  markd three places between sewalls point  our lines on roxbury neck for works to be thrown up and occasionally mannd in case of a sortee when the bay gets froze by order of genl howe  00 of the poor inhabitants of boston were landed on saturday last at point shirley destitute almost of every thing the instant i got notice of it i informed a committee of council thereof that proper care might be taken of them—yesterday in the evening i received information that one of them was dead  two more expiring and the whole in the most miserable  piteous condition—i have orderd provision to them till they can be removd but am under dreadful apprehensions of their communicating the small pox as it is rief in boston i have forbid any of them coming to this place on that acct     a ship well fraught with ordinance ordinance stores c is missing and gives great uneasiness in boston her convoy has been in a fortnight—i have orderd our armd vessels to keep a good look out for her the same reasons which restrained you from writing fully also prevent me i shall therefore only add that i am c if any waggon should be coming this way pray order a qty of good writing paper to head quarters  seag wax george washington    november      cambridge to the president of congress camp at cambridge    november      sir i had the honor of writing to you on the   th instant i have now to inform you that mr henry knox esq is gone to new york with orders to forward to this place what cannon and ordnance stores can be there procured from thence he will proceed to general schuyler on the same business as you will see by the enclosed copy of instructions which i have given him it would give me much satisfaction that this gentleman or any other whom you may think qualified were appointed to the command of the artillery regiment in my letter to you of the  th instant i have expressed myself fully on this subject which i beg leave to recommend to your immediate attention as the formation of that corps will be at a stand until i am honored with your instructions thereon the vessel laden with wine which i advised you was wrecked on this coast proves to have been     the property of thomas satler of philadelphia the papers relative to her and cargo were sent to robert morris esqr who can give you every information thereon the schooner with the dry goods from boston to halifax is given up to the committee of safety at beverly who will dispose of her and cargo agreeable to the decision of a court of admiralty and the schooner carried into portsmouth by captain adams proves to be a friend is of course discharged there are two persons engaged to go to nova scotia on the business recommended in your last by the best information we have from thence the stores have been withdrawn some time should this not be the case it is next to an impossibility to attempt any thing there in the present unsettled and precarious state of the army colonel enos is arrived and is under arrest he acknowledges that he had no orders for coming away his trial cannot come on until i hear from colonel arnold from whom there is no account since i last wrote you from what i can collect by my inquiries amongst the officers it will be impossible to get the men to enlist for the continuance of the war which will be an insuperable obstruction to the formation of the two battalions of marines on the plan resolved on in congress  as it can make no difference i propose to proceed on the new arrangement of the army and when completed inquire out such officers and men as     are best qualified for that service and endeavor to form these two battalions out of the whole this appears to me the best method and i hope it will meet the approbation of congress as it will be very difficult for the men to work when the hard frost sets in i have thought it necessary though of little use at present to take possession of cobble hill for the benefit of any future operations it was effected without the least opposition from the enemy the   d instant their inactivity on this occasion is what i cannot account for it is probable they are meditating a blow somewhere about three hundred men women and children of the poor inhabitants of boston came out to point shirley last friday they have brought their household furniture but unprovided of every other necessary of life i have recommended them to the attention of the committee of the honorable council of this province now sitting at watertown the number enlisted since my last is two thousand five hundred and forty men i am very sorry to be necesitated to mention to you the egregious want of public spirit which reigns here instead of pressing to be engaged in the cause of their country which i vainly flattered myself would be the case i find we are likely to be deserted and in a most critical time those that have enlisted must have a furlough which i have been obliged to grant to fifty at a time from each regiment the connecticut troops upon whom i reckoned are as backward indeed if possible more so than the people of this colony our     situation is truly alarming and of this general howe is well apprized it being the common topic of conversation when the people left boston last friday no doubt when he is reinforced he will avail himself of the information  i am making the best disposition i can for our defence having thrown up besides the work on cobble hill several redoubts halfmoons c along the bay and i fear i shall be under the necessity of calling in the militia and minutemen of the country to my assistance i say i fear it because by what i can learn from the officers in the army belonging to this colony it will be next to an impossibility to keep them under any degree of discipline and it will be very difficult to prevail on them to remain a moment longer than they choose themselves it is a mortifying reflection to be reduced to this dilemma there has been nothing wanting on my part to infuse a proper spirit amongst the officers that they may exert their influence with the soldiery you see by a fortnights recruiting amongst men with arms in their hands how little has been the success as the smallpox is now in boston i have used the precaution of prohibiting such as lately came out from coming near our camp general burgoyne i am informed will soon embark for england i think the risque too great to write you by post whilst it continues to pass thro new york it is certain that a post has been intercepted the beginning of last month as they sent out several letters from boston     with the postmark at baltimore on them this goes by captain joseph blewer who promises to deliver it carefully unto you you doubtless will have heard before this reaches you of general montgomerys having got possession of montreal  i congratulate you thereon he has troubles with his troops as well as i have all i can learn of colonel arnold is that he is near quebec i hope montgomery will be able to proceed to his assistance i shall be very uneasy until i hear they are joined my best respects attend the gentlemen in congress and believe me sir your most obedient c  george washington    november      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    november      dear sir by post i wrote you yesterday in answer to your letter of the   th since which your favors of the   th and   th are come to hand in one of these you justly observe that the sudden departure of mr randolph must cause your absence to be the more sensibly felt i can truly assure you that i miss you exceedingly and if an express declaration of this be     wanting to hasten your return i make it most heartily and with some pleasure as mr lynch in a letter of the   th received with yours gives this information in consequence of your letter by colonel reed i applied to the chief justice who tells me the supreme courts are lately held and that it will be some time before their term will return that he knows of no capital suit now depending and that it is very easy for colonel reed to manage matters so as not to let that prevent his return to you i am sure mr chew is so heartily disposed to oblige you and serve the cause that nothing in his power will be wanting i could wish my good friend that these things may give a spur to your inclination to return and that i may see you here as soon as convenient as i feel the want of your ready pen c greatly what an astonishing thing it is that those who are employed to sign the continental bills should not be able or inclined to do it as fast as they are wanted they will prove the destruction of the army if they are not more attentive and diligent such a dearth of public spirit and want of virtue such stockjobbing and fertility in all the low arts to obtain advantages of one kind or another in this great change of military arrangement i never saw before and pray god i may never be witness to again what will be the ultimate end of these manœuvres is beyond my scan i tremble at the prospect we have been till this time enlisting about three thousand five hundred men to engage these i have been obliged to allow furloughs as far as fifty men a regiment and     the officers i am persuaded indulge as many more the connecticut troops will not be prevailed upon to stay longer than their term saving those who have enlisted for the next campaign and mostly on furlough and such a dirty mercenary spirit pervades the whole that i should not be at all surprised at any disaster that may happen in short after the last of this month our lines will be so weakened that the minutemen and militia must be called in for their defence these being under no kind of government themselves will destroy the little subordination i have been laboring to establish and run me into one evil whilst i am endeavoring to avoid another but the lesser must be chosen could i have foreseen what i have and am likely to experience no consideration upon earth should have induced me to accept this command a regiment or any subordinate department would have been accompanied with ten times the satisfaction and perhaps the honor      i think i informed you in my letter of yesterday that we had taken possession of and had fortified cobble hill and several points round the bay between that and roxbury in a night or two more we shall begin our work on lechmores point when doubtless we shall be honored with their notice unless general howe is waiting the favorable moment he has been told of to aim a capital blow which is my fixed opinion the congress already know from the general estimate given in for a month what sum it will take to supply this army and that little less than two hundred and seventyfive thousand dollars will answer the purpose pray impress this upon the members and the necessity of forwarding the last sum voted as one hundred thousand dollars will be but a fleabite to our demands at this time did i not in one of my late letters inform you that i had sent mr knox through new york to general schuyler to see what artillery i could get from those places he has been set out upon this business about ten days and i hope will fall in with the committee of congress powder is also so much wanted that nothing without it can be done i wish that matter respecting the punctilio hinted at by you could come to some decision of congress i have done nothing yet in respect to the proposed exchange of prisoners nor shall i now until i hear from them or you on this subject i am sorry mr white met with a disappointment in the jerseys as     i could wish not to be under the necessity from any former encouragement given him of taking him into my family i find it is absolutely necessary that the aids to the commanderinchief should be ready at their pen which i believe he is not to give that ready assistance that is expected of them i shall make a lame hand therefore to have two of this kidney it would give me singular pleasure to provide for those two gentlemen mentioned in your letter but believe me it is beyond the powers of conception to discover the absurdities and partiality of these people and the trouble and vexation i have had in the new arrangement of officers after five i think different meetings of the general officers i have in a manner been obliged to give in to the humor and whimsies of the people or get no army the officers of one government would not serve in the regiments of another although there was to be an entire new creation a captain must be in this regiment a subaltern in that company in short i can scarce tell at this moment in what manner they are fixed some time hence strangers may be brought in but it could not be done now except in an instance or two without putting too much to the hazard    0 i have this instant by express received the agreeable news of the capitulation of montreal the account of it you also undoubtedly have poor arnold i wonder where he is enos left him with the rear division of his army and is now here under arrest what can your brethren of the law mean by saying your perquisites as secretary must be considerable i am sure they have not amounted to one farthing captain blewer waits and therefore i shall add no more than that i am dear sir your most obedient and affectionate servant p s please to let col lee know that i answered his query by last post respecting the armed vessels of this province and those fitted out by the continent george washington    november      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge    november      dear sir you may easily conceive that i had great pleasure in perusing your letter of the   th instant which with the enclosures i received last evening it was much damped by my finding that general montgomery had the same difficulties to encounter with the troops under your command that i have with these here  no troops were ever better provided or higher     paid yet their backwardness to enlist for another year is amazing it grieves me to see so little of that patriotic spirit which i was taught to believe was characteristic of this people colonol enos who had the command of arnolds rear division is returned with the greater part of his men which must weaken him so much as to render him incapable of making a successful attack on quebec without assistance from general montgomery i hope he will be able to give it him and by taking that city finish his glorious campaign i have nothing material to communicate to you from hence i am making every disposition for defence by throwing up redoubts c along the bay some of which have been constructed under the enemys guns but they have not given us the least disturbance i suppose     mr howe waits the arrival of his reinforcements when probably he will attempt something he sent out about three hundred men women and children last week they give shocking accounts of the want of fuel and fresh provisions  general burgoyne is gone or going home november  0 last evening i received the agreeable account of one of our armed schooners having taken a large brigantine laden with military stores the inventory of which i have the pleasure to enclose  but let not this acquisition prevent your sending what stores you can spare we shall want them all adieu my dear general i wish you a return of your health and am c      george washington   december      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull cambridge   december      sir the reason of my giving you the trouble of this is the late extraordinary and reprehensible conduct of some of the connecticut troops some time ago apprehending that some of them might incline to go home when the time of their enlistment should be up i applied to the officers of the several regiments to know whether it would be agreeable to the men to continue till the  st of january or until a sufficient number of other forces could be raised to supply their place who informed me that they believed the whole     of them would readily stay till that could be effected having discovered last week that they were very uneasy to leave the service and determined upon it i thought it expedient to summon the general officers at headquarters and invited a delegation of the general court to be present  that suitable measures might be adopted for the defence and support of our lines the result was that three thousand of the minutemen and militia of this province and two thousand men from new hampshire should be called in by the  0th instant for that purpose with this determination the connecticut troops were made acquainted and requested and ordered to remain here as the time of most of them would not be out before the  0th when they would be relieved notwithstanding this yesterday morning most of them resolved to leave the camp many went off and though the utmost vigilance and industry were used to apprehend them several got away with their arms and ammunition i have enclosed you a list of the names of some of them in general putnams regiment only who escaped and submit to your judgment whether some example should not be made of these men who have basely deserted the cause of their country at this critical juncture when the enemy are receiving reinforcements  i have the pleasure to inform you that one of our     armed vessels the lee captain manly took and brought in the other day a valuable storeship bound to boston i am c       george washington   december      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   december      sir i had the honor of writing to you on the  0th ult inclosing inventory of the military stores taken on board the brig nancy by capt manly of the armed schooner lee i have now to inform you that he has since sent into beverley a ship named the concord james lowrie master from greenock in scotland bound to boston she has on board dry goods and coals to the value of £  0      sterling shipped by crawford anderson  co and consigned to james anderson merchant in boston it is mentioned in     the letters found on board that this cargo was for the use of the army but on a strict examination i find it is really the property of the shippers and the person to whom consigned pray what is to be done with this ship and cargo and what with the brigantine which brought the military stores it was agreed in the conference last october that all vessels employed merely as transports and unarmed with their crews to be set at liberty upon giving security to return to europe but that this indulgence be not extended longer than till the first of april next in the shippers letter they mention that you must procure a certificate from the general and admiral of the concords being in the government service such as the glasgow packet brought with her which was of great service procured a liberty to arm her which was refused us also gave her a preference for some recruits that went out in her in another part of their letter they say captain lowrie will deliver you the contract for the coals we gave it to him as it perhaps might be of use as a certificate of his ships being employed in the government service every letter on board breathes nothing but enmity to this country and a vast number of them there are  it is some time since i recommended to the congress     that they would institute a court for the trial of prizes made by the continental armed vessels which i hope they have ere now taken into their consideration otherwise i should again take the liberty of urging it in the most pressing manner the scandalous conduct of a great number of the connecticut troops has laid me under the necessity of calling in a body of the militia much sooner than i apprehended there would be an occasion for such a step i was afraid some time ago that they would incline to go home when the time of their enlistment expired i called upon the officers of the several regiments to know whether they could prevail on the men to remain until the  st of january or till a sufficient number of other forces could be raised to supply their place i suppose they were deceived themselves i know they deceived me by assurances that i need be under no apprehension on that score for the men would not leave the lines last friday showed how much they were mistaken as the major part of the troops of that colony were going away with their arms and ammunition we have however by threats persuasions and the activity of the people of the country who sent back many of them that had set out prevailed upon the most part to stay there are about eighty of them missing      i have called in three thousand men from this province and general sullivan who lately returned from the province of new hampshire having informed me that a number of men were there ready at the shortest notice i have demanded two thousand from that province these two bodies i expect will be in by the tenth instant to make up the deficiency of the connecticut men whom i have promised to dismiss on that day as well as the numbers to whom i was obliged to grant furloughs before any would enlist as the same defection is much to be apprehended when the time of the massachusetts bay new hampshire and rhode island forces is expired i beg the attention of congress to this important affair  i am informed that it has been the custom of these provinces in the last war for the legislative power to order every town to provide a certain quota of men   0 for the campaign this or some other mode should be at present adopted as i am satisfied the men cannot be had without this the congress will please to take into their immediate consideration my suspicions on this head i shall also communicate to the governors trumbull and cooke also to the new hampshire convention the number enlisted in the last week is about thirteen hundred men by this you see how slow this important work goes on enclosed is a letter written to me by general putnam recommending colonel babcock  to the brigadiergeneralship now vacant in this army i know nothing of this gentleman but i wish the vacancy was filled as the want of one is attended with very great inconveniences an express is just come in from general schuyler with letters from colonel arnold and general montgomery copies of which i have the honor to enclose upon the whole i think affairs carry a pleasing aspect in that quarter the reduction of quebec is an object of such great importance that i doubt not the congress will give every assistance in their power for the accomplishing it this winter      by the last accounts from the armed schooners sent to the river st lawrence i fear we have but little to expect from them they were falling short of provision and mentioned that they would be obliged to return which at this time is particularly unfortunate as if they chose a proper station all the vessels coming down that river must fall into their hands  the     plague trouble and vexation i have had with the crews of all the armed vessels are inexpressible i do believe there is not on earth a more disorderly set every time they come into port we hear of nothing but mutinous complaints manlys success has lately and but lately quieted his people the crews of the washington and harrison have actually deserted them so that i have been under the necessity of ordering the agent to lay the latter up and get hands for the other on the best terms he could      the house of representatives and the honorable board have sent me a vote of theirs relative to the harbor of cape cod which you have herewith i shall send an officer thither to examine what can be done for its defence though i do not think i shall be able to give them such assistance as may be requisite for i have at present neither men powder nor cannon to spare the great want of powder is what the attention of congress should be particularly applied to i dare not attempt any thing offensive let the temptation or advantage be ever so great as i have not more of that most essential article than will be absolutely necessary to defend our lines should the enemy attempt to attack them by recent information from boston general howe is going to send out a number of the inhabitants in order it is thought to make more room for his expected reinforcements there is one part of the information i can hardly give credit to a sailor says that a number of those coming out have been inoculated with the design of spreading the smallpox through this country and camp i have communicated this to the general court and recommended their attention thereto they are arming one of the transports in boston with which they mean to decoy some of our armed vessels as we are apprized of their design i hope they will be disappointed my best respects wait on the gentlemen in congress and i am sir your most humble c p s i was misinformed when i mentioned that one regiment had arrived at boston a few companies     of the   th and artillery were all that are yet come near  00 persons are landed on point shirley from boston  george washington   december      cambridge governor cooke to governor cooke cambridge   december      sir i have of late met with abundant reason to be convinced of the impracticability of recruiting this army to the new establishment in any reasonable time by voluntary enlistments the causes of such exceeding great lukewarmness i shall not undertake to point out sufficient it is to know that the fact is so many reasons are assigned one only i shall mention and that is that the present soldiery are in expectation of drawing from the landed interest and farmers a bounty equal to the allowance at the commencement of this army and that therefore they play off be this as it may i am satisfied that this is not a time for trifling and that the exigency of our affairs calls aloud for vigorous exertions by sad experience it is found that the connecticut regiments have deserted and are about to desert the noble cause we are engaged in nor have i any reason to believe that the forces of new hampshire this government or rhode island will give stronger proofs of their attachment to it when the period arrives that they may claim their dismission for after every stimulus in my power to throw in their way and near a months close endeavor we have     enlisted — men one thousand five hundred of which are to be absent at a time on furlough until all have gone home in order to visit and provide for their families five thousand militia from this government and the colony of new hampshire are ordered to be at this place by the  0th instant to relieve the connecticut regiments and supply the deficiency which will be occasioned by their departure and of those on furlough  these men i have been told by officers who were eyewitnesses to their behavior are not to be depended on for more than a few days as they soon get tired grow impatient ungovernable and of course leave the service what will be the consequence then if the greatest part of the army is to be composed of such men upon the new establishment twentysix regiments were ordered to be raised besides those of the artillery and riflemen of these new hampshire has three massachusetts sixteen rhode island two and connecticut five a mode of appointing the officers was also recommended     and as strictly adhered to as circumstances would admit of these officers are now recruiting with the success i have mentioned thus sir have i given you a true and impartial state of our situation and submit it to the wisdom of your and the other three new england colonies whether some vigorous measures if the powers of government are adequate ought not to be adopted to facilitate the completion of this army without offering a bounty from the public which congress have declared against thinking the terms exclusive thereof greater than ever soldiers had  i have by this conveyance laid the matter before congress but the critical situation of our affairs will not await their deliberation and recommendation something must be done without further delay i am sir c      george washington   december      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge   december      dear sir your much esteemed favor of the   d ultimo covering colonel arnolds letter with a copy of one to general montgomery and his to you i received yesterday morning it gave me the highest satisfaction to hear of colonel arnolds being at point levi with his men in great spirits after their long fatiguing march attended with almost insuperable difficulties and the discouraging circumstance of being left by near one third of the troops that went on the expedition the merit of this gentleman is certainly great and i heartily wish that fortune may distinguish him as one of her favorites i am convinced that he will do every thing that prudence and valor shall suggest to add to the success of our arms and for reducing quebec to our possession should he not be able to accomplish so desirable a work with the forces he has i flatter myself that it will be effected when general montgomery joins him and our conquest of canada be complete i am exceeding sorry to find you so much plagued and embarrassed by the disregard of discipline confusion and want of order among the troops as to have occasioned you to mention to congress an inclination to retire i know that your complaints are too well founded but i would willingly hope that nothing will induce you to quit the service and that in time order and subordination will take place of confusion and command be rendered more agreeable     i have met with difficulties of the same sort and such as i never expected but they must be borne with the cause we are engaged in is so just and righteous that we must try to rise superior to every obstacle in its support and therefore i beg that you will not think of resigning unless you have carried your application to congress too far to recede i am dear sir with great esteem and regard yours c  george washington   december      cambridge benedict arnold to colonel benedict arnold cambridge   december      dear sir your letter of the  th ultimo with a postcript of the   th from point levi i have had the pleasure to receive it is not in the power of any man to command success but you have done more you have deserved it  and before this i hope you will have met with the laurels which are due to your toils in the possession of quebec my thanks are due and sincerely offered to you for your enterprising and persevering spirit to your brave followers i likewise     present them i was not unmindful of you or them in the establishment of a new army one out of twentysix regiments lately general putnams you are appointed to the command of and i have ordered all the officers with you to the one or the other of these regiments in the rank they now bear that in case they choose to continue in service and no appointments take place where they now are no disappointment may follow nothing very material has happened in this camp since you left it finding we were not likely to do much in the land way i fitted out several privateers or rather armed vessels in behalf of the continent with which we have taken several prizes to the amount it is supposed of fifteen thousand pounds sterling one of them a valuable storeship but no powder in it containing a fine brass mortar thirteeninch two thousand stand of arms shot c c i have no doubt but a juncture of your detachment with the army under general montgomery is effected before this if so you will put yourself under his command and will i am persuaded give him all the assistance in your power to finish the glorious work you have begun that the almighty may preserve and prosper you in it is the sincere and fervent prayer of dear sir c p s you could not be more surprised than i was at enoss return with the division under his command i immediately put him under arrest and had him tried for quitting the detachment without   0 your orders he is acquitted on the score of provisions  george washington    december      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    december      sir captain manly of the lee armed schooner has taken and sent into beverly two prizes since i wrote you last which was the  th instant one of them is the ship jenny captain forster who left london     late in october he has very unfortunately thrown all his papers overboard and is not yet arrived at camp if he does before i close this i will let you know what information i get from him his vessel is loaded with coal and porter of the latter he has about one hundred butts the other is a brigantine from antigua called the little hannah robert adams master her cargo consists of one hundred and thirtynine hogsheads of rum one hundred cases of geneva and some other trifling articles  both cargoes were for the army and navy at boston i have great pleasure in congratulating you on this business the numbers enlisted last week are men if they go on at this slow rate it will be a long time before this army is complete i have wrote to the governors of connecticut and rhode island also to the convention of new hampshire on this subject a copy of my letter to them i have the honor to enclose herewith a letter to the same purport i sent to the legislature of this province the militia are coming in fast i am much pleased with the alacrity which the good people of this province as well as those of new hampshire have shown upon this occasion i expect the whole will be in this day and tomorrow when what remains of     the connecticut gentry who have not enlisted will have liberty to go to their firesides the commissary general is still by his indisposition detained from camp he committed an error when making out the ration list for he was then serving out and has continued so to do six ounces pr man pr week of butter tho it is not included in the list approved of by congress i do not think it would be expedient to put a stop thereto as everything that would have a tendency to give the soldiery room for complaint must be avoided the information i received that the enemy intended spreading the smallpox amongst us i could not suppose them capable of i now must give some credit to it as it has made its appearance on several of those who last came out of boston every necessary precaution has been taken to prevent its being communicated to this army and the general court will take care that it does not spread through the country i have not heard that any more troops are arrived at boston which is a lucky circumstance as the connecticut troops i now find are for the most part gone off  the houses in boston are lessening every     day they are pulled down either for firewood or to prevent the effects of fire should we attempt a bombardment or an attack upon the town cobble hill is strongly fortified without any interruption from the enemy  colonel enos has been tried and acquitted upon what principle you will see by the process of his trial which i now send you as the time of colonel enoss engagement was near expired a doubt arose whether he could then be tried by a courtmartial this it was which occasioned his trial to come on before colonel arnolds evidence could be had  this is what at present occurs from sir c p s the weekly returns of inlistment not being     yet received for more than ten regiments amounting to     men i cannot fill up the blank in this letter but this added to the former makes in the whole      george washington    december      cambridge to the president of congress  cambridge    december      sir i received your favor of the  d instant with the several resolves of congress therein enclosed the resolves relative to captures made by continental armed vessels only want a court established for trial to make them complete this i hope will be soon done as i have taken the liberty to urge it often to the congress i am somewhat at a loss to know whether i am to raise the two battalions of marines here or not as the delay can be attended with but little inconvenience i will wait a further explanation from congress before i take any further steps thereon i am much pleased that the money will be forwarded with all possible expedition as it is much wanting also that connolly and his associates are taken it has been a very fortunate discovery i make no doubt but that congress will take every necessary measure to dispossess lord dunmore of his hold in virginia     the sooner steps are taken for that purpose the more probability there will be of their being effectual  mr william aspinwall and mr lemuel hayward were appointed surgeons at roxbury in the first formation of the army they were confirmed by doctor church who promised them to write to the congress in their behalf they applied to me during his confinement here at a time that i had notice of doctor morgans appointment i referred them to his arrival and inclosed you have his sentiments relative to them also of doctor rand surgeon to the smallpox hospital and his mate i have to remark to you that when we had some time past got the better of the smallpox doctor rand applied to me for a continuance of him in that department which from a principle of not multiplying offices i declined he is at present wanting and says that by only attending occasionally he loses his country practice of course his livelihood you will please to lay these matters before congress for their consideration i was happy enough to anticipate the desire of congress respecting mr croft and mr trot they both declined the latter did not choose to serve the formers ambition was not fully gratified by the offer made to him of a majority and higher rank must have turned out col burbeck or major mason     who had served in those characters in that regiment to acceptation i hope colonel knox will soon finish the business he is upon and appear here to take the honorable command conferred on him by congress  i will make application to general howe and propose an exchange for ethan allen i am much afraid i shall have a like proposal to make for captain martindale and his men of the armed brigantine washington which it is reported was taken a few days past by a manofwar and carried into boston we cannot expect to be always successful you will doubtless hear of the barbarity of captain wallace on connanicut island ere this reaches your hands  about a hundred and fifty more of the poor inhabitants are come out of boston the smallpox rages all over the town such of the military as had it not before are now under inoculation this i apprehend is a weapon of defence they are using against us what confirms me in this opinion is that i have information that they are tearing up the pavement to be provided against a bombardment i wrote to you this day by messrs penet and de pliarne who will lay before the congress or a committee thereof proposals for furnishing the continent with arms and ammunition i refer you to themselves for further particulars  i have the honor to be c     george washington    december      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    december      dear sir since my last i have had the pleasure of receiving your favors of the   th ultimo and the  d instant i must again express my gratitude for the attention shown mrs washington at philadelphia it cannot but be pleasing although it did in some measure impede the progress of her journey on the road  i     am much obliged to you for the hints contained in both of the above letters respecting the jealousies which you say are gone abroad  i have studiously avoided in all letters intended for the public eye i mean for that of the congress every expression that could give pain or uneasiness and i shall observe the same rule with respect to private letters further than appears absolutely necessary for the elucidation of facts i cannot charge myself with incivility or     what in my opinion is tantamount ceremonious civility to the gentlemen of this colony but if such my conduct appears i will endeavor at a reformation as i can assure you my dear reed that i wish to walk in such a line as will give most general satisfaction you know that it was my wish at first to invite a certain number of gentlemen of this colony every day to dinner but unintentionally i believe by anybody we some how or other missed it if this   0 has given rise to the jealousy i can only say that i am sorry for it at the same time i add that it was rather owing to inattention or more properly too much attention to other matters which caused me to neglect it the extracts of letters from this camp which so frequently appear in the pennsylvania papers are not only written without my knowledge but without my approbation as i have always thought they must have a disagreeable tendency but there is no restraining mens tongues or pens when charged with a little vanity as in the accounts given of or rather by the riflemen with respect to what you have said of yourself and your situation to what i have before said on this subject i can only add that whilst you leave the door open to my expectation of your return i shall not think of supplying your place if ultimately you resolve against coming i should be glad to know it as soon as you have determined upon it the congress have resolved well in respect to the pay of and advance to the men but if they cannot get the moneysigners to despatch their business it is of very little avail for we have not at this time money enough in camp to answer the commissarys and quartermasters accounts much more to pay the troops strange conduct this the account which you have given of the sentiments of the people respecting my conduct is extremely flattering pray god that i may continue to deserve them in the perplexed and intricate situation i stand in our enlistment goes on slowly by the returns last monday only five thousand nine     hundred and seventeen men are engaged for the ensuing campaign and yet we are told that we shall get the number wanted as they are only playing off to see what advantages are to be made and whether a bounty cannot be extorted from the public at large or individuals in case of a draft time only can discover this i doubt the measure exceedingly the fortunate capture of the storeship has supplied us with flints and many other articles we stood in need of but we still have our wants we are securing our approach to letchmores point unable upon any principle whatever to account for their silence unless it be to lull us into a fatal security to favor some attempt they may have in view about the time of the great change they expect will take place the last of this month if this be the drift they deceive themselves for if possible it has increased my vigilance and induced me to fortify all the avenues to our camps to guard against any approaches upon the ice if the virginians are wise that archtraitor to the rights of humanity lord dunmore should be instantly crushed if it takes the force of the whole colony to do it otherwise like a snow ball in rolling his army will get size some through fear some through promises and some from inclination joining his standard but that which renders the measure indispensably necessary is the negroes for if he gets formidable numbers will be tempted to join who will be afraid to do it without  i am exceeding happy to find that that villain connolly is seized i hope if there is any     thing to convict him that he will meet with the punishment due to his demerit and treachery we impatiently wait for accounts from arnold would to god we may hear he is in quebec and that all canada is in our possession my best respects to mrs reed i am c p s the smallpox is in every part of boston the soldiers there who have never had it are we are told under innoculation and considered as a security against any attempt of ours a third shipload of people is come out to point shirley if we escape the smallpox in this camp and the country around about it will be miraculous every precaution that can be is taken to guard against this evil both by the general court and myself george washington    december      cambridge general howe to his excellency general howe camp at cambridge    december      sir we have just been informed of a circumstance which were it not so well authenticated i should scarcely think credible it is that colonel allen     who with his small party was defeated and taken prisoner near montreal has been treated without regard to decency humanity or the rules of war that he has been thrown into irons and suffers all the hardships inflicted upon common felons i think it my duty sir to demand and do expect from you an eclaircissement on this subject at the same time i flatter myself from the character which mr howe bears as a man of honor gentleman and soldier that my demand will meet with his approbation i must take the liberty also of informing you that i shall consider your silence as a confirmation of the report and further assuring you that whatever treatment colonel allen receives whatever fate he undergoes such exactly shall be the treatment and fate of brigadier prescott now in our hands  the law of retaliation is not only justifiable in the eyes of god and man but absolutely a duty which in our present circumstances we owe to our relations friends and fellowcitizens permit me to add sir that we have all here the highest regard and reverence for your great personal qualities and attainments and that the americans in general esteem it as not the least of their misfortunes     that the name of howe a name so dear to them  should appear at the head of the catalogue of the instruments employed by a wicked ministry for their destruction with due respect i have the honor to be sir your most obedient humble servant  p s if an exchange of prisoners taken on each side in this unnatural contest is agreeable to general howe he will please to signify as much to his most obedient c      george washington    december      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    december      sir captain manly of the lee armed schooner took and sent into beverly the sloop betsey a atkinson master she is an armed vessel despatched by lord dunmore with indian corn potatoes and oats for the army in boston the packets of letters found on board i have the honor to send you with this by captain james chambers they being of so much importance that i do not think it would be prudent to trust them by a common express as lord dunmores schemes are fully laid open in these letters i need not point out to the congress the necessity there is of a vigorous exertion being adopted by them to dispossess his lordship of the stronghold he has got in virginia i do not mean to dictate but i am     sure they will pardon me for giving them freely my opinion which is that the fate of america a good deal depends on his being obliged to evacuate norfolk this winter or not i have kirkland  well secured and think i will send him to you for examination by most of the letters relative to him he is a dangerous fellow john steuarts letters and papers are of a very interesting nature governor tonyns and many other letters from st augustine show the weakness of the place at the same time of what vast consequence it would be for us to possess ourselves of it and the great quantity of ammunition contained in the fort  indeed these papers are of so great consequence that i think this but little inferior to any prize our famous manly has taken we now work at our ease on lechmeres hill on discovering our party there yesterday morning the ship which lay opposite began a cannonade to which     mount horam  added some shells one of our men was wounded we fired a few shot from two eighteen pounders which are placed on cobble hill and soon obliged the ship to shift her station she now lies in the ferryway and except a few shells from the mount in boston which do no execution we have no interruption in prosecuting our works which will in a very short time be completed when that is done when we have powder to sport with i think if the congress resolves on the execution of the proposal made relative to the town of boston that it can be done i have sent a letter this day to general howe of which a copy goes herewith my reason for pointing out brigadiergeneral prescott as the object who is to suffer mr allens fate is that by letters from general schuyler and copies of letters from general montgomery to schuyler i am given to understand that prescott is the cause of allens sufferings i thought it best to be decisive on the occasion as did the generals whom i consulted thereon the returns of men enlisted since my last amount to about eighteen hundred making in the whole seven thousand one hundred and forty the militia that are come in both from this province and new hampshire are very finelooking men and go through their duty with great alacrity the despatch made both by the people in marching and by the legislative powers in complying with my requisition has given me infinite satisfaction your letter of the  th     instant with the explanatory resolve respecting my calling forth the militia and minutemen is come to hand to which i shall pay all due attention you have removed all the difficulties which i labored under about the two battalions of marines i shall obey the orders of congress in looking out for proper officers to command that corps  i make no doubt but when the money arrives to pay off the arrears and the months advance that it will be a great encouragement for the men to enlist enclosed is a letter i lately received from mr james lovell his case is truly pitiable i wish some mode could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel situation he is now in i am sensible of the impropriety of exchanging a soldier for a citizen but there is something so cruelly distressing in regard to this gentleman that i dare say you will take it under your consideration  i am with great respect c  george washington    december      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge    december      dear sir your favors the first of the   th ultimo and the two last of the  th instant with their enclosures i received     i am happy to hear of your being better and heartily wish that you may soon be perfectly recovered from your indisposition i should have been very glad if mr carleton had not made his escape i trust ere long he will be in our hands as i think we shall get possession of quebec  from whence he will not easily get away i am much concerned for mr allen and that he should be treated with such severity i beg that you will have the matter and manner of his treatment strictly inquired into and transmit me an account of the same and whether general prescott was active and instrumental in occasioning it from your letter and general montgomerys to you i am led to think he was if so he is deserving of your particular notice and should experience some marks of our resentment for his cruelty to this gentleman and his violation of the rights of humanity as some of the prisoners had attempted to escape i doubt not of your giving the necessary orders that they may be prevented it is a matter that should be attended to in a letter from the reverend dr wheelock of dartmouth college of the  d instant i had the following intelligence— that the day before two soldiers returning from montreal informed him that our officers were assured by a frenchman a captain of the artillery whom they had taken captive that major   0 rogers was second in command under general carleton and that he had been in indian habit through our encampment at st johns had given a plan of them to the general and supposed that he made his escape with the indians which were at st johns you will be pleased to have this report examined into and acquaint me as to the authenticity or probability of the truth of it if any circumstances can be discovered to induce a belief that he was there he should be apprehended he is now in this government      the congress have sent me several accounts against the rifle companies one of which is against captain morgan which i enclose to you and desire it may be transmitted to colonel arnold who will have proper steps taken for the payment of it as captain morgan is with him i flatter myself that your next favor will give me an account of general montgomerys joining col arnold and that quebec is or soon will be reduced to our possession should our arms be crowned with such success to me it appears that administration will     be much embarrassed and stand in a very disagreeable predicament i am c  george washington    december      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge    december      dear sir your favor of the   th instant came yesterday to hand with copies and extracts of your late letters to congress i have with great attention perused them i am very sorry to find by several paragraphs that     both you and general montgomery incline to quit the service let me ask you sir when is the time for brave men to exert themselves in the cause of liberty and their country if this is not should any difficulties that they may have to encounter at this important crisis deter them god knows there is not a difficulty that you both very justly complain of which i have not in an eminent degree experienced that i am not every day experiencing but we must bear up against them and make the best of mankind as they are since we cannot have them as we wish let me therefore conjure you and mr montgomery to lay aside such thoughts—thoughts injurious to yourselves and excessively so to your country which calls aloud for gentlemen of your abilities you mention in your letter to congress of the  0th ultimo that the clothing was to remain at albany as general montgomery would provide the troops in canada i wish they could be spared for this army for we cannot get clothing for half of our troops  let me hear from you on this subject as soon as possible the proofs you have of the ministrys intention to     engage the savages against us are incontrovertible  we have other confirmations of it by several despatches from john stuart the superintendent for the southern district which luckily fell into my hands being found on board a sloop sent by lord dunmore bound to boston she was taken by one of our armed vessels these with many letters of consequence from his lordship i have lately sent to the congress i hope soon to hear that colonel knox has made good progress in forwarding the artillery it is much wanted for the works we have lately thrown up i have written a letter of the   th instant to general howe respecting mr allen of which and the answer you have copies enclosed i am with great regard sir yours c george washington    december      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    december      sir i had the honor to address myself to you on the   th instant since which i have received undoubted information that the genuine instructions given to     connolly have not reached your hands that they are very artfully concealed in the tree of his saddle and covered with canvass so nicely that they are scarcely discernible that those which were found upon him were intended to deceive if he was caught you will most certainly have his saddle taken to pieces in order to discover this deeplaid plot  enclosed is a copy of general howes letter in an swer to the one i wrote to him on the   th instant the conduct i am to observe towards brigadier prescott in consequence of these letters the congress will oblige me by determining for me the gentlemen by whom you sent the money are arrived the sum they brought though large is not sufficient to answer the demands of the army which at this time are remarkably heavy there is three months pay due one months advance two dollars for each blanket the arms which are left by those who are dismissed to be paid for besides the demands on the commissary and quartermastergenerals you will therefore see the necessity of another remittance which i beg may be as soon as you conveniently can  i will take the opportunity of the return of     these gentlemen to send colonel kirkland to you for examination and that you may dispose of him as to you may seem proper a committee from the general court of this province called on me the other day informing me that they were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the colony that if what belonged to them now in use here was kept for the continent they will be under the necessity of providing themselves with other of course what is kept must be paid for there are many of the cannon of very little use such of them as are good i cannot at present part with perhaps when i receive the supply from new york and canada it may be in my power     to spare them mr wadsworth  has sent in his report respecting cape cod harbor a copy of which you will receive herewith also a letter from a mr jacob bayley put into my hands by colonel little it contains some things that may not be unworthy the consideration of congress we have made good progress in the works on lechmeres point they would have been finished ere this but for the severity of the weather which prevents our people from working i received a letter from governor cooke which expresses the fears of the people of rhode island lest the ships which we had information were sailed with some troops on board were destined for newport i sent majorgeneral lee there to point out to them such defence as he may think the place capable of i sincerely wish he may be able to do it with effect as that place in its present state is an asylum for such as are disaffected to american liberty  our returns of enlistments to this day amount to eight thousand five hundred men i have the honor to be c      george washington    december      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    december      dear sir since my last your favors of the  th and   th are come to hand as also the  th the first last night the second by wednesdays post for the several pieces of information therein contained i thank you nothing new has happened in this quarter since my last except the setting in of a severe spell of cold weather and a considerable fall of snow which together have interrupted our work on lechmeres point which otherwise would have been compleated before this at first we only intended a bomb battery there but afterwards constructed two redoubts in one of which a mortar will be placed at a proper season a line of communication extends from the point of wood this side the causey leading on to lechmeres point quite up to the redoubt from boston and bunkers hill both we have received without injury except from the first case shot an irregular fire from cannon and mortars ever since the   th but have returned none except upon the ship which we soon obliged to move off at the same time that i thank you for stopping visitors in search of preferment it will give me pleasure to show civilities to others of your recommendation indeed no gentleman that is not well known ought to come here without letters of introduction as it puts me in an awkward situation with respect to my conduct towards them i do not well understand a paragraph in your     letter which seems to be taken from mine to colonel hancock expressive of the unwillingness of the connecticut troops to be deemed continental if you did not misconceive what col hancock read he read what i never wrote as there is no expression in any of my letters that i can either recollect or find that has a tendency that way further than their unwillingness to have officers of other governments mixed in their corps in which they are not singular as the same partiality runs through the whole i have in some measure anticipated the desires of the connecticut delegates by a kind of representation to each of the new england governments of the impracticability in my eye of raising our complement of men by voluntary enlistments and submitting it to their consideration whether if the powers of government are sufficiently coercive each town should not be called upon for a proportionate number of recruits what they will do in the matter remains to be known the militia which have supplied the places of the connecticut regiments behave much better than i expected under our want of wood barracks for they are not yet done and blankets c with these and such men as are reënlisted i shall hope if they will be vigilant and spirited to give the enemy a warm reception if they think proper to come out our want of powder is inconceivable a daily waste and no supply administers a gloomy prospect i fear the destination of the vessels from your port is so generally known as to defeat the end two menofwar forty guns it is said put into new york  00 the other day and were instantly ordered out supposed to be for virginia i am so much indebted for the civilities shown to mrs washington on her journey hither that i hardly know how to go about to acknowledge them some of the enclosed all of which i beg the favor of you to put into the postoffice are directed to that end and i shall be obliged to you for presenting my thanks to the commanding officers of the two battalions of philadelphia for the honors done to her and me as also to any others equally entitled i very sincerely offer you the compliments of the season and wish you and mrs reed and your fireside the happy return of a great many of them being dear sir yours c george washington    december      cambridge richard henry lee to richard henry lee cambridge    december      dear sir your favor of the  th instant did not reach this place till saturday afternoon the money which accompanied it came seasonably but not as it was so long delayed quantum sufficit our demands at this time being peculiarly great for pay and advance to the troops pay for their arms and blanketing independent of the demands of the commissary and quartermaster general lord dunmores letters to general howe which very fortunately fell into my hands and were enclosed by me to congress will let you pretty fully into his diabolical schemes if my dear sir that man is not  0  crushed before spring he will become the most formidable enemy america has his strength will increase as a snow ball by rolling and faster if some expedient cannot be hit upon to convince the slaves and servants of the impotency of his designs you will see by his letters what pains he is taking to invite a reinforcement at all events there and to transplant the war to the southern colonies i do not think that forcing his lordship on shipboard is sufficient nothing less than depriving him of life or liberty will secure peace to virginia as motives of resentment actuate his conduct to a degree equal to the total destruction of the colony i fear the destination of the naval armament at philadelphia is too well known to answer the design i have heard it spoken of in common conversation at this place near a fortnight ago and the other day was told that two menofwar going into the harbor of new york supposed to be those for the relief of the asia were ordered and accordingly sailed immediately out as it is imagined for virginia my letters to congress will give you the occurrences of this place i need not repeat them but i must beg of you my good sir to use your influence in having a court of admiralty or some power appointed to hear and determine all matters relative to captures you cannot conceive how i am plagued on this head and how impossible it is for me to hear and determine upon matters of this sort when the facts perhaps are only to be ascertained at ports forty fifty or more miles distant without bringing the parties  0  here at great trouble and expense at any rate my time will not allow me to be a competent judge of this business i must also beg the favor of you to urge the necessity of appointing a brigadiergeneral to the vacant brigade in this army the inconvenience we daily experience for want of one is very great much more than the want of a colonel to a regiment for then the next officer in command does the duty in a brigade this may not with propriety happen and seldom or never is done with any kind of regularity perfectly indifferent is it to me whom the congress shall please to appoint to these offices i only want it done that business may go regularly on my best respects to the good family you are in and to your brothers of the delegation and be assured that i am dear sir your most obedient and affectionate servant   0  george washington    december      cambridge to the general court of massachusetts cambridge    december      gentlemen having never considered the four independent companies which have been doing duty at braintree weymouth and hingham in the same point of view as the rest of the army although some orders may have gone to or for them through the hurry of business nor included them in my returns to congress according to the brigade majors report from roxbury i do not think myself authorized to direct pay for them without first laying the matter before congress which i shall do by inclosing an exact transcript of your representation of the case with this single remark that is they were not regimented  0  and were doing duty at some distance from these camps i did not know whether to consider them as part of the continental army and therefore had not ordered them payment heretofore  with respect to the other requisition contained in your resolve of the  0 i do not think myself at liberty to extend the guards of this camp beyond squantum and chelsea both fit places for observation—this was my sentiment of the matter when the committee did me the honor to call yesterday but as it appeared to be of some importance to this government i did not care to determine upon it without asking the opinion of some of the principal officers in this army whose sentiments i am happy to find coincide with my own this might be assigned as one among other reasons to shew that i did not consider these four companies as part of the continental troops that there were times in the course of the past summer when i should not have suffered them to have remained  0  at the places they were posted if i had conceived myself vested with power to have withdrawn them i would not have it inferred from hence that i do not think it my duty and with the greatest chearfulness shall undertake to march troops if these lines are not to be exposed by it to any place in this or the neighbouring governments to oppose an invasion but whilst the body of the ministerial troops continue in boston and the circumstances of this army remain as they are it must be my first object to guard these lines i am c  george washington    december      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    december      sir i wrote to you on the   th instant since which i am not honored with any of your favors the estimate i then enclosed to you was calculated to pay the troops up to the first of january that cannot be done for want of funds in the paymastergenerals hands which causes a great murmuring amongst those who are going off the monthly expenses of this army amount to near two hundred and seventyfive  0  thousand dollars which i take the liberty of recommending to the observation of congress that their future remittances may be governed thereby it sometimes happens that persons would wish to deposit money in the hands of the paymastergeneral for his bills on the treasury at philadelphia he has hitherto declined such offers not having authority from congress to draw would it not be proper to give this power if it should be approved of you will please to point out the mode that the congress would chuse to have it done in  the clothing sent to the quartermastergeneral is not sufficient to put half our army into regimentals nor is there a possibility of getting any quantity here i have wrote to genl schuyler that i wish what was lodged at albany could be spared for these troops as general montgomery would clothe the men under his command at montreal if this can be done it will be of infinite service and no time should be lost in forwarding them to this camp in forming the regiments for the new establishment i thought it but justice to appoint the officers detached under colonel arnold to commissions in them their absence at present is of very great detriment to the service especially in recruiting i would therefore wish if the congress intends raising troops in or for canada that they could be taken in there the sooner i have their opinion of this matter the better that if they can be commissioned in canada i may appoint officers here to replace them  0  enclosed you have a copy of a representation sent to me by the legislative body of this province respecting four companies stationed at braintree weymouth and hingham as they were never regimented and were doing duty at a distance from the rest of the army i did not know whether to consider them as a part of it nor do i think myself authorized to direct payment for them without the approbation of congress it has been represented to me that the free negroes who have served in this army are very much dissatisfied at being discarded as it is to be apprehended that they may seek employ in the ministerial army i have presumed to depart from the resolution respecting them and have given license for their being enlisted if this is disapproved of by congress i will put a stop to it   0  i believe colonel gridley expects to be continued as chief engineer in this army it is very certain that we have no one here better qualified he has done very little hitherto in that department but if the congress choose to appoint him i will take care that he pays a proper attention to it before i quit this subject i must remark that the pay of the assistant engineers is so very small that we cannot expect men of science will engage in it those gentlemen who are in that station remained under the expectation that an allowance would be made them by the respective provinces in which they were appointed additional to that allowed by the congress  captain freeman arrived this day at camp from canada he left quebec the   th ultimo in consequence of general carletons proclamation which i have the honor to send you herewith he saw colonel arnold the   th and says that he was joined at point aux trembles by general montgomery the  st instant that they were about two thousand strong and were making every preparation for attacking  0  quebec that general carleton had with him about twelve hundred men the majority of whom are sailors that it was his opinion the french would give up the place if they get the same conditions that were granted to the inhabitants of montreal captain adams of the warren armed schooner sent into marblehead the sloop sally bound from lisbon to new york with   pipes and     quarter casks of rum this sloop was made a prize of by the niger man of war somewhere near bermudas the captain of whom put his mate and his hands on board with orders to proceed with her to boston the sloop and cargo belong to mr peter barberie of perth amboy in new jersey captains semple and harbeson take under their care mr kirkland who appears to be a much more illiterate and simple man than his strong recommendations bespoke him captain mathis and mr robinson will accompany them the two latter were taken prisoners by lord dunmore  who was sending them to boston from whence there is little doubt but that they would be forwarded to england to which place i am credibly informed captain martindale and the crew of the washington are sent also colonel allen and the prisoners taken with him in canada this may account for general howes silence on the   0 subject of an exchange of prisoners mentioned in my letter to him general lee is just returned from his excursion to rhode island he has pointed out the best method the island would admit of for its defence he has endeavored all in his power to make friends of those that were our enemies you have enclosed a specimen of his abilities in that way for your perusal i am of opinion that if the same plan was pursued through every province it would have a very good effect  i have long had it on my mind to mention to congress that frequent applications had been made to me respecting the chaplains pay which is too small to encourage men of abilities some of them who have left their flocks are obliged to pay the parson acting for them more than they receive i need not point out the great utility of gentlemen whose lives and conversation are unexceptionable being employed for that service in the army there are two ways of making it worth the attention of such one is an advancement of their pay the other that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments this last i think may be done without inconvenience  i beg leave to recommend this matter to congress whose sentiments hereon i shall impatiently expect upon a farther conversation with captain freeman     he is of opinion that general montgomery has with him near three thousand men including colonel arnolds he says that lord pitt had received repeated orders from his father to return home in consequence of which he had embarked some time in october with a captain green who was master of a vessel belonging to philadelphia by a number of salutes in boston harbor yesterday i fancy admiral shuldham is arrived two large ships were seen coming in our enlistments now amount to nine thousand six hundred and fifty those gentlemen who were made prisoners by lord dunmore being left destitute of money and necessaries i have advanced them a hundred pounds lawful money belonging to the public for which i have taken captain matthewss draft on the treasury of virginia which goes enclosed i have the honor to be c           george washington   january      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   january      sir since my last of the   st ultimo i have been honored with your favor of the   d enclosing sundry resolves which shall in matters they respect be made the rule of my conduct the resolution relative to the troops in boston i beg the favor of you sir to assure congress shall be attempted to be put in execution the first moment i see a probability of success and in such a way as a council of officers shall think most likely to produce it but if this     should not happen as soon as you may expect or my wishes prompt to i request that congress will be pleased to advert to my situation and do me the justice to believe that circumstances and no want of inclination are the cause of delay it is not in the pages of history perhaps to furnish a case like ours to maintain a post within musketshot of the enemy for six months together without   and at the same time to disband one army and recruit another within that distance of twentyodd british regiments is more probably than ever was attempted but if we succeed as well in the     last as we have heretofore in the first i shall think it the most fortunate event of my whole life by a very intelligent gentleman a mr hutchinson from boston i learn that it was admiral shuldham that came into the harbor on saturday last that two of the five regiments from cork are arrived at halifax two others have sailed for quebec but what was become of them could not be told and the other the fiftyfifth has just got into boston certain it is also that the greater part of the seventeen regiments is arrived there whether we are to conclude from hence that more than five regiments have been sent out or that the companies of the seventeen arrived at boston are part of the regiments destined for halifax and quebec i know not we also learn from this gentleman and others that the troops embarked for halifax as mentioned in my letter of the   th were really designed for that place but recalled from nantasket road upon advice being received of the above regiments there i am also informed of a fleet now getting ready under the convoy of the scarborough and fowey menofwar consisting of five transports and two bombvessels with about three hundred marines and several flatbottomed boats it is whispered that they are designed for newport but generally thought in boston that they are meant for long island and it is probable they will be followed by more troops as the other transports are taking in water to lie as others say in nantasket road to be out of the ice a large quantity of biscuit is also baking     as the real design cannot with certainty be known i submit it with all due deference to the superior judgment of congress whether it would not be consistent with prudence to have some of the jersey troops thrown into new york to prevent an evil which would be almost irremediable should it happen i mean the landing of troops at that place or upon long island near it  as it is possible you may not     yet have received his majestys most gracious speech i do myself the honor to enclose one of many which were sent out of boston yesterday it is full of rancor and resentment against us and explicitly holds forth his royal will to be that vigorous measures must be pursued to deprive us of our constitutional rights and liberties these measures whatever they be i hope will be opposed by more vigorous ones and rendered unavailing and fruitless though sanctioned and authorized by the name of majesty a name which ought to promote the happiness of his people and not their oppression  i am sir c george washington   january      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge   january      dear sir since my last i have received your obliging favours of the   th and   d ulto and thank you for the articles of intelligence therein contained as i also do for the buttons which accompanied the last letter although i had got a set better i think made at concord i am exceeding glad to find that things wear a better face in virginia than they did some time ago but i do not think that any thing less than the life or liberty will free the colony from the effects of lord dunmores resentments and villainies     we are at length favored with a sight of his majestys most gracious speech breathing sentiments of tenderness and compassion for his deluded american subjects the echo is not yet come to hand but we know what it must be and as lord north said and we ought to have believed and acted accordingly we now know the ultimatum of british justice the speech i send you a volume of them was sent out by the boston gentry and farcical enough we gave great joy to them the red coats i mean without knowing or intending it for on that day the day which gave being to the new army but before the proclamation came to hand we had hoisted the union flag in compliment to the united colonies  but behold it was received in boston as a token of the deep impression the speech had made upon us and as a signal of submission so we learn by a person out of boston last night by this time i presume they begin to think it strange that we have not made a formal surrender of our lines admiral shuldham is arrived at boston the   th and the greatest part if not all of the   th regiment are also got in there the rest of the   regiments from ireland were     intended for halifax and quebec those for the first have arrived there the others we know not where they are got to it is easier to conceive than to describe the situation of my mind for some time past and my feelings under our present circumstances search the vast volumes of history through and i much question whether a case similar to ours is to be found to wit to maintain a post against the flower of the british troops for six months together without — and at the end of them to have one army disbanded and another to raise within the same distance of a reinforced enemy it is too much to attempt what may be the final issue of the last manœuvre time only can tell i wish this month was well over our heads the same desire of retiring into a chimneycorner seized the troops of new hampshire rhode island and massachusetts so soon as their time expired as had worked upon those of connecticut notwithstanding many of them made a tender of their services to continue till the lines could be sufficiently strengthened we are now left with a good deal less than half raised regiments and about five thousand militia who only stand ingaged to the middle of this month when according to custom they will depart let the necessity of their stay be never so urgent thus it is that for more than two months past i have scarcely immerged from one difficulty before i have been plunged into another how it will end god in his great goodness will direct i am thankful for his protection to this time we are told that we     shall soon get the army completed but i have been told so many things which have never come to pass that i distrust every thing i fear your fleet has been so long in fitting and the destination of it so well known that the end will be defeated if the vessels escape  how is the arrival of french troops in the west indies and the hostile appearance there to be reconciled with that part of the kings speech wherein he assures parliament that as well from the assurances i have received as from the general appearance of affairs in europe i see no probability that the measures which you may adopt will be interrupted by disputes with any foreign power i hope the congress will not think of adjourning at so important and critical a juncture as this i wish they would keep a watchful eye to new york from captain sears account now here much is to be apprehended from that quarter a fleet is now fitting out at boston consisting of five transports and two bombvessels under convoy of the scarborough and fowey menofwar three   0 hundred some say others more troops are on board with flatbottomed boats it is whispered as if designedly that they are intended for newport but it is generally believed that they are bound either to long island or virginia the other transports are taking in water and a good deal of bisquet is baking some say for the shipping to lay in nantasket road to be out of the way of ice whilst others think a more important move is in agitation all however is conjecture i heartily wish you mrs reed and family the compliments of the season in which the ladies here and family join  george washington   january      cambridge governor cooke to governor cooke cambridge   january      sir i received your favor of the  st instant and return you my thanks for the blankets and your promise of     having more procured as they are much wanted i did not see mr hale who brought them nor the account or the money should have been transmitted to you by his return you will be pleased to draw on the quartermastergeneral and it shall be immediately paid i have seen general lee since his expedition and hope rhode island will derive some advantage from it i am told that captain wallaces ships have been supplied for some time by the town of newport on certain conditions stipulated between him and the committee when this truce first obtained perhaps it was right then there might have been hopes of an accommodation taking place but now when every prospect of it seems to be cut off by his majestys late speech when the throne from which we had supplicated redress breathes forth vengeance and indignation and a firm determination to remain unalterable in its purposes and to prosecute the system and plan of ruin formed by the ministry against us should not an end be put to it and every possible method be fallen upon to prevent their getting necessaries of any kind we need not expect to conquer our enemies by good offices and i know not what pernicious consequences may result from a precedent of this sort other places circumstanced as newport is may follow the example and by that means their whole fleet and army will be furnished with what it highly concerns us to keep from them      i received a letter from governor trumbull of the  st instant by which i am informed that the connecticut assembly are very unanimous in the common cause and among others have passed an act for raising and equipping a fourth of their militia to be immediately selected by voluntary enlistments with such other able effective men as are not included in their militia rolls who incline to enlist to act as minutemen for their own or the defence of any of the united colonies and this under proper encouragements—another act for restraining and punishing persons inimical to us and directing proceedings therein—no person to supply the ministerial army or     navy to give them intelligence to enlist or procure others to enlist in their service to pilot their vessels or in any way assist them under pain of forfeiting his estate and an imprisonment not exceeding three years—none to write speak or act against the proceedings of congress or their acts of assembly under penalty of being disarmed and disqualified from holding any office and be further punished by imprisonment c—for seizing and confiscating for the use of the colony the estates of those putting or continuing to shelter themselves under the protection of the ministerial fleet or army or assist in carrying on their measures against us—a resolve to provide two armed vessels of sixteen and fourteen guns with a spyschooner of four and four rowgalleys—an act exempting the polls of soldiers from taxes for the last and ensuing campaigns—another for encouraging the making of saltpetre and gunpowder a considerable quantity of both mr trumbull hopes to make early in the spring he says the furnace at middletown is smelting lead and likely to turn out twenty or thirty tons and that ore is plenty they have also passed an act empowering the commanderinchief of the continental army or officers commanding a detachment or outposts to administer an oath and swear any person or persons to the truth of matters relative to the public service the situation of our affairs seems to call for regulations like these and i should think the other colonies ought to adopt similar ones or such of them as they have not already made vigorous measures and such as at another     time would appear extraordinary are now become absolutely necessary for preserving our country against the strides of tyranny making against it governor trumbull in his list has not mentioned an act for impressing carriages c agreeable to the recommendation of congress this i hope they have not forgotten it is highly necessary that such an authority should be given under proper restrictions or we shall be greatly embarrassed whenever the army or any detachment from it may find it necessary to march from hence i am c george washington   january      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull cambridge   january      sir your favor of the   inst i received and heartily thank you for your kind salutations — i was happy to hear of the great unanimity in your assembly  of the general salutary laws they passed which shew them to be well attached to the common cause  to have taken proper measures for supporting it inclosed you have the amount of lead from crown point agreeable to your request the account of the smelting furnace and your expectations to make a considerable amount of saltpetre and powder please me much i wish your most sanguine endeavors may be more than answered as to gun locks it is not in my power to furnish any the information you had was groundless for there were no spare ones in the ordnance stores     which fell into our hands none were ever found that i have heard of nor is there mention of them in the invoice having undoubted intelligence of the fitting out a fleet at boston—and of the embarkation of troops from thence which from the season of the year and other circumstances must be destined for some expedition south of this and having such information as i can depend upon that the inhabitants of long island in the colony of new york or a great part of them are inimical to the rights and liberties of america and from their conduct and professions have discovered an apparent inclination to assist in subjugating their fellow citizens to ministerial tyranny there is the greatest reason to believe that this armament if not immediately designed against the city of new york is nevertheless intended for long island and as it is of the utmost importance to prevent the enemy from possessing themselves of the city of new york and the north river which would give them the command of the country and the communication with canada i shall dispatch major general lee with orders to repair thither with such volunteers as are willing to join and can be expeditiously raised having no troops to spare from hence to put the city and fortifications on the north river in the best posture of defense the season and circumstances will admit of and for disarming all such persons upon long island and elsewhere whose conduct and declarations have rendered them justly suspected of designs unfriendly to the views of     congress  i have directed him to call upon the commanding officer of the jersey troops for such assistance as he can afford and being informed by captain sears and mr woodward who will deliver you this and whom genl lee will follow in a day or two that he apprehends  000 or   00 volunteers may be readily raised in your government in the town through which mr lee will pass i beg the favor of you to interpose your good offices and interest in the matter to encourage men to go on this important service and as expeditiously as possible for counteracting any designs our enemies may have against us in that quarter—every necessary expence attending their march and stay will be borne by the public  i have just receivd advice from chelsea     about   or  0 miles from this that several ships have sailed from nantasket road that were lying there i shall write to the honorable the convention of new york by general lee and direct his instructions to be laid before them praying their assistance to facilitate the purposes of his going i am c george washington  th day of january      cambridge charles lee to majorgeneral charles lee  instructions having undoubted intelligence of the fitting out of a fleet at boston and of the embarkation of troops from thence which from the season of the year and other circumstances must be     destined for a southern expedition and having such information as i can rely on that the inhabitants or a great part of them on long island in the colony of new york are not only inimical to the rights and liberties of america but by their conduct and public profession have discovered a disposition to aid and assist in the reduction of that colony to ministerial tyranny and as it is a matter of the utmost importance to prevent the enemy from taking possession of the city of new york as they will thereby command the country and the communication with canada it is of too much consequence to hazard such a post at so alarming a crisis since we find by his majestys speech to parliament that disregarding the petition of the united voice of america nothing less than the total subversion of her rights will satisfy him you will therefore with such volunteers as are willing to join you and can be expeditiously raised repair to the city of new york and calling upon the commanding officer of the forces of new jersey for such assistance as he can afford and you shall require you are to put that city into the best posture of defence which the season and circumstances will admit disarming all such persons upon long island and elsewhere and if necessary otherwise securing them whose conduct and declarations have rendered them justly suspected of designs unfriendly to the views of congress  you are also to inquire into the state and condition of the fortifications up the north river and as far as shall be consistent with the orders of congress or not repugnant to them to have the works guarded against surprises from a body of men which might be transported by water near the place and then marched in upon the back of them you will also endeavor to have the medicines shirts and blankets now at new york belonging to the ministerial troops secured and forwarded to this army captain sears can give you particular information concerning them      in all other matters relative to the execution of the general plan you are going upon your own judgment as it is impossible with propriety to give particular directions and the advice of those whom you have reason to believe are hearty in the cause must direct you keeping always in view the declared intentions of congress i am persuaded i need not recommend despatch in the prosecution of this business the importance of it alone is a sufficient incitement i would advise a dismission of the volunteers whose necessary expenses will be borne so soon as the service will admit of it and that you endeavor as much as possible at all times to be in readiness to join the army if the exigency of our affairs here should call for it given under my hand at headquarters cambridge this  th day of january         0 george washington  0 january      cambridge to the council of massachusetts bay cambridge  0 january      gentlemen in the confused and disordered state of this army occasioned by such capital changes as have taken place of late i have found it almost impossible to come at exact returns of the strength of our lines not till last night was i able to get in the whole since the dissolution of the old army by these i find myself weaker than i had any idea of and under the necessity of requesting an exertion of your influence and interest to prevail upon the militia of this government now in the pay of the continent to continue till the last of the month and longer if requisite i am assured that those of new hampshire will not stay any longer than they engaged for notwithstanding our weak state and the slow progress we make in recruiting which by the last weeks report amounts to but little more than half of our usual complement owing it is said to the number of men going or expecting to go into the provincial service at or near their own homes i am more and more convinced that we shall never raise the army to the new establishment by voluntary enlistments it is therefore necessary that the neighboring governments should consider in time and adopt some other expedient for effecting it the hurry i was in the other day when your committee did me the honor to present a petition from a person whose name i have forgot wanting to be employed in the continental army prevented me from being so full on the subject as i wished     i shall beg leave therefore at this time to add that i hope your honorable board will do me the justice to believe that it will give me pleasure at all times to pay a proper respect to any recommendation coming from them and that the reason why i do not now encourage such kind of applications as was then made is that the new army was arranged as near the plan and agreeable to the orders of congress although some unavoidable departures and changes have taken place as it was in my power to comply with and the officers thus constituted ordered to recruit every attempt therefore of others not of this appointment must counteract and has been of infinite prejudice to the service they infuse ideas into the minds of men they have any influence over that by engaging with them or which is tantamount not engaging with others they shall be able to force themselves into the service of this we have numberless instances i am therefore anxious to discourage every attempt of the kind by convincing such persons that their engaging a company will not bring them in if such persons could once be convinced of this the business of this army would go on more smoothly and with much more regularity and order in short gentlemen it is scarce possible for me to convey to you a perfect idea of the trouble and vexation i have met with in getting this matter fixed upon some settled footing one day an officer would serve another he would not and so on till i have hardly known what steps to pursue for preserving of consistency and advancing the good of the service which are the only objects i have in view i have no     friend whom i want to bring in nor any person with whom i am in the least connected that i wish to promote i am gentlemen with much esteem c george washington    january      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    january      sir every account i have out of boston confirms the embarkation of troops mentioned in my last which from the season of the year and other circumstances must be destined for some expedition to the southward of this i have therefore thought it prudent to send majorgeneral lee to new york i have given him letters recommendatory to governor trumbull and to the committee of safety at new york i have good hopes that in connecticut he will get many volunteers who i have some reason to think will accompany him on this expedition without more expense to the continent than their maintenance but should it be otherwise and should they expect pay i think it is a trifling consideration when put in competition with the importance of the object which is to put the city of new york with such parts of the north river and long island as to him shall seem proper in that state of defence which the season of the year and circumstances will admit of so as if possible to prevent the enemy from forming a lodgment in that government which i am afraid contains too many persons disaffected to the cause of liberty and america i have also written to lord     stirling to give him all the assistance that he can with the troops under his command in the continental service provided it does not interfere with any orders he may receive from congress relative to them  i hope the congress will approve of my conduct in sending general lee upon this expedition i am sure i meant it well as experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession the evening of the  th instant a party of our men under the command of major knowlton were ordered to go and burn some houses which lay at the foot of bunkers hill and at the head of charlestown they were also ordered to bring off the guard which we expected consisted of an officer and  0 men they crossed the milldam about half after eight oclock and gallantly executed their business having burnt eight houses and brought with them a sergeant and four privates of the  0th regiment there was but one man more there who making some resistance they were obliged to despatch the gun that killed him was the only one that was discharged by our men tho several hundreds were     fired by the enemy from within their works but in so confused a manner that not one of our people was hurt our inlistments go on very heavily  george washington    january      cambridge benedict arnold to colonel benedict arnold cambridge    january      sir your favor of the  th ultimo from before quebec enclosing the returns of your detachment is come to hand from the account you give of the garrison and the state of the walls i expect soon to hear from you within them which will give me vast pleasure i am informed that there are large quantities of arms blankets clothing and other military stores in that city these are articles which we are in great want of here i have therefore written to general montgomery or whoever is commanding officer in that quarter to send me as many as can be spared from thence if you can assist in expediting them you will much oblige me i understand that the congress have it under their consideration to raise an army for the defence of canada on a new establishment when i received this information i applied to congress to know whether it was their intention that you and the officers in your detachment were to be appointed there or remain as you were appointed in this army as newly arranged to which i have not yet received their answer     the want of so many good officers is felt here especially in the recruiting service which does not go on so briskly as i could wish i think it will be best for you to settle for the arrearages due to your men since october last with the paymaster of the army at your place i do not know any better way for you or them to receive it i am sir yours c      george washington    january      cambridge james warren to james warren speaker etc cambridge    january      gentlemen it is exceedingly painfull to me to give you so much trouble as i have and am like to do in the support of our lines and the arrangement of the new army but my difficulties must in their consequences devolve trouble on you to my very great surprize i find that the whole number of arms which have been stopped from the discharged soldiers amount to no more than    0 and of that number no more than   0 are in store the rest being redelivered to the recruits which have come in i also find from the report of the recruiting officers that few men are to be inlisted who have arms in their hands and that they are reduced to the alternative of either getting no men or men without arms unhappy situation what is to be done unless these governments will exert themselves in providing arms from the several towns or in such other manner as to them shall seem speedy and effectual to account for this great deficiency would be tedious and not much to the purpose suffice it generally to say that it has arisen from two causes the badness of the arms of the old army which the inspectors and valuers of did not think fit to detain and to the disobedient regiments which in spite of every order i could issue to the contrary even to a solemn threat of stopping the pay for the months of november and december of all those who should carry away their arms have in a manner by stealth borne them away     i am glad to hear by a gentleman of your honorable body who does me the honor to be the bearer of this letter that you have for some time past been collecting arms at watertown whilst a good deal of dispatch has been used in making them elsewhere i beg to know how many i can rely upon as the recruits now coming in from the country will be useless without it is to no purpose i find to depend upon imported arms—what you can furnish i must take in behalf of the continent and will upon notice send some gentleman to receive them will it be prudent to apply to such of the militia as are going away for their arms leaving it optional in them cannot be amiss but will the necessity of the case justify the policy of detaining them i ask for information—being with great truth and esteem c  george washington    january      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    january      sir i am exceedingly sorry that i am under the necessity of applying to you and calling the attention of congress to the state of our arms which is truly alarming upon the dissolution of the old army i     was apprehensive that the new would be deficient in this instance and that the want might be as inconsiderable as possible i gave it in orders that the arms of such men as did not reinlist should be or such of them as were good retained at the prices which should be affixed by persons appointed to inspect and value them and that we might be sure of them i added that there would be a stoppage of pay of the months of nov and decr from those that should carry their firelocks away without their being first examined—by these precautions i hoped to have procured a considerable number but sir i find with much concern that from the badness of the arms and the disobedience of too many in bearing them off without a previous inspection that very few were collected—neither are we to expect that many will be brought in by the new recruits—the officers who are out inlisting having reported that few men who have arms will engage in the service and that they are under the disagreeable alternative of taking men without arms or of getting none—unhappy situation indeed and much to be deplored especially when we know that we have to contend with a formidable army well provided of every necessary and that there will be a most vigorous exertion of ministerial vengence against us as soon as they think themselves in condition for it i hope it is in the power of congress to afford us relief if it is not what must what can be done our treasury is almost exhausted and the demands against it very considerable a constant supply of     money to answer every claim and exigency would much promote the good of the service in the common affairs of life it is useful in war it is absolutely necessary and essential—i would beg leave too to remind you of tents and of their importance hoping if an opportunity has offered you have procured them i fear that our army will not be raised to the new establishment in any reasonable time if ever the inlistments go on so very slow that they seem almost at an end in my letter of the   inst i wrote you that i had received certain intelligence from a mr hutchinson and others that   of the   regimts from cork now arrived at hallifax   at boston and the other   had sailed for quebec and had not been heard of—i am now assured as a matter to be relyed on by four captains of ships who left england about the  d of novr and who appear to be men of veracity that the whole of these regiments except the three companies which arrived at boston some time ago when they sailed were at milford haven where they had been obliged to put in by a violent storm the   th of october—that they would not be able to leave it for a considerable time being under the necessity of repairing their vessels and taking some new ones up—such is the incertainty and contradiction in what i now hear that it is not possible to know what to believe or disbelieve i wrote to the general court yesterday and to the convention at new hampshire immediately on being   0 acquainted with the great deficiency in our arms praying that they would interest themselves in the matter and furnish me with all in their power whether i shall get any or what quantity i cannot determine having not received their answers the same application will be made to the governments of connecticut and rhode island i do myself the honor to send you sundry newspapers i received from the above mentioned captains as they may be later than any you have seen and contain some interesting intelligence  george washington    january      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    january      dear sir the bearer presents an opportunity to me of acknowledging the receipt of your favor of the  0th ultimo which never came to my hands till last night and if i have not done it before of your other of the   d preceding the hints you have communicated from time to time not only deserve but do most sincerely and cordially meet with my thanks you cannot render a more acceptable service nor in my estimation give a more convincing proof of your friendship than by a free open and undisguised account of every matter relative to myself or conduct i can bear to hear of imputed or real errors the man who wishes to     stand well in the opinion of others must do this because he is thereby enabled to correct his faults or remove prejudices which are imbibed against him for this reason i shall thank you for giving me the opinions of the world upon such points as you know me to be interested in for as i have but one capital object in view i could wish to make my conduct coincide with the wishes of mankind as far as i can consistently i mean without departing from that great line of duty which though hid under a cloud for some time from a peculiarity of circumstances may nevertheless bear a scrutiny my constant attention to the great and perplexing objects which continually rise to my view absorbs all lesser considerations and indeed scarcely allows me time to reflect that there is such a body in existence as the general court of this colony but when i am reminded of it by a committee nor can i upon recollection discover in what instances i wish they would be more explicit i have been inattentive to or slighted them they could not surely conceive that there was a propriety in unbosoming the secrets of an army to them that it was necessary to ask their opinion of throwing up an intrenchment forming a battalion c c it must therefore be what i before hinted to you and how to remedy it i hardly know as i am acquainted with few of the members never go out of my own lines or see any of them in them i am exceeding sorry to hear that your little fleet has been shut in by the frost i hope it has     sailed ere this and given you some proof of the utility of it and enabled the congress to bestow a little more attention to the affairs of this army which suffers exceedingly by their overmuch business or too little attention to it we are now without any money in our treasury powder in our magazines arms in our stores we are without a brigadier the want of which has been twenty times urged engineers expresses though a committee has been appointed these two months to establish them and by and by when we shall be called upon to take the field shall not have a tent to lie in apropos what is doing with mine these are evils but small in comparison of those which disturb my present repose our enlistments are at a stand the fears i ever entertained are realized that is the discontented officers for i do not know how else to account for it have thrown such difficulties or stumblingblocks in the way of recruiting that i no longer entertain a hope of completing the army by voluntary enlistments and i see no move or likelihood of one to do it by other means in the last two weeks we have enlisted but about a thousand men whereas i was confidently bid to believe by all the officers i conversed with that we should by this time have had the regiments nearly completed our total number upon paper amounts to about ten thousand five hundred but as a large portion of these are returned not joined i never expect to receive them as an ineffectual order has once issued to call them in another is now gone forth     peremptorily requiring all officers under pain of being cashiered and recruits as being treated as deserters to join their respective regiments by the  st day of next month that i may know my real strength but if my fears are not imaginary i shall have a dreadful account of the advanced months pay in consequence of the assurances given and my expectation of having at least men enough enlisted to defend our lines to which may be added my unwillingness of burthening the cause with unnecessary expense no relief of militia has been ordered in to supply the places of those who are released from their engagements tomorrow and on whom though many have promised to continue out the month there is no security for their stay thus am i situated with respect to men with regard to arms i am yet worse off before the dissolution of the old army i issued an order directing three judicious men of each brigade to attend review and appraise the good arms of every regiment and finding a very great unwillingness in the men to part with their arms at the same time not having it in my power to pay them for the months of november and december i threatened severely that every soldier who carried away his firelock without leave should never receive pay for those months yet so many have been carried off partly by stealth but chiefly as condemned that we have not at this time one hundred guns in the stores of all that have been taken in the prizeship and from the soldiery notwithstanding our regiments are not half complete     at the same time i am told and believe it that to restrain the enlistment to men with arms you will get but few of the former and still fewer of the latter which would be good for any thing how to get furnished i know not i have applied to this and the neighboring colonies but with what success time only can tell the reflection on my situation and that of this army produces many an uneasy hour when all around me are wrapped in sleep few people know the predicament we are in on a thousand accounts fewer still will believe if any disaster happens to these lines from what causes it flows i have often thought how much happier i should have been if instead of accepting of a command under such circumstances i had taken my musket on my shoulder and entered the ranks or if i could have justified the measure to posterity and my own conscience had retired to the back country and lived in a wigwam if i shall be able to rise superior to these and many other difficulties which might be enumerated i shall most religiously believe that the finger of providence is in it to blind the eyes of our enemies for surely if we get well through this month it must be for want of their knowing the disadvantages we labor under could i have foreseen the difficulties which have come upon us could i have known that such a backwardness would have been discovered in the old soldiers to the service all the generals upon earth should not have convinced me of the propriety of delaying an attack upon boston till this time when it can now be attempted i will not undertake to say     but thus much i will answer for that no opportunity can present itself earlier than my wishes but as this letter discloses some interesting truths i shall be somewhat uneasy until i hear it gets to your hands although the conveyance is thought safe we made a successful attempt a few nights ago upon the houses near bunkers hill a party under major knowlton crossed upon the milldam the night being dark and set fire to and burnt down eight out of fourteen which were standing and which we found they were daily pulling down for fuel five soldiers and the wife of one of them inhabiting one of the houses were brought off prisoners another soldier was killed none of ours hurt  having undoubted information of the embarkation of troops somewhere from three to five hundred at boston and being convinced they are designed either for new york government from whence we have some very disagreeable accounts of the conduct of the tories or virginia i despatched general lee a few days ago in order to secure the city of new york from falling into their hands as the consequences of such a blow might prove fatal to our interests he is also to inquire a little into the conduct of the longislanders and such others as have by their conduct and declarations proved themselves inimical to the common cause to effect these purposes he is to raise volunteers in connecticut and call upon the troops of new jersey if not contrary to any order of congress     by a ship just arrived at portsmouth new hampshire we have london prints to the  d of november containing the addresses of parliament which contain little more than a repetition of the speech with assurances of standing by his majesty with lives and fortunes the captains for there were three or four of them passengers say that we have nothing to expect but the most vigorous exertions of administration who have a dead majority upon all questions although the duke of grafton and general conway have joined the minority as also the bishop of peterborough these captains affirm confidently that the five regiments from ireland cannot any of them have arrived at halifax inasmuch as that by a violent storm on the   th of october the transports were forced in a very distressful condition into milford haven wales and were not in a condition to put to sea when they left london and the weather has been such since as to prevent heavy loaded ships from making a passage by this time one or two transports they add were thought to be lost but these arrived some considerable time ago at boston with three companies of the   th regiment mr sayre has been committed to the tower upon the information of a certain lieutenant or adjutant richardson formerly of your city for treasonable practices an intention of seizing his majesty and possessing himself of the tower it is said in the crisis  but he is admitted to bail himself in five     hundred pounds and two sureties in two hundred and fifty pounds each what are the conjectures of the wise ones with you of the french armament in the west indies but previous to this is there any certainty of such an armament the captains who are sensible men heard nothing of this when they left england nor does there appear any apprehensions on this score in any of the measures or speeches of administration i should think the congress will not ought not to adjourn at this important crisis but it is highly necessary when i am at the end of a second sheet of paper that i should adjourn my account of matters to another letter i shall therefore in mrs washingtons name thank you for your good wishes towards her and with her compliments added to mine to mrs reed conclude dear sir your sincere and affectionate servant     george washington    january      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge    january      dear sir your favor of the  th instant enclosing copies of general montgomerys and general woosters letters i received for which i return you my thanks  it was from a full conviction of your zealous attachment to the cause of our country and abilities to serve it that i repeatedly pressed your continuance in command and it is with much concern sir that i find you have reason to think your holding the place you do will be of prejudice and incompatible with its interest as you are of this opinion the part you are inclined to take is certainly generous and noble but will the good consequences you intend be derived from it i greatly fear they will not i shall leave the matter to yourself in full confidence that in     whatever sphere you move your exertions for your countrys weal will not be wanting whatever proof you may obtain fixing or tending to support the charge against mr prescott you will please to transmit to me by the first opportunity  i am apt to believe the intelligence given to dr wheelock respecting major rogers was not true  but being much suspected of unfriendly views to this country his conduct should be attended to with some degree of vigilance and circumspection i confess i am much concerned for general montgomery and colonel arnold and the consequences which will result from their miscarriage should it happen will be very alarming i fear not less fatal than you mention however i trust that their distinguished conduct bravery and perseverance will meet with the smiles of fortune and put them in possession of this important fortress i wish their force was greater the reduction would then be certain i am sorry that ticonderoga and fort george should be left by the garrisons and that your recruiting officers meet such ill success it is too much the case in this quarter and from the slow progress made in enlisting i despair of raising an army to the new establishment should it be effected it will be a long time first our caghnawaga friends are not arrived yet i will try to make suitable provision for them during   0 their stay and use every means in my power to confirm their favorable disposition towards us they will not i am fearful have such ideas of our strength as i could wish this however shall be strongly inculcated  if quebec is in our possession i do not see that any inconvenience will result from mr gambles going there upon his parole  but if it is not however hurtful it may be to him however disagreeable to me to prejudice the interest of an individual i cannot consent to his return i am much distressed by applications of a like nature if mr gambles request is granted others in the same situation will claim the same indulgence further i think a partial exchange should not be made and my proposition for a general one was rejected by mr howe or what is the same it was unnoticed i could wish that his application had been to congress they might have complied with it had they thought it reasonable    i am much pleased that the artillery was like to be got over the river and am in hopes that colonel knox will arrive with it in a few days it is much wanted on reading the copy of general woosters letter i was much surprised to find that he had granted furloughs to the connecticut troops under his command in preference of discharges what advantage     could he imagine they would be of to the continent when they were at their own homes if he could not continue them in the service they were upon their discharges would certainly have eased the country of a considerable expense giving you in return the compliments of the season and wishing you every happiness i am dear sir c george washington    january      cambridge to the general court of massachusetts bay cambridge    january      gentlemen your several resolves in consequence of my letters of the  0 and    instant have been presented to me by a committee of your honorable body i thank you for the assurances of being zealously disposed to do every thing in your power to facilitate the recruiting of the american army and at the same time i assure you i do not entertain a doubt of the truth of it i must beg leave to add that i conceive you have mistaken the meaning of my letter of the  0th if you suppose it ever was in my idea that you should offer a bounty at the separate expense of this colony it was not clear to me but that some coercive measures might be used on this as on former occasions to draft men to complete the regiments upon the continental establishment but as this is thought unadvisable i shall rely on your recommending to     the selectmen and committees of correspondence c to exert themselves in their several towns to promote the enlistments for the american army  in the mean while as there is no appearance of this service going on but slowly and it is necessary to have a respectable body of troops here as soon as possible to act as circumstances shall require i must beg that you will order in with as much expedition as the nature of the case will admit of seven regiments agreeable to the establishment of this army to continue in service till the  st of april if required you will be pleased to direct that the men come provided with good arms blankets kettles for cooking and if possible with twenty rounds of powder and ball with respect to your other resolve relative to arms i am quite ready to make an absolute purchase of such as shall be furnished either by the colony or individuals i am also ready to engage payment for all the arms which shall be furnished by the recruits     if lost in the public service but i do not know how far i could be justified in allowing for the use of them when i know it to be the opinion of congress that every man shall furnish his own arms or pay for the use of them if put into his hands to do otherwise is an indirect way of raising the pay i again wish that the honorable court could advise some method of purchasing i beg leave to return my thanks for the kind offer of fifty thousand pounds for the continental use i will accept of a loan upon the terms mentioned of half that sum to secure payment of the militia whose time of service will be up the last of this month till when i shall not have occasion to make use of the money i am with great respect c      george washington    january      cambridge matthew thornton to matthew thornton  cambridge    january      sir the alarming and almost defenceless state of our lines occasioned by the slow progress in raising recruits for the new army and the departure of a great number of the militia which had been called in for their support until the   th instant rendered it necessary for me to summon the general officers in council to determine on proper measures to be adopted for their preservation for this purpose they met at head quarters yesterday and to day and finding that it was with the utmost difficulty and persuasion that such of the latter as are now here have been prevailed on to continue till the last of the month after which there is not the remotest probability of their staying a moment they have judged it expedient and absolutely necessary that thirteen regiments should be forthwith raised equal to those of the new establishment to be officered according to the usual mode of their respective governments which are to repair to this camp by the last instant if possible to be in readiness to act in such manner till the  st of april as circumstances may require of this number they apprehend the massachusetts should furnish seven connecticut four and your government two being agreeable to the proportion settled by congress in order that each regiment may consist of a proper number of officers and men i have enclosed you a list for their regulation and of the continental pay     i must earnestly solicit your attention and regard to arms ammunition blankets kettles and clothing that they may come as well provided with these necessaries as possible particularly the first as from the amazing deficiency here i shall not have it in my power to supply them the situation and exigency of our affairs calling for this assistance i have the most pleasing assurance that your honorable body will exert themselves for complying with all possible despatch george washington    january      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge    january      dear sir i received your favor of the   th instant with its enclosures and am heartily sorry and most sincerely condole with you upon the fall of the brave and worthy montgomery and those gallant officers and men who have experienced a like fate in the death of this gentleman america has sustained a heavy loss having approved himself a steady friend to her rights and of ability to render her the most essential services i am much concerned for the intrepid and enterprising arnold and greatly fear that consequences of the most alarming nature will result from this well intended but unfortunate attempt it would give me the greatest pleasure if i could be the happy means of relieving our fellow citizens now in canada and preventing the ministerial troops     from exulting long and availing themselves of the advantages arising from this repulse but it is not in my power since the dissolution of the old army the progress in raising recruits for the new has been so very slow and inconsiderable that five thousand militia have been called in for the defence of our lines a great part of these have gone home again and the rest induced to stay with the utmost difficulty and persuasion though their going would render the holding of them truly precarious and hazardous in case of an attack in short i have not a man to spare in order that proper measures might be adopted i called a council of general officers and upon mr john adams and other members of influence of the general court to attend and laid before them your letter and proposition  after due consideration of their importance they determined that the colonies of massachusetts new hampshire and connecticut should each immediately raise a regiment to continue in service for one year and to march forthwith to canada agreeably to the route proposed in your letter to congress this determination with a copy of your letter and the several enclosures will be immediately transmitted to the different governments for raising these regiments which i have reason to believe will be directly complied with from the assurances i have received from such of the members of the general     court as attended in council and the general officers promising to exert their utmost interest and influence in their respective colonies if these regiments should not be raised so soon as i could wish yet i would willingly hope from the accounts we have received that colonel arnold and his corps will be joined by a number of men under colonel warner and from connecticut who it is said marched immediately on getting intelligence of this melancholy affair if this account be true i trust they will be in a situation to oppose and prevent mr carleton from regaining possession of what he has lost and that upon the arrival of the reinforcement to be sent from these colonies the city of quebec will be reduced to our possession this must be effected before the winter is entirely over otherwise it will be exceedingly difficult if not impracticable as the enemy will undoubtedly place a strong garrison there should this desirable work be accomplished our conquest in that quarter will be complete but yet the loss of the brave montgomery will ever be remembered it gives me pleasure to find that you will continue in service and afford your assistance to relieve your country from the distresses which at present threaten her in the north         none of the letters gives an account how this unfortunate affair ended in colonel campbells letter of the   st ultimo the division which col greene was in he seems to think was in a very disagreeable situation and drawing it off at night or throwing in a party to sustain it was an object he had much in view here his information stops in his letter of the  d instant he says nothing about it but i dread further intelligence of the matter  general putnam is of opinion that it will be better for the troops which may be raised in the western part of connecticut to go to albany than the route you have mentioned by number four  and that you pointed out this way upon a supposition that the reinforcement would be detached from this army if you concur in sentiment with him please to inform governor trumbull of it by letter that he may give the necessary orders i am dear sir yours c     george washington    january      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    january      sir taking it for granted that general schuyler has not only informed you of the fall of the brave and muchtobelamented general montgomery but of the situation of our affairs in canada as related by general wooster colonel arnold colonel campbell and others i shall not take up much more of your time on this subject than is necessary to enclose you a copy of his letter to me with the result thereon as appears by the council of war which i immediately summoned on the occasion and at which mr adams by my particular desire was good enough to attend it may appear strange sir as i had not men to spare from these lines that i should presume without first sending to congress and obtaining an express direction to recommend to the governments of massachusetts connecticut and new hampshire to raise each a regiment on the continental account for this service i wish most ardently that the urgency of the case would have admitted of the delay i wish also that the purport of general schuylers letter had not unavoidably as it were laid me under an indispensable obligation to do it for having informed you in his letter a copy of which he enclosed me of his dependence on this quarter for men i thought you might also have some reliance on my exertions this consideration added to my fears of the fatal consequences of delay to an information of your   0 having designed three thousand men for canada to a belief founded chiefly on general schuylers letters that few or none of them were raised and to my apprehensions for new york which led me to think that no troops could be spared from that quarter induced me to lose not a moments time in throwing in a force there being well assured that general carleton will improve to the utmost the advantages gained leaving no artifices untried to fix the canadians and indians who we find are too well disposed to take part with the strongest in his interest if these reasons are not sufficient to justifie my conduct in the opinion of congress if the measure contravenes any resolution of theirs they will please to countermand the levying and marching of the regiments as soon as possible and do me the justice to believe that my intentions were good if my judgment has erred  the congress will please also to observe that the measure of supporting our posts in canada appeared of such exceeding great importance that the general officers agreeing with me in sentiment and unwilling to lay any burden which can possibly be avoided although it may turn out an illtimed piece of parsimony have resolved that the three regiments for canada shall be part of the thirteen militia regiments which were requested to reinforce this army as appears by the minutes of another council of war held     on the   th instant  i shall being much hurried and fatigued add no more in this letter than my duty to congress and that i have the honor to be c p s i enclose you a copy of my letter to the governments of massachusetts connecticut and new hampshire also a copy of a resolution of this colony in answer to an application of mine for arms since writing the above i have been informed by a message from the general court of massachusetts that they have a resolution upon the raising of a regiment for canada and appointed the field officers for it in the western parts of this government i am also informed by express from governor trumbull that he and his council of safety had agreed upon the raising of a regiment for the same purpose which was anticipating my application to that government     if commissions and they are applied for are to be given by congress to the three regiments going to canada you will please to have them forwarded as i have none by me for the purpose  george washington    january      cambridge to the new england governments cambridge    january      gentlemen the enclosures herewith sent convey such full accounts of the sad reverse of our affairs in canada as to render it unnecessary for me in my present hurry to add aught to the tale your spirited colony will i have no doubt be sufficiently impressed with the expediency of a vigorous exertion to prevent the evils which must follow from the repulse of our troops it does not admit of a doubt but that general carleton will improve this advantage to the utmost and if he should be able to give another current of sentiments to the canadians and indians than those they seem inclined to adopt words are unnecessary to describe the melancholy effect which must inevitably follow i am persuaded therefore that you will exert yourselves to the utmost to throw in the reinforcements by the route mentioned in general schuylers letter that is now required of your colony as the doing of it expeditiously may prove a matter of the utmost importance     you will perceive by the minutes of the council of war enclosed that the regiment asked of you for canada is one of the seven applied for in my letter of the   th instant and that the only difference with respect to the requisition is the length of time and place of service as no good would result from sending troops to canada for a shorter period than the continental army is raised for to wit till the  st of january      i am gentlemen c george washington jany   st      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull cambridge jany   st      sir in the hurry of my last dispatches to you of the    instt i forgot to intimate that for the encouragement of the regimt destind for canada a months advanced pay will be allowed officers and soldiers by me in behalf of the congress—at the same time i think it but right that you should be apprized of the intention of this government to advance their regiment another months pay to enable the men to provide for so long and fatiguing a march and in the mean time have something for their families to subsist on during their absence i have no doubt but that this last advance will be pleasing to congress and that the money will be speedily refunded but as i have no authority to direct and would not appear by any act of mine to put those three regmts for canada upon a different footg from those which have been raising for this     army i only give you a hint of the intention of this government if you think proper that the regiment from your colony may be placed upon the same footing as i know all kind of distinctions are considered by troops with an evil and jealous eye such necessaries as are absolutely requisite for the march of this regiment you will please to have provided upon the best terms you can and a regular account with vouchers thereof kept that payment may be made the importance of dispatch will i am persuaded appear in so urgent and pressing a light to you that i need add nothing on this head but shall be glad to hear what progress you make in the business being with the sincerest regard and esteem c  george washington    january      cambridge majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee cambridge    january      sir i received your favor of the   th instant and am exceedingly sorry to hear that congress countermanded the embarkation of the two regiments intended against     the tories on long island  they i doubt not had their reasons but to me it appears that the period is arrived when nothing less than the most decisive and vigorous measures should be pursued our enemies from the other side of the atlantic will be sufficiently numerous it highly concerns us to have as few internal ones as possible as congress seem to have altered their views in this instance and the men which went with you from connecticut are upon a very different footing from what i expected it will be right to give congress the earliest notice of your proceeding and to disband your troops as soon as you think circumstances will admit of it  in consequence of the melancholy reverse of our affairs in canada an application was made to me for succour and happy should i have been if the situation of this army could have afforded it all i could do was to lay the matter before this and the governments of connecticut and new hampshire and urge the expediency and necessity of their sending thither a reinforcement of three regiments there immediately mr trumbull and his council of safety had anticipated my request the other two colonies have     adopted the measure the three regiments are now raising and i would willingly hope will arrive in time to reinstate matters in that quarter and give them a more agreeable aspect than they now have i shall be much obliged by your pressing colonel mcdougall to forward the shells mentioned in his letter of the  d instant as they are much wanted and also to spare me some powder if he possibly can  you know our stock of this necessary article is small and inconsiderable and you know too that we have a demand for a further supply the progress in raising recruits for the new army being very slow i have applied to this colony connecticut and new hampshire for ten regiments of militia to continue in service till the  st of april next which they have granted me as soon as they come in and i can get provided with proper means i am determined to attempt something of this i would have you take no notice within a few days past several persons have come out of boston they all agree that general clinton has gone upon some expedition some say he has between four and five hundred men others part of two regiments what his force consists of is not     precisely known but i am almost certain he has gone with some his destination must be south of this and very probably for new york i thought it necessary to give you this information that you may be on your guard and prepared to receive him as well as you can i shall be glad to hear from you frequently and to be informed of any occurrences you may think material i am dear sir with great regard c george washington    january      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    january      dear sir real necessity compels me to ask you whether i may entertain any hopes of your returning to my family if you can make it convenient and will hint the matter to colonel harrison i dare venture to say that congress will make it agreeable to you in every shape they can my business increases very fast and my distresses for want of you along with it mr harrison is the only gentleman of my family that can afford me the least assistance in writing he and mr moylan whose time must now be solely employed in his department of commissary have heretofore afforded me their aid and i have hinted to them in consequence of what you signified in some former letter that as they have really had a great deal of trouble each of them should receive one third of your pay reserving the other third contrary to your desire for yourself my distress and embarrassment     are in a way of being very considerably increased by an occurrence in virginia which will i fear compel mr harrison to leave me or suffer considerably by his stay he has wrote however by the last post to see if his return cannot be dispensed with if he should go i shall really be distressed beyond measure as i know no persons able to supply your places in this part of the world with whom i would choose to live in unbounded confidence in short for want of an acquaintance with the people hitherward i know of none which appear to me qualified for the office of secretary the business as i hinted to you before is considerably increased by being more comprehensive and at this time from the great changes which are happening every day perplexed so that you would want a good writer and a methodical man as an assistant or copying clerk such a one i have no doubt will be allowed and the choice i leave to yourself as he should be a person in whose integrity you can confide and on whose capacity care and method you can rely at present my time is so much taken up at my desk that i am obliged to neglect many other essential parts of my duty it is absolutely necessary therefore for me to have persons that can think for me as well as execute orders this it is that pains me when i think of mr whites expectation of coming into my family if an opening happens i can derive no earthly assistance from such a man and my friend baylor is much such another although as good and obliging a person as any in the world     as it may be essential that the pay of the undersecretary should be fixed that you may if you incline to return and should engage one know what to promise him i have wrote to colonel harrison and mr lynch on this subject the interruption of the post has prevented the receipt of any letters from the southward since this day week so that we have but little knowledge of what is passing in that quarter the unfortunate repulse of our troops at quebec the death of the brave and much to be lamented general montgomery and wounding of col arnold will i fear give a very unfavorable turn to our affairs in that quarter as i have no opinion at all of woosters enterprising genius  immediately upon the receipt of the unfortunate intelligence and general schuylers intimation of his having no other dependence than upon me for men i addressed massachusetts connecticut and n hampshire in behalf of the continent for a regiment each to be marched forthwith into canada and there continued if need be till the  st of january upon the same establishment as those raising for these lines it was impossible to spare a man from hence as we want eight or nine thousand of our establishment and are obliged to depend upon militia for the defence of our works equally improper did it appear to me to wait situated as our affairs were   0 for a requisition from congress after several days debate perhaps when in the meantime all might be lost the urgency of the case therefore must apologize to congress for my adoption of this measure governor trumbull indeed anticipated my request for he and his council of safety had voted a regiment before my request had reached him the general court here have also voted another and i have no doubt of new hampshires doing the like and that the whole will soon be on their march i have this instant received a letter from new hampshire in answer to mine informing me that they have fully complied with my request of a regiment appointed the fieldofficers and will have the whole in motion as soon as possible col warner and others we are told are already on their march so that it is to be hoped if these bodies have but a good head our affairs may still be retrieved in canada before the kings troops can get reinforced they are pulling down the houses in boston as fast as possible and we have lately accounts from thence which it is said may be relied on that general clinton is actually sailed from thence with a detachment no accounts making it more than  00 for the southward some say virginia others new york but all in conjecture whether this is the fleet that has been making up for some time at nantasket or another i cannot with certainty say in my last i informed you i think of the expedition i had sent general lee on to new york should clinton steer his course thither i hope he will meet with a formidable     and proper reception i shall conclude with informing you that we should have had a formidable work on letchmores point long ago if it had not been for the frost and that if congress mean that we should do any thing this winter no time must be lost in forwarding powder i have ordered in militia to take advantage of circumstances but i see no appearances as yet of a bridge i am c george washington    january      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    january      sir the commissary general being at length returned from a long and painful illness i have it in my power to comply with the requisition of congress in forwarding an estimate of the expence attending his office as also that of the quartermaster general you will please to observe that the commissary by his account of the matter has entered into no special agreement with any of the persons he has found occasion to employ as those to whose names sums are annexed are of their own fixing but left it to congress to ascertain their wages i shall say nothing therefore on this head further than relates to the proposition of mr miller to be allowed ⅛ for his trouble and the delivery of the other ⅞ of provisions which to me appears exorbitant in the extreme however conformable it may be to custom and usage i therefore think that reasonable stipends had better be fixed upon both the quartermaster and commissary     generals assure me that they do not employ a single person uselessly and as i have too good an opinion of them to think they would deceive me i believe them i shall take the liberty of recommending the expediency indeed the absolute necessity of appointing fit and proper persons to settle the accounts of this army to do it with precision requires time care and attention the longer it is left undone the more intricate they will be the more liable to error and difficult to explain and rectify as also the persons in whose hands they are if disposed to take undue advantage will be less subject to detection i have been as attentive as the nature of my office would admit of in granting warrants for money on the paymaster but it would be absolutely impossible for me to go into an examination of all the accounts incident to this army and the vouchers appertaining to them without devoting so large a portion of my time to the business as might not only prove injurious but fatal to it in other respects this ought in my humble opinion to be the particular business of a select committee of congress or one appointed by them who once in three months at farthest should make a settlement with the officers in the different departments having met with no encouragement from the governments of massachusetts and new hampshire as to my application for arms and expecting no better from connecticut and rhode island i have as the last expedient sent one or two officers from each     regiment into the country with money to try if they can buy in what manner they succeed congress shall be informed as soon as they return congress in my last would discover my motives for strengthening these lines with the militia but whether as the weather turns out exceedingly mild insomuch as to promise nothing favorable from ice and as there is no appearance of powder i shall be able to attempt any thing decisive time only can determine no man upon earth wishes more ardently to destroy the nest in boston than i do no person would be willing to go greater lengths than i shall to accomplish it if it shall be thought advisable but if we have neither powder to bombard with nor ice to pass on we shall be in no better situation than we have been in all the year we shall be worse because their works are stronger i have accounts from boston which i think may be relied on that general clinton with about four or five hundred men has left that place within these four days whether this is part of the detachment which was making up as mentioned in my letter of the fourth instant and then at nantasket or not it is not in my power to say if it is designed for new york or long island as some think throwing a body of troops there may prove a fortunate circumstance if they go farther south agreeably to the conjectures of others i hope there will be men to receive them notwithstanding the positive assertions of the four captains from portsmouth noticed in my letter of the   th i am now convinced from several corroborating     circumstances the accounts of deserters and of a lieut hill of lord percys regiment who left ireland the   of november and was taken by a privateer from newburyport that the   th and   th regiments are arrived in boston and other troops at halifax agreeable to the information of hutchinson and others lieut hill says that the transports of two regiments only were forced into milford haven congress will think me a little remiss i fear when i inform them that i have done nothing yet towards raising the battalion of marines but i hope to stand exculpated from blame when they hear the reason which was that already having twentysix incomplete regiments i thought it would be adding to an expense already great in officers to set two entire corps of officers on foot when perhaps we should not add ten men a week by it to our present numbers in this opinion the general officers have concurred which induced me to suspend the matter a little longer our enlistments for the two last weeks have not amounted to a thousand men and are diminishing the regiment for canada it is thought will soon be filled as the men are to choose all but their fieldofficers who are appointed by the court on sunday evening thirteen of the caghnawaga indians arrived here on a visit i shall take care that they be so entertained during their stay that they may return impressed with sentiments of friendship for us and also of our great strength one of them     is colonel louis who honored me with a visit once before  i have c  george washington    january      cambridge majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler cambridge    january      dear sir your favor of the   d enclosing colonel arnolds letter of the  d explaining the doubt we were in respecting his detachment is received happy would it have been for our cause if that party could have got out of the city of quebec  as i am much afraid by the complexion of the letters from that place that there is little hope of arnolds continuing the blockade without assistance from wooster which he is determined not to give whether with propriety or not i shall not at this distance undertake to decide     the sad reverse of our affairs in that quarter calls loudly for every exertion in your power to restore them to the promising aspect they so lately wore for this reason notwithstanding you think the necessity of troops from hence is in some measure superseded i will not countermand the order and appointment of officers which are gone forth from this government connecticut and new hampshire for raising a regiment each till congress who are informed of it shall have decided upon the measure i consider that the important period is now arrived when the canadians and consequently their indians must take their side should any indecisive operations of ours therefore give the bias against us it is much easier to foresee than to rectify the dreadful consequences which must inevitably follow from it i consider also that the reinforcement under the command of colonel warner and such other spirited men as have left the western parts of the new england governments is only temporary and may fail when most wanted as we find it next to impossible to detain men not fast bound in service after they get a little tired of the duties of it and homesick these my dear sir are the great outlines which govern me in this affair if congress mark them as strongly as i do they will not wish to starve the cause at so critical a period if they think differently they will direct accordingly and i must stand corrected for the error my zeal hath led me into colonel porter said to be an exceedingly active man is appointed to the command of the regiment     from this government colonel burrell to the one from connecticut and colonel bedel to that from new hampshire the two last are represented to me as men of spirit and influence so that from these accounts i have no doubt of their getting into canada in a very short time as i have endeavored to excite the spirit of emulation i wish most ardently that the state of your health may permit you to meet them there the possession of quebec and entire reduction of canada this winter so as to have leisure to prepare for the defence of it in the spring is of such great and extensive importance to the wellbeing of america that i wish to see matters under the direction—but i will say no more you will come at my meaning i am a little embarrassed to know in what manner to conduct myself with respect to the caghnawaga indians now here they have notwithstanding the treaty of neutrality which i find they entered into with you the other day agreeably to what appears to be the sense of congress signified to me a desire of taking up arms in behalf of the united colonies the chief of them and who i understand is now the first man of the nation intends as it is intimated to apply to me for a commission with the assurance of raising four or five hundred men when he returns my embarrassment does not proceed so much from the impropriety of encouraging these people to depart from their neutrality accepting their own voluntary offer rather as from the expense which probably may follow i am sensible that if they do not desire to be idle they will be for or against us i am sensible     also that no artifices will be left unassayed to engage them against us their proffered services therefore ought not to be rejected but how far with the little knowledge i have of these peoples policy and real intentions and your want of their aid i ought to go is the question that puzzles me i will endeavor however to please them by yielding in appearance to their demands reserving at the same time the power in you to regulate their numbers and movements of which you shall be more fully informed when any thing is fixed  at present what they have mentioned is a kind of out door talk they expect and are waiting to see col bedel who promised to meet them here before they open themselves fully     what can you do in compliance with arnolds request of mortars c if knox disfurnished you i am almost sorry for it as i believe i shall never get wherewithal to feed them here i congratulate you upon the success of your expedition into tryon county i hope general lee will execute a work of the same kind on long island c it is high time to begin with our internal foes when we are threatened with such severity of chastisement from our kind parent without that the supreme dispenser of every good may bestow health strength and spirit on you and your army is the fervent wish of dear sir your most affectionate and obedient servant george washington    january      cambridge benedict arnold to colonel benedict arnold cambridge    january      dear sir on the   th instant i received the melancholy account of the unfortunate attack on the city of quebec attended with the fall of general montgomery and other brave officers and men and your being wounded this unhappy affair affects me in a very sensible manner and i sincerely condole with you upon the occasion but in the midst of distress i am happy to find that suitable honors were paid to the remains of mr montgomery and our officers and soldiers who have fallen into their hands were treated with kindness and humanity    0 having received no intelligence later than the copy of your letter of the  d to general wooster i would fain hope that you are not in a worse situation than you then were though i confess i have greatly feared that those misfortunes would be succeeded by others on account of your unhappy condition and the dispirited state of the officers and men if they have not i trust when you are joined by three regiments now raising in this and the governments of connecticut and new hampshire and two others ordered by the congress from pennsylvania and the jerseys with the men already sent off by colonel warner that these misfortunes will be done     away and things will resume a more favorable and promising appearance than ever i need not mention to you the great importance of this place and the consequent possession of all canada in the scale of american affairs you are well apprized of it to whomsoever it belongs in their favor probably will the balance turn if it is in ours success i think will most certainly crown our virtuous struggles if it is in theirs the contest at best will be doubtful hazardous and bloody the glorious work must be accomplished in the course of this winter otherwise it will become difficult most probably impracticable for administration knowing that it will be impossible ever to reduce us to a state of slavery and arbitrary rule without it will certainly send a large reinforcement there in the spring i am fully convinced that your exertions will be invariably directed to this grand object and i already view the approaching day when you and your brave followers will enter this important fortress with every honor and triumph attendant on victory then will you have added the only link wanting in the great chain of continental union and rendered the freedom of your country secure wishing you a speedy recovery and the possession of those laurels which your bravery and perseverance justly merit i am dear sir yours c      george washington    january      cambridge john manly to commodore john manly cambridge    january      sir i received your agreeable letter of the   th instant giving an account of your having taken and carried into plymouth two of the enemys transports your conduct in engaging the eightgun schooner with so few hands as you went out with your attention in securing your prizes and your general good behavior since you first engaged in the service merit my own and your countrys thanks  you may be assured that every attention will be paid to any reasonable request of yours and that you shall have the command of a stronger vessel of war but as it will take up some time before such a one can be fitted out my desire is that you continue in the hancock until the end of the cruise when that is out you will come to headquarters and we will confer together on the subject of the other ship i wish you could engage men at plymouth to make your complement at least forty strong it would enable you to encounter the small tenders that may fall in your way though i would rather have you avoid an engagement until you have a ship that will place you upon a more equal footing with your enemy     i need not recommend to you to proceed again and pursue your good fortune i wish you could inspire the captains of the other armed schooners under your command with some of your activity and industry can you not appoint stations for them where they may have the best chance of intercepting supplies going to the enemy they dare not disobey your orders as it is mentioned in the instructions i have given to each of them that they are to be under your command as commodore and as such i desire that you will give them such instructions in writing as to you will appear proper for the good of the service i am sir wishing you a continuance of success yours c  george washington  0 january      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge  0 january      sir your favors of the  th and of the  0th instant i received yesterday with the several resolves of congress     alluded to for which i return you my thanks knowing the great importance canada will be of to us in the present interesting contest and the relief our friends there stand in need of i should be happy were it in my power to detach a battalion from this camp but it cannot be done on the   th instant i had the honor to write to you a letter which will fully convey the resolutions of a council of war and the sentiments of the general officers here as to the propriety and expediency of sending troops from these lines for the defence of which we have been and now are obliged to call in the militia to which i beg leave to refer you  you may rest assured that my endeavors and exertions shall not be wanting to stimulate the governments of connecticut and new hampshire to raise and forward reinforcements as fast as possible nor in any other instance that will promote the expedition      i shall in obedience to the order of congress though interdicted by general howe propose an exchange of governor skene  for mr lovell and his family and shall be happy to have an opportunity of putting this deserving man who has distinguished his fidelity and regard to his country to be too great for persecution and cruelty to overcome in any post agreeable to his wishes and inclination i do not know that there is any particular rank annexed to the office of aiddecamp generally they are captains     and rank as such but higher rank is often given on account of particular merit and particular circumstances aids to the king have the rank of colonels whether any distinction should be made between those of your commanderinchief and the other generals i really know not i think there ought  you may rely that connolly had instructions concealed in his saddle mr eustis  who was one of lord dunmores family and another gentleman who wishes his name not to be mentioned saw them cased in tin put in the tree and covered over he probably has exchanged his saddle or withdrawn the papers when it was mended as you conjecture those that have been discovered are sufficiently bad but i doubt not of the others being worse and containing more diabolical and extensive plans i hope he will be taken proper care of and meet with rewards equal to his merits i shall appoint officers in the places of those who are in canada as i am fully persuaded they will wish to continue there for making our conquest complete in that quarter i wish their bravery and valor may be attended with the smiles of fortune it gives me great pleasure to hear of the measures congress are taking for manufacturing powder i hope their endeavors will be crowned with success     i too well know and regret the want of it it is scarcely possible to describe the disadvantages an army must labor under when not provided with a sufficient supply of this necessary it may seem strange after having received about    tons added to about   tons which i found here and no general action has happened that we should be so deficient in this article and require more but you will please to consider besides its being in its nature subject to waste and whilst the men lay in bad tents was unavoidably damaged by severe and heavy rains which could not have been prevented unless it had been entirely withdrawn from them and an attack hazarded against us without ammunition in their hands that the armed vessels our own occasional firings and some small supplies i have been obliged to afford the seaport towns threatened with destruction to which may be added the supply to the militia and going off of the old troops have occasioned and ever will a large consumption of it and waste in spite of all the care in the world the kings troops never have less than  0 rounds a man in their possession independent of their stores to supply an army of  0000 in this manner would be near  00 barrels allowing nothing for stores artillery c i have been always afraid to place more than    or    rounds at a time in the hands of our men lest any accident happening to it we should be left destitute and be undone i have been this particular not only to show our poverty but to exculpate myself from even a suspicion of unnecessary waste     i shall inform the paymaster general of the resolution of congress respecting his drafts and the mode and amount of them the companies at chelsea and malden are and have always been regimented it was not my intention to replace with continental troops the independent companies at hingham weymouth and braintree these places are exposed but not more so than cape ann beverly salem marblehead c c c is it the intention of congress that the officers of the army should pay postage they are not exempted by the resolve of the  th inst the congress will be pleased i have no doubt to recollect that the  00000 dollars now coming are but little more than enough to bring us up to the first day of this month that tomorrow will be the last of it and by their resolve the troops are to be paid monthly i wish it was in my power to furnish congress with such a general as they desire to send to canada  since the unhappy reverse of our affairs in that quarter general schuyler has informed me that though he had thoughts of declining the service before he would now act my letter of the   th will inform them of general lees being at new york he will be ready to obey their orders should they incline to send him but if i am not greatly deceived he or some other spirited able officer will be wanted there in the spring if not sooner as we have undoubted intelligence that general clinton has sailed with     some troops the reports of their number are various from between four and five hundred to nineteen companies of grenadiers and light infantry it is also imagined that the regiments which were to sail the  st of december are intended for that place or virginia general putnam is a most valuable man and a fine executive officer but i do not know how he would conduct in a separate department he is a younger majorgeneral than mr schuyler who as i have observed having determined to continue in the service will i expect repair into canada a copy of my letter to him on this and other subjects i enclose to you as it will explain my motives for not stopping the regiments from these governments when captain cochran arrives i will give him every assistance in my power in obedience to the orders of congress but i fear it will be the means of laying up our own vessels as these people will not bear the distinction  should this be the consequence it will be highly prejudicial to us as we sometimes pick up their provisionvessels and may continue to distress them in this way last week captain manly took a ship and a brig bound to boston from white haven with coals chiefly and some potatoes for the army i have for his great vigilance and industry appointed him commodore of our little squadron and he now hoists his flag on board the schooner hancock   0 i congratulate you upon the recovery of smith  and am exceedingly glad to hear of the measures congress are taking for the general defence of the continent the clouds thicken fast where they will burst i know not but we should be armed at all points i have not succeeded in my applications to these governments for arms they have returned for answer that they cannot furnish any whether i shall be more lucky in the last resource left me in this quarter i cannot determine having not received returns from the officers sent out to purchase of the people i greatly fear that but very few will be procured in this way as they are exceedingly scarce and but a small part of what there are fit for service when they make their port you shall be informed the quarter master general has just received from general schuyler clothing for the soldiery amounting to about £  00 york currency it has come very seasonably as they are in great want and will contribute a little to their relief since writing the above i have seen mr eustis and mentioning that nothing had been found in the tree of connollys saddle he told me there had been a mistake in the matter that the instructions were artfully concealed on the two pieces of wood which are on the mailpillion of his portmanteausaddle that by order of lord dunmore he saw them contrived for the purpose the papers put in and first covered with tin and over that with a waxed canvass cloth      he is so exceedingly pointed and clear in his information that i have no doubt of its being true i could wish them to be discovered as i think they contain some curious and extraordinary plans in my letter of the   th instant i mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our caghnawaga friends they honored me with a talk today as did three of the tribes of st johns and passamaquoddy indians copies of which i beg leave to enclose you i shall write to general schuyler respecting the tender of service made by the former and not to call for their assistance unless he shall at any time want it or be under the necessity of doing it to prevent their taking the sides of our enemies i had the honor of writing to you on the   th of november and then i informed you of having engaged two persons to go to nova scotia on the business recommended in your letter of the  0th and also that the state of the army would not then admit of a sufficient force being sent for carrying into execution the views of congress respecting the dockyards c i would now beg leave to mention that if the persons sent for information should report favorably of the expediency and practicability of the measure it will     not be in my power to detach any men from these lines the situation of our affairs will not allow it i think it would be advisable to raise them in the eastern parts of this government if it is attempted it must be by people from the country a colonel thompson a member of the general court from the province of maine and who is well spoken of by the court and a captain obrien have been with me they think the men necessary may be easily engaged there and the measure practicable provided there are not more than two hundred british troops at halifax they are willing and ready to embark in the matter upon the terms mentioned in their plan which i enclose to you i wish you to advert to the considerations inducing them to the expedition as i am not without apprehension should it be undertaken upon their plan that the innocent and guilty will be involved in one common ruin i presume they do not expect to receive more from the continent than the five or ten thousand pounds mentioned in their scheme and to be at every expense if we had men to spare it might be undertaken for less than either i conceive perhaps if congress do not adopt their proposition they will undertake to raise men for that particular purpose who may be disbanded as soon as it is effected and upon the same terms that are allowed the continental troops in general whatever may be the determination of congress upon the subject you will please to communicate it to me immediately for the season most favorable for the enterprise is advancing fast and we may expect in the spring that     there will be more troops there and the measure be more difficult to execute i have the honor to be c  george washington  0 january      cambridge majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee cambridge  0 january      dear sir i wrote to you the   d instant and then informed you that general clinton had gone upon some expedition with four or five hundred men there is good reason to believe that tryon has applied for some troops and that he would join them with a great number of inhabitants so that you will see the necessity of your being decisive and expeditious in your operations in that quarter the tories should be disarmed immediately though it is probable that they may have secured their arms on board the kings ships until called upon to use them against us however you can seize upon the persons of the principals they must be so notoriously known that there will be little danger of your committing mistakes and happy should i be if the governor could be one of them since writing the above your favor of the   th has come to hand with the sundry enclosures which i have with attention perused and very much approve of your conduct i sincerely wish that the letter you expect to receive from congress may empower you to act conformable to your own and my sentiments on this occasion if they should order differently we     must submit as they doubtless will have good reasons for what they may determine  the congress desire i should send an active general to canada i fancy when they made the demand that they did not think general schuyler would continue in that station which he has given me to understand in some late letters from him that he would should they not approve of the new york expedition and think another general necessary for the northern department it is probable they will fix on you to take the command there i should be sorry to have you removed so far from this scene but if the service there requires your presence it will be a fine field for the exertion of your admirable talents there is nothing new here let me hear often from you and believe me c      george washington    january      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    january      dear sir in my last date not recollected by mr john adams i communicated my distresses to you on account of my want of your assistance since this i have been under some concern at doing of it lest it should precipitate your return before you were ripe for it or bring on a final resignation which i am unwilling to think of if your return can be made convenient and agreeable true it is that from a variety of causes my business has been and now is multiplied and perplexed whilst the means of execution is greatly contracted this may be a cause for my wishing you here but no inducement to your coming if you hesitated before i have now to thank you for your favors of the   th   th and  0th inst and for the several articles of intelligence which they convey the account given of your navy at the same time that it is exceedingly unfavorable to our wishes is a little provoking to me inasmuch as it has deprived us of a necessary article which otherwise would have been sent hither but which a kind of fatality i fear will for ever deprive us of in the instance of new york we are not to receive a particle of what you expected would be sent from thence the time and season passing away as i believe the troops in boston also will before the season for taking the field arrives i dare say they are preparing for it now as we have undoubted intelligence of clintons leaving boston     with a number of troops by different accounts from four or five hundred to  0 companies of grenadiers and nine of light infantry believed to be designed for long island or new york in consequence of assurances from governor tryon of powerful aid from the tories there i hope my countrymen of virginia will rise superior to any losses the whole navy of great britain can bring on them and that the destruction of norfolk and the threatened devastation of other places will have no other effect than to unite the whole country in one indissoluble band against a nation which seems to be lost to every sense of virtue and those feelings which distinguish a civilized people from the most barbarous savages a few more of such flaming arguments as were exhibited at falmouth and norfolk  added to the sound doctrine and unanswerable reasoning contained in the pamphlet common sense will not leave numbers at a loss to decide upon the propriety of a separation by a letter of the   st instant from wooster i find that arnold was continuing the blockade of quebec on the   th which under the heaviness of our loss there is a most favorable circumstance and exhibits a fresh proof of arnolds ability and perseverance in the midst of difficulties the reinforcements ordered to him will i hope complete the entire conquest of canada this winter and but for the loss of the gallant chief and his brave followers i should     think the rebuke rather favorable than otherwise for had the country been subdued by such a handful of men it is more than probable that it would have been left to the defence of a few and rescued from us in the spring our eyes will now be open not only to the importance of holding it but to the numbers which are requisite to that end in return for your two beef and poultry vessels from new york i can acquaint you that our commodore manly has just taken two ships from white haven to boston with coal and potatoes and sent them into plymouth and fought a tender close by the light house where the vessels were taken long enough to give his prizes time to get off in short till she thought it best to quit the combat and he to move off from the menofwar which were spectators of this scene in my last i think i informed you of my sending general lee to new york with the intention of securing the tories of long island and to prevent if possible the kings troops from making a lodgment there but i fear the congress will be duped by the representations from that government or yield to them in such a manner as to become marplots to the expedition the city seems to be entirely under the government of tryon and the captain of the manofwar mrs washington desires i will thank you for the picture sent her mr campbell whom i never saw to my knowledge has made a very formidable figure of the commanderinchief giving him a sufficient     portion of terror in his countenance  mrs washington also desires her compliments to mrs reed as i do and with the sincerest regard and affection i remain dear sir your most obedient servant george washington   feby      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge   feby      my dear sir i had wrote the letter herewith enclosed before your favor of the   st came to hand the account given of the behavior of the men under general montgomery is exactly consonant to the opinion i have formed of these people and such as they will exhibit abundant proofs of in similiar cases whenever called upon place them behind a parapet a breastwork stone wall or any thing that will afford them shelter and from their knowledge of a firelock they will give a good account of their enemy but i am as well convinced as if i had seen it that they will not march boldly up to a work nor stand exposed in a plain and yet if we are furnished with the means and the weather will afford us a passage and we can get in men for these three things are     necessary something must be attempted  the men must be brought to face danger they cannot always have an intrenchment or a stone wall as a safeguard or shield and it is of essential importance that the troops in boston should be destroyed if possible before they can be reinforced or removed this is clearly my opinion whether circumstances will admit of the trial and if tried what will be the event the allwise disposer of them alone can tell the evils arising from short or even any limited inlistment of the troops are greater and more extensively hurtful than any person not an eyewitness to them can form any idea of it takes you two or three months to bring new men in any tolerable degree acquainted with their duty it takes a longer time to bring a people of the temper and genius of these into such a subordinate way of thinking as is necessary for a soldier before this is accomplished the time approaches for their dismissal and you are beginning to make interest with them for their continuance for another limited period in the doing of which you are obliged to relax in your discipline in order as it were to curry favor with them by which means the latter part of your time is employed in undoing what the first was accomplishing and instead  00 of having men always ready to take advantage of circumstances you must govern your movements by the circumstances of your inlistment this is not all by the time you have got men armd and equipd the difficulty of doing which is beyond description and with every new sett you have the same trouble to encounter without the means of doing it—in short the disadvantages are so great and apparent to me that i am convinced uncertain as the continuance of the war is that congress had better determine to give a bounty of  0  0 or even  0 dollars to every man who will inlist for the whole time be it long or short i intend to write my sentiments fully on this subject to congress the first leizure time i have i am exceeding sorry to hear that arnolds wound is in an unfavorable way his letter to me of the   th ulto says nothing of this i fancy congress have given some particular direction respecting genl prescott i think they ought for more reasons than one i am c be so good as to send the enclosed letter of randolphs to the postoffice   0  george washington   february      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull cambridge   february      sir i received your favors of the   and   inst and agreeable to your request have ordered payment of the ballance of the expences attending the journey of the two french gentlemen to philadelphia to be made to wm bacon post rider for your use which i hope will come safe to hand i am happy to hear of your having received    00 dollars from congress for the troops going upon the canada expedition and heartily wish that no other difficulties may occur to impede their march and prevent their giving early and timely succor to our friends there which they certainly stand in great need of as to replacing the money advanced by your colony to the regiments which served the last campain it is not in my power it is what i did not expect and therefore have made no provision for it i should have paid them in the same manner i did others had i not been prevented by the colonels who expressed their inclination to receive the whole  0  at one time after the expiration of the service and on their return home this being the case i always imagined that the sum advanced by you would be taken in when congress came to form a general account against the colonies and be applied to your credit which i presume they will shortly do as i have wrote to them and pointed out the necessity of having all the accounts respecting this army adjusted and liquidated at proper periods had i conceived that this application for repayment would have been made to me i should certainly have included the sum advanced by you in my estimates and taken care to have had a sufficiency of money to discharge it but i did not i am unprovided and have not more than will answer the claims i was apprized of antecedent to the last day of december they are large and numerous and in a few days will drain our treasury of every shilling now in it i am exceedingly sorry that matters should be so circumstanced as to give you the least disappointment or trouble but i doubt not congress upon your application will refund what you have advanced or settle it in such a way as shall be perfectly agreeable to you i shall take care to have the three battallions of the militia paid which are coming here for the defence of our lines in the same manner that the rest are when the time of their engagement expires they certainly might have come thus far without the advance you have been obliged to give having lately examined into the state of our powder and finding the deficiency to be much greater than  0  what i had any idea of and hearing that the militia from your colony and i fear from the others too are coming without any or with but very little i cannot but confess my anxiety and concern to be very great i therefore again repeat the request i made this morning and beg and entreat your most strenuous and friendly exertions to procure what we are told is important or such part as you possibly can and send it to me with the utmost expedition i am already much alarmed on account of the scarcity and the militia coming in without a proper supply fills me with apprehensions of the most disagreeable nature—this i would mention in confidence as it might give great uneasiness if it was generally known and trusting that nothing in your power will be wanting to relieve us at this alarming and important crisis i am c george washington   february      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   february      sir in compliance with the resolves of congress i have applied to general howe for the exchange of mr lovell a copy of my letter and his answer thereto you have inclosed captain waters and captain tucker who command two of the armed schooners have taken and sent into gloucester a large brigantine laden with wood   0 butts for water and  0 suits of bedding bound from la havre in nova scotia for boston she is one of the transports in the ministerial service  0  the captain says he was at halifax the   th january and that general massey was arrived there with two regiments from ireland the different prizes were all libelled immediately on receipt of the resolves of congress pointing out the mode but none of them yet brought to trial owing to a difference between the law passed in this province and the resolutions of congress the general court are making an amendment to their law by which the difficulties that now occur will be removed as i understand it is to be made conformable to your resolves the unavoidable delay attending the bringing the captures to trial is grievously complained of by the masters of these vessels as well as the captors many of the former have applied for liberty to go away without awaiting the decision which i have granted them i beg leave to call the attention of congress to their appointing a commissary in these parts to attend the providing of necessaries for the prisoners who are dispersed in these provinces complaints are made by some of them that they are in want of bedding and many other things as i understand that mr franks has undertaken that business i wish he was ordered to find a deputy immediately to see that the prisoners get what is allowed them by congress also to supply the officers with money as they may have occasion it will save me much time and much trouble there are yet but few companies of the militia come in this delay will i am much afraid frustrate  0  the intention of their being called upon as the season is slipping fast away when they may be of service the demands of the army were so very pressing before your last remittance came to hand that i was under the necessity of borrowing £  000 lawful money from this province they very cheerfully lent it and passed a vote for as much more if required i have not repaid the sum borrowed as i may stand in need of it before the arrival of another supply which the demands of the commissary general quartermaster general and paying off the arrearages will very soon require your esteemed favor of the   th ultimo is just come to hand it makes me very happy to find my conduct hath met the approbation of congress i am entirely of your opinion that should an accommodation take place the terms will be severe or favorable in proportion to our ability to resist and that we ought to be on a respectable footing to receive their armaments in the spring but how far we shall be provided with the means is a matter i profess not to know under my present unhappy want of arms ammunition and i may add men as our regiments are very incomplete the recruiting goes on very slow and will i apprehend be more so if for other service the men receive a bounty and none is given here i have tried every method i could think of to procure arms for our men they really are not to be had in these governments belonging to the public and if some method is not fallen upon in the southern governments to supply us we shall be in a distressed situation  0  for want of them there are near  000 men now in camp without firelocks i have wrote to the committee of new york this day requesting them to send me those arms which were taken from the disaffected in that government the congress interesting themselves in this request will doubtless have a good effect i have sent officers into the country with money to purchase arms in the different towns some have returned and brought in a few many are still out what their success will be i cannot determine i was in great hopes that the expresses resolved to be established between this place and philadelphia would ere now have been fixt it would in my opinion rather save than increase the expence as many horses are destroyed by one man coming the whole way it will certainly be more expeditious and safer than writing by the post or private hands which i am often under the necessity of doing i am c  george washington   february      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   february      sir the purport of this letter will be directed to a single object through you i mean to lay it before  0  congress and at the same time that i beg their serious attention to the subject to ask pardon for intruding an opinion not only unasked but in some measure repugnant to their resolves the disadvantages attending the limited enlistment of troops are too apparent to those who are eyewitnesses of them to render any animadversions necessary but to gentlemen at a distance whose attention is engrossed by a thousand important objects the case may be otherwise that this cause precipitated the fate of the brave and muchtobelamented general montgomery and brought on the defeat which followed thereupon i have not the most distant doubt of for had he not been apprehensive of the troops leaving him at so important a crisis but continued the blockade of quebec a capitulation from the best accounts i have been able to collect must inevitably have followed and that we were not obliged at one time to dispute these lines under disadvantageous circumstances proceeding from the same cause to wit the troops disbanding of themselves before the militia could be got in is to me a matter of wonder and astonishment and proves that general howe was either unacquainted with our situation or restrained by his instructions from putting any thing to hazard till his reinforcements should arrive the instance of general montgomery—i mention it because it is a striking one—for a number of others might be adduced proves that instead of having men to take advantage of circumstances you are  0  in a manner compelled right or wrong to make circumstances yield to a secondary consideration since the  st of december i have been devising every means in my power to secure these encampments and though i am sensible that we never have since that period been able to act on the offensive and at times not in a condition to defend yet the cost of marching home one set of men bringing in another the havoc and waste occasioned by the first the repairs necessary for the second with a thousand incidental charges and inconveniences which have arisen and which it is scarce possible either to recollect or describe amount to near as much as the keeping up a respectable body of troops the whole time ready for any emergency would have done to this may be added that you never can have a well disciplined army to bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier requires time to bring them under proper discipline and subordination not only requires time but is a work of great difficulty and in this army where there is so little distinction between the officers and soldiers requires an uncommon degree of attention to expect then the same service from raw and undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never did and perhaps never will happen men who are familiarized to danger meet it without shrinking whereas troops unused to service often apprehend danger where no danger is three things prompt men to a regular discharge of their duty in time of action natural  0  bravery hope of reward and fear of punishment the two first are common to the untutored and the disciplined soldier but the last most obviously distinguishes the one from the other a coward when taught to believe that if he breaks his ranks and abandons his colors will be punished with death by his own party will take his chance against the enemy but a man who thinks little of the one and is fearful of the other acts from present feelings regardless of consequences again men of a days standing will not look forward and from experience we find that as the time approaches for their discharge they grow careless of their arms ammunition camp utensils c nay even the barracks themselves have felt uncommon marks of wanton depredation and lay us under fresh trouble and additional expense in providing for every fresh set when we find it next to impossible to procure such articles as are absolutely necessary in the first instance to this may be added the seasoning which new recruits must have to a camp and the loss consequent thereupon but this is not all men engaged for a short limited time only have the officers too much in their power for to obtain a degree of popularity in order to induce a second enlistment a kind of familiarity takes place which brings on a relaxation of discipline unlicensed furloughs and other indulgences incompatible with order and good government by which means the latter part of the time for which the soldier was engaged is spent in undoing what you were aiming to inculcate in the first   0 to go into an enumeration of all the evils we have experienced in this late great change of the army and the expenses incidental to it to say nothing of the hazard we have run and must run between the discharging of one army and enlistment of another unless an enormous expense of militia is incurred would greatly exceed the bounds of a letter what i have already taken the liberty of saying will serve to convey a general idea of the matter and therefore i shall with all due deference take the freedom to give it as my opinion that if the congress have any reason to believe that there will be occasion for troops another year and consequently for another enlistment they would save money and have infinitely better troops if they were even at a bounty of twenty thirty or more dollars to engage the men already enlisted till january next and such others as may be wanted to complete the establishment for and during the war i will not undertake to say that the men can be had upon these terms but i am satisfied that it will never do to let the matter alone as it was last year till the time of service was near expiring the hazard is too great in the first place in the next the trouble and perplexity of disbanding one army and raising another at the same instant and in such a critical situation as the last was are scarcely in the power of words to describe and such as no man who has experienced them once will ever undergo again if congress should differ from me in sentiment upon this point i have only to beg that they will do me the justice to believe that i have nothing more in     view than what to me appears necessary to advance the public weal although in the first instance it will be attended with a capital expense and that i have the honor to be c  george washington  0 february      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge  0 february      dear sir your obliging favors of the   th ult and  st inst are now before me and claim my particular thanks for the polite attention you pay to my wishes in an early and regular communication of what is passing in your quarter if you conceive that i took any thing wrong or amiss that was conveyed in any of your former     letters you are really mistaken i only meant to convince you that nothing would give more real satisfaction than to know the sentiments which are entertained of me by the public whether they be favorable or otherwise and i urged as a reason that the man who wished to steer clear of shelves and rocks must know where they lay i know—but to declare it unless to a friend may be an argument of vanity—the integrity of my own heart i know the unhappy predicament i stand in i know that much is expected of me i know that without men without arms without ammunition without any thing fit for the accommodation of a soldier little is to be done and which is mortifying i know that i cannot stand justified to the world without exposing my own weakness and injuring the cause by declaring my wants which i am determined not to do further than unavoidable necessity brings every man acquainted with them if under these disadvantages i am able to keep above water as it were in the esteem of mankind i shall feel myself happy but if from the unknown peculiarity of my circumstances i suffer in the opinion of the world i shall not think you take the freedom of a friend if you conceal the reflections that may be cast upon my conduct my own situation feels so irksome to me at times that if i did not consult the public good more than my own tranquillity i should long ere this have put every thing to the cast of a dye so far from my having an army of twenty thousand men well armed i have been     here with less than half of it including sick furloughed and on command and those neither armed nor clothed as they should be in short my situation has been such that i have been obliged to use art to conceal it from my own officers the congress as you observe expect i believe that i should do more than others—for whilst they compel me to inlist men without a bounty they give  0 to others which will i expect put a stand to our inlistments for notwithstanding all the publick virtue which is ascribd to these people there is no nation under the sun that i ever came across pay greater adoration to money than they do—i am pleasd to find that your battalions are cloathed and look well and that they are filing off for canada i wish i could say that the troops here had altered much in dress or appearance our regiments are little more than half compleat and recruiting nearly at a stand—in all my letters i fail not to mention of tents and now perceive that notice is taken of yr application i have been convinced by general howes conduct that he has either been very ignorant of our situation which i do not believe or that he has received positive orders which i think is natural to conclude not to put anything to the hazard till his reinforcements arrive otherwise there has not been a time since the first of december that we must have fought like men to have maintained these lines so great in their extent the party to bunkers hill had some good and some bad men engaged in it one or two courts have been held on the conduct of part of it to be     plain these people—among friends—are not to be depended upon if exposed and any man will fight well if he thinks himself in no danger i do not apply this only to these people i suppose it to be the case with all raw and undisciplined troops you may rely upon it that transports left boston six weeks ago with troops where they are gone unless driven to the west indies i know not you may also rely upon general clintons sailing from boston about three weeks ago with about four or five hundred men his destination i am also a stranger to i am sorry to hear of the failures you speak of from france but why will not congress forward part of the powder made in your province they seem to look upon this as the season for action but will not furnish the means i will not blame them i dare say the demands upon them are greater than they can supply the cause must be starved till our resources are greater or more certain within ourselves with respect to myself i have never entertained an idea of an accommodation since i heard of the measures which were adopted in consequence of the bunkers hill fight the kings speech has confirmed the sentiments i entertained upon the news of that affair and if every man was of my mind the ministers of great britain should know in a few words upon what issue the cause should be put i would not be deceived by artful declarations nor specious pretences nor would i be amused by unmeaning propositions but in open undisguised and manly terms proclaim our wrongs and our resolution to be     redressed i would tell them that we had borne much that we had long and ardently sought for reconciliation upon honorable terms that it had been denied us that all our attempts after peace had proved abortive and had been grossly misrepresented that we had done every thing which could be expected from the best of subjects that the spirit of freedom beat too high in us to submit to slavery and that if nothing else could satisfy a tyrant and his diabolical ministry we are determined to shake off all connexions with a state so unjust and unnatural this i would tell them not under covert but in words as clear as the sun in its meridian brightness i observe what you say in respect to the ardor of the chimneycorner heroes i am glad their zeal is in some measure abated because if circumstances will not permit us to make an attempt upon boston or if it should be made and fail we shall not appear altogether so culpable i entertain the same opinion of the attempt now which i have ever done i believe an assault would be attended with considerable loss and i believe it would succeed if the men should behave well as to an attack upon bunkers hill unless it could be carried by surprise the loss i conceive would be greater in proportion than at boston and if a defeat should follow it would be discouraging to the men but highly animating if crowned with success great good or great evil would consequently result from it it is quite a different thing to what you left being by odds the strongest fortress they possess both in rear and front     the congress have ordered all captures to be tried in the courts of admiralty of the different governments to which they are sent and some irreconcilable difference arising between the resolves of congress and the law of this colony respecting the proceedings or something or another which always happens to procrastinate business here has put a total stop to the trials to the no small injury of the public as well as the great grievance of individuals whenever a condemnation shall take place i shall not be unmindful of your advice respecting the hulls c would to heaven the plan you speak of for obtaining arms may succeed the acquisition would be great and give fresh life and vigor to our measures as would the arrival you speak of our expectations are kept alive and if we can keep ourselves so and spirits up another summer i have no fears of wanting the needful after that as the number of our inlisted men were too small to undertake any offensive operation if the circumstances of weather c should favor i ordered in by application to this govt connecticut and new hampshire as many regiments of militia as would enable us to attempt something in some manner or other—they were to have been here by the first of the month but only a few straggling companies are yet come in the bay towards roxbury has been froze up once or twice pretty hard and yesterday single persons might have crossed i believe from litchmores point by picking his way—a thaw i fear is again approaching we have had the most laborious piece of work at     lechmeres point on account of the frost that ever you saw we hope to get it finished on sunday it is within as commanding a distance of boston as dorchester hill though of a different part our vessels now and then pick up a prize or two our commodore manly was very near being catched about eight days ago but happily escaped with vessel and crew after running ashore scuttling and defending her i recollect nothing else worth giving you the trouble of unless you can be amused by reading a letter and poem addressed to me by mrs or miss phillis wheatley in searching over a parcel of papers the other day in order to destroy such as were useless i brought it to light again at first with a view of doing justice to her great poetical genius i had a great mind to publish the poem but not knowing whether it might not be considered rather as a mark of my own vanity than as a compliment to her i laid it aside till i came across it again in the manner just mentioned i congratulate you upon your election although i consider it as the coup de grace to my expectation of ever seeing you a resident in this camp again  i have only to regret the want of you if that should be the case and i shall do it the more feelingly as i have experienced the good effects of your aid i am with mrs washingtons compliments to mrs reed and my best respects added dear sir your most obedient and affectionate servant     george washington  0 february      cambridge to the general court of massachusetts cambridge  0 february      gentlemen notwithstanding i have taken every method my judgement could suggest to procure a sufficient number of firelocks for the soldiers of this army by application to the assemblies and conventions of those governments as well as by sending officers out with money to purchase i am constrained by necessity to inform you that the deficiency is amazingly great and that there are not nigh enough to arm the troops already here— it is true that all the officers gone upon the business are not yet returned but from the small success of those who have made report i cannot promise myself many more i must therefore beg leave to sollicit your kind attention to this interesting and important concern and would submit it to your consideration whether if your honorable court were to depute some of their members to make applications to the different towns they might not procure a considerable quantity i will most cheerfully furnish them with money for the purpose or pay for them on their delivery here as you shall think most advisable— i shall only add that i hope the exigency of our affairs at this critical crisis will excuse this request and my confidence of your readiness and zeal to do every thing in your power for promoting the public good and am c p s i have heard that there are several kings muskets in the country—for every good one with a bayonet that have not been abused i will give        dollars and in proportion for other guns fit for service  george washington    february      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    february      sir through you i beg leave to lay before congress the enclosed letter from lord drummond to general   0 robertson which came to my hands a few days ago in order to be sent into boston as i never heard of his lordships being vested with power to treat with congress upon the subject of our grievances nor of his having laid any propositions before them for an accommodation i confess it surprised me much and led me to form various conjectures of his motives and intended application to general howe and admiral shuldham for a passport for the safe conduct of such deputies as congress might appoint for negotiating terms of reconciliation between great britain and us whatever his intentions are however benevolent his designs may be i confess that his letter has embarrassed me much and i am not without suspicion of its meaning more than the generous purpose it professes  i should suppose that if the mode for negotiation     which he points out should be adopted which i hope will never be thought of it ought to have been fixed and settled previous to any application of this sort and at best that his conduct in this instance is premature and officious and leading to consequences of a fatal and injurious nature to the rights of this country his zeal and desire perhaps of an amicable and constitutional adjustment taking place may have suggested and precipitated the measure be that as it may i thought it of too much importance to suffer it to go in without having the express direction of congress for that purpose and that it was my indispensable duty to transmit to them the original to make such interpretations and inferences as they may think right messrs willard and child who were sent to nova scotia in pursuance of the resolve of congress have just returned and made their report which i do     myself the honor to enclose they have not answered the purposes of their commission by any means as they only went a little way into that country and found their intelligence upon the information of others you will see the reasons they assign in excuse or justification of their conduct in the report itself last night a party of regulars said to be about five hundred landed on dorchester neck and burned some of the houses there which were of no value to us nor would they have been unless we take post     there they then might be of some service a detachment went after them as soon as the fire was discovered but before it could arrive they had executed their plan and made their retreat  inclosed is a letter for david franks esqr from mr chamier in boston upon the subject of victualling such of the kings troops as may be prisoners within the limits of his contract which i beg the favor of you to deliver him and that proper agents may be appointed by him to see that it is done i could wish too that congress would fall upon some     mode for supplying the officers with such money as they may really stand in need of and depute proper persons for that purpose and furnishing the privates with such clothing as may be absolutely necessary i am applied to and wearied by their repeated requests in some instances i have desired the committees to give the prisoners within their appointments what they should judge absolutely necessary for their support as the only means in my power of relieving their distress but i imagine that if there were persons to superintend this business that their wants would be better attended to and many exorbitant charges prevented and saved to the continent and the whole would then be brought into a proper account      george washington    february      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    february      sir the late freezing weather having formed some pretty strong ice from dorchester point to boston neck and from roxbury to the common thereby affording a more expanded and consequently a less dangerous approach to the town i could not help thinking notwithstanding the militia were not all come in and we had little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular cannonade and bombardment that a bold and resolute assault upon the troops in boston with such men as we had for it could not take many men to guard our own lines at a time when the enemy were attacked in all quarters might be crowned with success and therefore seeing no certain prospect of a supply of powder on the one hand and a certain dissolution of the ice on the other i called the general officers together for their opinion agreeably to the resolve of congress of the   d of december the result will appear in the enclosed council of war  and being almost unanimous i must suppose     it to be right although from a thorough conviction of the necessity of attempting something against the ministerial troops before a reinforcement should arrive and while we were favored with the ice i was not only ready but willing and desirous of making the assault under a firm hope if the men would have stood by me of a favorable issue notwithstanding the enemys advantage of ground artillery c perhaps the irksomeness of my situation may have given different ideas to me from those which influenced the gentlemen whom i consulted and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard than was consistent with prudence if it had i am not sensible of it as i endeavored to give it all the consideration that a matter of such importance required true it is and i cannot help acknowledging it that i have many disagreeable sensations on account of my situation     for to have the eyes of the whole continent fixed with anxious expectation of hearing of some great event and to be restrained in every military operation for want of the necessary means of carrying it on is not very pleasing especially as the means used to conceal my weakness from the enemy conceals it also from our friends and adds to their wonder i do not utter this by way of complaint i am sensible that all that the congress could do they have done and i should feel most powerfully the weight of conscious ingratitude were i not to acknowledge this but as we have accounts of the arrival of powder by captain mason i would beg to have it sent on in the most expeditious manner otherwise we shall not only lose all chance of the benefits resulting from the season but of the militia who are brought in at a most enormous expense upon a presumption that we should long ere this have been amply supplied with powder under the contracts entered into with the committee of congress the militia contrary to an express requisition are come and coming in without ammunition to supply then alone with    rounds which is less by ⅗ths than the regulars are served with will take between fifty and  0 barrels of powder and to complete the other troops to the like quantity will take near as much more than about  0 barrels besides a few rounds of cannon cartridges ready filled for use this sir congress may be assured is a true state of powder and will i hope bear some testimony of my     incapacity for action in such a way as may do any essential service february   st when i began this letter i proposed to have sent it by express but recollecting that all my late letters have been as expressive of my want of powder and arms as i could paint them and that mr hooper was to set off in a day or two i thought it unnecessary to run the continent to the expence of an express merely to repeat what i had so often done before when i am certain that congress knowing our necessities will delay no time that can possibly be avoided in supplying them my duty is offered to congress and with great respect and esteem i have the honor c p s hearing of the arrival of a small parcel of powder in connecticut i have been able to obtain  000 weight of it which is in addition to the  0 barrels before mentioned george washington    february      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull cambridge    february      sir i am grieved to find that instead of six or eight thousand weight of powder which i fondly expected to receive from providence agreeable to your letter that i am likely to get only      lbs including the  000 weight belonging to this province if to be had  my situation in respect to this article is really     distressing and while common prudence obliges me to keep my want of it concealed to avoid a discovery thereof to the enemy i feel the bad effect of that concealment from our friends for not believing our distress equal to what it really is they withhold such small supplies as are in their power to give i am restrained in all my military movements for want of these necessary supplies that it is impossible to undertake any thing effectual and whilst i am fretting at my own disagreeable situation the world i suppose is not behind hand in censuring my inactivity a golden opportunity has been lost perhaps to not be regained again this year the late freezing weather had formed some pretty strong ice from dorchester to boston neck and from roxbury to the common which would have afforded a less dangerous approach to the town than through the lines or by water the advantages of this added to a thorough conviction of the importance of destroying the ministerial troops in boston before they can be reinforced and to a belief that a bold and resolute assault aided in some small degree by artillery and mortars might be crowned with success i proposed the attempt a day or two ago to the general officers but they thought and perhaps rightly that such an enterprise in our present weak state of men for the militia are not yet half arrived and deficiency of powder would be attended with too much hazard and therefore that we had better wait the arrival of the last and then to begin a bombardment in earnest this matter is mentioned to you in confidence—your   0 zeal activity and attachment to the cause renders it unnecessary to conceal it from you or our real stock of powder which after furnishing the militia unfortunately coming in without and will require upwards of fifty barrells and compleating our other troops to    rounds a man which are less by one half than the regulars have and having a few rounds of cannon cartridges fitted for immediate use will leave us not more than   0 barrells in store for the greatest emergency inclusive of the      lbs from providence if we get it this my dear sir is melancholy but it is a truth and at the same time that it may serve to convey some idea of my disagreeable feelings under a knowledge of it will evince the necessity of vigorous exertions to throw without delay every oz that can be procured into this camp otherwise the great expence of sending in the militia will be entirely sunk without any possible good resulting from it but much evil as they will contribute not a little to the consumption of our ammunition c c for want perhaps of better information i cannot help giving it as my opinion that at a time when our military operations are entirely at a stand for want of powder principally and arms  it is inconsistent     with good policy to hoard up town stocks with either better it is to fight an enemy at a distance than at ones door prudence indeed points out the expediency of providing for private as well as publick exigencies but if both are not to be done i should think there can be no hesitation in the choice as the army now raised and supported at a considerable expence can be of little use if it is not sufficient to prevent an enemy from disturbing the quiet of the interior towns of these governments i am c      george washington    february      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    february      sir i had the honor of addressing you on the   th and   st instt by mr hooper since which nothing material has occurred we are making every necessary preparation for taking possession of dorchester heights as soon as possible with a view of drawing the enemy out—how far our expectations may be answered time can only determine but i should think if any thing will induce them to hazard an engagement it will be our attempting to fortifie these heights as on that events taking place we shall be able to command a     great part of the town and almost the whole harbor and to make them rather disagreeable than otherwise provided we can get a sufficient supply of what we greatly want within three or four days i have received sundry accounts from boston of such movements there such as taking the mortars from bunker hill the putting them with several pieces of heavy ordnance on board of ships with a quantity of bedding the ships all taking in water the baking a large quantity of biscuit c as to indicate an embarkation of the troops from thence a mr ides who came out yesterday says that the inhabitants of the town generally believe     that they are about to remove either to new york or virginia and that every vessel in the harbor on tuesday last was taken up for governments service and two months pay advanced them whether they really intend to embark or whether the whole is a feint is impossible for me to tell however i have thought it expedient to send an express to genl lee to inform him of it in order that he may not be taken by surprize if their destination should be against new york and continued him on to you if they do embark i think the possessing themselves of that place and the north river is the object they have in view thereby securing the communication with canada and rendering the intercourse between the northern and southern united colonies exceedingly precarious and difficult to prevent them from effecting their plan is a matter of the highest importance and will require a large and respectable army and the most vigilant and judicious exertions since i wrote by mr hooper some small parcels of powder have arrived from connecticut which will give us a little assistance on thursday night a party of our men at roxbury made the enemys out sentries consisting of a corporal and two privates prisoners without firing a gun or giving the least alarm i shall be as attentive to the enemies motions as i can and obtain all the intelligence in my power and if i find em embark shall in the most expeditious manner detach a part of the light troops to new york and repair thither myself if circumstances shall     require it i shall be better able to judge what to do when the matter happens at present i can only say that i will do every thing that shall appear proper and necessary your letter of the   th inst by coll bull came to hand yesterday evening and shall agreeable to your recommendation pay proper notice to him the supply of cash came very seasonably as our treasury was just exhausted and nothing can be done here without it p s this letter was intended to have been sent by express but meeting with a private conveyance the express was countermanded  george washington    february      cambridge majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee cambridge    february      dear sir i received your esteemed favor of the   th instant which gave me great pleasure being impatient to hear from you i rejoice to find that you are getting better and could not avoid laughing at captain parkers reasons for not putting his repeated threats into execution      i take notice of your intended dispositions for defence which i request you will lose no time in putting into execution as from many corroborating accounts i have received the enemy seem to prepare for their departure from boston they have removed the two mortars from bunkers hill and carried them with a great part of their heavy brass cannon on board their ships they have taken all the topsail vessels in the harbor into the service they are ready watered and their sails bent all this show may be but a feint but if real and they should come your way i wish you may be prepared to receive them if i find that they are in earnest and do go off i will immediately send you a reinforcement from this camp and if necessary march the main body to your assistance as circumstances may require i shall keep a good watch on their motions and give you the speediest information possible lechmeres point is now very strong i am sending some heavy cannon thither the platform for a     mortar is preparing to be placed in the works there another at lambs dam and we are making the necessary disposition to possess ourselves of dorchester heights which must bring them on if any thing will  if they do not interrupt us in that work i shall be confirmed in my opinion that they mean to leave the town a little time must now determine whether they are resolved to maintain their present ground or look out for another post i will now return to your letter the account you give of our new york brethren is very satisfactory i should be glad to know how many men you are likely to have that you can depend upon remaining with you i very much fear that the sailing of clinton will keep back those whom you expected from pennsylvania let me hear from you upon this and every thing else that concerns you as soon and as often as you possibly can i shall pay due attention to your recommendations of captain smyth and capt     badlam with respect to the canada expedition i assure you that it was not my intention to propose your going there i only meant what i thought would happen that the congress would make you that proposal i am now of opinion that you will have work enough upon your hands where you are and make no doubt but your presence will be as necessary there as it would be in canada  i am glad that colonel ritzema is gone to congress and hope they will expedite an army thither not only to preserve what we have already got but also to possess ourselves of quebec before it can be reinforced from europe or elsewhere it is an object of such vast importance that it will be madness not to strain every sinew for effecting that purpose i am in some pain for our little fleet as i am informed that the     asia and phœnix are sailed in quest of them  you doubtless had good reasons for the appointment you mention having made  as it is temporary it can have no bad effect i am with great regard c    0 george washington    february      cambridge phillis wheatley to miss phillis wheatley cambridge    february      miss phillis your favor of the   th of october did not reach my hands till the middle of december time enough you will say to have given an answer ere this granted but a variety of important occurrences continually interposing to distract the mind and withdraw the attention i hope will apologize for the delay and plead my excuse for the seeming but not real neglect i thank you most sincerely for your polite notice of me in the elegant lines you enclosed     and however undeserving i may be of such encomium and panegyric the style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your poetical talents in honor of which and as a tribute justly due to you i would have published the poem had i not been apprehensive that while i only meant to give the world this new instance of your genius i might have incurred the imputation of vanity this and nothing else determined me not to give it place in the public prints if you should ever come to cambridge or near headquarters i shall be happy to see a person so favored by the muses and to whom nature has been     so liberal and beneficent in her dispensations i am with great respect your obedient humble servant      george washington   march      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge   march      dear sir the foregoing  was intended for another conveyance but being hurried with some other matters and not     able to complete it it was delayed since which your favors of the   th of january and  st and  th of february are come to hand for the agreeable accounts contained in one of them of your progress in the manufacture of powder and prospect of getting arms i am obliged to you as there is some consolation in knowing that these useful articles will supply the wants of some part of the continental troops although i feel too sensibly the mortification of having them withheld from me congress not even thinking it necessary to take the least notice of my application for these things i hope in a few nights to be in readiness to take post on dorchester as we are using every means in our power to provide materials for this purpose the ground being so hard froze yet that we cannot intrench and therefore are obliged to depend entirely upon chandeliers fascines and screwed hay for our redoubts it is expected that this work will bring on an action between the kings troops and ours general lees expedition to new york was founded upon indubitable evidence of general clintons being on the point of sailing no place so likely for his destination as new york nor no place where a more capital blow could be given to the interests of america than there common prudence therefore dictated the necessity of preventing an evil which might have proved irremediable had it happened but i confess to you honestly i had no idea of running the continent to the expense which was incurred or that such a body of troops would go from     connecticut as did or be raised upon the terms they were you must know my good sir that captain sears was here with some other gentlemen of connecticut when the intelligence of clintons embarkation at least the embarkation of the troops came to hand the situation of these lines would not afford a detachment new york could not be depended upon and of the troops in jersey we had no certain information either of their numbers or destination what then was to be done why sears and these other gentlemen assured me that if the necessity of the case was signified by me and general lee should be sent one thousand volunteers requiring no pay but supplied with provisions only would march immediately to new york and defend the place till congress could determine what should be done and that a line from me to governor trumbull to obtain his sanction would facilitate the measure this i accordingly wrote in precise terms intending that these volunteers and such of the jersey regiments as could be speedily assembled should be thrown into the city for its defence and for disarming the tories upon long island who i understood had become extremely insolent and daring when behold instead of volunteers consisting of gentlemen without pay the governor directed men to be voluntarily enlisted for this service upon continental pay and allowance this you will observe was contrary to my expectation and plan yet as i thought it a matter of the last importance to secure the command of the north river i did not think it expedient to     countermand the raising of the connecticut regiments on account of the pay if i have done wrong those members of congress who think the matter ought to have been left to them must consider my proceedings as an error of judgment and that a measure is not always to be judged of by the event it is moreover worthy of consideration that in cases of extreme necessity as the present nothing but decision can ensure success and certain i am that clinton had something more in view by peeping into new york than to gratify his curiosity or make a friendly visit to his friend mr tryon however i am not fond of stretching my powers and if the congress will say thus far and no farther you shall go i will promise not to offend whilst i continue in their service i observe what you say in respect to my wagon i wanted nothing more than a light travellingwagon such as those of new jersey with a secure cover which might be under lock and key the hinges being on one side the lock on the other i have no copy of the memorandum of the articles which i desired you to provide for me but think one dozen and a half of camp stools a folding table rather two plates and dishes were among them what i meant therefore was that the bed of this wagon should be constructed in such a manner as to stow these things to the best advantage if you cannot get them with you i shall despair of providing them here as workmen are scarce and most exorbitantly high in their     charges what i should aim at is when the wagon and things are ready which ought to be very soon as i do not know how soon we may beat a march to buy a pair of clever horses of the same color hire a careful driver and let the whole come off at once and then they are ready for immediate service i have no doubt but that the treasury by application to mr hancock will direct payment thereof without any kind of difficulty as congress must be sensible that i cannot take the field without equipage and after i have once got into a tent i shall not soon quit it i am c      george washington   march      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   march      sir on the   th ultimo i had the honor of addressing you and then mentioned that we were making preparations for taking possession of dorchester heights i now beg leave to inform you that a council of general officers having determined a previous bombardment and cannonade expedient and proper in order to harass the enemy and divert their attention from that quarter on saturday sunday and monday nights last we carried them on from our posts at cobble hill lechmeres point and lambs dam  whether they did the enemy any considerable and what injury i have not yet heard but have the pleasure to acquaint you that they greatly facilitated our schemes and would have been attended with success equal to our most sanguine expectations had it not been for the unlucky bursting of two thirteen and three ten inch mortars among which was the brass one taken in the ordnance brig to what cause to attribute this misfortune i know not whether to any defect in them or to the inexperience of the bombardiers     but to return on monday evening as soon as our firing commenced a considerable detachment of our men under the command of brigadiergeneral thomas crossed the neck and took possession of the two hills without the least interruption or annoyance from the enemy and by their great activity and industry before the morning advanced the works so far as to be secure against their shot they are now going on with such expedition that in a little time i hope they will be complete and enable our troops stationed there to make a vigorous and obstinate stand during the whole cannonade which was incessant the two last nights we were fortunate enough to lose but two men one a lieutenant by a cannonball taking off his thigh the other a private by the explosion of a shell which also slightly wounded four or five more our taking possession of dorchester heights is only preparatory to taking post on nooks hill and the points opposite to the south end of boston it was absolutely necessary that they should be previously fortified in order to cover and command them as soon as the works on the former are finished measures will be immediately adopted for securing the latter and making them as strong and defensible as we can their contiguity to the enemy will make them of much importance and of great service to us as mortars are essential and indispensably necessary for carrying on our operations and for the prosecution of our plans i have applied to two furnaces to have some thirteeninch ones cast with all   0 expedition imaginable and am encouraged to hope from the accounts i have had that they will be able to do it when they are done and a proper supply of powder obtained i flatter myself from the posts we have just taken and are about to take that it will be in our power to force the ministerial troops to an attack or to dispose of them in some way that will be of advantage to us i think from these posts they will be so galled and annoyed that they must either give us battle or quit their present possessions i am resolved that nothing on my part shall be wanting to effect the one or the other it having been the general opinion that the enemy would attempt to dislodge our people from the hills and force their works as soon as they were discovered which probably might have brought on a general engagement it was thought advisable that the honorable council  should be applied to to order in the militia from the neighboring and adjacent towns i wrote them on the subject which they most readily complied with and in justice to the militia i cannot but inform you that they came in at the appointed time and manifested the greatest alertness and determined resolution to have acted like men engaged in the cause of freedom  when the enemy first discovered our works in the morning they seemed to be in great confusion and     from their movements to have intended an attack it is much to be wished that it had been made the event i think must have been fortunate and nothing less than success and victory on our side as our officers and men appeared impatient for the appeal and to possess the most animated sentiments and determined resolution on tuesday evening a considerable number of their troops embarked on board of their transports and fell down to the castle where part of them landed before dark one or two of the vessels got aground and were fired at by our people with a fieldpiece but without any damage what was the design of this embarkation and landing i have not been able to learn it would seem as if they meant an attack for it is most probable that if they make one on our works at dorchester at this time they will first go to the castle and come from thence if such was their design a violent storm that night and which lasted till eight oclock the next day rendered the execution of it impracticable it carried one or two of their vessels ashore which they have since got off      in case the ministerial troops had made an attempt to dislodge our men from dorchester hills and the number detached upon the occasion had been so great as to have afforded a probability of a successful attacks being made upon boston on a signal given from roxbury for that purpose agreeably to a settled and concerted plan four thousand chosen men who were held in readiness were to have embarked at the mouth of cambridge river in two divisions the first under the command of brigadiergeneral sullivan the second under brigadiergeneral greene the whole to have been commanded by majorgeneral putnam the first division was to land at the powderhouse and gain possession of beacon hill and mount horam the second at bartons point or a little south of it and after securing that post to join the other division and force the enemys gates and works at the neck for letting in the roxbury troops three floating batteries were to have preceded and gone in front of the other boats and kept up a heavy fire on that part of the town where our men were to land how far our views would have succeeded had an opportunity offered for attempting the execution it is impossible for me to say nothing less than experiment could determine with precision the plan was thought to be well digested and as far as     i could judge from the cheerfulness and alacrity which distinguished the officers and men who were to engage in the enterprise i had reason to hope for a favorable and happy issue the militia who were ordered in from the adjacent towns brought with them three days provision they were only called upon to act under the idea of an attacks being immediately made and were all discharged this afternoon i beg leave to remind congress that three majorgenerals are essential and necessary for this army and that by general lees being called from hence to the command in canada the left division is without one i hope they will fill up the vacancy by the appointment of another general thomas is the first brigadier stands fair in point of reputation and is esteemed a brave and good officer  if he is promoted there will be a vacancy in the brigadiergenerals which it will be necessary to supply by the appointment of some other gentleman that shall be agreeable to congress but justice requires me to mention that william thompson of the rifle regiment is the first colonel in this department and as far as i have had an opportunity of judging is a good officer and a man of courage what i have said of these two gentlemen i conceive to be my duty at the same time acknowledging     whatever promotions are made will be satisfactory to me march  th yesterday evening a captain irvine who escaped from boston the night before with six of his crew came to head quarters and gave the following intelligence— that our bombardment and cannonade caused a good deal of surprize and alarm in town as many of the soldiery said they never heard or thought we had mortars or shells that several of the officers acknowledged they were well and properly directed that they made much distress and confusion that the cannon shot for the greatest part went thro the houses and he was told that one took off the legs and arms of six men lying in the barracks on the neck that a soldier who came from the lines there on tuesday morning informed him that  0 men had been wounded the night before it was reported that others were also hurt and one of the light horse torn to pieces by the explosion of a shell this was afterwards contradicted that early on tuesday morning admiral shuldham discovering the works our people were throwing up on dorchester heights immediately sent an express to general howe to inform him and that it was necessary they should be attacked and dislodged from thence or he would be under the necessity of withdrawing the ships from the harbor which were under his command that preparations were directly made for that purpose as it was said and from twelve to two oclock about  000 men embarked on board the transport which fell down to the castle with a design of landing on that part of dorchester next to it and attacking the works on the heights at   oclock next morning that lord percy was appointed to command that it was generally believed the attempt would have been made had it not been for the violent storm which happened that night as i have mentioned before that he heard several of the privates and one or two sergeants say as they were embarking that it would be another bunker hill affair he further informs that the army is preparing to leave boston and that they will do it in a day or two that the     transports necessary for their embarkation were getting ready with the utmost expedition that there had been great movements and confusion among the troops the night and day preceding his coming out in hurrying down their cannon artillery and other stores to the wharves with the utmost precipitation and were putting em on board the ships in such haste that no account or memorandum was taken of them that most of the cannon were removed from their works and embarked or embarking that he heard a woman say which he took to be an officers wife that she had seen men go under the ground at the lines on the neck without returning that the ship he commanded was taken up places fitted and fitting for officers to lodge and several shot shells and cannon already on board that the tories were to have the liberty of going where they please if they can get seamen to man the vessels of which there was a great scarcity that on that account many vessels could not be carried away and would be burnt that many of the inhabitants apprehended the town would be destroyed and that it was generally thought their destination is halifax the account given by captain irvine as to the embarkation and their being about to leave the town i believe true there are other circumstances corroborating and it seems fully confirmed by a paper signed by four of the selectmen of the town a copy of which i have the honor to enclose to you which was brought on yesterday evening by a flag and delivered to colonel learned by major bassett of the tenth regiment who desired it might be delivered me as soon as possible i advised with such of the general officers upon the occasion as i could immediately assemble and we determined it right as it was not addressed to me nor to any one else nor authenticated by the signature of general howe or any other act obliging him to a performance of the     promise mentioned on his part that i should give it no answer at the same time that a letter should be returned as going from colonel learned signifying his having laid it before me with the reasons assigned for not answering it a copy of this is sent  tonight i shall have a battery thrown up on     nooks hill dorchester point with a design of acting as circumstances may require it being judged advisable to prosecute our plans of fortification as we intended before this information from the selectmen came it being agreed on all hands that there is no possibility     of stopping them in case they determine to go i shall order lookouts to be kept upon all the headlands to discover their movements and course and moreover direct commodore manly and his little     squadron to dog them as well for the same purpose as for picking up any of their vessels that may chance to depart their convoy from their loading with such precipitancy it is presumable they ll not be in the best condition for sea if the ministerial troops evacuate the town and leave it standing i have thoughts of taking measures for fortifying the entrance into the harbor if it shall be thought proper and the situation of affairs will admit of it notwithstanding the report from boston that halifax is the place of their destination i have no doubt but that they are going to the southward and i apprehend to new york many reasons lead to this opinion it is in some measure corroborated by their sending an express ship there which on wednesday week got on shore and bilged at cape cod the despatches if written were destroyed when she was boarded she had a parcel of coal and about four thousand cannonshot six carriageguns a swivel or two and three barrels of powder i shall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops in readiness to march at a moments warning and govern my movements by the events that happen or such orders as i may receive from congress which i beg may be ample and forwarded with all possible expedition on the  th inst a ship bound from london with stores for the ministerial army consisting of coal porter and krout fell in with our armed vessels four of them in company and was carried   0 into portsmouth she had had a long passage and of course brought no papers of a late date the only letters of importance or the least interesting that were found i have enclosed i beg leave to mention to congress that money is much wanted the militia from these governments engaged till the first of april are then to be paid and if we march from hence the expence will be very considerable must be defrayed and cannot be accomplished without it the necessity of making the earliest remittance for these purposes is too obvious for me to add more when i wrote that part of this letter which is antecedent to this date i fully expected it would have gone before now by col bull not deeming it of sufficient importance to send a special messenger but he deferred his return from time to time and never set off till today these reasons i hope will excuse the delay and be received as a proper apology for not transmitting it sooner  george washington   march      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge   march      dear sir the rumpus which every body expected to see between the ministerialists in boston and our troops has detained the bearer till this time on monday night i took possession of the heights of dorchester with two thousand men under the command of general     thomas previous to this and in order to divert the enemys attention from the real object and to harass we began on saturday night a cannonade and bombardment which with intervals was continued through the night—the same on sunday and on monday a continued roar from seven oclock till daylight was kept up between the enemy and us in this time we had an officer and one private killed and four or five wounded and through the ignorance i suppose of our artillerymen burst five mortars two thirteen inch and three ten inch the congress  one of them what damage the enemy has sustained is not known as there has not been a creature out of boston since the cannonade c except in the destruction of the mortars answered our expectations fully for although we had upwards of  00 teams in motion at the same instant carrying on our fascines and other materials to the neck and the moon shining in its full lustre we were not discovered till daylight on tuesday morning so soon as we were discovered every thing seemed to be prepared for an attack but the tide failing before they were ready about one thousand only were able to embark in six transports in the afternoon and these falling down towards the castle were drove on shore by a violent storm which arose in the afternoon of that day and continued through the night since that they have been seen returning to boston and whether from an apprehension that     our works are now too formidable to make any impression on or from what other causes i know not but their hostile appearances have subsided and they are removing their ammunition out of their magazine whether with a view to move bag and baggage or not i cannot undertake to say but if we had powder and our mortars replaced which i am about to do by new cast ones as soon as possible i would so soon as we were sufficiently strengthened on the heights to take possession of the point just opposite to boston neck give them a dose they would not well like we had prepared boats a detachment of  000 men c c for pushing to the west part of boston if they had made any formidable attack upon dorchester i will not lament or repine at any act of providence because i am in a great measure a convert to mr popes opinion that whatever is is right but i think everything had the appearance of a successful issue if we had come to an engagement on that day it was the  th of march which i recalled to their remembrance as a day never to be forgotten an engagement was fully expected and i never saw spirits higher or more prevailing  your favor of the   th ultimo came to my hands by post last night and gives me much pleasure as i am led to hope i shall see you of my family again the terms upon which you come will be perfectly agreeable to me and i should think you neither candid nor friendly if your communications on this subject     had not been free unreserved and divested of that false kind of modesty which too often prevents the elucidation of points important to be known mr baylor seeming to have an inclination to go into the artillery and colonel knox desirous of it i have appointed mr moylan and mr palfrey my aidsdecamp so that i shall if you come have a good many writers about me i think my countrymen made a capital mistake when they took henry out of the senate to place him in the field and pity it is that he does not see this and remove every difficulty by a voluntary resignation  i am of opinion that colonel armstrong if he retains his health spirits and vigor would be as fit a person as any they could send to virginia as he is senior officer to any now there and i should think could give no offence but to place colonel thompson there in the first command would throw every thing into the utmost confusion for it was by mere chance that he became a colonel upon this expedition and by greater chance that he became first colonel in this army to take him then from another colony     place him over the heads of several gentlemen under or with whom he has served in a low and subordinate character would never answer any other purpose than that of introducing endless confusion such a thing surely cannot be in contemplation and knowing the mischiefs it would produce surely colonel thompson would have more sense and a greater regard for the cause he is engaged in than to accept of it unless some uncommon abilities or exertions had given him a superior claim he must know that nothing more than being a captain of horse in the year      i think it was did very extraordinarily give him the start he now has when the rank was settled here at the same time he must know another fact that several officers now in the virginia service were much his superiors in point of rank and will not i am sure serve under him he stands first colonel here and may i presume put in a very good and proper claim to the first brigade that falls vacant but i hope more regard will be paid to the service than to send him to virginia the bringing of colonel armstrong into this army as majorgeneral however great his merit would introduce much confusion thomas if no more would surely quit and i believe him to be a good man if thomas supplies the place of lee there will be a vacancy for either armstrong or thompson for i have heard of no other valiant son of new england waiting promotion since the advancement of frye who has not and i doubt will not do much service to the cause at present he keeps his room and talks     learnedly of emetics cathartics c for my own part i see nothing but a declining life that matters him  i am sorry to hear of your illfated fleet we had it i suppose because we wished it that hopkins had taken clinton and his transports how glorious would this have been we have the proverb on our side however that a bad beginning will end well this applies to land and sea service the account given of the business of the commissioners from england seems to be of a piece with lord norths conciliatory motion last year built upon the same foundation and if true that they are to be divided among the colonies to offer terms of pardon it is as insulting as that motion  and only designed after stopping all intercourse with us to set us up to view in great britain as a people that will not hearken to any propositions of peace was there ever any thing more absurd than to repeal the very acts which have introduced all this confusion and bloodshed and at the same time enact a law to restrain all intercourse with the colonies for opposing them the drift and design are obvious but is it possible that any sensible nation upon earth can be imposed upon by such a cobweb scheme or gauze covering but enough or else upon a subject so copious i should enter upon my fifth sheet of paper i have if length     of letter will do it already made you ample amend for the silence which my hurry in preparing for what i hoped would be a decisive stroke obliged me to keep my best respects to mrs reed in which mrs washington joins concludes me dear sir c  march  th—colonel bulls still waiting to see a little further into the event of things gives me an opportunity of adding that from a gentleman out of boston confirmed by a paper from the selectmen there we have undoubted information of general howes preparing with great precipitancy to embark     his troops for what place we know not halifax it is said the selectmen being under dreadful apprehensions for the town applied to general robertson to apply to general howe who through general robertson has informed them that it is not his intention to destroy the town unless his majestys troops should be molested during their embarkation or at their departure this paper seems so much under covert unauthenticated and addressed to nobody that i sent word to the selectmen that i could take no notice of it but i shall go on with my preparations as intended the gentlemen above mentioned out of boston say that they seem to be in great consternation there that one of our shot from lambs dam disabled six men in their beds and that the admiral upon discovering our works next morning informed the general that unless we were dispossessed of them he could not keep the kings ships in the harbor and that three thousand men commanded by lord percy were actually embarked for that purpose of the issue of it you have been informed before i am c george washington    march      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    march      sir in my letter of the  th and  th instant which i had the honor of addressing you i mentioned the intelligence i had received respecting the embarkation of the troops from boston and fully expected before this that the town would have been entirely evacuuated     although i have been deceived and was rather premature in the opinion i had then formed i have little reason to doubt but the event will take place in a very short time as other accounts which have come to hand since the sailing of a great number of transports from the harbor to nantasket road and many circumstances corresponding therewith seem to confirm and render it unquestionable whether the town will be destroyed is a matter of much uncertainty but it would seem from the destruction they are making of sundry pieces of furniture of many of their wagons and carts which they cannot take with them as it is said that it will not for if they intended it the whole might be involved in one general ruin holding it of the last importance in the present contest that we should secure new york and prevent the enemy from possessing it and conjecturing they have views of that sort and their embarkation to be for that purpose i judged it necessary under the situation of things here to call a council of general officers to consult of such measures as might be expedient to be taken at this interesting conjuncture of affairs a copy of the proceedings i have the honor to enclose to you agreeable to the opinion of the council i shall detach the rifle regiment tomorrow under the command of brigadiergeneral sullivan with orders to repair to new york with all possible expedition and which will be succeeded the day after by the other five in one brigade they being all that it was thought     advisable to send from hence till the enemy shall have quitted the town immediately upon their departure i shall send forward majorgeneral putnam and follow myself with the remainder of the army as soon as i have it in my power leaving here such a number of men as circumstances may seem to require as the badness of the roads at this season will greatly retard the march of our men i have by advice of the general officers written to governor trumbull by this express to use his utmost exertions for throwing a reinforcement of two thousand men into new york from the western parts of connecticut  and to the commanding officer there to apply to the provincial convention or committee of safety of new jersey for a thousand more for the same purpose to oppose the enemy and prevent their getting possession in case they arrive before the troops from hence can get there of which there is a probability unless they are impeded by contrary winds this measure though it may be attended with considerable expense i flatter myself will meet with the approbation of congress past experience and the lines in boston and on boston neck point out the propriety and suggest the necessity of keeping our enemies from gaining possession and making a lodgment   0 should their destination be further southward or for halifax as reported in boston for the purpose of going into canada the march of our troops to new york will place them nearer the scene of action and more convenient for affording succour we have not taken post on nooks hill and fortified it as mentioned that we should in my last on hearing that the enemy were about to retreat and leave the town it was thought imprudent and unadvisable to force them with too much precipitation that we might gain a little time and prepare for a march tomorrow evening we shall take possession of it unless they are gone as new york is of such importance prudence and policy require that every precaution that can be devised should be adopted to frustrate the designs which the enemy have of possessing it to this end i have ordered vessels to be provided and held ready at norwich for the embarkation and transportation of our troops thither this i have done with a view not only of greatly expediting their arrival as it will save several days marching but also that they may be fresh and fit for intrenching and throwing up works of defence as soon as they get there if they do not meet the enemy to contend with for neither of which would they be in a proper condition after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads if wallace with his ships should be apprized of the measure and attempt to prevent it by stopping up the harbor of new london they can but pursue their march by land you will please to observe that it is the opinion of     the general officers if the enemy abandon the town that it will be unnecessary to employ or keep any part of this army for its defence and that i have mentioned on that event happening i shall immediately repair to new york with the remainder of the army not now detached leaving only such a number of men here as circumstances may seem to require what i partly allude to is that—as it will take a considerable time for the removal of such a body of men and the divisions must precede each other in such order as to allow intermediate time sufficient for them to be covered and provided for and many things done previous to the march of the whole for securing and forwarding such necessaries as cannot be immediately carried and others which it may be proper to keep here—directions might be received from congress respecting the same and as many men ordered to remain for that and other purposes as they may judge proper i could wish to have their commands upon the subject and in time as i may be under some degree of embarrassment as to their views congress having been pleased to appoint colonel thompson a brigadiergeneral there is a vacancy for a colonel in the regiment he commanded to which i would beg leave to recommend lieutenantcolonel hand i shall also take the liberty of recommending captain hugh stephenson of the virginia riflemen to succeed colonel hand and to be appointed in his place as lieutenantcolonel there being no major to the regiment since the promotion of major magaw to be lieutenantcolonel of one of the pennsylvania     battalions who is gone from hence he is in my opinion the fittest person in this army for it as well as the oldest captain in the service having distinguished himself at the head of a rifle company all the last war and highly merited the approbation of his superior officers col mifflin informed me to day of his having received tent cloths from mr barrell of philadelphia to the amount of £  00 pennsylvania currency and applied for a warrant for payment of it but as our fund is low and many necessary demands against it which must be satisfied and our calls for money are and will be exceedingly great i could not grant it thinking it might be convenient for payment to be made in philadelphia by your order on the treasury there i have the honor c      george washington    march      cambridge to the commanding officer at new york cambridge    march      sir i have stronger reasons since i last wrote to you to confirm me in my opinion that the army under general howe is on its departure all their movements pronounce it but lest it be but a feint i must continue on my guard and not weaken my lines too much until i have a certainty of their departure it is given out that they are bound to halifax but i am of opinion that new york is the place of their destination it is the object worthy of their attention and it is the place that we must use every endeavor to keep from them for should they get that town and the command of the north river they can stop the intercourse between the northern and southern colonies upon which depends the safety of america my feelings upon this subject are so strong that i would not wish to give the enemy a chance of succeeding at your place i shall therefore despatch a regiment and some independent companies of riflemen this day and tomorrow or as soon as it conveniently can be done five more regiments will set out from this camp i cannot part with more while the enemy remain in sight but i have wrote to governor trumbull to send you two thousand men as soon as he possibly can if you can get one thousand from new jersey with the militia of the country called in if not repugnant to the will of congress i think you can make a sufficient stand until i can with the main body of this army     join you which you may depend upon will be as soon as possible after i can with any degree of certainty tell their route the plan of defence formed by general lee is from what little i know of the place a very judicious one i hope nay i dare say it is carrying into execution with spirit and industry you may judge from the enemys keeping so long possession of the town of boston against an army superior in numbers and animated with the noble spirit of liberty i say you may judge by that how much easier it is to keep an enemy from forming a lodgment in a place than it will be to dispossess them when they get themselves fortified as i have in my last told you that the fate of this campaign of course the fate of america depends upon you and the army under your command should the enemy attempt your quarter i will dwell no more thereon though the vast importance of the subject would make an apology for repetitions needless i am sir c      george washington    march      cambridge to the president of congress headquarters cambridge    march      sir it is with the greatest pleasure i inform you that on sunday last the   th instant about nine oclock in the forenoon the ministerial army evacuated the town of boston and that the forces of the united colonies are now in actual possession thereof i beg leave to congratulate you sir and the honorable congress on this happy event and particularly as it was effected without endangering the lives and property of the remaining unhappy inhabitants      i have great reason to imagine their flight was precipitated by the appearance of a work which i had ordered to be thrown up last saturday night on an eminence at dorchester which lies nearest to boston neck called nooks hill the town although it has suffered greatly is not in so bad a state as i expected to find it and i have a particular pleasure in being able to inform you sir that your house has received no damage worth mentioning your furniture is in tolerable order and the family pictures are all left entire and untouched captain cazneau takes charge of the whole until he shall receive further orders from you as soon as the ministerial troops had quitted the town i ordered a thousand men who had had the     smallpox under command of general putnam to take possession of the heights which i shall endeavor to fortify in such a manner as to prevent their return should they attempt it but as they are still in the harbor i thought it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until i should be fully satisfied they had quitted the coast i have therefore only detached five regiments besides the rifle battalion to new york and shall keep the remainder here till all suspicion of their return ceases the situation in which i found their works evidently discovered that their retreat was made with the greatest precipitation they have left their barracks and other works of wood at bunkers hill all standing and have destroyed but a small part of their     lines they have also left a number of fine pieces of cannon which they first spiked up also a very large iron mortar and as i am informed they have thrown another over the end of your wharf i have employed proper persons to drill the cannon and doubt not i shall save the most of them i am not yet able to procure an exact list of all the stores they have left as soon as it can be done i shall take care to transmit it to you from an estimate of what the quartermastergeneral has already discovered the amount will be twentyfive or thirty thousand pounds part of the powder mentioned in yours of the  th instant has already arrived the remainder i have ordered to be stopped on the road as we shall have no occasion for it here the letter to general thomas i immediately sent to him he desired leave for three or four days to settle some of his private affairs after which he will set out for his command in canada  i am happy that my conduct in intercepting lord drummonds letter is approved of by congress i have the honor to be c      proclamation on the evacuation of boston whereas the ministerial army has abandoned the town of boston and the forces of the united colonies under my command are in possession of the same i have therefore thought it necessary for the preservation of peace good order and discipline to publish the following orders that no person offending therein may plead ignorance as an excuse for his misconduct all officers and soldiers are hereby ordered to live in the strictest peace and amity with the inhabitants and no inhabitant or other person employed in his lawful business in the town is to be molested in his person or property on any pretence whatever if any officer or soldier shall presume to strike imprison or otherwise illtreat any of the inhabitants he may depend on being   0 punished with the utmost severity and if any officer or soldier shall receive any insult from any of the inhabitants he is to seek redress in a legal way and no other any noncommissioned officer or soldier or others under my command who shall be guilty of robbing or plundering in the town are to be immediately confined and will be most rigidly punished all officers are therefore ordered to be very vigilant in the discovery of such offenders and report their names and crime to the commanding officer in the town as soon as may be the inhabitants and others are called upon to make known to the quartermastergeneral or any of his deputies all stores belonging to the ministerial army that may be remaining or secreted in the town any person or persons whatsoever that shall be known to conceal any of the said stores or appropriate them to his or their own use will be considered as an enemy to america and treated accordingly the selectmen and other magistrates of the town are desired     to return to the commanderinchief the names of all or any person or persons they may suspect of being employed as spies upon the continental army that they may be dealt with accordingly all officers of the continental army are enjoined to assist the civil magistrates in the execution of their duty and to promote peace and good order they are to prevent as much as possible the soldiers from frequenting tipplinghouses and strolling from their posts particular notice will be taken of such officers as are inattentive and remiss in their duty and on the contrary such only as are active and vigilant will be entitled to future favor and promotion given under my hand at headquarters in cambridge the   st day of march       george washington    march      cambridge to the general court of massachusetts bay cambridge    march      gentlemen ere now i was in hopes of congratulating you on the departure of the ministerial troops not only from your capital but country that they still remain in the harbor after having been five days embarked affords matter of speculation and collected as their force is now of apprehension this circumstance the security of boston by a work on fort hill and the demolition of the lines on the neck and preservation of the stores for continental use belonging to the king by a proper search after them rendered it indispensably necessary for me to throw some troops into the town immediately it coming within the line of my duty but notwithstanding all the precaution which i have endeavored to use to restrain and     limit the intercourse between the town and country and army for a few days i greatly fear that the smallpox will be communicated to both so soon as the fleet sets sail my attention must be turned to another quarter and most of the continental regiments now here must be marched off it may be necessary therefore for you gentlemen to consider the state of your harbor and think of such works as may be found necessary for the defence of it and the town also in case another armed force which i by no means expect should be sent hither i shall leave three or four regiments as circumstances may require for security of the stores and throwing up works as shall be deemed necessary for the purposes above mentioned and shall direct the officer commanding them to receive such instructions in respect to the latter as you may think proper to give it has been suggested to me that in the town of boston there is a good deal of property belonging to refugees and such other inimical persons as from the first of the present dispute have manifested the most unfriendly disposition to the american cause and that part of this property is in such kind of effects as can be easily transported concealed or changed i submit to you therefore gentlemen the expediency of having an inquiry made into this matter before it is too late for redress leaving the decision thereupon after the quantum or value is ascertained and held in a state of durance to the consideration of a future day i have ordered that no violence be offered by the soldiery either to the     property or persons of those people wishing that the matter may be taken into consideration by your honorable body and in such a way as you shall judge most advisable  the enclosed came to me a few days ago and i beg leave to recommend the purport of it to the consideration of the court i shall take the liberty to add as my opinion that the congress expect nothing else than that the fieldofficers of the massachusetts regiments should receive the same pay as those of the other colonies have done and that they expected at the time the pay was fixed fifteen pounds to a colonel twelve pounds to a lieutenantcolonel and ten pounds to a major was the actual establishment of this government i could wish therefore they were allowed it to remove the jealousies and uneasiness     which have arisen i am with great respect and esteem gentlemen c      george washington    march      cambridge governor trumbull to governor trumbull cambridge    march      sir i received your favour of the    inst and concur with you in opinion that their women and children with the tory families will most probably goe to halifax this is what i meant and alluded to having never suspected that they especially the latter would goe to new york i am extreemly obliged by your friendly hint and shall ever receive them with pleasure but i do not think that they were apprehensive of an attack from our side but rather preparing to make one however let their designs have been what they may i have the satisfaction to inform you that on sunday morning last they totally evacuated the town and we are now in full possession upon which event i beg leave to congratulate you and more so as the town is in a much better situation than was expected added to this they have left by means of their precipitate retreat stores of one kind  another to a pretty considerable amount a particular detail of which or estimation of there value i have not yet got—notwithstanding they have abandoned the town and there have been favorable winds for their departure they are still lying with their fleet in nantasket road but for what purpose is a matter of much conjecture some suposing their vessels to have been loaded with such hurry and confusion as to be unfit for sea and to require sundry things and arrangements to be settled previous to their goeing out but for my own     part i cannot but suspect they are waiting for some opportunity to give us a stroke at a moment when they conceive us to be off our guard in order to retrieve the honor they have lost by their shamefull and scandelous retreat diminishing from that lustre and renown which british armies were wont to boast and justly claimed as their right—suspecting them of such motives i shall not detach any more of the army than what is gone already untill they have taken their departure and quitted the coast i heartily thank you for your kind attention to my last requisition and am glad that the companies you have ordered are of the militia the trouble and inconveniences occasioned by them being far less than what generally attend voluntiers—nothing but necessity and the importance of new york to us in the present contest could have induced the application and therefore as soon as they can be spared by the arrival of our army they will be at liberty to return home to their common and necessary employments except such as may chuse to inlist and continue in service in compliance with your request i shall direct the troops or some of them that goe from hence after the ministerial fleet are gone to pursue their rout on or near the sea coast if they can be accommodated with covering and provision that they may be ready to oppose the enemy in case they make any attempt upon your colony about the time of their goeing tho that is what i do not apprehend i rather suppose when they once set out that they will     repair to new york or where ever bound with all posible dispatch to secure the place they are destined for by surprize lest preparations shoud be made to receive  prevent them i am sir c  george washington    march      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge    march      sir when i had the honor to address you on the   th instant upon the evacuation of the town of boston by the ministerial army i fully expected as their retreat and embarkation were hurried and precipitate that before now they would have departed the harbor and been far on their passage to the place of destination but to my surprise and disappointment the fleet is still in nantasket road the purpose inducing their stay is altogether unknown nor can i suggest any satisfactory reason for it on wednesday night last before the whole of the fleet fell down to nantasket they demolished the castle     and houses belonging to it by burning them down and the several fortifications they left a great number of the cannon but have rendered all of them except a very few entirely useless by breaking off the trunnions and those they spiked up but may be made serviceable again some are already done there are several vessels in the docks which were taken by the enemy some with and others without cargoes which different persons claim as their property and right are they to be restored to the former owners on making proof of their title or to belong to the continent as captures made from the enemy i wish congress would direct a mode of proceeding against them and establish a rule for decision they appear to me to be highly necessary in like manner some of the cannon which are in boston are said to have come from the castle supposing them with those remaining at the castle to have been purchased by and provided originally at the expense of this province are they now to be considered as belonging to it or to the public i beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of congress and pray their direction how i am to conduct respecting them it having been suggested to me that there was considerable property c belonging to persons who had from the first of the present unhappy contest manifested an unfriendly and inveterate disposition in the town of boston i thought it prudent to write to the honorable general court upon the subject that it might be inquired after and secured a copy of the letter i herewith send you and submit it to     congress whether they will not determine how it is to be disposed of and as to the appropriation of the money arising from the sale of the same as soon as the town was abandoned by the enemy i judged it advisable to secure the several heights lest they should attempt to return and for this purpose have caused a large and strong work to be thrown up on fort hill a post of great importance as it commands the whole harbor and when fortified if properly supported will greatly annoy any fleet the enemy may send against the town and render the landing of their troops exceedingly difficult if not impracticable this work is almost done and in a little time will be complete and that the communication between the town and country may be free and open i have ordered all the lines upon the neck to be immediately destroyed and the other works on the sides of the town facing the country that the inhabitants from the latter may not be impeded but afforded an easy entrance in case the enemy should gain possession at any future time these matters i conceived to be within the line of my duty of which i advised the general court and recommended to their attention such other measures as they might think necessary for securing the town against the hostile designs of the enemy i have just got an inventory of stores and property belonging to the crown which the enemy left in boston at the castle and bunkers hill which i have the honor to transmit to you and shall give strict orders that a careful attention be had to any   0 more that may be found i shall take such precautions respecting them that they may be secure and turn to the public advantage as much as possible or as circumstances will admit of a mr bullfinch from boston who acted as clerk to mr — having put into my hands a list of rations drawn the saturday before the troops evacuated the town i have enclosed it for your inspection he says neither the staff officers or women are included in the list from which it appears that their number was greater than we had an idea of  majorgeneral ward and brigadiergeneral frye are desirous of leaving the service and for that purpose have requested me to lay the matter before congress that they may be allowed to resign their commissions  the papers containing their applications you will herewith receive these will give you a full and more particular information upon the subject and therefore i shall take the liberty of referring you to them i would mention to congress that the commissary of artillery stores has informed me that whatever powder has been sent to the camp has always come without any bill ascertaining the number of casks or quantity this it is probable has proceeded from forgetfulness or inattention in the persons appointed to send it or to the negligence of those who brought it tho they have declared otherwise and that they never had any as it may prevent in some measure embezzlements tho i do not     suspect any to have been made and the commissary will know what and how much to receive and be enabled to discover mistakes if any should happen i shall be glad if you will direct a bill of parcels to be always sent in future there have been so many accounts from england all agreeing that commissioners are coming to america to propose terms for an accommodation as they say that i am inclined to think the time of their arrival not very far off if they come to boston which probably will be the case if they come to america at all i shall be under much embarrassment respecting the manner of receiving them and the mode of treatment that ought to be used  i therefore pray that congress will give me directions and point out the line of conduct to be pursued whether they are to be considered as ambassadors and to have a pass or permit for repairing through the country to philadelphia or     to any other place or whether they are to be restrained in any and what manner i shall anxiously wait their orders and whatever they are comply with them literally i have the honor c  george washington    march      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge    march      my dear sir since my last things remain nearly in statu quo the enemy have the best knack at puzzling people i ever met with in my life they have blown up burnt and demolished the castle totally and are now all in nantasket road they have been there ever since wednesday what they are doing the     lord knows various are the conjectures the bostonians think their stay absolutely necessary to fit them for sea as the vessels neither in themselves nor their lading were in any degree fit for a voyage having been loaded in great haste and much disorder this opinion is corroborated by a deserter from one of the transports who says they have yards booms and bowsprits yet to fix others again think that they have a mind to pass over the equinoctial gale before they put out not being in the best condition to stand one others that they are a reinforcement which i believe has arrived as i have had an account of the sailing of fifteen vessels from the west indies but my opinion of the matter is that they want to retrieve their disgrace before they go     off and i think a favorable opportunity presents itself to them they have now got their whole force into one collected body and no posts to guard we have detached six regiments to new york and have many points to look to and on monday next ten regiments of militia which were brought in to serve till the first of april will be disengaged  from former experience we have found it as practicable to stop a torrent as these people when their time is up if this should be the case now what more favorable opening can the enemy wish for to make a push upon our lines nay upon the back of our lines at roxbury as they can land two miles from them and pass behind i am under more apprehension from them now than ever and am taking every precaution i can to guard against the evil but we have a kind of people to deal with who will not fear danger till the bayonet is at their breast and then they are susceptible enough of it i am fortifying fort hill in boston and demolishing the lines on the neck there as they are a defence against the country only and     making such other dispositions as appear necessary for a general defence i can spare no more men till i see the enemys back fairly turned and then i shall hasten towards new york you mention mr webb in one of your letters for an assistant  he will be agreeable enough to me if you think him qualified for the business what kind of a hand he writes i know not i believe but a cramped one latterly none at all as he has either the gout or rheumatism or both he is a man fond of company and gayety and is of a tender constitution whether therefore such a person would answer your purpose so well as a plodding methodical person whose sole business should be to arrange his papers in such order as to produce any one at any instant it is called for and capable at the same time of composing a letter is what you have to consider i can only add that i have no one in view myself and wish you success in your choice being with great truth and sincerity dear sir your affectionate servant p s i have taken occasion to hint to a certain gentleman in this camp without introducing names my apprehensions of his being concerned in trade he protests most solemnly that he is not directly nor indirectly and derives no other profit than the congress allows him for defraying the expenses to wit   per cent on the goods purchased      george washington   th day of march      cambridge thomas mifflin to colonel thomas mifflin quartermastergeneral instructions as the motions of the enemy and the operations of the ensuing campaign render it indispensably necessary that a very large body of troops should be immediately assembled at or near new york you will immediately proceed to norwich in connecticut where you will in concert with the brigadiergenerals heath and sullivan regulate the embarkation of the brigades under their command and settle all such matters with the commissarygeneral of provisions and contracts for the transports as may be further necessary for expediting the march of the rest of the army with the stores artillery and camp equipage this being done you will proceed without delay to new york where your first care will be to provide barracks for the troops firing forage and quarters for the general officers fix upon a proper house or houses for a general hospital and stabling for the continental draughthorses intrenching tools must also be immediately provided with a sufficient quantity of joists and planks for platforms and timber for guncarriages in short every article necessary for the public service and which your experience in the last campaign convinces you will be wanted in that now approaching the variety of the business of your department renders it next to impossible to point out particularly every duty of your office therefore a latitude is given you in these orders and instructions which together with the directions and advice of the commanding general at new york must be the rule for the future regulation of your conduct and i shall at present only recommend that the same integrity zeal diligence and activity which has animated your past services may govern that which is to come given at headquarters in cambridge this   th day of march           george washington answer to an address from the general assembly of massachusetts gentlemen i return you my most sincere and hearty thanks for your polite address and feel myself called upon by every principle of gratitude to acknowledge the     honor you have done me in this testimonial of your approbation of my appointment to the exalted station i now fill and what is more pleasing of my conduct in discharging its important duties when the councils of the british nation had formed a plan for enslaving america and depriving her sons of their most sacred and invaluable privileges against the clearest remonstrances of the constitution of justice and of truth and to execute their schemes had appealed to the sword i esteemed it my duty to take a part in the contest and more especially on account of my being called thereto by the unsolicited suffrages of the representatives of a free people wishing for no other reward than that arising from a conscientious discharge of the important trust and that my services might contribute to the establishment of freedom and peace upon a permanent foundation     and merit the applause of my countrymen and every virtuous citizen your acknowledgment of my attention to the civil constitution of this colony whilst acting in the line of my department also demands my grateful thanks a regard to every provincial institution where not incompatible with the common interest i hold a principle of duty and of policy and it shall ever form a part of my conduct had i not learnt this before the happy experience of the advantages resulting from a friendly intercourse with your honorable body their ready and willing concurrence to aid and to counsel whenever called upon in cases of difficulty and emergency would have taught me the useful lesson that the metropolis of your colony is now relieved from the cruel and oppressive invasions of those who were sent to erect the standard of lawless domination and to trample on the rights of humanity and is again open and free for its rightful possessors must give pleasure to every virtuous and sympathetic heart and its being effected without the blood of our soldiers and fellowcitizens must be ascribed to the interposition of that providence which has manifestly appeared in our behalf through the whole of this important struggle as well as to the measures pursued for bringing about the happy event may that being who is powerful to save and in whose hands is the fate of nations look down with an eye of tender pity and compassion upon the whole of the united colonies may he continue to smile upon their counsels and arms and crown them with  00 success whilst employed in the cause of virtue and mankind may this distressed colony and its capital and every part of this wide extended continent through his divine favor be restored to more than their former lustre and once happy state and have peace liberty and safety secured upon a solid permanent and lasting foundation  george washington   th day of march      cambridge majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam instructions as there are the best reasons to believe that the enemys fleet and army which left nantasket road last wednesday evening are bound to new york to endeavor to possess that important post and if possible secure the communication by hudsons river to canada it must be our care to prevent them from accomplishing their designs to that end i have detached brigadiergeneral heath with the whole body of riflemen and five battalions of the continental army by the way of norwich in connecticut to new york these by an express arrived yesterday from general heath i have reason to believe are in new  0  york six more battalions under general sullivan march this morning by the same route and will i hope arrive there in eight or ten days at the farthest the rest of the army will immediately follow in divisions leaving only a convenient space between each division to prevent confusion and want of accommodation upon their march you will no doubt make the best despatch in getting to new york upon your arrival there you will assume the command and immediately proceed in continuing to execute the plan proposed by majorgeneral lee for fortifying that city and securing the passes of the east and north rivers if upon consulation with the brigadiergenerals and engineers any alteration in that plan is thought necessary you are at liberty to make it cautiously avoiding to break in too much upon his main design unless where it may be apparently necessary so to do and that by the general voice and opinion of the gentlemen above mentioned you will meet the quartermastergeneral colonel mifflin and the commissarygeneral at new york as they are both men of excellent talents in their different departments you will do well to give them all the authority and assistance they require and should a council of war be necessary it is my direction they shall assist at it your long service and experience will better than any particular directions at this distance point out to you the works most proper to be first raised and your perseverance activity and zeal will lead you without my recommending it to exert every nerve to disappoint the enemys designs devoutly praying that the power which has hitherto sustained the american arms may continue to bless them with his divine protection i bid you farewell given at headquarters in cambridge this   th day of march      george washington    march      cambridge john augustine washington to john augustine washington cambridge    march      dear brother your letter of the   th ultimo was duly forwarded to this camp by colonel lee and gave me the pleasure  0  of hearing that you my sister and family were well after your post is established to fredericksburg the intercourse by letter may become regular and certain and whenever time little of which i have for friendly correspondence will permit i shall be happy in writing to you i cannot call to mind the date of my last to you but this i recollect that i have written more letters than i have received from you the want of arms and powder is not peculiar to virginia  this country of which doubtless you have heard large and flattering accounts is more deficient in both than you can conceive i have been here months together with what will scarcely be believed not thirty rounds of musket cartridges to a  0  man and have been obliged to submit to all the insults of the enemys cannon for want of powder keeping what little we had for pistol distance another thing has been done which added to the above will put it in the power of this army to say what perhaps no other with justice ever could say we have maintained our ground against the enemy under this want of powder and we have disbanded one army and recruited another within musketshot of two and twenty regiments the flower of the british army whilst our force has been but little if any superior to theirs and at last have beaten them into a shameful and precipitate retreat out of a place the strongest by nature on this continent and strengthened and fortified at an enormous expense as some account of the late manœuvres of both armies may not be unacceptable i shall hurried as i always am devote a little time to it having received a small supply of powder very inadequate to our wants i resolved to take possession of dorchester point lying east of boston looking directly into it and commanding the enemys lines on boston neck to do this which i knew would force the enemy to an engagement or subject them to be enfiladed by our cannon it was necessary in the first instance to possess two heights those mentioned in general burgoynes letter to lord stanley in his account of the battle of bunkers hill which had the entire command of the point the ground at this point being frozen upwards of two feet deep and as impenetrable as a rock nothing could be attempted  0  with earth we were obliged therefore to provide an amazing quantity of chandeliers and fascines for the work and on the night of the  th after a previous severe cannonade and bombardment for three nights together to divert the enemys attention from our real design we removed every material to the spot under cover of darkness and took full possession of those heights without the loss of a single man upon their discovery of the works next morning great preparations were made for attacking them but not being ready before the afternoon and the weather getting very tempestuous much blood was saved and a very important blow to one side or the other was prevented that this most remarkable interposition of providence is for some wise purpose i have not a doubt but as the principal design of the manœuvre was to draw the enemy to an engagement under disadvantages to them as a premeditated plan was laid for this purpose and seemed to be succeeding to my utmost wish and as no men seem better disposed to make the appeal than ours did upon that occasion i can scarcely forbear lamenting the disappointment unless the dispute is drawing to an accommodation and the sword going to be sheathed but to return the enemy thinking as we have since learnt that we had got too securely posted before the second morning to be much hurt by them and apprehending great annoyance from our new works resolved upon a retreat and accordingly on the   th embarked in as much hurry precipitation and confusion  0  as ever troops did not taking time to fit their transports but leaving the kings property in boston to the amount as is supposed of thirty or forty thousand pounds in provisions and stores many pieces of cannon some mortars and a number of shot and shells are also left and baggagewagons and artillerycarts which they have been eighteen months preparing to take the field with were found destroyed thrown into the docks and drifted upon every shore in short dunbars destruction of stores after general braddocks defeat which made so much noise affords but a faint idea of what was to be met with here the enemy lay from the   th to the   th in nantasket and kings roads about nine miles from boston to take in water from the islands thereabouts and to prepare themselves for sea whither they are now bound and where their tents will be next pitched i know not but as new york and hudsons river are the most important objects they can have in view as the latter secures the communication with canada at the same time that it separates the northern and southern colonies and the former is thought to abound in disaffected persons who only wait a favorable opportunity and support to declare themselves openly it becomes equally important for us to prevent their gaining possession of these advantages and therefore as soon as they embarked i detached a brigade of six regiments to that government and when they sailed another brigade composed of the same number and tomorrow another  0  brigade of five regiments will march in a day or two more i shall follow myself and be in new york ready to receive all but the first the enemy left all their works standing in boston and on bunkers hill and formidable they are the town has shared a much better fate than was expected the damage done to the houses being nothing equal to report but the inhabitants have suffered a good deal in being plundered by the soldiery at their departure all those who took upon themselves the style and title of governmentmen in boston in short all those who have acted an unfriendly part in the great contest have shipped themselves off in the same hurry but under still greater disadvantages than the kings troops being obliged to man their own vessels as seamen enough could not be had for the kings transports and submit to every hardship that can be conceived one or two have done what a great number ought to have done long ago committed suicide by all accounts there never existed a more miserable set of beings than these wretched creatures now are taught to believe that the power of great britain was superior to all opposition and if not that foreign aid was at hand they were even higher and more insulting in their opposition than the regulars when the order issued therefore for embarking the troops in boston no electric shock no sudden explosion of thunder in a word not the last trump could have struck them with greater consternation they were at their wits end and conscious of their black ingratitude they chose  0  to commit themselves in the manner i have above described to the mercy of the waves at a tempestuous season rather than meet their offended countrymen i believe i may with great truth affirm that no man perhaps since the first institution of armies ever commanded one under more difficult circumstances than i have done to enumerate the particulars would fill a volume many of my difficulties and distresses were of so peculiar a cast that in order to conceal them from the enemy i was obliged to conceal them from my friends and indeed from my own army thereby subjecting my conduct to interpretations unfavorable to my character especially by those at a distance who could not in the smallest degree be acquainted with the springs that governed it i am happy however to find and to hear from different quarters that my reputation stands fair that my conduct hitherto has given universal satisfaction the addresses which i have received and which i suppose will be published from the general court of this colony and from the selectmen of boston upon the evacuation of the town and my approaching departure from the colony exhibit a pleasing testimony of their approbation of my conduct and of their personal regard which i have found in various other instances and which in retirement will afford many comfortable reflections the share you have taken in the public disputes is commendable and praiseworthy it is a duty we owe our country a claim which posterity has upon us  0  it is not sufficient for a man to be a passive friend and wellwisher to the cause this and every other cause of such a nature must inevitably perish under such an opposition every person should be active in some department or other without paying too much attention to private interest it is a great stake we are playing for and sure we are of winning if the cards are well managed inactivity in some disaffection in others and timidity in many may hurt the cause nothing else can for unanimity will carry us through triumphantly in spite of every exertion of great britain if we are linked together in one indissoluble bond this the leaders know and they are practising every stratagem to divide us and unite their own people upon this principle it is that the restraining bill is passed and commissioners are coming over the device to be sure is shallow the covering thin but they will hold out to their own people that the acts complained of are repealed and commissioners sent to each colony to treat with us and that we will attend to neither of them this upon weak minds among us will have its effect they wish for reconciliation or in other words they wish for peace without attending to the conditions general lee i suppose is with you before this he is the first officer in military knowledge and experience we have in the whole army he is zealously attached to the cause honest and wellmeaning but rather fickle and violent i fear in his temper however as he possesses an uncommon share of  0  good sense and spirit i congratulate my countrymen upon his appointment to that department  as i am now nearly at the end of my eighth page i think it time to conclude especially as i set out with prefacing the little time i had for friendly correspondences i shall only add therefore my affectionate regards to my sister and the children and compliments to friends and that i am with every sentiment of true affection your loving brother and faithful friend end of vol iii   on june   th the provincial congress of massachusetts appointed a committee to consider the steps proper to be taken for receiving general washington with proper respect and to provide a house for him accordingly the report was made on the   th but was not perfected until the next day resolved that doct benjamin church and mr moses gill be a committee to repair to springfield there to receive generals washington and lee with every mark of respect due to their exalted characters and stations to provide proper escorts for them from thence to the army before boston and the house provided for their reception at cambridge and to make suitable provision for them in manner following viz by a number of gentlemen of this colony from springfield to brookfield and by another company raised in that neighborhood from there to worcester and by another company there provided from thence to marlborough and from thence by the troop of horse to that place to the army aforesaid and to make suitable provision for their company at the several stages on the road and to receive the bills of expenses at the several inns where it may be convenient for them to stop for refreshment to examine them and make report of the several sums expended at each of them for that purpose that orders may be taken by the congress for the payment of them and all innkeepers are hereby directed to make provision agreeably to the requests made by the said committee and that general ward be notified of the appointment of general washington as commander in chief of the american forces and of the expectation we have of his speedy arrival with major general lee that he with the generals of the forces of the other colonies may give such orders for their honorable reception as may accord with the rules and circumstances of the army and the respect due to their rank without however any expense of powder and without taking the troops off from the necessary attention to their duty at this crisis of our affairs i hope the utmost politeness and respect will be shown to these officers on their arrival the whole army i think should be drawn up upon the occasion and all the pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war displayed—no powder burned however john adams to gerry    june      the cost of escorting and entertaining the generals from springfield to cambridge was twenty eight pounds five shillings and ten pence lawful money the appointment of washington was soon known in the camp at

of some delay and difficulty as on the fifth the same committee was ordered to complete the business general washington arrived in cambridge on sunday july  d about two oclock in the afternoon the first of the general orders issued is dated july  d on the  th the provincial congress appointed some of its members to confer with washington on the subject of furnishing his table and know what he expects relative thereto some question may have been raised on the general acceptableness of the presidents house for washingtons purposes as on the  th the congress directed the committee of safety to desire general washington to let them know if there is any house at cambridge that would be more agreeable to him and general lee than that in which they now are and in that case the said committee are directed to procure such house and put it in proper order for their reception the general thought a change expedient and on the  th the committee of safety directed that the house of john vassall subsequently known as the craigie house belonging to a refugee loyalist should be immediately put in a proper condition for the reception of his excellency and his attendants on the  th the provincial congress directed the committee appointed to procure a steward for general washington to procure him two or three women for cooks a report was made on the following which was accepted directing a committee to make inquiry forthwith for some ingenious active and faithful man to be recommended to genl washington as a steward likewise to procure and recommend to him some capable woman suitable to act in the place of a housekeeper and one or more good female servants ebenezer austin was soon after appointed steward and remained in that capacity while the general was at cambridge when washington moved into the vassall house is uncertain but mr charles deane to whose careful study of the subject i am indebted for most of the above facts conjectures it was in the month of july on the  th the congress provided for supplying the general with such articles of household furniture as he had written for and on the   th is noted in washingtons accounts an item for cleaning the house assigned to him for quarters the provincial congress expired on the   th leaving the house still incompletely furnished for its legislative successor the house of representatives on the   d ordered the committee

  we would not presume to prescribe to your excellency but supposing you would choose to be informed of the general character of the soldiers who compose the army beg leave to represent that the greatest part of them have not before seen service and although naturally brave and of good understanding yet for want of experience in military life have but little knowledge of divers things most essential to the preservation of health and even life the youth of the army are not possessed of the absolute necessity of cleanliness in their dress and lodging continual exercise and strict temperance to preserve them from diseases frequently prevailing in camps especially among those who from childhood have been used to a laborious life—from the address of the congress the entire address is printed in journals of the provincial congress of massachusetts       the hon artemas ward charles lee philip schuyler and israel putnam esquires are appointed major generals of the american army and due obedience is to be paid them as such the continental congress not having compleated the appointments of the other officers in said army nor had sufficient time to prepare and forward their commissions every officer is to continue to do duty in the rank and station he at present holds untill further orders thomas mifflin esqr is appointed by the general one of his aiddecamps—joseph reed esqr is in like manner appointed secretary to the general and they are in future to be considered and regarded as such the continental congress having now taken all the troops of the several colonies which have been raised or which may be hereafter raised for the support and defence of the liberties of america into their pay and service they are now the troops of the united provinces of north america and it is hoped that all distinctions of colonies will be laid aside so that one and the same spirit may animate the whole and the only contest be who shall render on this great and trying occasion the most essential service to the great and common cause in which we are all engaged it is required and expected that exact discipline be observed and due subordination prevail thro the whole army as a failure in these most essential points must necessarily produce extreme hazard disorder and confusion and end in shameful disappointment and disgrace the general most earnestly requires and expects a due observance of those articles of war established for the government of the army which forbid profane cursing swearing and drunkeness and in like manner requires  expects of all officers and soldiers not engaged on actual duty a punctual attendance on divine service to implore the blessings of heaven upon the means used for our safety and defence all officers are required and expected to pay diligent attention to keep their men neat and clean—to visit them often at their quarters and inculcate upon them the necessity of cleanliness as essential to their health and service they are particularly to see that they have straw to lay on if to be had and to make it known if they are destitute of this article they are also to take care that necessarys be provided in the camps and frequently filled up to prevent their being offensive and unhealthy proper notice will be taken of such officers and men as distinguish themselves by their attention to these necessary duties orderly book   july      the general most earnestly recommends  requires of all the officers that they be exceeding diligent and strict in preventing all invasions and abuse of private property in their quarters or elsewhere he hopes and indeed flatters himself that every private soldier will detest and abhor such practices when he considers that it is for the preservation of his own rights liberty and property and those of his fellow countrymen that he is now called into service that it is unmanly and sullys the dignity of the great cause in which we are all engaged to violate that property he is called to protect and especially that it is most cruel and inconsistant thus to add to the distresses of those of their countrymen who are suffering under the iron hand of oppression   july      no soldier belonging to these posts or elsewhere to be suffered to straggle at a distance from their respective parade on any pretence without leave from his officers as an unguarded hour may prove fatal to the whole army and to the noble cause in which we are engaged the importance of which to every man of common understanding must inspire every good officer and soldier with the noblest ardour and strictest attention least he should prove the fatal instrument of our ruin    the general has great reason and is highly displeased with the negligence and inattention of those officers who have placed as centries at the outposts men with whose characters they are not acquainted he therefore orders that for the future no man shall be appointed to those important stations who is not a native of this country or has a wife or family in it to whom he is known to be attached this order is to be considerd as a standing one and the officers are to pay obedience to it at their peril   july        the council of war concluded that the enemy number    00 men that the present posts occupied should be defended that the american army should be raised to   000 men that the massachusetts regiments should be recruited and the provincial congress should furnish a temporary reinforcement and that the welch mountains near cambridge and in the rear of the roxbury lines was a suitable place for a rendezvous in case of a dissolution of the army or the positions should become untenable   resolved that the committee of safety be directed to wait on general washington and inform him of the powers with which the congress have vested them and that the committee of supplies remain possessed of all those powers they have heretofore had and to confer with the general with regard to the circumstances of the army and to desire him to call in all that are out on furlough and direct that all recruits be ordered to the camp as soon as made and the said committee are further directed to issue their order for calling in such a number of militia from the several parts of this colony as the general shall request not exceeding three thousand men massachusetts provincial congress    july      washington thought that a temporary reinforcement of one thousand men to be stationed at medford would be sufficient for the existing exigency and until the new levies then raising could be completed but some intelligence from boston received on the evening of the   th induced the general to decide that the proposed reinforcement could be dispensed with the time of harvest the expected troops from the southward and the repeated calls which have been made of the like nature from this province are strong reasons to postpone this measure if

beat a march the majors general with rested arms the officer to salute and the drums to beat two ruffles the brigadiers general with rested arms the officer to salute and the drums to beat one ruffle—there being something awkward as well as improper in the general officers being stoppd at the outposts askd for passes by the sentries and obliged often to send for the officer of the guard who it sometimes happens is as much unacquainted with the persons of the generals as the private men before they can pass in or out it is recommended to both officers and men to make themselves acquainted with the persons of all the officers in general command and in the mean time to prevent mistakes the general officers and their aidsdecamp will be distinguished in the following manner the commander

officers or sentrys or the advancd posts of the enemy will be immediately brought before a general court martial and punished with the utmost severity the general is alone to judge of the propriety of

inhabitants of all the english colonies upon this continent as a day of public humiliation fasting and prayer that they may with united hearts  voice unfeinedly confess their sins before god and supplicate the all wise and merciful disposer of events to avert the desolation and calamities of an unnatural war the general orders that day to be religiously observed by the forces under his command exactly in manner directed by the proclamation of the continental congress it is therefore strictly enjoind on all officers and soldiers not upon duty to attend divine service at the accustomed places of worship as well in the lines as the encampments and quarters and it is expected that all those who go to worship do take their arms ammunition and accoutrements  are prepared for immediate action if called upon if in the judgment of the officers the works should appear to be in such forwardness as the utmost security of the camp requires they will command their men to abstain from all labour upon that solemn day it was with much surprise and concern that the general in passing along the new hampshire lines yesterday observed a most wanton mischievous and unprofitable abuse of property in the destruction of many valuable trees which were standing along the side of the road out of the way of our works or guns he therefore orders that an effective stop be put to such practices for the future or severe punishment will fall upon the transgressors of this order—orderly book    july        governor trumbull was one of the firmest patriots and best men that his country

and such was the confidence of his fellow citizens in his talents and integrity that although first appointed governor in      several years before the breaking out of the war he was constantly chosen with great unanimity to the same station till the end of the revolution when at the age of seventythree he declined a further election his services were of very great importance throughout the whole war not only in regulating the civil affairs of connecticut but in keeping alive a military ardor among the people and thus promoting efficiency and promptness of action in the forces contributed from

their men at their several posts half an hour before day break and remain there untill the commanding officers think proper to dismiss them the general hears with astonishment the very frequent applications that are made to him as well by officers as soldiers for furloughs brave men who are engaged in the noble cause of liberty should never think of removing from their camp while the enemy is in sight and anxious to take every advantage any indiscretion on our side may give them the general doubts not but the commanding officers of corps will anticipate his wishes and discourage those

observation was placed under the command of washington records of the colony of rhode island vii           it is with inexpressible concern that the general upon his first arrival in the army should find an officer sentenced by a general court martial to be cashierd for cowardice—a crime of all others the most infamous in a soldier the most injurious to an army and the last to be forgiven inasmuch as it may and often does happen that the cowardice of a single officer may prove the distruction of the whole army the general therefore tho with great concern and more especially as the transaction happened before he had the command of the troops thinks himself obliged for the good of the service to approve the judgment of the court martial with respect to capt john callender who is hereby sentenced to be cashiered capt john callender is accordingly cashiered and dismissd from all farther service in the continental army as an officer the general having made all due inquiries and maturely considerd this matter is led to the above determination not only from the particular guilt of capt callenders but the fatal consequences of such conduct to the army and to the cause of america he now therefore most earnestly exhorts officers of all ranks to shew an example of bravery and courage to their men assuring them that such as do their duty in the day of battle as brave and good officers shall be honord with every mark of distinction and regard their names and merits made known to the general congress and all america while on the other hand he positively declares that every officer be his rank what it may who shall betray his country dishonour the army and his general by basely keeping back and shrinking from his duty in any engagement shall be held up as an infamous coward and punishd as such with the utmost martial severity and no connections interest or intercessions in his behalf will avail to prevent the strict execution of justice—orderly book

therefore orders that the following regiments vizt— genl wards gen thomass col fellows col cottons col danielsons col dad brewers compose one brigade and be under the command of brigadier general thomas that genl spencers col parsons col walkers col i reads col learneards independents compose another brigade to be commanded by brigadier genl spencer that these two brigades compose the right

that event to the english public captain derby was summoned before the privy council the ministry having received no despatches from general gage confirming such a report nor did his letters arrive till eleven days afterwards although the vessel conveying them sailed four days previous to the departure of captain derby great excitement was produced throughout england and the clamor grew loud

bound to block island fisher island and long island to plunder them and bring off what cattle they may find this fellow returned again into boston under such suspicious circumstances that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intelligence a deserter who came in afterwards informs me that it was given out in the camp they were either gone for indians or fresh provisions and that each transport had but twenty men on board upon this intelligence i immediately wrote to governor cooke of rhode island and to general wooster that they might take proper precautions for removing the cattle off those islands and to prevent any surprise as we are confirmed by every account in the great scarcity of fresh provisions in the enemies camp and particularly by this deserter who says they have had none since the battle of lexington it is very probable this voyage may be only intended for a supply but as it may possibly be otherwise i thought it best to transmit the intelligence to the honorable

military spirit would spread through the colonies and besides that they would all consider themselves the more interested in the success of our army and in providing for its support but then there was

inhabitants here think that had general schuyler known their very exposed situation he would not have ordered the companies away the new york congress suppose they have no right to counteract his orders they might indeed have sent to him and received an answer in season but they are so refined in their policy have so many private views to answer and take such infinite pains to keep out of the

him a plan for procuring powder from bermuda two small armed vessels had already been fitted out by rhode island and put under the command of captain abraham whipple with the design of protecting the bay and coast of that province from the depredations of the enemy the plan was approved by the governor and committee of that province and captain whipple agreed to engage in the affair provided general washington would give him a certificate under his own hand that in case the bermudians would assist the undertaking he would recommend to the continental congress to permit the exportation of provisions to those islands from the colonies the captain pledging himself at the same time that he would make no use of such a paper unless he should be opposed by the inhabitants captain whipple sailed in the larger of the rhode island vessels manned with sixtyone seamen the vessel was manned by the agency of the rhode island committee and at the charge of that province at this time a packet from england was daily expected at new york it was thought desirable to intercept that packet and governor cooke ordered captain whipple to cruise for it off the harbor of new york fourteen days and if he should not fall in with it during that period then to proceed immediately on his voyage to bermuda but he had scarcely sailed from providence before an account appeared in the newspapers of one hundred barrels of powder having been taken from bermuda by a vessel supposed to be from philadelphia and another from south carolina the facts were such as to make it in the highest degree probable that this was the same powder which captain whipple had gone to procure general washington and governor cooke were both of opinion that it was best to countermand his instructions the other armed vessel of rhode island was immediately despatched in search of the captain with orders that when he had finished the cruise in search of the packet he should return to providence but it was too late captain whipple had heard of the arrival of the packet at new york and proceeded on his voyage to bermuda he put in at the west end of the island the inhabitants were at first alarmed supposing him to command a kings armed vessel and the women and children fled into the country but when he showed his commission and instructions they treated him with cordiality and friendship they had assisted in removing the powder which was made known to general gage and he had sent a sloop of war to take away all the superfluous provisions from the island they professed themselves hearty friends to the american cause but as captain whipple was defeated in the object of his voyage he speedily returned to providence—gov cookes ms letters soon afterwards the inhabitants of bermuda petitioned congress

only manned with    men if the vessel proposed to go to bermudas should cruise for a few days off sandy hook—i have no doubt she would fall in with her in which case she might with little or no delay land the mail in order to be forwarded to me and proceed on her voyage but if there any material objections to this mode i am still so anxious upon the subject that i would have it tried with another vessel at the continental expense and will for that end direct that any charge which shall accrue in this service shall be paid by the paymaster here upon being duly liquidated it will be necessary that some person well acquainted with the packets should be on board our vessel or the stopping inward bound vessels indiscriminately will give the alarm and she may be apprized of her danger the

in handsome squares upon every other lot along the river bank leaving the trees next the river standing as a safeguard against freshets and ice these fields may be so near together as to answer small tenements of about  00 acres in a lot in case you cannot get them surveyed in short allow each lot a breadth of about one hundred rods upon the river running back for quantity agreeably to the plots given you the same sized lots that is lots of the same breadth upon the river may be laid upon all the other tracts and five acre fields cleared upon every other one as above but after the season has got too late for planting corn then at each of these fields build a house sixteen feet by    with an outside chimney the lower part to be of logs with diamond corners and to be covered with three feet shingles also inclose and fence your corn at this time or before if necessary you may then that is after building houses to the fields already cleared and fencing them in carry your clearing building and fencing regularly on together in the manner above described after the time for planting the corn is over in all of the bottoms you may be at work in if there should be any grassy ponds or places easily improved and drained for meadow it may be done and inclosed instead of preparing land for corn endeavor to get some rareripe corn to carry with you for your last planting and replanting the corn which you do plant must be cultivated in any manner which may appear most advisable to you for my interest if you can get or i should send out peach stones have them cracked and the kernals planted as soon as you get to the first land and properly inclose them it will be essentially necessary to have all the work done upon any one tract appraised before you move to the next field if it be possible to have it done such work i mean as can be injured by fire or other accidents otherwise i may labor in vain as i shall have no allowance made for any thing that is not valued in these appraisements you must let nothing go unnoticed as it is necessary that every thing should be brought into account that will enhance the price you should take care to have a pair of hand mill stones with you as also a grindstone for the benefit of your tools with proper pecks keep a regular account of your tools and call them over frequently to see that none are missing make every man answerable for such as is put into his care keep a regular account also of the days lost by sickness for i expect none will be lost by any other means that an allowance may be made for it at settlement and keep a regular and clear account of all expences with proper vouchers that matters may be settled without any difficulty at the end of the service as i could wish to have my lands rented if it be possible to do it you may if tenants should offer engage them upon the following terms to wit upon a rent of three pounds sterling to be discharged in the currency of the country at the exchange prevailing at the time of payment for each lot which is to be laid off as described on the plot leases to be given for three lives four years rent free where no improvement is made and two only where there is a house built and five acres of land cleared on the lot or if it will be a greater inducement to tenants i will grant leases for    years upon the above rent payable in the above manner which leases shall be renewable for ever upon paying at the end of the first    years twenty shillings per annum additional rent for the next seven years and in like manner the increased rent of  0s sterling per annum for every seven years afterwards but it is to be noted that i will not give leases for lives and leases for the above term renewable in the same tract of land as it might not be so convenient to have leases of different tenures mixed as i have pointed out the distance along the water for the breadth of each lot in measuring of which go strait and as the course and distance from the river of each lot is also particularly set down you cannot be at a loss if you have a compass and chain to lay them off and mark them exactly the back lines of the lots may be marked or not just as it suits the dividing lines must be marked at all events and an account taken of the corner trees in order to insert them in the leases if any should be given at the corner of each lot upon the river blaze a tree and with a knife or chisel number them in the following manner viz at the upper corner of the first lot make the figure   at the corner which divides lots no one and two make these figures ½ at the corner which divides lot no two and three make the figures ⅔ and so on with every lot by which means the lots can always be distinguished the moment they are looked at and no mistakes can happen build a house and clear and fence five acres of land upon every other lot in the manner described upon the plot by which means should any one person incline to take two lots they may be added together conveniently and the improvements will be convenient to both i have now mentioned every thing by way of instruction to you that i can at present recollect let me conclude then with observing that this business must even under the greatest good management and industry be attended with great expense as it will be with equal injustice if it is neglected to this i am to add that as you are now receiving my money your time is not your own and that every day or hour misapplied is a loss to me do not therefore under a belief that as a friendship has long subsisted between us many things may be overlooked in you that would not in another devote any part of your time to other business or to amusements for be assured that in respect to our agreement i shall consider you in no other light than as a man who has engaged his time and services to conduct and manage my interest on the ohio to the best advantage and shall seek redress if you do not just as soon from you as from an entire stranger i wish you your health and success and am c note as these instructions were begun some time ago and at a time when i had little doubt of having my people moved over the mountains before the first of april as also at a time when i had a scheme under contemplation of importing palatines in order to settle on these lands which scheme i have now laid aside those clauses which relate to the turning your whole force towards preparing land for corn may be entirely or in part laid aside as circumstances may direct and if there should be any inconsistency between the first and latter clauses pursue the directions of the last mentioned if you should not receive an order of court from botetourt for valuing the work done on my first tract before you move to the second have the work done thereon appraised in the best manner you can by stevens c and an account thereof signed by them in such a manner as they would swear to if called upon if it should happen that you are obliged to wait in your own neighborhood for vessels provisions or on any other account let all the people which you carry out be employed in forwarding my mill work at gilbert simpsons   james cleveland was to be placed in

endeavour to reduce them but i did not say so and i must appeal to you sir if the question need or should have been asked the answer was obvious and therefore it could only be asked with a design to have something to say i told them therefore that i gloried in serving my king and country and should always do so and i glory even in repeating it to you i am convinced sir you will not think the worse of me for supporting my honor as a man and a british officer which in all situations i am determined to do   your favor of the   th instant and one from major french on the same subject have come safely to hand from the general character of this gentleman and the acknowledged politeness and attention of the committee of hartford to the gentlemen intrusted to their care i flattered myself that there would be a mutual emulation of civility which would have resulted in the ease and convenience of both i am extremely sorry to find it otherwise and upon a reperusal of former letters and papers respecting these gentlemen i cannot think there is any thing particular in their situation which can challenge a distinction if the circumstance of wearing their swords had created no dissatisfaction i should not have interfered considering it in itself as a matter of indifference but as it has given offence partly perhaps by the inadvertent expressions which have been dropped on this occasion i persuade myself that major french for the sake of his own convenience and ease and to save me farther trouble will concede what is not essential to either his comfort or happiness farther than mere opinion makes it so on the other hand allow me to recommend a gentleness even to forbearance with persons so entirely in our power we know not what the chance of war may be but let it be what it will the duties of humanity and kindness will demand from us such a treatment as we should expect from others the case being reversed—washington to the committee of hartford    september

philadelphia as it was not discussed having made inquiry i find the rule with regard to the indulgence in question is that prisoners do not wear their swords i therefore cannot approve of it more especially as it gives such general dissatisfaction to the good people of the country to your other request of removing to some place where you can have the benefit of attending public worship in the church of england i have not the least objection provided the place is approved by governor trumbull to whom in this case you will be pleased to apply i wish you all the happiness consistent with your

means of keeping up a communication between boston and new york and as a place easy to be defended and one from which in any exigency succours might be derived he had also expressed an opinion that new york should be occupied general gage replied—as the kings forces are too weak to act in more than one point new york is the most eligible situation to hold the friends of government could rally there and from every account numbers would join them that city could be easily defended and supplied by a water communication but there is much difficulty in leaving boston it requires secrecy and is

with the troops either to new york or to some other port to the southward where the ships could lie in safety and carry on operations securely during the winter many advantages he thought would result from such a change this was answered by general howe with arguments similar to those already advanced by general gage and his reasons for not complying with the recommendation of the minister were approved another plan in agitation was to divide the forces and endeavor to hold new york and boston at the same time general howe discouraged this scheme as in his opinion impracticable and he said that gage clinton and burgoyne agreed with him such a movement would require an additional force of not less than five thousand men to be left in boston and twelve thousand at new york the latter to be employed in opening a communication with canada leaving five battalions for the defence of new york three thousand regulars would then remain for quebec who with three or four thousand canadians and some hundreds of indians would compose the army of canada but he could not say whether such a force would be sufficient in that quarter the primary object of a communication with canada by the hudson being thus accomplished and secured by posts troops might take separate routes into massachusetts and other parts of new england as circumstances should point out it was the opinion of general howe at the same time that boston should be evacuated and the force designed for that place removed to rhode island the project of penetrating the country could more easily be executed from that point than from boston where little else could be done than to defend the post the possession of rhode island would moreover put connecticut in jeopardy and induce that colony to keep its army at home for selfdefence boston harbor might be blockaded after the evacuation by a small naval force aided by a land party intrenched in the neighborhood of nantasket road—letter to lord dartmouth october  th

connecticut troops were raised in      he was appointed to the command of the whole the continental appointment therefore by which he was placed the third on the list of brigadiers and putnam raised over him to the rank of majorgeneral was by no means satisfactory yet he accepted the commission in a spirit which reflected much credit upon his character when he went to the northward general washington had the impression that he would assume the command in canada as higher in rank than montgomery but the fact was he stood one degree lower so that this difficulty was obviated to prevent all chance of dispute general schuyler resolved to keep wooster at ticonderoga and send forward his regiment but the officers and men who sympathized with their commander in his complaint of injustice would not go without him they had already refused to sign the articles of war sent out by the continental congress and their general was obliged to govern them by the military laws of connecticut this aspect of things gave some concern to general schuyler when the regiment arrived at ticonderoga and he wrote to general wooster requesting to know precisely on what ground he considered himself to stand the reply was that of an honorable and generous soldier as well as a true patriot my appointment in the continental army said general wooster you are sensible could not be very agreeable to me notwithstanding which i never should have continued in the service had i not determined to observe the rules of the army no sir i have the cause of my country too much at heart to attempt to make any difficulty or uneasiness in the army upon which the success of an enterprise of almost infinite importance to the country is now depending i shall consider my rank in the army what my commission from the continental congress makes it and shall not attempt to dispute the command with general montgomery at st johns you may depend sir that i shall exert myself as much as possible to promote the strictest union and harmony among both officers and soldiers and use every means in my power to give success to the expedition general wooster is just arrived here as he was appointed a majorgeneral by the colony of connecticut and that i did not know his sentiments with respect to the rank he considered himself in the continental army my intentions were to have him remain at this post ticonderoga but assuring me that his regiment would not move without him and that although he thought hard of being superceded yet he would most readily put himself under the command of general montgomery that his only views were the public service and that no obstructions of any kind would be given by him this spirited and sensible declaration i received with inexpressible satisfaction and he moves tomorrow with the first division of his regiment schuyler to congress    october      this harmony was soon threatened as schuyler wrote on the next day complaining that wooster had ordered a court martial at fort george which he by no means had a right to do and had discharged men from hinmans and waterburys regiments i assure you sir that i feel these insults from a general officer with all that keen sensibility that a man of honor ought and i should be ashamed to mention them to congress but that the critical situation of our public affairs at this period require that i should sacrifice a just resentment to them and i would wish to have it remembered that to that cause only must be imputed that i have suffered a personal indignity to go unpunished schuyler to congress    october      he went forward with his regiment into canada put himself under general montgomery and verified this declaration by his conduct which was not marked however with much enterprise or efficiency   probably otway byrd who was appointed aiddecamp to general lee on the   th   if any negro is found straggling after taptoo beating about the camp or about any of the roads or villages

president of the board in a council of war which had been assembled but a short time before several of the points put in charge of the committee by congress had been considered and the opinions of the officers upon them expressed these were generally confirmed and adopted by the delegates in conference the mode of raising arranging clothing and supplying a new army was determined while the enemy remained in the same strength at boston it was unanimously agreed that the american army ought not to consist of less than twenty thousand three hundred and seventytwo men making twentysix regiments exclusive of riflemen and artillery each regiment to be divided into eight companies efforts were to be made to reenlist as many soldiers as possible among those already on the ground and the vacancies were to be filled up by new levies the delegates of the four colonies were respectively of opinion that twenty thousand men might be raised in massachusetts eight thousand in connecticut three thousand in new hampshire and fifteen hundred in rhode island if the pay remained the same as heretofore and the time of service one year minutes of the conference after settling what pertained to the army the conference broke up but the committee from congress remained two or three days longer and took many other topics into consideration which had been suggested in general washingtons letters to congress the articles of war were revised and changes recommended to congress regulations for disposing of prizes and provisions captured at sea exchange of prisoners employment of indians local details in regard to the army and many other particulars were discussed and certain definite principles or rules established the conference was of great moment to general washington since the committee and the delegates from the colonies would be bound to sustain the measures there agreed upon the affairs of the army were brought into a more systematic train and the commanderinchief could act with more precision and confidence the doings of the committee were in part confirmed by congress in a series of resolves after their return the instructions given by congress to its committee

fit out two armed vessels at the continental expense to sail for the st lawrence with the view of intercepting these brigantines he was directed to procure the vessels from the government of massachusetts but as there were no armed vessels belonging to that province and the vessels of rhode island were not available he equipped and sent off two of those which were already employed in the public service these vessels the lynch commanded by nicholas broughton and the franklin commanded by captain john selman were ordered to the river st lawrence to intercept an ammunition vessel bound

an account of the convention is given in a letter from george mason to washington    october        on the   th of october the officers were convened a second time to hold a council respecting an attack on boston there was a unanimous voice against it but there is no record of what was washingtons opinion the question of attacking boston had come before the committee of conference the subject being thus stated by washington— the council of war having in consequence of an intimation from congress deliberated on the expediency of an attack upon the troops in the town of boston and determined that at present it was not practicable the general wishes to know how far it may be deemed proper and advisable to avail himself of the season to destroy the troops who propose to winter in boston by bombardment when the harbor is blocked up or in other words whether the loss of the town and the property therein are so to be considered as that an attack upon the troops there should be avoided when it evidently appears that the town must of consequence be destroyed the committee thought this too important to be determined by them they therefore referred it to congress where it hung fire for a long time i mean not to anticipate your determination but only to approve your design to hover like an eagle over your prey always ready to pounce upon it when the proper time comes i have not forgot your proposition relative to that city i try to pave the way for it and wait for the season as you do lynch to washington    november      it was not until december   d that a resolution was reached which appears in the printed journals although marked secret in the manuscript journals that if general washington and his council of war should be of opinion that a successful attack may be made on the troops in boston he do it in any manner he may think expedient notwithstanding the town and property in it may be destroyed in communicating this resolve president hancock wrote you will notice the resolution relative to an attack upon boston this passed after a most serious debate in a committee of the whole house and the execution was referred to you may god crown your attempt with success i most heartily wish it though individually i may be the greatest sufferer president hancock possessed a valuable property in boston it is a little remarkable that each party had conclusive reasons for avoiding to attack the other it is inadvisable said general gage in a letter to lord dartmouth to attempt penetrating the country from boston the enemys forces are numerous and such an attempt must be made under very great disadvantages and even if successful little would be gained by it as neither horses carriages nor other means for moving forward could be procured our force is too small

schuyler had written september   th from ticonderoga the vexation of spirit under which i labor that a barbarous complication of disorders should prevent me from reaping those laurels for which i have unweariedly wrought since i was honored with this command the anxiety i have suffered since my arrival here lest the army should starve occasioned by a scandalous want of subordination and inattention to my orders in some of the officers that i left to command at the different posts the vast variety of vexations and disagreeable incidents that almost every hour arise in some department or other not only retard my cure but have put me considerably back for some days past if job had been a general in my situation his memory had not been so famous for patience but the glorious end we have in view and which i have a confident hope will be attained will atone for all   general montgomery had likewise met with his full share of troubles on the   th of october while investing the fort at st johns he wrote to general schuyler— i had had a road cut to the intended ground and some fascines made when i was informed by major brown that a general dissatisfaction prevailed that unless something was undertaken in a few days there would be a mutiny and that the universal sense of the army was to direct all our attention to the east side the impatience of the troops to get home has prevented their seeing the impossibility of undertaking this business sooner the duty being hard for the troops even on the present confined state of operations when i mentioned my intentions i did not consider that i was at the head of troops who carry the spirit of freedom into the field and think for themselves upon considering the fatal consequences which might flow from a want of subordination and discipline should this illhumor continue my unstable authority over troops of different colonies the insufficiency of the military law and my own want of power to enforce it weak as it is i thought it expedient to call the fieldofficers together enclosed i send you the result of our deliberations i cannot help observing to how little purpose i am here were i not afraid the example would be too generally followed and that the public service might suffer i would not stay an hour at the head of troops whose operations i cannot direct i must say i have no hope of success unless from the garrisons wanting provision   when a convention of the several townships of the new hampshire grants met at dorset on july         to elect field and other officers ethan allen expected to obtain the chief command but to his great chagrin was defeated by seth warner of bennington the vote in the convention being fortyone to five allen then joined general schuyler without holding a commission and raising a company of canadians crossed the st lawrence with a small party below montreal where he was defeated and taken prisoner after maintaining for some time and with great courage a very unequal conflict he was put in irons and sent to quebec and thence to england where he arrived december   d after being a prisoner for nearly three years transported from place to place he was exchanged he published in      a narrative of the events of his capture and imprisonment   while dr franklin was in camp he paid over to a committee of the massachusetts assembly one hundred pounds sterling which had been forwarded

again upon this subject the distress of the army for these necessaries i fear will be followed with the most dreadful effects to the general cause in which we are engaged unless some speedy and effectual remedy is provided i have the utmost reason to think the scarcity is artificial and that the general court may have full satisfaction on this subject three gentlemen who have been employed in endeavouring to procure these articles now wait on your honourable houses to give you such information as their inquiries and opportunities enable them to do the importance and necessity of making such provision as to enable the troops to keep their post must be too obvious to make any argument necessary and as this province has ever been among the foremost in its spirited exertions i flatter myself such measures will be adopted as will remove the apprehensions and anxieties under which we now labor washington to the council of massachusetts    october      your favor of the   th instant

proper opportunity to make their case known to the honorable continental congress washington to deputy governor cooke    october        as you will be fully informed of every matter and thing relative to the army by your own committee i should not have given you the trouble of a letter at this time were it not on colonel reeds account he is as i presume you may have heard concerned in many of the principal causes now depending in the courts of pennsylvania and should those causes be pressed for trial by his brethren of the profession it will not only do him a manifest injury in his practice and future prospects but afford room for complaint of his having neglected his business as a lawyer this he thinks may be avoided if some of you gentlemen of the congress in the course of conversation with the chiefjustice and others would represent the disadvantages which must result to him in case his causes should be hurried to trial that colonel reed is clever in his business and useful to me is too apparent to mention i should do equal injustice therefore to his abilities and merits were i not to add that his services here are too important to be lost and that i could wish to have him considered in this point of view by your honorable body when occasion shall favor i shall take it kind of you to give me from time to time such authentic intelligence of the manœuvres of the ministry

he left the camp for philadelphia on the  0th of october and was absent till after the removal of the army to new york during this period a constant and confidential correspondence was kept up between him and the commanderinchief robert hanson harrison of alexandria a lawyer by profession with whom washington had been much acquainted and who had been invited by him to become one of his aids arrived in cambridge shortly after the departure of colonel reed he was immediately announced in the public orders as an aid to the commanderinchief he received a colonels commission and served as secretary to the general during a large portion of the war sparks as many officers and others have begun to inlist men for the continental army without orders from head quarters the general desires that an immediate stop be put thereto that the inlistments be returnd and that no person for the future presume to interfere in this matter till there is a proper establishment of officers and those officers authorised and instructed in what manner to proceed commissions in the new army are not intended merely for those who can inlist the most men but for such gentlemen as are most likely to deserve them the general would therefore not have it even supposed nor our enemies encouraged to believe that there is a man in this army except a few under particular circumstances who will require to be twice asked to do what his honour his personal liberty the welfare of his country and the safety of his family so loudly demand of him when motives powerful as these conspire to call men into service and when that service is rewarded with higher pay than private soldiers ever yet met with in any former war the general cannot nor will not until he is convinced to the contrary harbour so despicable an opinion of their understanding and zeal for the cause as to believe they will desert it as the congress have been at so much pains to buy goods to cloath the army and the quarter master general at great trouble to collect upon the best terms he can such articles as are wanting for this purpose he is directed to reserve those goods for those brave soldiers who are determind to stand forth in defence of their country another year and that he may be able to distinguish these from such as mean to quit the service at the end of their present engagement he will be furnished with the inlistments—any person therefore negroes excepted which the congress do not incline to inlist again coming with a proper order and will subscribe the inlistment shall be immediately supplied that every non commissioned officer and soldier may know upon what terms it is he engages he is hereby informd—that he is to be paid by the kalendar month at the present rates to wit—forty eight shillings to the serjeants forty four to the corporals drums  fifes and forty to the privates which pay it is expected will be regularly distributed every month that each man is to furnish his own arms and good ones or if arms is found him he is to allow six shillings for the use thereof during the campaign that he is to pay for his cloathing which will be laid in for him upon the best terms it can be bought to do which a stoppage of ten shillings a month will be made until the cloathing is paid for that two dollars will be allowed every one of them who brings a good blanket of his own with him  will have liberty to carry it away at the end of the campaign that the present allowance of provisions will be continued and every man who inlists shall be indulged in a reasonable time to visit his family in

calamities like these are staring us in the face and a brutal savage enemy more so than was every yet found in a civilized nation are threatening us and every thing we hold dear with destruction from foreign troops it little becomes the character of a soldier to shrink from danger and condition for new terms it is the generals intention to indulge both officers and soldiers who compose the new army with furloughs to be absent a reasonable time but it must be done in such a manner as not to injure the service or weaken the army too much at once the general also thinks that he can take upon him to assure the officers and soldiers of the new army that they will receive their pay once a month regularly after the terms of their present inlistment are expired—orderly book    october   i am happy to inform you that congress has agreed to every recommendation of the committee and have gone beyond it in allowing the additional pay to the officers i rejoice at this but cannot think with patience that pitiful wretches who stood cavilling with you when entreated to serve the next campaign should reap the benefit of this addition they will now be ready enough but hope you will be able to refuse them with the contempt they deserve and to find better in their room could not some of the gentlemen at camp enlist the new england men who have been persuaded to leave you frazier told me

of america at such a juncture and in such circumstances to be insulting their religion is so monstrous as not to be suffered or excused indeed instead of offering the most remote insult it is our duty

much taken up with military affairs that it is impossible for me to pay a proper attention to these matters there will be sent you amongst others a james smithwick who from an intercepted letter appears to have resolved to get into boston there is a small trunk belonging to him now in my possession which contains in gold and silver about fifty pounds lawful money which it is probable he

boston with provisions c for some time i beg leave to refer them to your examination—washington to james warren   november        the virginia convention had met on the   th of july and passed an ordinance for raising two regiments to act in defence of the colony and two additional companies for protecting the western frontiers by the same ordinance the province was divided into sixteen districts and regulations were adopted for exercising all the militia as minutemen and preparing for public service at a moments call—see henings stat vol ix p   patrick henry was appointed colonel of the first regiment and commander of all the forces to be raised for the defence of the colony william woodford was colonel of the second regiment the following letter from george mason to washington dated october   th is characteristic of the writer and contains some curious particulars in regard to the doings of the convention i hinted to you in my last the parties and factions which prevailed at richmond i never was in so disagreeable a situation and almost despaired of a cause which i saw so ill conducted during the first part of the convention parties ran so high that we had frequently no other way of preventing improper measures than by procrastination urging the previous question and giving men time to reflect however after some weeks the babblers were pretty well silenced a few weighty members began to take the lead several wholesome regulations were made and if the convention had continued to sit a few days longer i think the public safety would have been as well provided for as our present circumstances permit the convention not thinking this a time to rely upon resolves and recommendations only and to give obligatory force to their proceedings adopted the style and form of legislation changing the word enact into ordain their ordinances were all introduced in the form of bills were regularly referred to a committee of the whole house and underwent three readings before they were passed i enclose you the ordinance for raising an armed force for the defence and protection of this colony it is a little defaced by being handled at our district committee but it is the only copy i have at present by me you will find some little inaccuracies in it but upon the whole i hope it will ment your approbation the minuteplan i think is a wise one and will in a short time furnish eight thousand good troops ready for action and composed of men in whose hands the sword may be safely trusted to defray the expense of the provisions made by this ordinance and to pay the charge of the last years indian war we are now emitting the sum of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds in paper currency i have great apprehensions that the large sums in bills of credit now issuing all over the continent may have fatal effects in depreciating the value and therefore i opposed any suspension of taxation and urged the necessity of immediately laying such taxes as the people could bear to sink the sum emitted as soon as possible but i was able only to reduce the proposed suspension from three years to one our friend the treasurer was the warmest man in the convention for immediately raising a standing army of not less than four thousand men upon constant pay they stood a considerable time at three thousand exclusive of the troops upon the western frontiers but at the last reading as you will see by the ordinance they were reduced to one thousand and twenty rank and file in my opinion a well judged reduction not only from our inability to furnish at present such a number with arms and ammunition but i think it extremely imprudent to exhaust ourselves before we know when we are to be attacked the part we have to act at present seems to require our laying in good magazines training our people and having a good number of them ready for action   the general thanks col thompson and the other gallant officers and soldiers as well of other regiments as the rifflers for their alacrity yesterday in pushing thro the water to get to the enemy on letchmores point he is informd that there were some names as yet unknown who discoverd a backwardness in crossing the causway—these will be marked if they can be discovered—the general was much surprised and concerned to see the order in which many of the arms in several of the regiments appeared he had not time to enquire the names of the particular officers to whose companies they belonged but desires that this hint may be received as an admonition by such officers as are conscious of their neglect of this duty as other methods will be fallen upon if it is not—orderly book  0th november        this act is remarkable as having been the first which was passed by any of the

body than this militia—charles lee to benjamin rush    december      the task of disbanding army and forming new was rendered very difficult by the reduction of eleven regiments and the discharge of such a number of officers who have done every thing to obstruct and retard the filling of the new army in hopes to ruin the establishment and bring themselves into place again—general greene to governor ward by letters from camp i find there is infinite difficulty in reinlisting the army the idea of making it wholly continental has induced so many alterations disgusting to both officers and men that very little success has attended our recruiting orders i have often told the congress that under the idea of new modelling i was afraid we should destroy our army southern gentlemen wish to remove that attachment which the officers and men have to their respective colonies and make them look up to the continent at large for their support or promotion i never thought that attachment injurious to the common cause but the strongest inducement to people to risk every thing in defence of the whole upon the preservation of which must depend the safety of each colony i wish therefore not to eradicate but to regulate it in such a manner as may most conduce to the protection of the whole—governor ward to his brother    november        in writing to colonel reed a few days afterwards washington spoke in the following manner of this affair the alacrity of the riflemen and officers upon that occasion did them honor to which colonel patersons regiment and some others were equally entitled except in a few instances but the tide at that time was so exceedingly high as to compel a large circuit before our men could get to the causeway by which means the enemy except a small covering party distant from the dry land on this side near four hundred yards had retreated or were about to embark all the shot therefore that passed were at a great distance however the men went to and over the causeway spiritedly enough this little manœuvre of the enemy is nothing more than a prelude we have certain advice of a scoundrel from marblehead a man of property having carried to

south carolina and thence to england in a vessel belonging to hancock from a journal which he kept during his stay in london and which i have seen he appears to have been on terms of intimacy with some of the leaders of the high whig party and it is probable that his visit to the metropolis of great britain had a political as well as commercial object he returned to massachusetts a few days

afterwards to general washington and received a lieutenantcolonels commission on the   th of april      he was by congress appointed paymastergeneral of the army a station of great responsibility which for more than four years and a half he filled in such a manner as to give universal satisfaction during this period he had exhibited such proofs of his talents for business fidelity and devotedness to the cause of his country that on the  th of november    0 he was elected consulgeneral from the united states to france an office at this time of much consideration as it involved the duties of making extensive purchases of military and other supplies for the country and an examination and settlement of all the accounts in which the united states were concerned with public and

as follows to a serjeant fortyeight shillings to the corporals fortyfour and forty to each private which pay it is expected will be regularly distributed every month— each noncommissioned officer and soldier drums  fifes excepted is to furnish his own arms if arms are found him he is to allow six shillings at the end of the campaign for the use thereof new cloathing will forthwith be provided for every non commissiond officer  soldier for which an easy stoppage of only ten shillings a month will be made out of his pay until the whole is paid two dollars will be allowed to each noncommissiond officer and soldier who provides himself with a good blanket and liberty to take it away at the end of the campaign the present ample allowance of provisions will be continued and those who inlist will be indulged in a reasonable time to visit their familys in the course of the winter this to be regulated in such manner as not to weaken the army or injure the service to prevent such contentions as have arisen from the same person being inlisted by different officers and for different regiments it is possitively ordered upon pain of being cashiered that no officer knowingly presume to inlist any soldier who has been previously inlisted by another officer where such a mistake happens undesignedly the first inlistment is to take place— the officers are to be careful not to inlist any person suspected of being unfriendly to the liberties of america or any abandond vagabond to whom all causes and countries are equal and alike indifferent—the rights of mankind and the freedom of america will have numbers sufficient to support them without resorting to such wretched assistance—let those who wish to put shackles upon freemen fill their ranks and place their confidence in such miscreants neither negroes boys unable to bear arms nor old men unfit to endure the fatigues of the campaign are to be inlisted the preferences being given to the present army the officers are vigilantly to try what number of men can be inlisted in the course of this week and make report thereof to their colonels who will report it to the general—this to be done every week until the whole are compleated the regiments are to consist of eight companies each company of a captain two lieutenants and an ensign four serjeants four corporals two drums  fifes and seventysix privates as the regiments are compleated they will be mustered and then reviewed by the commander in chief when a roll of each company signd by the captain according to a form previously deliverd by the adjutant

suddenly called upon whenever it happens very pointed complaints having this day been made against the commissary general from several field officers c of genl sullivans brigade—the commander in chief assures the complainants that the strictest examination shall be made into the conduct of the commissary general as soon as he arrives in cambridge which is expected this week whereas the general has been informed that the orders of the  th of septembr have been construed to permit any approvd sutler to sell spirituous liquors to the soldiers belonging to other regiments without the permission of the commanding officer of the regiment to which such soldier belongs it is therefore ordered that no commanding officer of a regiment shall authorise more than one sutler to a regiment and such appointment shall be notified in regimental orders and no person being authorised shall presume to sell spirituous liquors to any soldiers belonging to any other regiment without leave in writing

several engagements and was a gentleman highly respected he commanded one of the massachusetts regiments but on account of his advanced age he was omitted in arranging the new army the soldiers of his regiment were so much dissatisfied that they resolved not to enlist under any other officer he exhorted them not to be influenced by such a motive in a cause so important and to induce them to remain he proposed to join them in the ranks november   th motives of economy rendering it indispensably necessary that many of the regiments should be reduced and the whole put upon a different establishment several deserving officers not from any demerit but pure necessity have been excluded in the new arrangement of the army among these was colonel whitcomb but the noble sentiments disclosed by that gentleman upon this occasion the zeal he has shown in exhorting the men not to abandon the interest of their country at this important crisis and his determination to continue in the service even as a private soldier rather than by a bad example when the enemy are gathering strength to put the public affairs to hazard when an example of this kind is set it not only entitles a gentleman to particular thanks but to particular rewards colonel jonathan brewer is entitled to no small share of credit in readily giving up to colonel whitcomb the regiment which he was appointed to command colonel whitcomb therefore is henceforward to be considered as colonel of that regiment which was intended for colonel brewer and colonel brewer will be appointed barrackmaster until something better worth his acceptance can be provided orderly book   three companies of loyalists were embodied in boston on the   th of november the following is an extract from general howes orderly book of

arm representations having been made to the continental congress of the great inequality in the pay of the officers and soldiers of this army the first being lower than usual and less than was ever given to commissiond officers in any other service whilst that of the soldiers is higher the congress have been pleased to increase the pay of captain to twentysix and ⅔ dollars—of a first lieutenant to eighteen dollars of a second lieutenant  ensign to thirteen  ⅓ dollars pr kalender month each to take place so soon as the new regiments are compleated to their full compliment of men the congress have given this encouragement to the captains and subalterns whose pay was lower in proportion with a view to impress upon their minds a due sense of gratitude at the same time that it is intended to enable them to support the character and appearance of gentlemen  officers which will add much to the reputation of the regiments and cannot but be pleasing to every man in it it is expected that the officers of the new formed regiments will exert themselves in the recruiting service and that they do not fail to report the number they have recruited to their colonels to morrow that they may make returns thereof the day after in order that the recruiting parties may be sent into the country if any backwardness should appear here—when this happens the colonels of the old regiments are to be consulted to prevent the companies therein being left without officers as furloughs have been promised to the new inlisted men none others can be indulged under any pretence whatsoever and in order that these furloughs may be given with some degree of regularity none but colonels or commanding officers of regiments upon the new establishment are to grant them and they respectively not to let more than fifty be absent at a time beginning with those who inlisted first and going on in a regular rotation until all are indulged allowing each man ten days to be at home and a sufficient time to

days but before enos got over the carryingplace major bigelow was sent back from colonel greenes division with ninety men for provisions enos supplied them and marched onward till he overtook colonel greene fifty miles up the dead river here he received orders from arnold to furnish colonel greene with provisions enough for his men in their march to the settlements on the chaudière river after executing this order he had no more than six days provisions left for his own troops in this condition it was the opinion of the officers that the rear division ought to return such is colonel enoss account in his letter to washington and the courtmartial acquitted him on the ground here assigned but from arnolds letters since published it would appear that he did not represent the matter with perfect accuracy on the   th of october arnold wrote to him that there were twentyfive days provisions arnold went forward and wrote again on the   th from chaudière pond that on account of heavy rains there had been a delay and it would take twelve or fifteen days for the army to reach the inhabited country he ordered enos therefore and greene to select such a number of their best men as could be supplied with fifteen days provisions and send the others with the sick back to the commissary at norridgewock instead of obeying this order enos gave his provisions to greene except enough for his division of the troops on their return to norridgewock and immediately retraced his steps with all his men although he was acquitted by the courtmartial and received a lieutenantcolonels commission in the new army yet he was not satisfied with the evidences he received of the good opinion of the commanderinchief and in january he asked leave to resign he was removed to vermont and in

for regulating the plans and conduct of the manager hardly any copies of this description of letters were recorded if retained and the originals have been lost or destroyed but lund washingtons

all the means in your power to perfect the raising of a regiment of canadians in fact general montgomery had been beforehand with congress in this respect for he had said to the people when he took possession of montreal on the   th of november that he hoped to see such a provincial convention assembled as would enter with zeal into every measure that could contribute to set the civil and religious rights of that and her sister colonies on a permanent foundation and he did not fail to use his best endeavors to induce as many canadians as possible to join his standard in this however he was less successful than some sanguine persons had anticipated notwithstanding appearances the canadians proved themselves nowise inclined to be conquered into liberty in whatever way the fate of this

manner from the colonel or commanding officer of the regiment they respectively belong to and it is expected that all officers and soldiers in this army will pay the strictest attention to this order as they shall answer the consequences this order is not intended to change the mode of giving furloughs already pointed out in past orders the sole design being to keep men to their duty that they may be always ready to meet their enemy upon the shortest notice it is again and again expressly ordered that an officer of each company do once a day examine the arms and ammunition of the company he

connecticut troops of the relief being ordered to supply their places by the  0th of this month that many of them have taken their arms with them and gone off not only without leave but contrary to express orders this is therefore to inform those who remain that the general has sent an express to the governor of connecticut with the names of such men as have left the camp in order that they may be dealt with in a manner suited to the ignominy of their behaviour the general also informs those who remain that it is necessary for them to obtain a written discharge from the commanding officer of the regt they belong to when they are dismissed on the  0th instant that they may be distinguished from and not treated as deserters we had here exhibited the other day a scene pleasant enough some of

upon the new establishment that if their captains do not recruit a company the command of it will be taken away and given to such first lieutenants provided he can fill it up which makes the first lieutenants indifferent and lukewarm in the recruiting business whence such an opinion could arise is not easy to say but if it be possible that there are any officers in this army actuated by such principles the general most positively assures them that they not only deceive themselves but if proof can be given of such a charge such guilty enemies to their country will with disgrace be dismissed from the continental army  service forever the general thought it his duty to give them this public notice—orderly book    november        governor trumbull wrote in reply—the late extraordinary and reprehensible conduct of some of the troops of this colony impresses me and the minds of many of our people with grief surprise and indignation since the treatment they met with and the order and request made to them were so reasonable and apparently necessary for the defence of our common cause and safety of our rights and privileges for which they freely engaged the term they voluntarily enlisted to serve not expired and probably would not end much before the time when they would be relieved provided their circumstances and inclination should prevent their undertaking further indeed there is great difficulty to support liberty to exercise government to maintain subordination and at the same time to prevent the operation of licentious and levelling principles which many very easily imbibe the pulse of a new england man beats high for liberty his engagement in the service he thinks purely voluntary therefore when the time of enlistment is out he thinks himself not holden without further engagement this was the case in the last war i greatly fear its operation amongst the soldiers of the other colonies as i am sensible this is the genius and spirit of our people the union of the colonies and the internal union of each are of the utmost importance i determine to call the general assembly of this colony to meet at new haven on thursday the   th instant

forces deaf to the entreaties of their own as well as all other officers and regardless of the contempt with which their own government threatens to treat them upon their return have absolutely refused to tarry till the  st day of january but will quit the lines on the  th of december they have deceived us and their officers by pretending there would be no difficulty with them till they have got so near the close of their term and now to their eternal infamy demand a bounty to induce them to tarry only three weeks this is such an insult to every american that we are determined to release them at the expiration of their term at all hazards and find ourselves obliged immediately to supply their place with troops from new hampshire and massachusetts bay—general sullivan to the new

army here described— providence favors us everywhere our success in every operation exceeds our most sanguine expectations and yet when god is ready to deliver our oppressors into our hands that men cannot be found willing to receive them is truly surprising with grief and shame it must be confessed that the whole blame lies not with the army you will find your hands straightened instead of strengthened what the event will be it is impossible to foresee perhaps it is only intended to force the continent into their own terms and to show that neither general nor congress shall be permitted to control the army perhaps to mortify the favorites of congress be this as it may resolution and firmness ought to rule our councils a step yielded to improper and intemperate demands may be

americans might be encouraged by their successes in canada and the arms recently taken in the brigantine nancy and think of a project against halifax he should immediately send a reinforcement to that place as the recovery of canada was a primary object he recommended that the army for effecting it should consist of not less than twelve thousand fighting men representing at the same time the inexpediency of abandoning the plan heretofore suggested of taking possession of rhode island and new york since the enemy would be more distressed by an attack on this vulnerable side than by any successes against them in canada—ms letter the following intelligence was contained in a letter from general howe forwarded at the same time as the above the enclosed are original letters found in mr

suffered much for want of fuel the following extraordinary order will show that the destruction of houses to supply this want was far from being approved by the british commander the frequent depredations committed by the soldiers in pulling down houses and fences in defiance of repeated orders have induced the commanderinchief to direct the provost to go his rounds attended by the executioners with orders to hang up upon the spot the first man he shall detect in the act without waiting for further proof by trial—general howes orderly book december  th   i believe i told you

order of congress to intercept in the river st lawrence two brigantines which it had been understood were to sail from england to quebec laden with arms and ammunition and without convoy after a cruise of several days the american captains discovered no such vessels but they committed a very unjustifiable act in making a descent on the island of st johns pillaging the defenceless inhabitants and bringing away some of them prisoners the gentlemen thus brought off among whom was mr callbeck presented a memorial to general washington in which they stated that the governors house and other private dwellings were broken open and robbed of their plate carpets curtains lookingglasses table linen wearing apparel and whatever else was of value and could be taken away this was done by the captains of course without a shadow of licence from their instructions though apparently rather through ignorance of the customary rules of warfare than by any conscious violation of the laws of equity and honor such conduct however could not fail to excite the indignation of the commanderinchief and he released the captives immediately treating them with all possible kindness and respect orders were given for restoring the goods which had been pillaged and from the following note written by mr callbeck it may be presumed that he at least was satisfied i should ill deserve the generous treatment which your excellency has been pleased to show me had i not gratitude to acknowledge so great a favor i cannot ascribe any part of it to my own merit but must impute the whole to the

distress for the want of firewood and hay the assembly of massachusetts undertook to supply these articles by calling on the towns within twenty miles of boston to furnish at stated times specific

and summoning every person capable of bearing arms to resort to his majestys standard or be looked upon as traitors to his majestys crown and government but the part that gave the most offense to the colonists was the promise of freedom to all indented servants negroes and others appertaining to rebels who should join his troops congress interpreted this proclamation as one tearing up the

that he would not bear arms against the american united colonies in any manner whatsoever during the american contest with great britain and in his letter to washington he says i love america it is my native country and that of my family and i intend to spend the evening of my days in it these professions being apparently sincere washington sent general sullivan to examine him on certain points and report the result he owned the accuracy of dr wheelocks letter except the part relating to canada which he denied though he had been to the west of albany as no good reason appeared why he came to camp or why he wished to travel through the country the general did not think it expedient to receive a visit from him nor to sign his permit but as this had already been signed by the president of the new york congress and the chairman of the new hampshire committee of safety he suffered the major to depart at his option and to enjoy such security as his papers thus authenticated might procure him there was a suspicion strengthened by his subsequent conduct that he was at this time a spy or at least practising a very unworthy artifice for acquiring a confidence to which his political sentiments did not entitle him be this as it may he soon after joined the enemys ranks and was raised to be a colonel in the british army notwithstanding his parole of honor and his love of america it may be said perhaps in extenuation that he considered his parole extorted from him at a time when there were no just grounds for questioning his motives and by an authority which he did not feel bound

extract from the orderly book is indicative of the spirit that prevailed in enlisting the new army november   th to prevent such contentions as have arisen from the same person being enlisted by different officers and for different regiments it is positively ordered upon pain of being cashiered that no officer knowingly presume to enlist any soldier who has been previously enlisted by another officer when such a mistake happens undesignedly the first enlistment is to take place the officers are to be careful not to enlist any person suspected of being unfriendly to the liberties of america or any abandoned vagabond to whom all causes and countries are equal and alike indifferent the rights of mankind and freedom of america will have numbers sufficient to support them without resorting to such wretched assistance let those who wish to put shackles upon freemen fill their ranks with such miscreants and place their confidence in them neither negroes boys unable to bear arms nor old men unfit to endure the fatigues of the campaign are to be enlisted this step was taken at the very time that lord dunmore in virginia was promising freedom to all slaves who should repair to his

a laudable spirit of emulation will now take place and pervade the whole of it without such a spirit few officers have ever arrived to any degree of reputation nor did any army ever become formidable his excellency hopes that the importance of the great cause we are engaged in will be deeply impressed upon every mans mind and wishes it to be considered that an army without order regularity discipline is no better than a commissioned mob let us therefore when every thing dear and valuable to freemen is at stake when our unnatural parent is threatening of us with destruction from every quarter endeavour by all the skill and discipline in our power to acquire that knowledge and conduct which is necessary in war our men are brave and good men who with pleasure it is observed are addicted to fewer vices than are commonly found in armies but it is subordination and discipline the life and soul of an army which next under providence is to make us formidable to our enemies honourable in our selves and respected in the world and herein is to be shown the goodness of the officer in vain is it for a general to issue orders if orders are not attended to equally vain is it for a few officers to exert themselves if the same spirit does not animate the whole it is therefore expected it is not insisted upon that each brigadier will be attentive to the discipline of his brigade to the exercise of and the conduct observed in it calling the colonels and field officers of every regiment to severe account for neglect or disobedience of orders—the same attention is to be paid by the field officers to their respective companies of their regiments by the captains to their subalterns and so on and that the plea of ignorance which is no excuse for the neglect of orders but rather an aggravation may not be offerd it is ordered and directed that not only every regiment but every company do keep an orderly book to which frequent recourse is to be had it being expected that all standing orders be rigidly obeyed until altered or countermanded it is also expected that all orders which are necessary to be communicated to the men be regularly read and carefully explained to them as it is the first wish of the general to have the business of the army conducted without punishment to accomplish which he assures every officer soldier that as far as it is in his power he will reward such as particularly distinguish themselves at the same time he declares that he will punish every kind of neglect or misbehavior in an exemplary manner as the great variety of occurrences and the multiplicity of business in which the general is necessarily engaged may withdraw his attention from many objects and things which might be improved to advantage he takes this opportunity of declaring that he will thank any officer of whatsoever rank for any useful hints or profitable informations but to avoid trivial matters as his time is very much engrossed he requires that it may be introduced through the channel of a general officer who is to weigh the importance before he communicates it all standing orders heretofore issued for the government of the late army of which every regiment has or ought to have copies are to be strictly complied with until changed or countermanded—orderly book   january      it was with no small degree of surprise that the general yesterday saw after the repeated orders that had been given for having the tents as soon as the barracks were fit to be enterd returned to the qr mr general several of them standing uninhabited and in a disgraceful ruinous situation and moreover hears that others serve only for bedding the officers who have suffered this neglect are informed that this is the last admonition that will be given on this head it is expected that the commanding officers of regiments will be exceedingly attentive to the training exercising and disciplining their men bringing them as soon as possible acquainted with the different evolutions and manœuvres necessary to be practiced and as nothing reflects more disgrace upon an officer or is more pernicious or dangerous in itself than suffiering arms to be in bad order the general assures the officers and men that he will never overlook or pardon a neglect of this kind there are many practices in regular service highly worthy of imitation but none more essential than this and keeping soldiers always clean and neat the first is absolutely necessary for self preservation the other for health and appearance for if a soldier cannot be induced to take pride in his person he will soon become a sloven and indifferent to everything else whilst we have men therefore who in every respect are superior to mercenary troops that are fighting for two pence or three pence a day why cannot we in appearance also be superior to them when we fight for life liberty property and our country—orderly book   january        left blank in the original to guard

correspondence although both these purposes were in prospect the forces that sailed from boston in the month of january under command of general clinton were bound to north carolina with the intention to join lord cornwallis in a grand enterprise against that colony which the ministry had planned several months before in consequence of the reports and solicitation of governor martin it was supposed that there would be a general rising among the loyalists in that country when supported by a formidable force and supplied with arms and thus a secure hold would be gained on all the southern provinces the affair turned out to be a signal failure as did most of those undertaken at the suggestion of the colonial governors and zealous partisans of the crown whose wishes and hopes betrayed them into a deplorable ignorance of the state of the country and character of the people on the   th of december governor tryon wrote a letter to general howe dated on board his majestys ship duchess of gordon in the harbor of new york informing him that the spirit of rebellion was decreasing in that colony and that five thousand regular troops only were wanting to restore commerce and the old government that many counties were well affected and in others were friends who called for protection from the insults of the insurgents if general clinton or some other officer would come with a suitable force governor tryon was ready to take the field under him and believed he could collect a body of two or three thousand loyalists provided he were authorized to put them on the establishment of regulars at all events he requested three thousand firearms and one hundred thousand cartridges but in his present condition he saw no prospect of getting ashore to resume his government general howe replied that it was impossible to send the force required at that time as the army in boston could not be divided but he might expect the earliest assistance in the spring meantime he advised that the willingness of the friends of the crown to take up arms should not be known but rather that the insurgents should receive the impression of their neutrality or even of their being dissatisfied with the government since no troops had been sent to their support in this idea he declined forwarding the arms and ammunition because such a step before they could be used would only serve to alarm the insurgents if it could be supposed possible to gain and keep possession of new york with the force desired it should be despatched without delay but of such a result there could be

whom the utmost dilligence is expected those sergeants and corporals are by no means to suffer the arms and accoutrements of any man in their squads to be dirty or unfit for use and as far as in them lies to make the men appear neat clean and soldierlike—neglect of duty in these instances they may rely upon it will reduce them to the ranks—these orders are not intended to exempt the commissioned officers of the companies from the strictest attention to these things on the contrary as it serves to show the generals solicitude in having the men and their arms appear in the best order it is

intimating his desire and intention to leave the army and closing his remarks on the subject as follows i have already informed you of the disagreeable situation i have been in during the campaign but i would waive that were it not that it has chiefly arisen from prejudice and jealousy for i could point out particular persons of rank in the army who have frequently declared that the general commanding in this quarter ought to be of the colony from whence the majority of the troops came but it is not from opinions or principles of individuals that i have drawn the following conclusion that troops from the colony of connecticut will not bear with a general from another colony it is from the daily and common conversation of all ranks of people from that colony both in and out of the army and i assure you that i sincerely lament that people of so much public virtue should be actuated by such an unbecoming jealousy founded on such a narrow principle a principle extremely unfriendly to our righteous cause as it tends to alienate the affections of numbers in this colony in spite of the most favorable constructions that prudent men and real americans amongst us attempt to put upon it and although i frankly avow that i feel a resentment yet i shall continue to sacrifice it to a nobler object—the weal of that country in which i have drawn the breath of life resolved ever to seek

permission to go to quebec on his parole   i think the service has suffered and the enlistments been embarrassed by the low state in which you keep your treasury here had the general been able to have paid off the old army to the last of december when their term expired and to give assurances for the pay of the militia when their continuance in the army should end it might have produced many good effects—among others added some thousands to the army you will be surprised perhaps when i tell you there is but about  0000 dollars here and that left by the necessary parsimony of the general not

may be known by the following extract from a letter dated on the   th of january and written by him to lord dartmouth from what i can learn of the designs of the leaders of the rebels says general howe they seem determined since the receipt of the kings speech among them to make the most diligent preparations for an active war and it is my firm opinion that they will not retract until they have tried their fortune in a battle and are defeated but i am under the necessity of repeating to your lordship that the apparent strength of the army for the spring does not flatter me with the hopes of bringing the rebels to a decisive action with a proper army of twenty thousand men having twelve thousand at new york six thousand at rhode island and two thousand at halifax exclusive of an army for the province of quebec the present unfavorable appearance of things would probably wear a very different aspect before the end of the ensuing campaign with fewer troops the success of any offensive operations will be very doubtful the enemy possessing advantages that will not readily be overcome by a small force neither is their army by any means to be despised having in it many european

army and for a time lieutenantgovernor of canada had served in the late war with montgomery and entertained for him a warm personal attachment he asked permission of general carleton to bury his friend with marks of honor and respect this was granted in part and a coffin lined and covered with black was provided but the governor did not consent to the reading of the funeral service probably not deeming this indulgence conformable to military rules but when the time of burial approached mr cramahé invited a clergyman to be present who read the service privately and unmolested the other officers were buried at a short distance from their general but without coffins and in the military manner all the graves were within the walls of the city and near the port of st louis these particulars were communicated to me by mr william smith of quebec who had received them from several persons acquainted with them at the time and especially from mr thompson who assisted at the burial of montgomery and who pointed out the place of his grave a few years ago when his remains were taken up and removed to new york—sparks   government being fully convinced of these facts will most

ethan allen yet the prisoners who fell into his hands on the above disastrous occasion according to their own account met with a usage in every respect as good as that of the british soldiers except in the necessary restraints of confinement this was declared in a letter to washington from major meigs when he returned on his parole the summer following the soldiers were confined in the jesuits college and the officers in the seminary the latter after the srege was raised had permission to walk in a large garden adjoining their quarters major meigs left three hundred prisoners in quebec about the middle of may when they were released for exchange general carleton supplied them with articles of clothing in which they were deficient it was said that when some of his officers spoke to him of this act as an unusual degree of lenity towards prisoners of war he replied—since we have tried in vain to make them acknowledge us as brothers let us at least send them away disposed to regard us as first cousins having been informed that many persons suffering from wounds and various disorders were concealed in the woods and obscure places fearing that if they appeared openly they would be seized as prisoners and severely treated he issued a proclamation commanding the militia officers to search for such persons bring them to the general hospital and procure for them all necessary relief at the public charge he also invited all such persons to come forward voluntarily and receive the assistance they needed assuring them that as soon as their health should be restored they

country we must have tradesmens sons and farmers sons or we should be without defence and such men certainly would not enlist during the war or for long periods as yet the service was too new they had

conduct in this instance at the same time it is declared and particular attention will be paid to it that if any colonel or commanding officer of a regiment presume in future to discharge a man without proper authority for so doing he will be put in arrest and tried for disobedience of orders to have men inlisted one day and discharged as it were the next without any action or apparent cause

attempts were made by lord drummond to propose a plan of reconciliation between great britain and the colonies the first notice of the matter is contained in a letter from mr lynch to general washington dated at philadelphia    january      in which he says a gentleman well known in maryland lord drummond just from england tells me that he has had many conversations with the ministry and showed me a paper approved by each of them and which he is sure will be supported in both houses the substance of it is—america to be declared free in point of taxation and internal police judges to be approved by the judges of england and commissioned during good behaviour upon stated and sufficient support to be statedly assigned them by the colonies all charters to be held sacred that of boston to be restored britain to regulate trade sub modo all duties laid for the purpose of regulation to be paid into the colony treasury where they arise applicable to its uses by its own legislature in lieu of which america shall by duties on such articles as will probably keep pace in its consumption with the rise or declension of the colony laid by each legislature by permanent act of assembly grant towards the general support of the empire annual sums in proportion to five thousand pounds sterling for this colony as this sum is little more than half of what did arise by duties heretofore paid in this place i doubted his information but was assuied that ministry wanted nothing but a show of revenue to hold up to parliament as they are afraid to propose reconciliation without saving what the stiff old englishmen call the honor of the nation his lordship came hither through halifax boston and new york where i fancy he saw what induced him to hint once or twice at beginning with a suspension of arms to which i turned a very deaf ear well knowing that the season of winter is ours and that much may be done by april next i sincerely wish i had your sentiments on those heads i shall propose them to the consideration of congress as soon as the most urgent affairs are over i think they merit it three weeks afterwards when mr lynch was in new york as one of a committee from congress to consult with general lee respecting the fortifications and defence of that city he there met lord drummond and wrote again to general washington— i mentioned to you some time ago certain propositions which lord drummond had been talking to me of general robertson writes to him by clinton that he clinton is very desirous of being instrumental in bringing about the same end it is mysterious to me how such a man should be sent on such an errand be it as it may it will not produce any remission of our using the present moment to strengthen ourselves and weaken our enemies lord drummonds great point is to get some member of congress to go home to inform the cabinet of the real desires and intentions of that body respecting the reestablishment of peace to promote this purpose he has desired me to enclose you a letter which after you have read it if you think it can do no harm you will be so kind as to forward to robertson and to send his answer to his lordship under your cover robertson will doubtless send it open to you the letter was as follows just as i was sitting down to write to you i received yours by general clinton but have not as yet had an opportunity of seeing him during the very few months i was with you at boston i expressed my wish of being able to make known at philadelphia the disposition in england towards an accommodation upon liberal terms and such as were founded in equity and candor you then concurred with me in thinking that however much these gentlemen whose province it now is to think for the public might be held up as aiming at a total separation they had as their sole object such a reconciliation as would give a constitutional security to their children in this opinion i think we were not deceived from all the conversation i had at philadelphia with those gentlemen who allow me i hope to rank among the number of their friends i have every reason to think them most seriously disposed towards reconciliation nor am i without hopes of success should such an event take place it is not impossible but a deputation from hence may be found expedient and in that case a passport requisite for a security against english cruisers such a passport must be left blank for filling up names and sent by the same conveyance that this passes through it will be needless to caution you against delay my slight acquaintance with general howe and admiral shuldham will furnish you with an apology for not making a more direct application p s let me guard you against letting this get to the public till we see how far my hopes are well grounded drummond to robertson   february      this letter was forwarded to general washington at cambridge with the view of its being sent by him into boston but he enclosed it to congress congress instructed their president to inform the commanderinchief that they highly approved his care and attention in stopping lord drummonds letter and entirely concurred with him in regard to his lordships officious and unwarrantable zeal hence the letter never found its way to general robertson the letter from lord drummond which seemed to derive importance from the transmission of it by general washington was a fire engine to play cold water on the fire of independence they opponents of independence set it in operation with great zeal and activity it was indeed a very airy phantom and ought not to have been sent us by the general who should only have referred lord drummond to congress but there were about headquarters some who were as weak and wavering as our members    in short it lord drummonds letter was so flimsy a veil that the purblind might see through it but yet it was made instrumental of much delay and amusement to members john adams autobiography iii        in describing

they should be served with powderhorns and shot pouches in lieu of cartouch boxes and that every thing which is delivered to them be charged to the regiment that received it that it may be redelivered

indicated an active force of only  000 a stroke at this time might put an end to the war but from the lack of powder the main reliance must be had in the small arms and not in cannon and mortars the closing of the ice afforded a path for an assault and it should be made before the expected reinforcements were arrived these considerations were laid before a council of war held on the   th but were not deemed sufficient to warrant an assault on the grounds that there was not force enough for such an attempt that the army was deficient in arms and powder and that the impression of the fieldofficers generally was unfavorable to such a measure it was however resolved that a cannonade and bombardment would be advisable as soon as there should be a proper supply of powder and that in the meantime preparations ought to be made for taking possession of dorchester heights and of noddles island also if it could be effected on the   th writing to joseph reed he said i proposed it an assault in council but behold though we had been waiting all the year for this favorable event the enterprise was thought too dangerous perhaps it was perhaps the irksomeness of my situation led me to undertake more than could be warranted by prudence i did not think so and i am sure yet that the enterprise if it had been undertaken with resolution must have succeeded without it any would fail but it is now at an end and i am preparing to take post on dorchester to try if the enemy will be so kind as to come out to us ten regiments of militia you must know had come to strengthen my hands for offensive measures but what i have here said respecting the determinations in council and the possessing of dorchester point is spoken under the rose   read in congress march  th   notwithstanding i have adopted every measure which my judgement directed for procuring arms in these governments for the army under my command as well by applications to the sevl assemblies and conventions as by sending officers to the several towns to purchase i am under the disagreeable  melancholy necessity of informing you that there is at this important crisis a very great deficiency and that there is now a considerable number of men at these encampments without any in their hands nor do i know that there is any prospect or probability of providing them—can you my dear sir assist me with any from your parts if you can procure or purchase any in the towns fit for use i beg that you will do it and have them forwarded with all possible expedition to me i will pay for them immediately on delivery and the charges for bringing them i am told that a major duncan at schenactady has about  00 kings arms these or such of them as are good  serviceable will be of great use and i doubt not may be readily procured if they can i request—that they may  be forwarded with any others that you may get with the price—i would not be thus pressing  thus importunate were it not for my situation which is truly alarming  distressing to be within musquet shot of a formidable army well provided with every necessary without having the means on my part of maintaining even a defensive war—washington to schuyler    february        as it is necessary that every regiment should be furnished with colors and that those colors should if it can be done bear some kind of similitude to the uniform of the

regimental colors and colors for each grand division the whole to be small and light the number of the regiment is to be markd on the colors and such a motto as the colonel may choose in fixing upon

consider what campequipage may be further necessary that no time may be lost in providing it as the season is fast approaching for taking the field the general cannot again help urging it in the strongest terms to the colonels the necessity of the strictest attention to the discipline of their men learning them to march and perform all the different evolutions and manœuvers which is of more essential service than dwelling too long upon the manual exercise he also recommends to the colonels a proper attention to the cloathing of their officers and men that they may appear in a soldierlike manner—orderly book  0 february      the general having the credit of this army much at heart and anxious that it should not only behave well but look well recommends it to and does expect that every officer from the highest to the lowest doth exert himself to accomplish those ends to attain which the brigadiers are desired to be attentive to every matter and thing relative to their brigades  when orders are not or cannot be complied with immediately to report the reason thereof from henceforward it is expected that the weekly returns of every regiment will before they are brought into the commander in chief be examined and certified by the brigadier to whose brigade they respectively belong who is also to direct his major of brigade to keep a book and have them regularly entered always comparing the return to be made with the one preceding and enquiring minutely into the cause of every change or alteration from the last—the colonel or commanding officer of every regiment is to observe the same conduct with respect to the returns of his companies and keep a book for the regular entry thereof—these precautions are taken to prevent the many blunders and mistakes which have heretofore happend in making out the pay abstracts all of which for the future are to be inspected by the brigadiers compared with their books and certified by them before a warrant will be granted a very strict attention will be expected to this order for if these books are called for and do not correspond with this order the officer neglecting will meet with no favor the commanding officer of each regiment may apply for a warrant for fivehundred dollars to put into the hands of such officers as they send into the country on the recruiting service to buy arms but such as are good and fit for immediate use kings musquets or guns as near that quality as can be had should be got and with bayonets if possible as there is a committee in each of the counties of the massachusettsbay

much importance to intrust the wounds and lives of officers and soldiers to unskillful surgeons the general requests the director general and the surgeons of the hospital taking also to their assistance such regimental surgeons as upon examination they approve of will sit and examine the surgeons  mates of the whole army and give certificates to those who are found qualified to discharge the duties of their office in order that they may receive commissions—gentlemen of candor and knowledge in their profession will see the utility of this measure and approve of it none but those who are conscious of their inability will decline the examination the surgeon of every regiment is immediately to report to the director general of the hospital in what manner he and his mate are at present furnished with instruments medicines bandages c that the true state and condition may be known the first court of examination will sit on tuesday next at the convalescent hospital in cambridge

wythe and rutledge   general lee had written february   th the governor and the captain of a manofwar had threatened perdition to the town if the cannon were removed from the batteries and wharves but i ever considered their threats as a brutum fulmen and even persuaded the town to be of the same way of thinking we accordingly conveyed them to a place of safety in the middle of the day and no cannonade ensued captain parker publishes a pleasant reason for his passive conduct he says that it was manifestly my intention and that of the new england men under my command to bring destruction on this town so hated for its loyal principles but that he was determined not to indulge us so remained quiet out of spite the people here laugh at his nonsense and begin to despise the menaces which formerly used to throw em into convulsions to do em justice the whole show a wonderful alacrity and in removing the cannon men and boys of all ages worked with the greatest zeal and pleasure i really believe that the generality are as well affected as any on the continent a little different story was given by governor tryon the ice keeping the ships of war so near within shore that he parker was of opinion he could not bring the ships under his command to lay off the fort and battery where the artillery and chief part of the stores were deposited without great risk to the kings ships from the ice at that severe season the destruction therefore of the city where there were so many friends to government with the loss of all their property and the consideration of preserving the town for the kings army were thought to be too great sacrifices to make for only retarding the removal of the artillery and stores governor tryon to lord george germaine   april        as i am making all possible preparation to take possession of the heights of dorchester which i expect i shall be able to accomplish by the latter end of this week it is expected that this if any thing can will bring the enemy out of boston to oppose as at charlestown our erecting any works there to weaken our lines on the north side of cambridge river to strengthen those of dorchester before any movement is made that way by the enemy may neither be consistent with prudence nor good policy and to delay it till after an attack is begun would be too late as the contest will soon be decided for or against us after this happens under this state of the matter and to avoid putting an affair of so much importance to a doubtful issue when under providence it may be reduced to a certainty i submit it to the wisdom of your board whether it might not be best to direct the militia of certain towns most contiguous to dorchester and roxbury to repair to the lines at those places with their arms ammunition and accoutrements instantly upon a signal given if you approve of this you will please to fix with general thomas who waits on you for that purpose upon the signal to be given and issue your notices

maintain the blockade i look forward with a pleasing confidence to the day when you being properly reinforced will oblidge it to surrender    when i sent colo knox in pursuit of artillery i did not design that you should have been disfurnished i only meant that he should have brought from canada such ordinance as you could conveniently spare but from your letter and the return i am led to think that you are in want—i have been informed that genl lee hath lately secured a large number of heavy cannon  that that were at new york from whence i immagine you may get a supply of what you want which you cannot be supplied with else where if you will acquaint me i will most readily give you every assistance in my power  deem myself happy if i can contribute to relieve your necessitys in any

vigor of our exertions in short freedom or slavery must be the result of our conduct there can therefore be no greater inducement to men to behave well but it may not be amiss for the troops to know that if any man in action shall presume to skulk hide himself or retreat from the enemy without the orders of his commanding officer he will be instantly shot down as an example of cowardice cowards having too frequently disconcerted the best formed troops by their dastardly behaviour next to the favor of divine providence nothing is more essentially necessary to give this army the victory of all its enemies than exactness of discipline unless the arms are kept clean and in good firing order it is impossible to vanquish the enemy and cleanliness of the person gives health and soldierlike appearance that no confusion may ensue when the troops are called to action the general has ordered all the posts and guards of the lines and redoubts to be so fixd and regulated as every officer and soldier may know his place and his duty and to confirm the order and discipline the general orders that the officers and men who are to mount guard do parade every morning at eight oclock upon their regimental parades where they are to be reviewed by the adjutant in the presence of a field officer who is to see that their arms ammunition and accoutrements are compleat and the men dressed in a soldierlike manner the adjutant is then to march them to the parade of the brigade and deliver them over to the major of brigade who is very minutely to inspect the whole and then march them to the grandparade where the brigadier with the field officers of the day will attend to see all the guards paraded and march to their several destinations with the brigadier will constantly mount his major of brigade who is always to make up the guards upon the grand parade and report all extraordinaries to his brigadier general—the brigadier of the day will give his orders to the field officers of the

astonishment in england intelligence of this event was published by the ministry on the  d of may in a short paragraph which merely announced that his majestys forces had embarked from boston with the greatest order and regularity and without the least interruption from the rebels and were destined for halifax parliament being then in session the subject was called up by the duke of manchester on the  0th of may who proposed a motion for an address to his majesty that he would be pleased to order the late despatches of general howe and admiral shuldham to be laid before the house of lords a long and warm debate ensued in which the ministers were severely censured for the recent occurrences in america the duke of manchester said to come now my lords to that which has cast the deepest stain on the glory of the british arms to that which must rouse the indignation of all who feel for her disgrace the army of britain equipped with every possible essential of war a chosen army with chosen officers backed by the power of a mighty fleet sent to correct revolted subjects sent to chastise a resisting city sent to assert britains authority has for many tedious months been imprisoned

attempt one way indeed of escape is left the fleet is still respected to the fleet the army has recourse and british generals whose names never met with a blot of dishonor are forced to quit that town which was the first object of the war the immediate cause of hostilities the place of arms which has cost this nation more than a million to defend we are informed of this extraordinary event by a gazette published by authority from government in which it is related that general howe had quitted boston no circumstances mentioned to palliate the event no veil but that of silence to cast over the disgrace but my lords though the government account is short and uncircumstantial yet private intelligence public report on which till it is with authenticity denied i must rely informs us that general howe quitted not boston of his own free will but that a superior enemy by repeated efforts by extraordinary works by the fire of their batteries rendered the place untenable the earl of suffolk in defence of the ministry told the house that there was nothing extraordinary in the evacuation of boston that it was not intended to pursue the war in massachusetts since the disaffection had become general that orders had been sent out for a removal of the troops when the commander should think proper and that he had resolved on this step ten days before it actually took place the noble duke he added says there must have been a convention between general howe and the rebel commander which i do assure his grace was by no means the case no convention stipulation concession or compromise whatever having been made the general thought proper to shift his position in order in the first place to protect halifax and after that object was secured to penetrate by that way into the interior country and pursue his future intended operations the marquis of rockingham replied after stating certain particulars which had come through a private channel if those accounts are true of which i have very little doubt your lordships will perceive though possibly there might have been no formal convention or capitulation signed which i understood was avoided by the generals on both sides for particular reasons that in whatever manner the business might have been negotiated it had every substantial requisite of a treaty or compromise as much as if it had been ever so solemnly authenticated or subscribed the troops were permitted to evacuate the town without interruption because they engaged on the other hand not to burn or destroy it either previous to their departure or after they had got on board their ships the same sentiments were expressed by lord shelburne and other lords in the opposition but the minister persisted that he had no knowledge or belief of such a matter the facts in the case however prove to have been very nearly as represented by the marquis of rockingham the inhabitants of boston fearing the consequences of an attack as general howe had prepared to set the town on fire in such an event were very anxious to avert a calamity that would involve them in ruin an informal statement was drawn up signed by the selectmen addressed to nobody

excellency general howe is determined to leave the town with the troops under his command a number of the respectable inhabitants being very anxious for its preservation and safety have applied to general robertson for this purpose who at their request has communicated the same to his excellency general howe who has assured him that he has no intention of destroying the town unless the troops under his command are molested during their embarkation or at their departure by the armed force without which declaration he gave general robertson leave to communicate to the inhabitants if such an opposition should take place we have the greatest reason to expect the town will be exposed to entire destruction our fears are quieted with regard to general howes intentions we beg we may have some assurance that so dreadful a calamity may not be brought on by any measures without as a testimony of the truth of the above we have signed our names to this paper carried out by messrs thomas and jonathan amory and peter johonnot who have at the earnest entreaties of the inhabitants through the lieutenantgovernor solicited a flag of truce for this purpose john scollay timothy newell thomas

without an address and not obligatory upon general howe he would take no notice of it i am with esteem and respect gentlemen your most obedient servant ebenezer learned to messrs amory and johonnot notwithstanding this apparently uncompromising answer yet as the paper evidently conveyed the dispositions of general howe and as washington could have no wish to destroy the town but on the contrary the strongest motives for preserving it no direct annoyance was afterwards offered to the british troops and this mutual understanding doubtless saved much destruction of property and much bloodshed

cannot be procured for superfluous articles it will be well if sufficient can be found to answer all requisite services—the nature of the service we are engaged in is such as require light troops ready at all times and upon all occasions for forced marches the less baggage therefore officers and men are encumbered with the better the recruiting service is to be continued but the recruits and all the men upon furlough are to join their respective regiments immediately the general being desirous of selecting a particular number of men as a guard for himself and baggage the colonel or commanding officer of each of the established regiments the artillery and rifflemen excepted will furnish him with four that the number wanted may be chosen out of them his excellency depends upon the

concurs with your sentiments the two regiments of connecticut now here consisting of about five hundred rank and file each are impatient to go home as many of them are farmers who want to make out their summers work the time of their engagement with general lee ends next monday i have used my best endeavors to prevail on them to stay till their places are supplied from that quarter but it is still doubtful whether they will consent to it of this i have apprized governor trumbull and have requested him to make up the whole two thousand from that colony from new jersey i have requested one thousand men about two hundred of them are come in about one thousand are ordered from the northern counties of this province none of them is yet arrived we have now in this place and on long island

be crowned with the success they have been here where their destination is or what plans they have in view is altogether unknown here most probably the next attempt will be against new york or some more southern colony however i should think though i do not believe they have any design against rhode island that it will be advisable to keep a strict lookout and i submit it to you whether it may not be proper against the time you apprehend they might arrive to call in a number of the militia and have them posted in proper places i do not mean to direct the measure but only to mention it for your consideration to me it appears worthy of attention—washington to governor cooke    march      we saw the ships under way about   in the morning and the river full of boats armed with soldiers

and rode down to charlestown neck where i had a clear view of bunkers hill i saw the sentrys standing as usual with their firelocks shouldered but finding they never moved i soon suspected what regiment they belonged to and upon taking a clear view with my glass found they were only effigies set there by the flying enemy this convinced me that they were actually fled for if they meant to decoy us they would have taken away every appearance of man by this time i was joined by colo mifflin who with my brigade major agreed to go up sending two persons round the works to examine whether there was any of them in the rear of the works while we went up in the front i at the same time sent for a strong party to follow us on to the hill to assist us in running away if necessary we found no person there and bravely took the fortress defended by lifeless sentries i then brought on a party to secure what we had so bravely won and went down to the other works where we found all abandoned but the works not injured in any part we hailed the ferry boat which came over and informed us that they had abandoned the town we then gave information to the general who ordered me with the troops under my command to take possession of charlestown and general putnam with  000 men to take possession of the works in boston and on monday morning his excellency made his entry into boston and

there is a sufficient force to repel their attempts but it is the opinion of the general officers here that their destination is against new york the importance of which as it seems the free and only communication between the northern and southern colonies which will be entirely cut off by their possessing it and give them the command of hudsons river and an easy pass into canada makes it absolutely and indispensably necessary for the whole of this army which is but inconsiderable except that part of it which will be left to secure the stores barracks and other public property to be

previous application for the necessary passports or safe conduct and on such application being made congress will then direct the proper measures for the reception of such commissioners it will be observed how long this trifling business had been depending but it cannot be known from the journal how much debate it had occasioned it was one of those delusive contrivances by which the party in opposition to us endeavored by lulling the people with idle hopes of reconciliation into security to turn their heads and thoughts from independence they endeavored to insert in the resolution ideas of reconciliation we carried our point for inserting peace they wanted powers to be given to the general to receive the commissioners in ceremony we ordered nothing to be done till we were solicited for passports upon the whole we avoided the snare and brought the controversy to a close with some dignity but it will never be known how much labor it cost us to accomplish it john adams

who is now here with an acadian from this it appears they are in a distressed situation and from mr eddys account they are exceedingly apprehensive that they will be reduced to the disagreeable alternative of taking up arms and joining our enemies or to flee their country unless they can be protected against their insults and oppressions he says that their committees think many salutary and valuable consequences would be derived from five or six hundred men being sent there as it would not only quiet the minds of the people from the anxiety and uneasiness they are now filled with and enable them to take a part in behalf of the colonies but be the means of preventing the indians of which there are a good many from taking the side of government and the ministerial troops from getting such supplies of provisions from thence as they have done how far these good purposes would be answered if such a force was sent as they ask for it is impossible to determine in the present uncertain state of things for if the army from boston is going to halifax as reported by them before their departure that or a much more considerable force would be of no avail if not and they possess the friendly disposition to our cause suggested in the petition and declared by mr eddy it might be of great service unless another body of troops should be sent thither by administration too powerful for them to oppose it being a matter of some importance i judged it prudent to lay it before congress for their consideration and requesting their direction upon the subject shall only add if they determine to adopt it that they will prescribe the number to be sent and whether it is to be from the regiments which will be left here i shall wait their decision and whatever it is will endeavour to have it carried into execution—washington to the president of congress    march      there seems to have been in nova scotia a strong spirit of opposition to the government and a tendency to join with the other colonies in open resistance particularly among the acadians the petition abovementioned was dated on the  th of february and signed by twelve persons resident in cumberland county and members of different committees who had acted it would appear with some degree of secrecy and under fear of the government threatening proclamations had been issued and measures adopted for raising a military force the petitioners say we agreed in our committees that nothing should be done publicly as it might instigate the others to fall upon us sooner than they intended and as we could not tell what was the intention of the continental congress concerning us therefore we pray ardently that your excellency will please to relieve us that we may be able to express our sentiments publicly and join our little strength with the other colonies in preventing the ensigns of slavery from being set up in any part of this great empire we further desire that this our request may be kept a secret for the present a member of one of the committees also wrote a private letter to washington in which he said the great contest between britain and america has hitherto been only treated speculatively among us i presume a sympathy with our brethren on the continent reigns in the breasts of the generality of the inhabitants with gladness would we be active in the glorious struggle if our situation and circumstances were such as to afford the least glimpse of success but our remoteness from the other colonies and our form of government joined with the indigence of the inhabitants render it in a manner impossible without succour from some other quarter as to the acadians i have dwelt among them near twenty years and am well acquainted with their manners and ways they are to a man wholly inclined to the cause of america there are but about two hundred regular troops in halifax including raw recruits from newfoundland and other places had we at present two or three hundred men they
