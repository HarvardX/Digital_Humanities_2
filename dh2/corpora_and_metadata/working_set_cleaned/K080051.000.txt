the spirit of masonry    in moral and elucidatory lectures  by wm hutchinson master of the barnardcastle lodge of concord  london printed for j wilkie no    in st pauls churchyard and w goldsmith no    paternoster row  mdcclxxv  the sanction whereas brother william hutchinson has compiled a book entitled the spirit of masonry and has requested our sanction for the publication thereof we having perused the said book and finding it will be of use to this society do recommend the same  petre g m rowland holt d g m thomas noel s g w john hatch j g w rowland berkley g t james heseltine g s   to the ancient and honorable society of free and accepted masons brethren the following lectures were composed for the use of the lodge over which i presided for several successive years since that time i have added explanatory notes to support my propositions or exemplify the principles of the work  with the utmost humility and diffidence i give these lectures to the public they may indeed serve to detect the wretched artifices used by wicked men to impose upon the world and if i succeed so far with you as to excite the due exercise of those moral works which our profession enjoins i shall have my reward  from the nature of our society and its laws it is difficult to write on the subject of masonry  we are not allowed that explicit language any other topic would admit of  my diction will appear technical and abstruse to all but masons and with the critic i am exposed to every degree of severity without his candor will admit the moral intention of the work in extenuation of those imperfections our mystical expression throws upon the following pages  as supreme of this society the right honorable the lord petre in the first place and after him mr holt and the officers of the grand lodge of england command my most humble acknowledgments and gratitude for the candor and condescension with which this little work was received under their precedence  my lord petre dedications

masonry and under distinct heads to arrange my observations on the nature of this society  on my initiation i was struck with the ceremonials and immediately apprehended there was more conveyed by them than appeared to the vulgar eye as i attended to the matter i was convinced my first impressions were just and by my researches to discover their implications i presume i have acquired some degree of knowledge touching the origin of masonry the reasons of its several institutions the meaning of its various symbols and their import together with the progress of the profession  it is known to the world but more particularly to my brethren that there are three degrees of masons  apprentices craftsmen and masters  the initiation to and several advancements from the order of apprentices will necessarily lead my observations to three distinct channels  how the several mysteries are revealed to masons they alone know  so steadfastly have the fraternity preserved their faith for many ages that this remains a secret to the world in defiance of the corruptions and vices of mankind  in order to comprehend our profession we must look back into the remotest antiquity and from thence collect the several parts which have been united in the forming of our order  in the first place we must give our attention to the creation of man and the state of our first parent in the garden of eden genesis  chapter i ver    and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness ver     so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him ver     and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good chapter   ver    and the lord god formed the man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul   it is not to be doubted when adam came from out the hand of his creator the image of god from whom he immediately proceeded that he was perfect in symetry and beauty that he was made in the highest degree of excellence human nature was capable of on earth  calculated for regions of felicity and paradise where sin or sorrow had not known existence  made in such perfection of body and mind that he could endure the presence of god and was capable of conversing with the almighty face to face genesis chapter ii ver             chapter iii ver     0              so much was he superior to the chosen ones of israel  he was endowed with understanding suitable to his station as one whom the almighty deigned to visit and his heart was possessed of all the virtues unpolluted endowments of an heavenly temper  his hours were full of wisdom exultation and transport  the book of nature was revealed to his comprehension and all her mysteries were open to his understanding  he knew whence and what he was  even this was but a minute degree of his capacity for astonishing as it may appear to us yet it is an uncontrovertable truth that he had a competent knowledge of the mighty the tremendous creator of the universe  he saw him with his natural eyes he heard his voice he understood his laws and was present to his majesty  to this fountain of human perfection and wisdom we must necessarily look back for all the science and learning which blessed the earliest ages of the world  calculated for such exalted felicity and elevated enjoyments placed in regions of peace where angels ministered and the divinity walked abroad was the parent of mankind  but alas he fell  his disobedience forfeited all that glory and felicity  and horrible to recount even in the midst of this exalted state satan prevailed  if we presume to estimate the change which befell adam on his expulsion from paradise by the deformity that took place on the face of the world we should be apt to believe the exile though not distorted in body was yet darkened in understanding  instead of confidence and steady faith that distrust and jealousy would take place and disbelief confound even testimony that argument would be deprived of definition and wander by excentric propositions that confusion would usurp the throne of wisdom and folly of judgment thorns and thistles grow up in the place of those excellent flowers of science which flourished in eden and darkness cloud the day of his capacity  it is not possible for me to determine from any evidence given to us in what degree disobedience and sin immediately contracted the understanding of adam but we are certain that great and dreadful effects very early took place on adams posterity  we may conclude memory was retained by our first parent in all its energy  a terrible portion of the punishment his disobedience had incurred restoring to him perfect images and neverdying estimates of what he had lost and thereby increasing the bitterness of what he had purchased through the endowments of memory adam would necessarily teach to his family the sciences which he had comprehended in eden and the knowledge he had gained of nature and her god  it will follow that some of them would retain those lessons of wisdom and faithfully transmit them to posterity  no doubt the family of cain who bore the seal of the curse on his forehead was given up to ignorance genesis cha iv ver     and cain went out from the presence of the lord   tradition would deliver down the doctrines of our first parents with the utmost truth and certainty whilst the antideluvians enjoyed that longivity of which the books of moses give evidence  but when men came to multiply exceedingly upon the face of the earth and were dispersed to the distant regions of the globe then the inestimable lessons of knowledge and truth taught by the first men fell into confusion and corruption and were retained pure and in perfection but by few  those few to our great consolation have handed them down to after ages  they also retained the universal language uncorrupted with the confusion of the plains of shinar and preserved it to posterity  thus we must necessarily look back to our first parent as the original professor of the worship of the true god to whom the religion and mysteries of nature were first revealed and from whom all the wisdom of the world was in the beginning derived  in those times when the present rules and maxims of our profession of free masonry had their beginning the minds of men were possessed of allegories emblems and mystic devices in which peculiar sciences manners institutions and doctrines in many nations were wrapped up  this was an invention of the earliest ages  the priests in egypt secreted the mysteries of their religion from the vulgar by symbols and hieroglyphics comprehensible alone to those of their own order the priests of rome and greece practiced other subtleties by which the art of divination was enveiled and their oracles were intelligible only to their brethren who expounded them to the people  these examples were wisely adopted for the purposes of concealing the mysteries of masonry  like the cybils leaves the secrets of the brotherhood would appear to the world as indistinct and scattered fragments whilst they convey to masons an uniform and wellconnected system  in the forming of this society which is at once religious and civil great regard has been given to the first knowledge of the god of nature and that acceptable service wherewith he is well pleased  this was the first stage on which our originals thought it expedient to place the foundation of masonry  they had experienced that from religion all civil ties and obligations were compacted and that thence proceeded all the bonds which could unite mankind in social intercourse  hence it was that they laid the corner stone of the edifice on the bosom of religion religions all descending from the skies to wretched man the goddess in her left holds out this world and in her right the next religion the sole voucher man is man supporter sole of man above himself even in this night of frailty change and death she gives the soul a soul that acts a god religion providence an after state here is firm footing here is solid rock this can support us all is sea besides sinks under us bestorms and then devours his hand the good man fastens on the skies and bids earth roll nor feels her idle whirl youngs night thoughts   in the earliest ages after the deluge in those nations made known to us the service of the true god was clouded with imagery and defiled by idolatry  men who had not been taught the doctrines of truth by those who retained the wisdom of the antideluvians but were left to the operations of their own judgments perceived that there was some great cause of natures uniformity and wonderful progressions of her works suitable to their ignorance they represented the author of those works by such objects as struck their observation for their powerful effects on the face of the world  from whence the sun and moon became the symbols of the deity the posterity of ham forsook the doctrines of their predecessor for the deity whose adoration he taught they soon substituted the symbol and for the original worshipped the sun which was regarded in the first ages after the deluge as the type or emblem of the divinity  the descendants of chus called cuthites were those emigrants who carried their rites religions and customs into various quarters of the globe  they were the first apostates from the truth yet great in worldly wisdom  they were joined in their expeditions by other nations especially by the collateral branches of their family the mizraim caphtorim and the sons of canaan  these were all of the line of ham who was held by his posterity in the highest veneration  they called him amon and havin process of time raised him to a divinity they worshipped him as the sun and from this worship they were styled amonians  the deity which they worshipped was the sun but they soon conferred his titles upon some of their ancestors whence arose a mixed worship they particularly deified the great patriarch who was the head of their line and worshipped him as the fountain of light making the sun only an emblem of his influence and power  bryants analysis of ancient mythology   moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians he was initiated in all the knowledge of the wisemen of that nation by whom the learning of antiquity had been retained and held sacred wrapped up from the eye of the wicked and vulgar in symbols and hieroglyphics and communicated to men of their own order only with care secrecy and circumspection  this secrecy is not in any wise to be wondered at when we consider the persecution which would have followed a faith unacceptable to the ignorance of the nations who were enveloped in superstition and bigotry and more particularly as these sages were in possession of that valuable knowledge of the powers of nature of the qualities of matter and properties of things so dangerous to be communicated to wicked and ignorant men from whose malevolence the most horrid offenses might be derived of which we may judge by the extraordinary and astonishing performances even of those impious and unenlightened men who contended with moses in the miracles he performed under the immediate impression and influence of the deity exodus chapter vii ver            chapter viii ver         moses divested the worship of the deity of its cloak of mysteries and images and taught the jews the knowledge of the god of the universe unpolluted with the errors of the nations of the earth and uncorrupted with the devices and ludicrous ceremonies instituted by the people of the east from whom he derived his first comprehension and knowledge of the divinity the author of the dissertation on the ancient pagan mysteries defending dr warburtons positions against dr leland writes thus that to the pagan divinity there was not only an open and public worship but also a secret worship paid to them to which none were admitted but those who had been selected by preparatory ceremonies called initiation this secret worship was termed the mysteries  of these there were two sorts the greater and the lesser according to the bishop of gloucester the lesser taught by certain secret rites and shows the origin of society and the doctrine of a future state they were preparatory to the greater and might be safely communicated to all the initiated without exception  the arcana of the greater mysteries were the doctrine of the unity and the detection of the errors of the vulgar polytheism these were not communicated to all the aspirants without exception but only to a small and select number who were judged capable of the secret  the initiated were obliged by the most solemn engagements to commence a life of strictest piety and virtue it was proper therefore to give them all the encouragement and assistance necessary for this purpose now in the pagan world there was a powerful temptation to vice and debauchery the profligate examples of their gods ego homuncio hoc non facerem was the absolving formula whenever any one was resolved to give a loose to his passions this evil the mysteries remedied by striking at the root of it therefore such of the initiated as were judged capable were made acquainted with the whole delusion the mystagogue taught them that jupiter mercury bacchus venus mars and the whole rabble of licentious deities were only dead mortals subject in life to the same passions and infirmities with themselves but having been on other accounts benefactors to mankind grateful posterity had deified them and with their virtues had indiscreetly canonized their vices  the fabulous gods being thus rooted the supreme cause of all things naturally took their place him they were taught to consider as the creator of the universe who pervaded all things by his virtue and governed all by his providence but here it must be observed that the discovery of this supreme cause was so made as to be consistent with the notion of local tutelary deities beings superior to men and inferior to god and by him set over the several parts of his creation this was an opinion universally holden by antiquity and never brought into question by any theist what the arcana of the mysteries overthrew was the vulgar polytheism the worship of dead men  it was natural for these politicians to keep this a secret in the mysteries for in their opinion not only the extinction but even the gradation of their false gods would have too much disconcerted and embroiled the established system of vulgar polytheism  from hence we may be led to determine that to moses the secret of the egyptian mythology was divulged by his preceptors and the knowledge of the only god revealed to him divested of all the symbols and devices which engaged the vulgar     the second stage of free masonry is grounded on this period  the temple at jerusalem owns the probation of the craftsmen  moses was also possessed of knowledge superior to that of his egyptian teachers through the revelations and inspirations of the deity  he had acquired the comprehension of and was instructed to decipher all the hieroglyphical characters used by that people in their records  it was no doubt a part of the original knowledge to express by characters to the eye the thoughts and sentiments of the mind  but this was obscured and debased in after ages by symbols and hieroglyphics yet by the immediate dispensation of heaven moses attained the knowledge of those original characters by which he was enabled to reveal to his people and preserve to posterity the commandments of god delivered to him on the mount by inscribing them on tables of stone exodus chapter xxxi ver     and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god chapter xxxiv ver    and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest ver     and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel   it is natural to conceive that the israelites would be instructed in this act by which the will of the deity was communicated  they would be led to write the doctrines of their leader and his expositions of the law that they should be preserved to their children  and if we give credit to the observations and conjectures of learned travelers the written mountains remain monuments of the peregrinating hebrews to this day  but to return to the progressions of our profession  it is not to be presumed that we are a set of men professing religious principles contrary to the revelations and doctrines of the son of god reverencing a deity by the denomination of the god of nature and denying that mediation which is graciously offered to all true believers  the members of our society at this day in the third stage of masonry confess themselves to be christians  the veil of the temple is rent  the builder is smitten  and we are raised from the tomb of transgression  i humbly presume it is not to be understood that the name of mason in this society denotes that the origin or rise of such society was solely from builders architects or mechanics  at the times in which moses ordained the setting up of the sanctuary exodus chapter xxxi ver    see i have called by name bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah ver    and i have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship ver    to devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in brass ver    and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timber to work in all manner of workmanship ver    and in the hearts of all that are wisehearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee ver    the tabernacle of the congregation etc chapter xxxvi ver    then wrought bezaleel and aholiab and every wisehearted man in whom the lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary according to all that the lord had commanded ver    and moses called bezaleel and aholiab and every wisehearted man in whose heart the lord had put wisdom even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it and when solomon was about to build the temple at jerusalem they selected from out the people those men who were enlightened with the true faith and being full of wisdom and religious fervor were found proper to conduct these works of piety  it was on those occasions that our predecessors appeared to the world as architects and were formed into a body under salutary rules for the government of those who were employed in these great works since which period builders have adopted the name of masons as an honourary distinction and title to their profession  i am induced to believe the name of mason has its derivation from a language in which it implies some strong indication or distinction of the nature of the society and that it has not its relation to architects  the french word mason signifies a family or particular race of people  it seems as if the name was compounded of  quero salvum and the title of masonry no more than a corruption of  sum in medio coeli or  signa coelestia job xxxviii     which conjecture is strengthened by our symbols the titles of masons and masonry most probably were derived from the greek language as the greek idiom is adopted by them and is shown in many instances in the course of this work  the druids when they committed any thing to writing used the greek alphabet  and i am bold to assert the most perfect remains of the druids rites and ceremonies are preserved in the ceremonials of masons that are to be found existing among mankind  my brethren may be able to trace them with greater exactness than i am at liberty to explain to the public  the original names of masons and masonry may probably be derived from or corrupted of  res arcana mysteries and  sacris initiatus mysta  those initiated to sacred mysteries     i am inclined to determine that the appellation of mason implies a member of a religious sect and a professed devotee of the deity who is seated in the center of heaven  to prove these several propositions in masonry to be true and to demonstrate to masons the importance of their order shall be the subject of the following lectures  the principles of morality are rigorously enjoined us  charity and brotherly love are our inindispensable duty  how they are prescribed to us and their practice enforced will also be treated of in the following pages  my original design in these lectures was not only to explain to my brethren the nature of their profession but also to testify to the world that our mysteries are important and to take away the reproach which has fallen upon this society by the vices ignorance or irregularities of some profligate men who have been found among masons  should the errors of a few stain and render ignominious a whole society or bring infamy and contempt on a body of men there is no association on earth either civil or religious which might not be affected  lecture ii on the rites ceremonies and institutions of the ancients there is no doubt that our ceremonies and mysteries were derived from the rites ceremonies and institutions of the ancients and some of them from the remotest ages our morality is deduced from the maxims of the grecian philosophers and perfected by the christian revelation  the institutors of this society had their eyes on the progression of religion and they symbolized it as well in the first stage as in the advancement of masons  the knowledge of the god of nature forms the first estate of our profession the worship of the deity under the jewish law is described in the second stage of masonry and the christian dispensation is distinguished in the last and highest order  it is extremely difficult with any degree of certainty to trace the exact origin of our symbols or from whence our ceremonies or mysteries were particularly derived  i shall point out some ancient institutions from whence they may have been deduced  the assideans a sect among the jews divided into  the merciful and  the just the fathers and predecessors of the pharisees and essenes  they preferred their traditions before the written word and set up for a sanctity and purity that exceeded the law they at last fell into the error of the sadduces in denying the resurrection and the faith of rewards and punishments after this life  the essenes the etymologies of the names essaei or esseni i e essenes are diverse that which i prefer is from the syriac  asa signifying  to heal or cure diseases for though they gave themselves chiefly to the study of the bible yet with all they studied physic  concerning the beginning of this sect from whom or when it began it is hard to determine some make them as ancient as the rechabites and the rechabites to have differed only in the addition of some rules and ordinances from the kenites mentioned judge i    and thus by consequence the essenes were as ancient as the israelites departure out of egypt for jethro mosess fatherin law as appears by the text was a kenite but neither of these seems probable for the kenites are not mentioned in scripture as a distinct order or sect of people but as a distinct family kindred or nation numb xxiv    secondly the rechabites did not build houses but dwelt in tents neither did they deal in husbandry they sowed no seed nor planted vineyards nor had any jer lv    the essenes on the contrary dwelt not in tents but in houses and they employed themselves especially in husbandry one of the hebrew doctors says that the essenes were nazarites but that cannot be because the law enjoined the nazarites when the time of the consecration was on to present themselves at the door of the tabernacle or temple numb vi now the essenes had no access to the temple when therefore or from what author this sect took its beginning is uncertain the first that i find mentioned by the name of an essene josephus l xiii c    was one judas who lived in the time of aristobulus the son of jannes hyrcanus before our saviors birth about one hundred years however this sect was of greater antiquity for all three pharisees sadduces and essenes were in jonathans time the brother of judas maccabeus who was fifty years before aristobulus certain it is that this sect continued until the days of our savior and after philo and josephus speak of them as living in their times what might be the reason then that there is no mention of them in the new testament i answer first the number of them seems not to have been great in philo and josephuss time about four thousand which being dispersed in many cities made the faction weak and happily in jerusalem when our savior lived they were either few or none secondly if we observe histories we shall find them peaceable and quiet not opposing any and therefore not so liable to reproof as the pharisees and sadduces who opposed each other and both joined against christ thirdly why might they not as well be passed over in silence in the new testament especially containing themselves quietly without contradiction of others as the rechabites in the old testament of whom there is mention only once and that obliquely although their order continued about three hundred years before this testimony was given of them by the prophet jeremy for between john with whom jonadab was coetanean and zedekia chronologers observe the distance of many years lastly though the name of essenes be not found in scripture yet we shall find in st pauls epistles many things reproved which were taught in the school of the essenes of this nature was that advice given to timothy   timothy v    drink no longer water but use a little wine  again   timothy iv   forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meat is a doctrine of devils  but especially coloss  d in many passages the apostle seems directly to point at them let no man condemn you in meat and drink v     let no man bear rule over you by humbleness of mind and worshipping of angels v      why are ye subject to ordinances v  0  the apostle uses the word  which was applied by the essenes to denote their ordinances aphorisms or constitutions  in the verse following he gives an instance of some particulars touch not taste not handle not ver     now the junior company of essenes might not touch their seniors and in their diet their taste was limited to bread salt water and hyssop and these ordinances they undertook  says philo for the love of wisdom but the apostle concludes ver    that these things had only  a show of wisdom and whereas philo terms the religion of the essenes by the name of  which word signifies religious worship the apostle terms in the same verse  voluntary religion or will worship yea where he terms their doctrine  a kind of philosophy received from their forefathers by tradition st paul bids them beware of philosophy ver   godwyns moses and aaron   were of very remote antiquity and it has been argued by divines that they were as ancient as the departure of the israelites out of egypt they might take their rise from that dispersion of their nation which happened after their being carried captive into babylon the principal character of this sect was that they chose retirement were sober were industrious had all things in common paid the highest regard to the moral precepts of the law but neglected the ceremonial any further than what regarded bodily cleanliness the observation of the sabbath and making an annual present to the temple at jerusalem they never associated with women nor admitted them into their retreats by the most sacred oaths though they were in general averse to swearing or to requiring an oath they bound all whom they initiated among them to the observance of piety justice fidelity and modesty to conceal the secrets of the fraternity preserve the books of their instructors and with great care commemorate the names of the angels they held that god was surrounded by spiritual beings who were mediators with him and and therefore to be reverenced second that the soul is defiled by the body and that all bodily pleasures hurt the soul which they believed to be immortal though they denied the resurrection of the body as it would return the soul to sin third that there was a great mystery in numbers particularly in the number seven they therefore attributed a natural holiness to the seventh or sabbath day which they observed more strictly than the other jews they spent their time mostly in contemplation and abstained from every gratification of the senses the essenes introduced their maxims into the christian church and it is alleged by the learned that st paul in his epistles to the ephesians and colossians particularly censures the tenets of this sect  of these essenes there were two sorts some were theoricks giving themselves wholly to speculation others practicks laborious and painful in the daily exercise of those arts or manufactories in which they were most skilful of the latter philo treats in his book entitled quod omnis vir probus of the former in the book following entitled de vita contemplativa  godwyns moses and aaron the essenes were denied access to the temple  the practicks and theoricks both agreed in their aphorisms or ordinances but in certain circumstances they differed    the practicks dwelt in the cities the theoricks shunned the cities and dwelt in gardens and solitary villages    the practicks spent the day in manuel crafts keeping of sheep looking to bees tilling of ground etc they were artificers the theoricks spent the day in meditation and prayer whence they were from a kind of excellency by philo termed supplicants    the practicks had every day their dinner and supper allowed them the theoricks only their supper  the practicks had for their commons every one his dish of water gruel and bread the theoricks only bread and salt if any were of a more delicate palate than other to him it was permitted to eat hyssop their drink for both was common water  some are of opinion that these theoricks were christian monks but the contrary appears for these reasons    in the whole book of philo concerning the theoricks there is no mention either of christ or christians of the evangelists or apostles    the theoricks in that book of philos are not any new sect of late beginning as the christians at that time were as is clearly evinced by philos own words in calling the doctrine of the essenes  a philosophy derived unto them by tradition from their forefathers  in grecian antiquity we find a festival celebrated in honor of caeres it was the most celebrated and mysterious solemnity of any in greece whence it is often called by way of eminence the mysteries and so superstitiously careful were they to conceal the sacred rites that if any person divulged any of them he was thought to have called down some divine judgment upon his head and it was accounted unsafe to abide in the same house with him wherefore he was apprehended as a public offender and suffered death such also was the secrecy of these rites that if any person who was not lawfully initiated did but out of ignorance or mistake chance to be present at the mysterious rites he was put to death the neglect of initiation was looked upon as a crime of a very heinous nature insomuch that it was one part of the accusation for which socrates was condemned to death persons convicted of witchcraft or any other heinous crime or had committed murder though involuntary were debarred from these mysteries in later times certain institutions were made called the lesser mysteries and were used as preparative to the greater for no persons were initiated in the greater unless they had purified at the lesser the persons who were to be admitted to the greater mysteries made their sacrifice a year after purification the secret rites of which some few excepted to which only priests were conscious were frankly revealed to them  the manner of initiation was thus the candidates being crowned with myrtle had admittance by night into a place called  i e the mystical temple which was an edifice so vast and capacious that the most ample theater did scarce exceed it at their entrance they purified themselves by washing their hands in holy water and at the same time were admonished to present themselves with minds pure and undefiled without which the external cleanness of the body would by no means be accepted after this the holy mysteries were read to them out of a book called  which word is derived from  a stone because the book was nothing else but two stones fitly cemented together then the priest that initiated them called  proposed certain questions to which they returned answers in a set form as may be seen in meursiuss treatise on this festival this done strange and amazing objects presented themselves sometimes the place they were in seemed to shake round them sometimes appeared bright and resplendent with light and radiant fire and then again covered with black darkness and horror  sometimes thunder and lightning sometimes frightful noises and bellowings sometimes terrible apparitions astonished the trembling spectators the garments in which they were initiated were accounted sacred and of no less efficacy to avert evils than charms and incantations  the chief person that attended at the initiation was called  i e a revealer of holy things the hierophantes had three assistants the first of which was called from his office  i e torchbearer the second was called  or the crier the third ministered at the altar and was for that reason named   hierophantes is said to have been a type of the great creator of all things  of the sun  of mercury and  of the moon    at eleusis a town of attica where the athenians with great pomp and many ceremonies attended the mystic rites  historians tell us that these rites were a mystical representation of what the mythologists taught of that goddess and were of so sacred a nature that no less than death was the penalty of discovery  there was another great festival celebrated by the greeks at plataea in honor of jupiter eleutherius the assembly was composed of delegates from almost all the cities of greece and the rites which were instituted in honor of jupiter as the guardian of liberty were performed with the utmost magnificence and solemn pomp  in balsara and along the banks of jordan a sect of christians are known who call themselves christians of st john but as they profess no knowledge of the union of the third person in the trinity i am induced to believe no part of our profession was derived from them their ceremonies and mysteries are founded on traditions and they permit no canonical book to be received amongst them  in the institution of the orders of knighthood the eyes of the founders were fixed on various religious ceremonies being the general mode of ancient times  knights of the bath had their hair cut and beards shaven were shut up in the chapel alone all the night preceding their initiation there to spend the solemn hours in fasting meditation and prayer they offered their sword at the altar as devotees to the will of heaven and assumed a motto expressive of their vow tres in uno meaning the unity of the three theological virtues  various orders of knights wear a cross on their cloaks the order of christ in livonia instituted in   0  wore this ensign and were denominated brothers of the sword  the order of the holy ghost wear a golden cross  an ancient writing which is preserved amongst masons with great respect requires my attention in this place as it discovers to us what the ancient masons regarded as the foundation of our profession see the appendix  this writing is said to have come from the hand of king henry the sixth who began his reign in      it is in the form of an inquisition for the discovery of the nature of masonry  from this ancient record we are told that the mystery of masonry is a knowledge of nature and its operations appendix  that this science arose in the east ezekiel chapter xliii ver   and behold the glory of the god of israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like the noise of many waters and the earth shined with his glory chapter xxiv ver    the east gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the glory of the god of israel has entered in by it therefore it shall be shut ver    it is for the prince the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord  from the east it is well known learning first extended itself into the western world and advanced into europe  the east was an expression used by the ancients to imply christ  in this sense we find  used in the prophets  that the phoenicians first introduced this science it is the opinion of many great antiquaries that the druids were established in britain before they gained any footing in gaul  to quote the authorities for this would render my work too prolix  in order to show how early the maxims and principles of the eastern nations might be communicated to this land i must mention some observations of learned men  arthur agard deputy chamberlain of the exchequer    0 vide bibl cotton faustina e v speaking of the admeasurement of lands in this country says our nation having their origin from the trojans brought from thence the same order as was observed in that country our lands were measured by hides the etymology whereof is derived from didos act mentioned in virgil the word hyda not being to be found in any other language but ours  it is the opinion of the learned dr stukely that there is no doubt our first british ancestors were of the progeny of abraham in the arabian line by hagar and by keturah the ishmaelites and medianites who came hither with the tyrian hercules to seek for tin  after naming many evidences and authorities to support this assertion he adds and these matters mutually prove one another both that they came hither by sea from the coast of phoenicia and that they brought the arts mentioned with them from the east  admitting that there is merely a probability in these opinions it will follow that from thence the druids would at once derive their theological principles and their religious rites  the sacred groves the unhewn altars the stone pillars the consecrated circles emblematical of eternity were adopted from the manners of the hebrews and the eastern nations   appendix  that pythagoras journeyd into egypt and syria and brought with him these mysteries into greece appendix  it is known to all the learned that pythagoras traveled into egypt and was initiated there into several different orders of priests who in those days kept all their learning secret from the vulgar  he made every geometrical theorem a secret and admitted only such to the knowledge of them as had first undergone a fiveyears silence  he is supposed to be the inventor of the   th proposition of euclid the   th proposition of euclid which is attributed to pythagoras is contained in the first book and is as follows  theorem in any rightangled triangle the square which is described upon the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares described upon the sides which contain the right angle  the demonstration   in geometrical solutions and demonstrations of quantities this proposition is of excellent use and the example is held by us as a memorial of pythagoras   for which in the joy of his heart it is said he sacrificed an hecatomb  he knew the true system of the world revived by copernicus  the record appendix also says that pythagoras framed a great lodge at crotona in greecia magna and made many masons some of whom journeyd to france and there made masons from whence in process of time the art passed into england  from whence it is to be understood that the pupils of this philosopher who had been initiated by him in the crotonian school in the sciences and the study of nature which he had acquired in his travels dispersed themselves and taught the doctrines of their preceptor from hence it would seem that our druids received their origin in gaul but antiquaries of late years have been of opinion that they originated in britain   the same record appendix says that masons teach mankind the arts of agriculture architecture astronomy geometry numbers music poesy chemistry government and religion  i will next observe how far this part of of the record correspondends with what pythagoras taught  the pythagoric tetracties were a point a line a surface and a solid  his philosophical system is that in which the sun is supposed to rest in the center of our system of planets and in which the earth is carried round him annually being the same with the copernican  it seems as if this system was professed by masons in contradistinction to those who held the mosaic system  among the jews were a set of men who were called masorites in godwyns moses and aaron this account is given of them that their name was derived from  masar signifying tradere to deliver and masor a tradition delivered from hand to hand to posterity without writing as the pythagorians and druids were wont to do  pythagoras lived at samos in the reign of tarquin the last king of the romans in the year of rome two hundred and twenty or according to livy in the reign of servius tullius in the year of the world three thousand four hundred and seventytwo  from his extraordinary desire of knowledge he traveled in order to enrich his mind with the learning of the several countries through which he passed  he was the first that took the name of philosopher that is a lover of wisdom which implied that he did not ascribe the possession of wisdom to himself but only the desire of possessing it in godwyns moses and aaron treating of the essenes we have the following comparisons between their principles and the maxims of pythagoras  their dogmata their ordinances or constitutions did symbolize in many things with pythagorass therefore my purpose is first to name pythagorass and then to proceed with the essenes they follow thus  the pythagorians professed a communion of goods so did the essenes they had one common purse or stock  none richer none poorer than other out of this common treasury every one supplied his own wants without leave and administered to the necessity of others only they might not relieve any of their kindred without leave from the overseers they did not buy or sell among themselves but each supplied the others want by a kind commutative bartering yea liberty was granted to take one from another what they wanted without exchange they performed offices of service mutually one to another for mastership and service cannot stand with communion of goods when they traveled besides weapons for defense they took nothing with them for in whatsoever city or village they came they repaired to the fraternity of the essenes and were there entertained as members of the same and if we do attentively read josephus we may observe that the essenes of every city joined themselves into one common fraternity or college every college had two sorts of officers treasurers who looked to the common stock provided their diet appointed each his task and other public necessaries others who entertained their strangers    the pythagorians shunned pleasures so did the essenes to this belonged their avoiding of oil which if any touched unawares they wiped it off presently    the pythagorians garments were white so were the essenes white also  modest not costly when once they put on a suit they never changed it till it was worn out or torn    the pythagorians forbade oaths so did the essenes they thought him a noted liar who could not be believed without an oath    the pythagorians had their elders in singular respect so had the essenes the body or whole company of the essenes were distinguished in four ranks or orders according to their seniority and happily if any of the superior ranks had touched any of the inferior he thought himself polluted as if he had touched an heathen    the pythagorians drank water so did the essenes water only  wholly abstaining from wine    the pythagorians used inanimate sacrifices so did the essenes they sent gifts to the temple and did not sacrifice but preferred the use of their holy water thereto for which reason the other jews sorbade them all access unto the temple    the pythagorians ascribed all things to fate or destiny so did the essenes in this aphorism all three jewish sects differed each from other  the pharisees ascribed some things to fate and other things to mans free will  the essenes ascribed all to fate  the sadduces wholly denied fate and ascribed all things to mans free will    the pythagorians the first five years were not permitted to speak in the school but were initiated per quinque male silentium and not until then suffered to come into the presence of or sight of pythagoras to this may be referred the essenes silence at table straightly observed so that december simul sedentibus nemo loquiter invitis novem  drusius renders it that ten of them sitting together none of them spoke without leave obtained of the nine when any did speak it was not their custom to interrupt him with words but by nods of the head or beckenings or holding their finger or shaking their heads and other suchlike dumb signs and gestures to signify their doubtings disliking or approving the matter in hand and to the time of silence among the pythagorians that it must be five years may be referred the initiation of the essenes for amongst them none were presently admitted into their society without full trial and four years probation  the first year they received doloellum a spade perezoina a pair of breeches used in bathing and vestem albam a white garment which the sect affected at this time they had their commons allowed them but without not in the common dining hall the second year they admitted them to the participation of holy matters and instructed them in the use of them two years after they admitted them in full manner making them of their corporation after they had received an oath truly to observe all the rules and orders of the essenes if any brake his oath one hundred of them being assembled together expelled him upon which expulsion commonly followed death within a short time for none having once entered this order might receive alms or any meat from other and themselves would feed such a one only with distasteful herbs which wasted his body and brought it very low sometimes they would readmit such a one being brought near unto death but commonly they suffered him to die in that manner   0 the essenes worshipped toward the sun rising     the essenes bound themselves in their oath to preserve the name of angels the phrase implying a kind of worshipping of them     they were above all others strict in the observation of the sabbath day  on it they would dress no meat kindle no fire remove no vessels out of their place no nor ease nature yea they observed every seventh week a solemn pentecost seven pentecosts every year  from the great similitude in the principles of the pythagorians and essenes it seems as if they were derived from one origin varying in some few particulars suitable to the constitutions of the people and most probably they first sprang from egyptian tenets and maxims    his maxims of morality were admirable for he was for having the study of philosophy solely tend to elevate man to a resemblance of the deity  he believed that god is a soul diffused through all nature and that from him human souls are derived that they are immortal and that men need only take pains to purge themselves of their vices in order to be united to the deity  he made unity the principle of all things and believed that between god and man there are various orders of spiritual beings who are the ministers of the supreme will  he condemned all images of the deity and would have him worshipped with as few ceremonies as possible  his disciples brought all their goods into a common stock  contemned the pleasures of sense  abstained from swearing  eat nothing that had life  and believed in the doctrine of a metempsychosis or transmigration of souls  some eminent writers deny that pythagoras taught that souls passed into brute animals reuchlin in particular denies this doctrine and maintains that the metempsychosis of pythagoras implied nothing more than a similitude of manners and desires formerly existing in some person deceased and now reviving in another alive  pythagoras is said to have borrowed the notion of metempsychosis from the egyptians others say from the ancient brachmans  lecture iii on the rites ceremonies and institutions of the ancients the disciples of pythagoras were divided into two classes the first were simple hearers and the last such as were allowed to propose their difficulties and learn the reasons of all that was taught  the figurative manner in which he gave his instructions was borrowed from the hebrews egyptians and other orientals  if we examine how morality or moral philosophy is defined we shall find that it is a conformity to those unalterable obligations which result from the nature of our existence and the necessary relations of life whether to god as our creator or to man as our fellow creature  or it is the doctrine of virtue in order to attain the greatest happiness  pythagoras showed the way to socrates though his examples were very imperfect as he deduced his rules of morality from observations of nature a degree of knowledge which he had acquired in his communion with the priests of egypt  the chief aim of pythagorass moral doctrine was to purge the mind from the impurities of the body and from the clouds of the imagination  his morality seems to have had more purity and piety in it than the other systems but less exactness his maxims being only a bare explication of divine worship of natural honesty of modesty integrity publicspiritedness and other common offices of life  socrates improved the lessons of pythagoras and reduced his maxims into sixed principles  plato refined the doctrine of both these philosophers and carried each virtue to its utmost height and accomplishment mixing his ideas of the universal principle of philosophy through the whole design  the ancient masonic record appendix also says that masons know the way of gaining an understanding of abrac  on this word all commentators which i have yet read on the subject of masonry have confessed themselves at a loss  abrac or abracar was a name which basilides a religious of the second century gave to god who he said was the author of three hundred and sixtyfive  the author of this superstition is said to have lived in the time of adrian and that it had its name after abrasan or abraxas the denomination which basilides gave to the deity  he called him the supreme god and ascribed to him seven subordinate powers or angels who presided over the heavens  and also according to the number of the days in the year he held that three hundred and sixtyfive virtues powers or intelligences existed as the emanations of god the value or numerical distinctions of the letters in the word according to the ancient greek numerals made      a     p  00 a    0 a   s  00  amongst antiquaries abraxas is an antique gem or stone with the word abraxas engraven on it  there are a great many kinds of them of various figures and sizes mostly as old as the third century  persons professing the religious principles of basilides wore this gem with great veneration as an amulet from whose virtues and the protection of the deity to whom it was consecrated and with whose name it was inscribed the wearer derived health prosperity and safety  the annexed plate is from a drawing taken in the british museum of a gem deposited there is near twice the size of the original which is engraved on a beril stone of the form of an egg the head is in camio the reverse in taglio the head is supposed to represent the image of the creator under the denomination of jupiter ammon jupiter ammon a name given to the supreme deity and who was worshipped under the symbol of the sun he was painted with horns because with the astronomers the sign aries in the zodiac is the beginning of the year when the sun enters into the house of aries he commences his annual course heat in the hebrew tongue hammah in the prophet isaiah hammamin is given as a name of such images the error of depicting him with horns grew from the doubtful signification of the hebrew word which at once expresses heat splendor or brightness and also horns  the sun was also worshipped by the house of judah under the name of tamuz for tamuz says hierom was adonis and adonis is generally interpreted the sun from the hebrew word adon signifying dominus the same as baal or moloch formerly did the lord or prince of the planets the month which we call june was by the hebrews called tamuz and the entrance of the sun into the sign cancer was in the jews astronomy termed tekupha tamuz the revolution of tamuz  about the time of our savior the jews held it unlawful to pronounce that essential name of god jehovah and instead thereof read adonai to prevent the heathen blaspheming that holy name by the adoption of the name of jove etc to the idols  concerning adonis whom some ancient authors call osiris there are two things remarkable  the death or loss of adonis and  the finding of him again as there was great lamentation at his loss so was there great joy at his finding by the death or loss of adonis we are to understand the departure of the sun by his finding again the return of that luminary now he seems to depart twice in the year first when he is in the tropic of cancer in the farthest degree northward and secondly when he is in the tropic of capricorn in the furthest degree southward hence we may note that the egyptians celebrated their adonia in the month of november when the sun began to be farthest southward and the house of judah theirs in the month of june when the sun was farthest northward yet both were for the same reasons some authors say that this lamentation was performed over an image in the night season and when they had sufficiently lamented a candle was brought into the room which ceremony might mystically denote the return of the sun then the priest with a soft voice muttered this form of words trust ye in god for out of pains salvation is come unto us godwyns moses and aaron  the sun and moon on the reverse the osiris and isis of the egyptians and were used hierographically to represent the omnipotence omnipresence and eternity of god  the star our next inquiry is what idol was meant by chiun and remphau otherwise in ancient copies called repham by chiun we are to understand hercules who in the egyptian language was called chon by repham we are to understand the same hercules for rephaim in holy tongue signifies giant by hercules we may understand the planet of the sun there are etymologists that derive herculess name from the hebrew hiercol illuminavit omnia the greek etymology  aeris gloria holds correspondency with the hebrew and both signify that universal light which flows from the sun as water from a fountain porphyry interprets herculess twelve labors so often mentioned by the poets to be nothing else but the twelve signs of the zodiac through which the sun passes yearly but some may question whether the name of hercules was ever known to the jews it is probable it was for hercules was god of the tyrians from whom the jews learned much idolatry as being their near neighbors it is apparent that in the time of the maccabees the name was commonly known unto them for jason the high priest sent three hundred drachmes of silver to the sacrifice of hercules   mac iv     the star of remphau is thought to be the star which was painted in the forehead of molech neither was it unusual for the heathen to paint their idols with such symbolica additamenta godwyns moses and aaron the egyptian apis was to bear such mark   seems to be used as a point only but is an emblem of prudence the third emanation of the basilidian divine person  the scorpion i own myself doubtful of the implication of these hieroglyphics i am inclined to believe the whole of them implied the tenets of the egyptian philosophy  that the scorpion represents egypt being her ruling sign in the zodiac  and that the serpent represents a religious tenet the learned mr bryant proves to us that it was adopted amongst the ancients as the most sacred and salutary symbol and rendered a chief object of adoration in so much that the worship of the serpent prevailed so that many places as well as people received their names from thence   in hieroglyphics represented malice and wicked subtlety and the serpent  the corruptions flowing from the egyptian philosophy when adapted to christianity were these they held that the god of the jews was the demiurgus that to overthrow and subvert the power and dominion of this demiurgus jesus one of the celestial aeons was sent by the supreme being to enter into the body of the man christ in the shape of a dove that christ by his miracles and sufferings subverted the kingdom of the demiurgus but when he came to suffer the aeon jesus carried along with him the soul of christ and left behind upon the cross only his body and animal spirit that the serpent who deceived eve ought to be honored for endeavoring to rescue man from their slavery to the demiurgus key to the new testament an heretic  the implication whereof seems to be that heresy the subtleties and vices of infidels and the devotees of satan were subdued by the knowledge of the true god  the description i own myself at a loss how to decipher the characters are imperfect or ill copied i have obtained two constructions of the inscription on the abrax the one is the earth shall praise thee   0  purporting the date of the sculpture  this date can have no relation to the christian era basilides existed in the earliest age of christianity and the ensignae with which the gem is engraven have relation most evidently to the egyptian philosophy which renders it probable this antique owes its creation to very remote ages the other construction without noticing the numerals is terra declarat laudem magnificientiamque tuam both these gentlemen say the characters are very rude and imperfect  as to the numerals computing the date from the deluge it will relate to that remarkable era of davids conquest of jerusalem and settling the empire and royal seat there the descendants of ham would probably take their date from the departure of noahs sons from the ark     the moon with divines is an hieroglyphic of the christian church who compared i c to the sun and the church to the moon as receiving all its beauty and splendor from him  in church history abrax is noted as a mystical term expressing the supreme god under whom the basilidians supposed three hundred and sixtyfive dependant deities  it was the principle of the gnostic hierarchy whence sprang their multitudes of thaeons  from abraxas proceeded their primogaenial mind  from the primogaenial mind the logos or word  from the logos the phronaesis or prudence  from phronaesis sophia and dynamis or wisdom and strength  from these two proceeded principalities powers and angels and from these other angels of the number of three hundred and sixtyfive who were supposed to have the government of so many celestial orbs committed to their care  the gnostics of the gentiles who were converted to christianity the most dangerous and pernicious kind were those who were infected with the egyptian philosophy a system as it was then taught entirely chimerical and absurd the christians of this sort assumed to themselves the name of gnostics a word of greek extraction implying in it a knowledge of things much superior to that of other men this word does not occur in the new testament but the nicolaitans made mention of in the apocalypse of st john seem to have been of the gnostic sect and most of the errors maintained by cerinthus and opposed in the gospel of st john may be derived from the same source when we say the gentile converts were chiefly liable to the gnostic infection we must not be understood to exclude those of the jewish race many of whom were tainted with it but they seem to have derived it from the essenes the maintainers of the egyptian philosophy held that the supreme being the infinitely perfect and happy was not the creator of the universe nor the alone independent being for according to them matter too was eternal the supreme being who resides in the immensity of space which they call pteroma or fullness produced from himself say they other immortal and spiritual natures styled by them aeons who filled the residence of the deity with beings similar to themselves of these beings some were placed in the higher regions others in the lower those in the lower regions were nighest to the place of matter which originally was an inert and formless mass till one of them without any commission from the deity and merely to show his own dexterity reduced it into form and order and enlivened some parts of it with animal spirit the being who achieved all this they called the demiurgus the operator artificer or workman but such was the perverseness of matter that when brought into form it was the source of all evil the supreme being therefore never intended to have given it a form but as that had been now done he in order to prevent mischief as much as possible added to the animal spirit of many of the enlivened parts rational powers the parts to whom rational powers were thus given were the original parents of the human race the other animated parts were the brute creation unluckily however the interposition of the supreme being was in vain for the demiurgus grew so aspiring that he seduced men from their allegiance to the supreme being and diverted all their devotion to himself key to the new testament were a sect of christians having particular tenets of faith  they assumed their name to express that new knowledge and extraordinary light to which they made pretensions the word gnostic implying an enlightened person  the gnostic hierarchy here pointed out represents to us the degrees of etherial persons or emanations of the deity  this leads me to consider the hierarchy of the christian church in its greatest antiquity which in the most remote times as a society consisted of several orders of men viz rulers believers and catechumens the rulers were bishops priests and deacons the believers were perfect christians and the catechumens imperfect  catechumens were candidates for baptism  they were admitted to the state of catechumen by the imposition of hands and the sign of the cross  their introduction to baptism was thus singular  some days before their admission they went veiled and it was customary to touch their ears saying be opened and also to anoint their eyes with clay both ceremonies being in imitation of our saviors practice and intended to shadow out to the candidates their ignorance and blindness before their initiation they continued in the state of catechumen until they proved their proficiency in the catechistic exercises when they were advanced to the second state as believers  as the druids tacitus says among the britains there is to be seen in their ceremonies and superstitious persuasions an apparent conformity with the gauls both nations had their druidae as both caesar and tacitus evidence of whom caesar thus records the druidae are present at all divine service they are the overseers of public and private sacrifices and the interpreters of religious rites and ceremonies they are the preceptors of youth who pay them the highest honor and esteem they determine all controversies both public and private in the cases of heinous offenses murder or manslaughter they judge of the matter and give rewards or decree penalties and punishments they determine disputes touching inheritance and boundaries of lands if either private person or body politic obey not their decree they debar them from religious ceremonies as excommunicate which is esteemed by this people as a grievous punishment whoever are under this interdict are esteemed wicked and impious persons and are avoided by all men as fearing contagion from them they have no benefit of the law and are incapacitated from holding any public office of the druidae there is a chief who has the greatest authority amongst them at his death the most excellent person amongst them is elected as his successor but upon any contest the voice of the druidae is required  sometimes the contest is determined by arms  they at a certain season of the year hold a solemn session within a consecrated place in the marches of the carmites near charhes in france hither resort as unto the term from all parts all persons having controversies or suits at law and the decree and judgment there delivered is religiously obeyed their learning and profession is thought to have been first devised in britain and so from thence translated into france and in these days they that desire more competent learning therein go thither for instruction the druids are free from tributes and service in war and like these immunities are they also exempt from all state impositions many excited by such rewards resort to them to be instructed it is reported they learn by heart many verses they continue under this discipline for certain years it being unlawful to commit any of their doctrines to writing other matters which they trust to writing is written in the greek alphabet this order they have established i presume for two reasons because they would not have their doctrines divulged nor their pupils by trusting to their books neglect the exercise of the memory this one point they are principally anxious to inculcate to their scholars that mans soul is immortal and after death that it passes from one man to another they presume by this doctrine men will contemn the fear of death and be steadfast in the exercise of virtue moreover concerning the stars and their motions the greatness of heaven and earth the nature of things the power and might of the eternal divinity they give many precepts to their pupils  from pliny we learn the druidae for so they call their diviners wisemen and priests esteem nothing in the world more sacred than misleto and the tree which produces it if it be an oak the priests choose groves of oak for their divine service they solemnize no sacrifice nor celebrate any sacred ceremonies with the branches and leaves of oak from whence they may seem to claim the name of dryidae in greek whatsoever they find growing to that tree besides its own proper produce they esteem it as a gift sent from heaven and a sure sign that the deity whom they serve has chosen that peculiar tree no wonder that misleto is so revered for it is scarce and difficult to be found but when they do discover it they gather it very devoutly and with many ceremonies to that end they observe that the moon be just six days old for on that day their months and new years commence and also their several ages which have their revolutions every thirty years they call the misleto allheal for they have an opinion that it is an universal remedy against all diseases when they are about to gather it after they have duly prepared their sacrifices and festivals under the tree they bring thither two young bullocks milkwhite whose horns are then and not before bound up this done the priest arrayed in a surplice or white vesture climbeth the tree and with a golden bill cutteth off the misleto which those beneath receive in a white cloth they then stay the beasts for sacrifice pronouncing many orisons and prayers  that it would please god to bless these his gifts to their good on whom he had bestowed them   were a set of religious peculiar to gaul and britain it may not be improper to cast our eyes on the ceremonies they used their antiquity and peculiar station render it probable some of their rites and institutions might be retained in forming the ceremonies of our society  in so modern an era as one thousand one hundred and forty they were reduced to a regular body of religious in france and built a college in the city of orleans  they were heretofore one of the two estates of france to whom were committed the care of providing sacrifices of prescribing laws for worship and deciding controversies concerning rights and properties  in the greatest antiquity in ancient gaul and britain they were elected out of the best families and were held both from the honors of their birth and office in the greatest veneration their study was astrology geometry natural history politics and geography they had the administration of all sacred things were the interpreters of religion and the judges of all matters indifferently  they had a chief or archdruid in every country  they had the tutorage of youth and taught them many verses which they caused them to learn by heart without the assistance of writing in which manner they instructed them in the mysteries of their religion the sciences and politics  at the conclusion of each year they held a general festival and assembly in which they paid their adoration and offered gifts to the god of nature bringing with them misleto and branches of oaks in mystic verses supplicating for approaching spring and the renewing year  at their sacrifices i cannot quit the subject of the druids worship without taking notice of the charge made against them by solinus and dio cassius that they offered human victims or mens flesh in their sacrifices  if we examine this charge with candor we will not impute to them so great an offense against the god of nature and humanity as appears at first fight they were judges of all matters civil and religious they were the executors of the law as being the ministers of god to them was committed the administration of justice i shall admit that they used human sacrifices but those sacrificed were criminals were offenders against society obnoxious to the world for their sins and adjudged to be deserving of death for their heinous wickedness the great attribute of god to which they paid the most religious deference was justice  to the god of justice they offered up those offenders who had sinned against his laws  punishments by death were of very early date and such punishments have never been esteemed a stigma on the states in which they were used  such executions by the druids were at once designed as punishments and examples the utmost solemnity and the most hallowed rites preceded and prepared this tremendous exhibition to impress on the minds of the spectators the deepest religious reverence and the utmost horror of the sufferings and detestation of the crimes for which they suffered were endeavored to be instilled into the hearts of those who were present at this execution by the doctrine of the druids the criminals were shut up in an effigy of wicker work of a gigantic size in whose chambers of tribulation they suffered an ignominious death by burning  this effigy represented the tyrian hercules whose name of remphan in the hebrew tongue implies a giant  with him came the phoenicians to this land from whom the amonian rites and hebrew customs were taught to the druids  under his name worship was also paid to the god of nature symbolized by the sun  in honor and commemoration of him the criminals were committed to his effigy as being delivered up to the god of justice   and in their religious offices they wore white apparel and the victims were two white bulls  they opened a sessions once a year in a certain consecrated place in which all causes were tried and determined  they worshipped one supreme god immense and infinite but would not confine their worship to temples built with human hands professing the universe was the temple of the deity esteeming any other inconsistent with his attributes  their whole law and religion were taught in verse  some druids spent twenty years in learning to repeat those sacred and scientific distichs which it was forbidden to commit to writing by which means they were withheld from the vulgar such was the aversion and enmity entertained by the romans against the druids that as suctonius says their rites were prohibited by augustus and totally abolished by claudius caesar  many probable conjectures have been made that the phoenicians when we speak of the phoenicians we must distinguish the times with accuracy these people possessed originally a large extent of countries comprised under the name of the land of canaan they lost the greatest part of it by the conquests of the israelites under joshua the lands which fell in division to the tribe of asher extended to sydon that city notwithstanding was not subdued if the conquests of joshua took from the phoenicians a great part of their dominion they were well paid by the consequences of that event in effect the greatest part of the ancient inhabitants of palestine seeing themselves threatened with entire destruction had recourse to flight to save themselves sidon offered them an asylum by this irruption of the hebrew people the sidonians were enabled to send colonies where ever they thought proper sidon lent them ships and made good use of these new inhabitants to extend their trade and form settlements from hence that great number of colonies which went then from phoenicia to spread themselves in all the country of africa and europe  we may date this event about the year of the world two thousand five hundred and fiftythree and one thousand four hundred and fiftyone years before christ  spain was not the only country beyond the pillars of hercules which the phoenicians penetrated being familiarized with the navigation of the ocean they extended themselves to the left of the straits of cadiz as far as the right  stabo assures that these people had gone over a part of the western coast of africa a little time after the war of troy  we might perhaps determine their passage into england by a reflection which the reading of the writers of antiquity furnishes us with they are persuaded that all the tin that was consumed in the known world came from the isles of cassitorides and there is no doubt that these isles were the sorlingues and a part of cornwall we see by the books of moses that in his time tin was known in palestine homer teaches us also that they made use of this metal in the heroic ages it should follow then that the phoenicians had traded in england in very remote antiquity  de goguer on the origin of arts and sciences   visited this land in very early ages  it has been attempted to be proved from the similarity of the habit worn and staff carried by the western britons  this staff was used by the druids and has the name of diogenes staff in a description given by mr seldom of some statues of druids which were dug up at wichtelberg in germany it is particularly mentioned  the phoenicians most probably introduced to those teachers the laws and customs known amongst the ancient hebrews and specified in the levitical institutions  the altars or temples of the druids and also their obelisks or monuments of memorable events of which many remains are to be seen at this day bear the greatest similarity to those mentioned in the old testament genesis xxviii    and jacob awaked out of his sleep and said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not  ver    and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven  ver    and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it  ver    and this stone which i have set up for a pillar shall be gods house  exodus xx    and if thou will make me an altar of stone thou shall not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou have polluted it  exodus xxiv   and moses wrote all the words of the lord and rose up early in the morning and builded an altar under the hill and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of israel  ver   and he sent young men of the children of israel which offered burntofferings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the lord  deuteronomy xxvii   and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over jordan unto the land which the lord thy god gives thee that thou shall set thee up great stones  ver   therefore it shall be when ye be gone over jordan that ye shall set up these stones which i command you this day in mount ebal  ver   and there thou shall build an altar unto the lord thy god an altar of stones thou shall not lift up any iron tool upon them  ver   thou shall build the altar of the lord thy god of whole stones and thou shall offer burntofferings thereon unto the lord thy god  it was usual to give those places the name of the house of the lord   chro xxii   this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burntoffering for israel  this is said of the altar erected by david where afterward the brazen altar stood in solomons temple  the oak diodorus siculus terms the gaulish priests  which betokens the oak  bryant in his analysis speaking of those who held the amonian rites says in respect to the names which this people in process of time conferred either upon the deities they worshipped or upon the cities which they founded we shall find them either made up of the names of those personages or else of the titles with which they were in process of time honored he proceeds to class those and reduce them to radicals as he terms them and inter alias gives the monofyllable  sar  under the word sar says he we are taught that as oaks were styled saronides so likewise were the ancient druids by whom the oak was held sacred  this is the title which was given to the priests of gaul as we are informed by diodorus siculus and as a proof how far the amonian religion was extended and how little we know of druidical worship either in respect to its essence or its origin bryants analysis of ancient mythology  maximus tyrius says the celts or gauls worshipped jupiter whose symbol or sign is the highest oak  the saxons called their sages  from the druids   was held sacred by the druids under whose branches they assembled and held their solemn rites  the oak and groves of oak were also held in great veneration by the hebrews and other ancient nations as appears by deuteronomy xii      judges vi       kings xviii       kings xxi       chronicles xv        deuteron vii   and xvi     exodus xxxiv     judges iii   deuteronomy xii     ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree and ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place judges vi    the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and he brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it   kings xviii    and the prophets of the groves four hundred   kings xxi   for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them ver   and he set a graven image of the grove which he had made etc   chronicles xv    he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove ver    but the high places were not taken away out of israel deuteronomy vii   ye shall all destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire cha xvi ver    thou shall not plant the grove of any trees near unto the altar of the lord thy god exodus xxxiv    but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves judges iii   and the children of israel etc served baalim and the groves isaiah i    they shall be ashamed of the oaks which they have desired  the french magi held the  or oak in great veneration plin not hist  the celtae revered the oak as a type or emblem of jupiter maximus tyrius   i have been thus particular on this subject as it encourages a conjecture that the druids gained their principles and maxims from the phoenicians as appears from those capital similarities before remarked in the plain of tormore in the isle of arran are the remains of four circles by the number of the circles and by their sequestered situation this seems to have been sacred ground these circles were formed for religious purposes boethius relates that mainus son of fergus i a restorer and cultivator of religion after the egyptian manner as he calls it instituted several new and solemn ceremonies and caused great stones to be placed in form of a circle the largest was situated toward the south and served as an altar for the sacrifices to the immortal gods boethius lib    pa    boethius is right in part of his account the object of the worship was the sun and what confirms this is the situation of the altar pointed toward that luminary in his meridian glory pennants voyage to the hebrides and thence it may be conceived they also received from them the doctrines of moses and the original principles of wisdom and truth as delivered down from the earliest ages  the oak hierogliphically represents strength virtue and constancy and sometimes longevity  under these symbolic characters it might be revered by the druids and the misletoe which they held in the utmost veneration has excellent medicinal qualities which in those days of ignorance might form the chief of their materia medica being a remedy for epilepsies and all nervous disorders to which the britons in those ages might be peculiarly subject from the woodiness of the country the noxious respiration proceeding from large forests the moisture of the air from extensive uncultivated lands and the maritime situation of this country  from all these religious institutions rites customs and ceremonies which bear in many degrees a striking similarity to those of this society we may naturally conjecture that the founders of our present maxims had in view the most ancient race of christians as well as the first professors of the worship of the god of nature our ancient record which i have mentioned brings us positive evidence of the pythagorian doctrine and basilidian principles making the foundation of our religious and moral rules  the following lectures will elucidate these assertions and will enable us i hope with no small degree of certainty to prove our original principles  lecture iv the nature of the lodge i now take upon me to prove my first proposition and to show that the first state of a mason is representative of the first stage of the worship of the true god  the lodge when revealed to an entering mason discovers to him a representation of the world the proportion of the measures of the tabernacle proved it to be an imitation of the system of the world for that third part thereof which was within the four pillars to which the priests were not admitted is as at were an heaven peculiar to god but the space of the twenty cubits is as it were sea and land on which men live and so this part is peculiar to the priests only  when moses distinguished the tabernacle into three parts and allowed two of them to the priests as a place accessible and common he denoted the land and the sea for these are accessible to all but when he set apart the third division for god it was because heaven is inaccessible to men and when he ordered twelve loaves to be set on the table he denoted the year as distinguished into so many months and when he made the candlestick of seventy parts he secretly intimated the decani or seventy divisions of the planets and as to the seven lamps upon the candlesticks they referred to the course of the planets of which that is the number and for the veils which were composed of four things they declared the four elements for the fine linen was proper to signify the earth because the flax grows out of the earth the purple signified the sea because that color is dyed by the blood of a sea shell fish the blue is fit to signify the air and the scarlet will naturally be an indication of fire now the vestment of the high priest being made of linen signified the earth the blue denoted the sky being like lightning in its pomegranates and in the noise of the bells resembling thunder and for the ephod it showed that god had made the universe of four elements and as for the gold interwoven i suppose it related to the splendor by which all things are enlightened he also appointed the breast plate to be placed in the middle of the ephod to resemble the earth and the girdle which encompassed the high priest round signified the ocean each of the sardonyxes declares to us the sun and the moon those i mean that were in the nature of buttons on the high priests shoulders and for the twelve stones whether we understand by them the months or whether we understand the like number of the signs of that circle which the greeks call the zodiac we shall not be mistaken in their meaning and for the mitre which was of a blue color it seems to me to mean heaven for how otherwise could the name of god be inscribed upon it that it was also illustrated with a crown and that of gold also is because of that splendor with which god is pleased  josephus antiq jud cha   in another place josephus says the candlestick was emblematical of the seven days of creation and rest  the tabernacle set up by the israelites in the desert may nevertheless give some ideas of the manner in which at that time the egyptian temples were constructed i believe really that there must have been some relation between the taste which reigned in these edifices and the tabernacle the tabernacle though only a vast tent had a great relation with architecture we ought to look upon it as a representation of the temples and palaces of the east let us recollect what we have said before of the form of government of the hebrews the supreme being was equally their god and king the tabernacle was erected with a view to answer to that double title the israelites went there sometimes to adore the almighty and sometimes to receive the orders of their sovereign present in a sensible manner in the presence of his people i think then we ought to look upon the tabernacle as a work which god would have that the structure should have relation with the edifices destined in the east whether for the worship of the gods or the habitation of kings the whole construction of the tabernacle presented moreover the model of an edifice regular and distributed with much skill all the dimensions and proportions appeared to have beeen observed with care and perfectly well adapted de goguet in which from the wonders of nature we are led to contemplate her great original and worship him for his mighty works and we are thereby also moved to exercise those moral and social virtues which become mankind as the servants of the great architect of the world in whose image we were formed in the beginning  the creator designing to bless mans estate on earth has opened the hand of his divine benevolence with good gifts  he has spread over the world the illumined canopy of heaven  the covering of the tabernacle and the veil of the temple at jerusalem were representations of the celestial hemisphere and were of blue of crimson and purple and such is the covering of the lodge   chronicles iii    and he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubims thereon see also josephus    as an emblem of gods power his goodness omnipresence and eternity the lodge is adorned with the image of the sun besides what is already noted touching the amonian rights and the worship of the sun the doctrine of the magians was the original intelligence who is the first principle of all things discovers himself to the mind and understanding only but he has placed the sun as his image in the visible universe and the beams of that bright luminary are but a faint copy of the glory that shines in the higher heavens it appears to the man studying nature that the sun is the most probable place in the universe for the throne of the deity from whence are diffused throughout creation light and heat a subtle essence inexhausting and selfsubsisting  conveying or in themselves being the operative spirits which conduct the works of god through all the field of nature  psalm civ   bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honor and majesty ver   who coverest thyself with light as with a garment ver   who makes the clouds his chariot who walks upon the wings of the wind ver   who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flaming fire   which he ordained to arise from the east and open the day thereby calling forth the people of the earth to their worship and exercise in the walks of virtue  the great author of all has given the moon to govern the night a fit season for solemn meditation  when the labors of the day are ended and mans mind is abstracted from the cares of life then it is for our souls recreation to walk forth with contemplative mind to read the great works of the almighty in the starry firmament and in the innumerable worlds which are governed by his will and thence to meditate on his omnipotence o majestic night natures great ancestor days elder born and fated to survive the transient sun by mortals and immortals seen with awe a starry crown thy raven brow adorns an azure zone thy waist clouds in heavens loom wrought through varieties of shape and shade in ample folds of drapery divine thy flowing mantle form and heaven throughout voluminously pour thy pompous train thy gloomy grandeurs natures most august inspiring aspect claim a grateful verse and like a fable curtain starrd with gold drawn over my labors past shall close the scene youngs night thoughts  our thoughts returning from this glorious scene toward ourselves we discern the diminutiveness of man and by a natural inference confess the benevolence of that god who regards us such minute atoms in the midst of his mighty works whose universal love is thus divinely expressed that not a sparrow shall fall without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered  when the world was under the hands of her great architect she remained dark and without form but the divine fiat was no sooner pronounced than behold there was light silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace said then the omnisic word your discord end nor stayed but on the wings of cherubim uplifted in paternal glory rode far into chaos and the world unborn for chaos heard his voice him all his train followed in bright procession to behold creation and the wonders of his might then stayed the servid wheels and in his hand he took the golden compasses prepared in gods eternal store to circumscribe this universe and all created things one foot he centered and the other turned round through the vast profundity obscure and said thus far extend thus far thy bounds this be thy just circumference o world let there be light said god and forthwith light ethereal first of things quintessence pure sprung from the deep and from her native east to journey through the aerie gloom began spherd in a radiant cloud for yet the sun was not she in a cloudy tabernacle sojourned the while  thus was the first day even and morn nor past uncelebrated nor unsung by the caelestial quires when orient light exhaling first from darkness they beheld birthday of heaven and earth with joy and shout the hollow universal orb they filled and touched their golden harps and hymning praised god and his works creator him they sung miltons par lost  creation was delivered from darkness and the sun shot forth instantaneous rays over the face of the earth  he gave that great constellation to the espousal of nature and vegetation sprang from the embrace the moon yielded her influence to the waters and attraction begat the tides  remembering the wonders in the beginning we claiming the auspicious countenance of heaven on our virtuous deeds assume the figures of the sun and moon as emblematical of the great light of truth discoverd to the first men and thereby implying that as true masons we stand redeemed from darkness and are become the sons of light acknowledging in our profession our adoration of him who gave light unto his works let us then by our practice and conduct in life show that we carry our emblems worthily and as the children of light that we have turned our backs on works of darkness obscenity and drunkenness hatred and malice satan and his dominions preferring charity benevolence justice temperance chastity and brotherly love as the acceptable service on which the great master of all from his beatitude looks down with approbation  the same divine hand pouring forth bounteous gifts which has blessed us with the sight of his glorious works in the heavens has also spread the earth with a beauteous carpet he has wrought it in various colors fruits and flowers pastures and meads golden furrows of corn and shady dells mountains skirted by nodding forests and valleys flowing with milk and honey  he has wrought it as it were in mosaic work giving a pleasing variety to the eye of man  he has poured upon us his gifts in abundance not only the necessaries of life but also wine to gladden the heart of man and oil to give him a cheerful countenance and that he might still add beauty to the scene of life wherein he has placed us his highlyfavoured creatures he has skirted and bordered the earth with the ocean  for the wise creator having made man in his own image not meaning in the likeness of his person but spiritually by breathing into his nostrils the breath of life and inspiring him with that resemblance of the divinity an intellectual spirit he skirted the land with the ocean not only for that salubrity which should be derived from its agitation but also that to the genius of man a communication should be opened to all the quarters of the earth and that by mutual intercourse men might unite in mutual good works and all become as members of one society these subjects are represented in the flooring of the lodge  the universe is the temple of the deity whom we serve  wisdom strength and beauty are about his throne as the pillars of his works for his wisdom is infinite his strength is in omnipotence and beauty stands forth through all his creation in symmetry and order  he has stretched forth the heavens as a canopy and the earth he has planted as his footstool  he crowns his temples with the stars as with a diadem and in his hand he extends the power and the glory  the sun and moon are messengers of his will and all his law is concord  the pillars supporting the lodge are representative of these divine powers  a lodge where perfect masons are assembled represents these works of the deity  we place the spiritual lodge in the vale of jehosophat implying thereby that the principles of masonry are derived from the knowledge of god and are established in the judgment of the lord the literal translation of the word jehosophat from the hebrew tongue being no other than those express words  the highest hills at length to beautify those holy hills the places of the idolatrous worship they beset them with trees and hence came the consecration of groves and woods from which their idols many times were named  at last some choice and select trees began to be consecrated those french magi termed dryadae worshipped the oak in greek termed  and thence had their names  the etrurians worshipped an holmtree  and amongst the celtae a tall oak was the idol or image of jupiter  among the israelites the idolatry began under the judges othniel and ehud judge iii   and at the last it became so common in israel that they had peculiar priests whom they termed prophets of the grove   kings xviii    and idols of the grove that is peculiar idols unto whom their groves were consecrated   kings xxi     chronicles xv     godwyns moses and aaron and lowest valleys were from the earliest times esteemed sacred and it was supposed the spirit of god was peculiarly diffusive in those places  ezekiel xliii    upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy  it is said in the old testament that the spirit of god buried moses in a valley in the land of moab implying that from divine influence he was interred in such hallowed retirement  on elijahs translation the sons of the prophets said to elisha behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master least peradventure the spirit of the lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley hence was derived the veneration paid to such places in the earliest ages and hence the sacred groves of the easterns and druids  they chose those situations for their public worship conceiving that the presence of the deity would hallow them they set up their altars there and shadowed them with groves that there as it was with adam they might hear the voice of the lord god walking in the garden  in the corruption and ignorance of after ages these hallowed places were polluted with idolatry the vulgar losing sight of the emblematical signification which was not readily understood but by poets and philosophers took up with the plain figures as real divinities stones erected as monuments of the dead became the place where posterity paid their venerations to the memory of the deceased  this increased into a peculiarity and at length became an object of worship lord kamess sketches of man   the unenlightened mind mistook the type for the original and could not discern the light from darkness  the sacred groves and hills became objects of enthusiastic bigotry and superstition  the devotees bowed down to the oaken log and the graven image of the sun as being divine  some preserved themselves from the corruptions of the times and we find those sages and select men to whom were committed and who retained the light of understanding and truth unpolluted with the sins of the world under the denomination of magi among the persians wisemen southsayers and astrologers among the caldeans philosophers among the greeks and romans bramins among the indians druids and bards among the britons and with the chosen people of god solomon shone forth in the fullness of human wisdom  the master of each lodge should found his government in concord and universal love for as the great architect moves the systems with his finger and touches the spheres with harmony so that the morning stars together sing the songs of gratitude and the floods clap their hands amidst the invariable beauties of order so should we rejoicing be of one accord and of one law in unanimity in charity and in affection moving by one unchanging system and actuated by one principle in rectitude of manners  a mason sitting the member of a lodge claiming these emblems as the testimonies of his order ought at that instant to transfer his thoughts to the august scene which is there initiated and remember that he then appears professing himself a member of the great temple of the universe to obey the laws of the mighty master of all in whose presence he seeks to be approved  the ancient record which i have before quoted expresses that the first masons received their knowledge from god by which means they are endowed with the due understanding of what is pleasing to him and the only true method of propagating their doctrines  the few who remained uncorrupted with the sins of nations and who served the only and true god despised the fables and follies of idolaters others who were emerging from the ignorance and blindness in which they had been overwhelmed contemplated on the wonders displayed in the face of nature and traced the divinity through the walks of his power and his mighty deeds  contemplation at first went forth admiring but yet without comprehension from whence all things had their existence contemplation returned glowing with conviction that one great original of infinite power of infinite intelligence and of benevolence without bounds was the master of all  they beheld him in his works they read his majesty in the heavens and discovered his miracles in the deep every plant that painted the face of nature and every thing having the breath of life described his presence and his power  such men were afterward made known to the enlightened and were united with them in the perfection of truth thus as our noble author says through a long maze of errors man arrived at true religion acknowledging but one being supreme in power intelligence and benevolence who created all other beings to whom all other beings are subjected and who directs every event to answer the best purposes lord kamess sketches of man   as the servants of one god our predecessors professed the temple wherein the deity approved to be served was not of the work of mens hands  in this the druids copied after them  the universe they confessed was filled with his presence and he was not hidden from the most distant quarters of creation they looked upwards to the heavens as his throne and wheresoever under the sun they worshipped they regarded themselves as being in the dewlling place of the divinity from whose eye nothing was concealed  the ancients not only refrained from building temples but held it utterly unlawful so to do because they thought no temple spacious enough for the sun the great symbol of the deity mundus universus est templum solis was their maxim they thought it profane to set limits to the infinity of the deity  when in later ages they built temples they left them open to the heavens and unroofed  the true believers in order to withdraw and distinguish themselves from the rest of mankind especially the idolaters with whom they were surrounded adopted emblems and mystic devices together with certain distinguishing principles whereby they should be known to each other and also certify that they were servants of that god in whose hands all creation existed by these means they also protected themselves from persecution and their faith from the ridicule of the incredulous vulgar  to this end when they rehearsed the principles of their profession they pronounced that they were worshipers in that temple whose bounds were from the distant quarters of the universe whose height was no otherwise limited than by the heavens and whose depth was founded on that axis on which the revolutions of the starry zodiac were performed  the egyptians were the first people known to us who in the early ages of the world after the flood advanced to any high degree of knowledge in astronomy arts and sciences  these were the means of discovering to them the existence of the divinity and they worshipped the author of those sublime works which they contemplated  but through national prejudices soon began to represent the attributes of the deity in symbols and as the visible operations of his omnipotence were chiefly expressed in the powers of the sun and moon whose influence they perceived through all the field of nature they depicted the deity by those heavenly bodies and at length under the names of osiris and isis adored the god of nature dr owen divides the whole of idolatrous worship into sabaism and hellenism the former consists in the worship of the sun moon and stars and the host of heaven which only is to my present purpose which it is probable a few ages after the flood had its beginning dr prideaux says the true religion which noah taught his posterity was that which abraham practiced the worshipping of one god the supreme governor of all things through a mediator men could not determine what essence contained this power of mediation no clear revelation being then made of the mediator whom god appointed because as yet he had not been manifested in the world they look upon them to address him by mediators of their own choosing and their notion of the sun moon and stars being that they were habitations of intelligencies which animated the orbs in the same manner as the soul animates the body of man and were causes of their motion and that these intelligencies were of a middle sort between god and them they thought these the properest things to be mediators between god and them and therefore the planets being the nearest of all the heavenly bodies and generally looked on to have the greatest influence on this world they made choice of them in the first place as their gods mediators who were to mediate with the supreme god for them and to procure from him mercies and favors which they prayed for herodotus says that osiris and isis were two great deities of the egyptians and almost the whole mythology of that ancient people is included in what their priests sabled of them plutarch conceives that by osiris the sun is to be understood and this macrobius confirms adding that osiris in the egyptian language signifies manyeyed and isis the ancient or the moon osiris according to banier is the same as misraim the son of cham who peopled egypt some time after the deluge and dr cumberland bishop of peterborough says misraim the son of cham grand child of noah was the first king of egypt and founder of their monarchy and that osiris was an appropriated title signifying the prince and isis is ishah his wife diodorus siculus who has transmitted down to us with great care the most ancient traditions of the egyptians asserts this prince is the same with menes the first king of egypt perhaps at his apotheosis his name was changed to that of isiris according to some historians as the images of osiris were very resplendent to represent the beams of light from the sun so in their hymns of praise they celebrate him as resting in the bosom of the sun  from the authority of banier and other historians we learn that the gods of the egyptians were adopted by the phoenicians that their theology was propagated by the phoenicians into the east and in the west and some traces of them are sound in almost every island of the mediterranean  in syria we find the same theology the sun under the name of adonis and the moon of ashtaroth the festival of adonis is mentioned in baruch chap vii  0    the priests of the city sat in their temples uncovered and shaven and mourning as at a feast for the dead  the prophet complains that solomon went after ashtaroth and after melcom the abomination of the ammonites  the chaldeans and babylonians paid adoration to fire and held the sabaism worship  the persians worshipped the sun and fire  st cyril writing on the pythagorian principles says we see plainly that pythagoras maintained that there was but one god the original and cause of all things who enlightens every thing animates every thing and from whom every thing proceeds who has given being to all things and is the source of all motion  pythagoras thus defines the divinity  god is neither the object of sense nor subject to passion but invisible purely intelligible and supremely intelligent in his body he is like the light and in his soul he resembles truth he is the universal spirit that pervades and diffuses itself over all nature all beings receive their life from him there is but one only god who is not as some are apt to imagine seated above the world beyond the orb of the universe but being all in himself he sees all the beings that inhabit his immensity he is the sole principle the light of heaven the father of all he produces every thing he orders and disposes every thing he is the reason the life and the motion of all beings  plutarch says osiris is neither the sun nor the water nor the earth nor the heaven but whatever there is in nature well disposed well regulated good and perfect all that is the image of osiris  seneca the stoie says it is of very little consequence by what name you call the first nature and the divine reason that presides over the universe and fills all the parts of it  he is still the same god he is called jupiter strator not as historians say because he stopped the flying armies of the romans but because he is the constant support of all beings  they call him fate because he is the first cause on which all others depend we stoies sometimes call him father bacchus because he is the universal life that animates nature  hercules because his power is invincible  mercury because he is the eternal reason order and wisdom you may give him as many names as you please provided you allow but one sole principle every where present     as we derived many of our mysteries and moral principles from the doctrines of pythagoras who had acquired his learning in egypt and others from the phoenicians who had received the egyptian theology in an early age it is not to be wondered that we should adopt egyptian symbols to represent or express the attributes of the divinity  the pythagorian system of philosophy also points out to us a reason for the figure of the sun being introduced into the lodge as being the center of the planetary system which he taught as well as the emblem of the deity which he served  this grand  was a symbol expressing the first and greatest principle of his doctrines  this was also a representation of the abrax which governed the stellary world and our diurnal revolutions  in the books of hermes irismegistus who was an egyptian and said to be contemporary with abrahams grandfather is this remarkable passage speaking of the deity he says but if thou will see him consider and understand the sun consider the course of the moon consider the order of the stars  oh thou unspeakable unutterable to be praised with silence  from hence we are naturally led to perceive the origin of the egyptian symbolization and the reason for their adopting those objects as expressive of the might majesty and omnipresence of the deity the learned dr stukeley speaking of stonehenge says he took his dimensions of this monument by the hebrew phoenician or egyptian cubit being twenty inches and threefourths of an inch english measure he dates this erection from the time of cambyses invasion of egypt before the time of building the second temple at jerusalem at an era when the phoenician trade was at its height and he presumes that when the priests fled from egypt under the cruelties committed by that invader they dispersed themselves to distant parts of the world and introduced their learning arts and religion among the druids in britain     posterity to record the wise doctrines and religious principles of the first professors of the true worship have adopted these descriptions of the lodge in which they assemble and maintain those religious tenets which nature dictates gratitude to him under whom we exist and working in the acceptable service of him who rejoiceth in the upright man  as such it is to be a free mason  as such is a lodge of masons  as such are the principles of this society  as these were the original institutions of our brotherhood let the ignorant laugh on and the wicked ones scoff  and that these are true solutions of our emblems i am convinced myself and with humble deference to the rest of my brethren offer them for their attention  lecture v the furniture of the lodge it is with pleasure i pursue the duty i have imposed upon myself to give solutions of the mysteries in masonry which to minds inattentive to the real import of the objects in their view might remain undiscovered and the professor of masonry might pass on without receiving a just sense of those dignities which he has assumed  i have defined what is intended to be represented by a lodge and its origin and nature it is now my duty to discover to you the import of the furniture of a lodge  as solomon at jerusalem carried into the jewish temple all the vessels and instruments requisite for the service of jehovah according to the law of his people so we masons as workers in moral duties and as servants of the great architect of the world have placed in our view those emblems which should constantly remind us of what we are and what is required of us  the third emanation of abrax in the gnostic hierarchy was phronaesis the emblem of prudence which is the first and most exalted object that demands our attention in the lodge  it is placed in the center ever to be present to the eye of the mason that his heart may be attentive to her dictates and steadfast in her laws  for prudence is the rule of all virtues  prudence is the path which leads to every degree of propriety  prudence is the channel where selfapprobation slows for ever  she leads us forth to worthy actions and as a blazing star enlightneth us through the dreary and darksome paths of this life  virtue by moralists is defined to be that steadfast purpose and firm will of doing those things which nature has dictated to us as the best and most salutary  a habit of the soul by which mankind are inclined to do the things which are upright and good and to avoid those that are evil  in short virtue is moral honesty and good principles  of the virtues of which prudence is the rule three are called cardinal virtues of which most properly a mason should be possessed  fortitude temperance and justice for without these the name of mason is an empty title and but a painted bubble  that fortitude must be the characteristic of a mason i need not argue by which in the midst of pressing evils he is enabled always to do that which is agreeable to the dictates of right reason  temperance also must be one of his principles being a moderating or restraining of our affections and passions especially in sobriety and chastity  we regard temperance under the various definitions of moralists as constituting honesty decency and bashfulness and in its potential parts instituting meekness clemency and modesty  we profess justice as dictating to us to do right to all and to yield to every man what belongs to him  the cardinal virtues prudence fortitude temperance and justice hold in their train the inferior powers of peace concord quietness liberty safety honor felicity piety and charity with many others which were adored by the ancients in those ages when they confounded mythology with the worship of the divinity  within the starry girdle of prudence all the virtues are enfolded  we may apply this emblem to a still more religious import  it may be said to represent the star which led the wise men to bethlehem proclaiming to mankind the nativity of the son of god and here conducting our spiritual progress to the author of redemption  as the steps of man are trod in the various and uncertain incidents of life as our days are chequered with a strange contrariety of events and our passage through this existence though sometimes attended with prosperous circumstances is often beset by a multitude of evils hence is the lodge furnished with mosaic work to remind us of the precariousness of our state on earth  today our feet tread in prosperity tomorrow we totter on the uneven paths of weakness temptation and adversity  whilst this emblem is before us we are instructed to boast of nothing  to have compassion and give aid to those who are in adversity  to walk uprightly and with humility  for such is this existence that there is no station in which pride can be stably founded  all men in birth and in the grave are on the level  whilst we tread on this mosaic work let our ideas return to the original which it copies and let every mason act as the dictates of reason prompt him to live in brotherly love  as more immediate guides for a free mason the lodge is furnished with unerring rules whereby he shall form his conduct  the book of his law is laid before him that he may not say through ignorance he erred  whatever the great architect of the world has dictated to mankind as the mode in which he would be served and the path in which he is to tread to obtain his approbation  whatever precepts he has administered and with whatever laws he has inspired the sages of old the same are faithfully comprised in the book of the law of masonry that book which is never closed in any lodge reveals the duties which the great master of all exacts from us  open to every eye comprehensible to every mind then who shall say among us that he knows not the acceptable service  but as the frailty of human nature wageth war with truth and mans infirmities struggle with his virtues to aid the conduct of every mason the master holds the compass limiting the distance progress and circumference of the work he dictateth the manners he gives the direction of the design and delineateth each portion and part of the labor assigning to each his province and his order and such is his mastership that each part when asunder seems irregular and without form yet when put together like the building of the temple at jerusalem is connected and framed in true symmetry beauty and order  the moral implication of which is that the master in his lodge fits dictating those salutary laws for the regulation thereof as his prudence directs assigning to each brother his proper province limiting the rashness of some and circumscribing the imprudence of others restraining all licentiousness and drunkenness discord and malice envy and reproach and promoting brotherly love morality charity benevolence cordiality and innocent mirth that the assembly of the brethren may be with order harmony and love  to try the works of every mason the square is presented as the probation of his life  proving whether his manners are regular and uniform  for masons should be of one principle and one rank without the distinctions of pride and pageantry intimating that from high to low the minds of masons should be inclined to good works above which no man stands exalted by his fortune  but superior to all the lodge is furnished with three luminaries the particular attention paid by the ancients to the element of fire is in no wise to be wondered at when we consider that when ever the deity deigned to reveal himself to the human senes it was under this element  exodus iii   and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed ver   god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses chap xiii    and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night chap xix    there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount ver    and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire chap xviv    and the sight of the glory of the lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel chap xxix    and there i will meet with the children of israel and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory numb ix    that thou go before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night deuteronomy v   the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ver   for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount ver    these words the lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire ver    for the mountain did burn with fire ver    and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire ver    for who is there of all flesh that has heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and lived to these may be added the shachina in the temple  it would from a kind of parity in circumstances naturally follow that men would look up to the sun as the throne of the divinity from whence his ministering spirits dispensed his will to the distant quarters of the universe  fire became the general emblem of the divinity in the eastern nations  was in great esteem with the chaldeans and persians the persians used consecrated fire as the emblem of the supreme being to whom they would not build temples or confine the divinity to space the etherial fire was preserved in the temple of the jews and in the tabernacle with great reverence the druid priests in their worship looked toward the sun  they retained many of the ammonian rites  they are said to have made mystical processions round their consecrated fires sunwise before they proceeded to sacrifice    as the golden candlestick in the tabernacle of moses was at once emblematical of the spirit of god whereby his chosen people were enlightened and prophetical of the churches or otherwise as josephus says representative of the planets and the powerful works of god so our three lights show to us the three great stages of masonry the knowledge and worship of the god of nature in the purity of eden  the service under the mosaic law when divested of idolatry  and the christian revelation or otherwise our lights are typical of the holy trinity  such is the furnitures of the lodge such are the principles dictated to us as masons let us rejoice in the exercise of those excellencies which should set us above the rank of other men and prove that we are brought out of darkness into light  and let us show our good works unto the world that through our light so shining unto men they may glorify the great master of the universe and therefore do justice  love mercy  and walk humbly with their god  mus brit tab    wm hutchinson del         lecture vi the apparel and jewels of masons masons as one of their first principles profess innocence  they put on white apparel as an emblem of that character which bespeaks purity of soul guiltlessness and being harmless  we have the following passage in the biographia ecclesiastica  the ancients were also wont to put a white garment on the person baptized to denote his having put off the lusts of the flesh and his being cleansed from his former sins and that he had obliged himself to maintain a life of unspotted innocence  accordingly the baptized are both by the apostle and the greek fathers frequently styled  the enlightened because they professed to be the children of light and engaged themselves never to return again to the works of darkness isaiah ix   the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them has the light shined   this white garment used to be delivered to them with this solemn charge receive the white and undefiled garment and produce it without spot before the tribunal of our lord jesus christ that you may obtain eternal life amen  they were wont to wear these white garments for the space of a week after they were baptized and then put them off and laid them up in the church that they might be kept as a witness against them if they should violate the baptismal covenant  whilst the apron with which we are clothed indicates a disposition of innocence and belies not the wearers heart let the ignorant deride and scoff on superior to the ridicule and malice of the wicked we will enfold ourselves in the garb of our own virtue and safe in selfapproving conscience stand unmoved amidst the persecutions of adversity  the raiment which truly implies the innocence of the heart is a badge more honorable than ever was devised by kings  the roman eagle with all the orders of knighthood are inferior  they may be prostituted by the caprice of princes but innocence is innate and cannot be adopted  to be a true mason is to possess this principle or the apparel which he wears is an infamy to the apostate and only shows him forth to shame and contempt  that innocence should be the professed principle of a mason occasions no astonishment when we consider that the discovery of the deity leads us to the knowledge of those maxims wherewith he may be well pleased  the very idea of a god is succeeded with the belief that he can approve of nothing that is evil and when first our predecessors professed themselves servants of the architect of the world as an indispensible duty they professed innocence and put on white raiment as a type and characteristic of their conviction and of their being devoted to his will  the druids were apparelled in white at the time of their sacrifices and solemn offices  the egyptian priests of osiris wore snowwhite cotton  we do not find that the priests of other nations noted for antiquity were singular in this except that in the service of ceres under whom was symbolized the gift of providence in the fruits of the earth  the grecian priests put on white  every degree of sin strikes the rational mind of man with some feelings of selfcondemnation  under such conviction who could call upon or claim the presence of a divinity whose demonstration is good works  hence are men naturally led to conceive that such divinity will only accept of works of righteousness  standing forth for the approbation of heaven the servants of the first revealed god bound themselves to maxims of purity and virtue  and as masons we regard the principles of those who were the first worshippers of the true god imitate their apparel and assume the badge of innocence  our jewels or ornaments imply that we try our affections by justice and our actions by truth as the square tries the workmankship of the mechanic  that we regard our mortal state whether it is dignified by titles or not whether it be opulent or indigent as being of one nature in the beginning and of one rank in its close in sensations passions and pleasures in infirmities maladies and wants all mankind are on a parallel  nature has given us no superiorities  it is wisdom and virtue that constitute superiority  from such maxims we make estimates of our brother when his calamities call for our council or our aid  the works of charity are from sympathetic feelings and benevolence acts upon the level  the emblem of these sentiments is another of the jewels of our society  to walk uprightly before heaven and before men neither inclining to the right or to the left is the duty of a mason  neither becoming an enthusiast or a persecutor in religion nor bending toward innovation or infidelity  in civil government firm in our allegiance yet steadfast in our laws liberties and constitution  in private life yielding up every selfish propensity inclining neither to avarice or injustice to malice or revenge to envy or contempt with mankind but as the builder raises his column by the plane and perpendicular so should the mason carry himself toward the world  to rule our affections by justice and our actions by truth is to wear a jewel which would ornament the bosom of the highest potentate on earth  human nature has her impulses from desires which are often too inordinate  love blinds with prejudices and resentment burns with fevers  contempt renders us incredulous and covetousness deprives us of every generous or humane feeling  to steer the bark of life upon the seas of passions without quitting the course of rectitude is one of the highest excellencies to which human nature can be brought aided with all the powers of philosophy and religion  yet merely to act with justice and truth is not all that man should attempt for even that excellence would be selfishness  that duty is not relative but merely proper  it is only touching our own character and doing nothing for our neighbor for justice is an indispensible duty in each individual  we were not born for ourselves alone only to shape our course through life in the tracks of tranquillity and solely to study that which should afford peace to the conscience at home  but men were made as mutual aids to each other  no one among us be he ever so opulent can subsist without the assistance of his fellow creatures natures wants are numerous and our hands are filled with very little of the warfare of necessity  our nakedness must be clothed our hunger satisfied our maladies visited  where shall the proud man toil for sustenance if he stands unaided by his neighbor  when we look through the varied scene of life we see our fellow creatures attacked with innumerable calamities and were we without compassion we should exist without one of the finest feelings of the human heart  to love and to approve are movements in the soul of man which yield him pleasure but to pity gives him heavenly sensations and to relieve is divine  charity thus has her existence  her rise is from the consciousness of our similarity in nature the level on which mortality was created in the beginning  its progress is in sympathetic feelings from the affections of the heart breathing love toward our brother coupled with the touch of original estimation in our minds which proves all our species to be brethren of one existence  its conclusion is from comparison producing judgment we weigh the necessities of our suffering fellow creatures by our natural equality by compassion our sympathy and our own abilities and dispense our gifts from affection  pity and pain are sisters by sympathy  to be an upright man is to add still greater luster to the masons character  to do justice and to have charity are excellent steps in human life but to act uprightly gives a superlative degree of excellence  for in that station we shall become examples in religious in civil and in moral conduct it is not enough that we are neither enthusiasts nor persecutors in religion neither bending toward innovation or infidelity not to be in the passive only but we should appear in the active character we should be zealous practisers observers of and steadfast members in religious duties  in civil matters we should not only submit to but execute the laws of our country obey all their ordinances and perform all their precepts be faithful to the constitution of the realm and loyal to our king true soldiers in the defense of our liberty and of his crown and dignity  in morality it requires of us not only that we should not err by injuring betraying or deceiving but that we should do good in every capacity in that station of life wherein kind providence has placed us  by such meets let the mason be proved and testify that his emblematical jewels are ensigns only of the inward man thence he will stand approved before heaven and before men purchasing honor to his profession and felicity to the professor  lecture vii the temple at jerusalem the first worshipers of the god of nature in the nations of the east represented the deity by the figures of the sun and moon from the influence of those heavenly bodies on the earth professing that the universe was the temple in which the divinity was at all times and in all places present  they adopted these with other symbols as a cautious mode of preserving or explaining divine knowledge  but we perceive the danger arising from thence to religion for the eye of the ignorant the bigot and enthusiast cast up toward these objects without the light of understanding introduced the worship of images and at length the idols of osiris and isis became the gods of the egyptians without conveying to their devotees the least idea of their great archetype other nations who had expressed the attributes of the deity by outward objects or who had introduced pictures into the sacred places as ornaments or rather to assist the memory claim devout attention and warm the affections ran into the same error and idols multiplied upon the face of the earth  amongst the ancients the worshipers of idols throughout the world had at last entirely lost the remembrance of the original of whose attributes their images were at first merely symbols and the second darkness in religion was more tremendous than the first as it was strengthened by prepossession custom bigotry and superstition  moses had acquired the knowledge of the egyptians and derived the doctrines of truth from the righteous ones of the nations of the east he being also touched by divine influence and thence truly comprehending the light from out the darkness taught the people of israel the worship of the true god without the enigmas and pollutions of the idolatrous nations which surrounded them  this was the second era of the worship of the god of nature  and at this period the second stage of masonry arises  the ruler of the jews perceiving how prone the minds of ignorant men were to be led aside by show and ceremony and that the eye being caught by pomp and solemn rites perverted the opinion and led the heart astray and being convinced that the magnificent festivals processions sacrifices and ceremonials of the idolatrous nations impressed the minds of mankind with a wild degree of reverence and enthusiastic devotion thought it expedient for the service of the god of israel to institute holy offices though in an humbler and less oftentatious mode well judging that the service and adoration of the deity which was only clothed in simplicity of manners and humble prayer must be established in the judgment and conviction of the heart of man with which ignorance was ever waging war  in succeeding ages solomon built a temple for the service of god and ordained its rights and ceremonies to be performed with a splendor equal to the most extravagant pomp of the idolaters  as this temple ezekiel xliv   the east gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the lord the god of israel has entered in by it therefore it shall be shut ver   it is for the prince the prince shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord ver   then brought he me by the way of the north gate before the house received the second race of the servants of the true god and as the true craftsmen were here proved in their work i will crave your attention to the circumstances which are to be gathered from holy writ and from historians touching this structure as an illustration of those secrets in masonry which may appear to my brethren dark or insignificant unless they are proved from thence  in the first book of kings we are told that hiram king of tire sent his servants unto solomon and solomon sent to hiram saying behold i intend to build an house unto the name of the lord my god  and solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men  and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses  a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the levy  and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains  besides the chief of solomons officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people which wrought in the work  and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house  and solomons builders and hirams builders did hew them and the stonesquarers or gibilites  in the fourth year was the foundation of the house laid and in the eleventh year was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it  and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tire he was a widows son of the tribe of napthali and his father was a man of tire a worker in brass  he cast two pillars of brass with two chapiters which were of lilywork and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple  and he set up the right pillar and he called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called it boaz  in the second book of chronicles we read that he set three hundred and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountains and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work  and solomon sent to hiram king of tire to send him a man cunning to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in purple in crimson and in blue and skilful in engravings  and hiram sent unto him a cunning man endowed with the understanding of hiram his father  and he made the veil of the temple of blue purple crimson and fine linen  and he made before the house two pillars and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and that on the left boaz the raising pillars and obelisks was a custom of the eastern nations and of egypt in particular the use of which we are told was to record the extent of dominion and the tributes of nations subject to the egyptian empire etc or in commemoration of memorable events  diodorus tells us that sosostris signalized his reign by the erection of two obelisks which were cut with a design to acquaint postertity of the extent of his power and the number of nations he had conquered augustus according to the report of pliny transported one of these obelisks to rome and placed it in the campus martius pliny says the egyptians were the first devisers of such monuments and that mestres king of heliopolis erected the first marsham and others attribute the invention to jesostris the obelisk of shannesses exceeded all that had preceded it constantine and constans his son caused it to be moved to rome where it remains the noblest piece of egyptian antiquity existing in the world solomon had pursued this custom in erecting his pillars in the porch of the temple which he designed should be a memorial to the jews as they entered the holy place to warm their minds with confidence and faith by this record of the promises made by the lord unto his father david and which were repeated unto him in a vision in which the voice of god proclaimed   kings ix   i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever   when this splendid structure was finished solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven and in the earth  o lord my god hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prays before thee  o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed  in the conduct of this great work we must admire the sagacity of this pious architect  he discerned the necessity there was to assign to portions of his people the particular labor they were to pursue he gave them particular signs and secret tokens these were meant for the better conduct of the work and were totally abstracted from those other principles which were the foundation of our profession  they were manual proofs of the part each was stationed to perform  the light which had possessed the soul and which was the first principle was in no wise to be distinguished by such signs and tokens or revealed expressed or communicated thereby   by which each rank should be distinguished in order that the whole might proceed with propriety and without confusion  he selected those of most enlightened minds and comprehensive understandings religious men piously zealous in good works as masters to superintend the workmen men skilful in geometry and proportions who had been initiated and proved in the mystical learning of the ancient sages those he made overseers of the work  the whole was conducted with that degree of holy reverence that even the noise of a tool or instrument was not permitted to disturb the sacred silence on moriali sanctified by the presence of the almighty and by his miraculous works  was it not reasonable then to conceive under this exalted degree of pious attention that no part of this structure was to be formed but by men of pure hands and holy minds who had professed themselves devoted to the service of the true god and had enrolled themselves under the banner of true religion and virtue  as the sons of aaron alone were admitted to the holy offices and to the sacrificial rites so none but devotees were admitted to this labor  on this stage we see those religious who had received the truth and the light of understanding as possessed by the first men embodied as artificers and engaged in this holy work as architects  this together with the construction of the tabernacle under moses are the first instances of our predecessors being exhibited to the world as builders for although it is not to be doubted the sages amongst the hebrews egyptians persians chaldeans greeks romans bramins druids and bards understood geometry and the rules of proportion and numbers yet we have no evidence of their being the actual executors of any plan in architecture and yet without question they were the projectors and superintendants of such works in every age and nation  without such regulations as solomon had devised for the government of his servants without such artificers and a superior wisdom overruling the whole we should be at a loss to account for the beginning carrying on and finishing that great work in the space of seven years and six months when the two succeeding temples though much inferior employed so much more time and when we have good authority to believe that the temple of diana at ephesus a structure not comparable to the temple at jerusalem was two hundred and twenty years in building  the building being conducted by a set of religious makes it natural to conceive that from devotion and pious fervor as well as emulation those employed had unceasing motives to prompt their diligence and preserve harmony and order as their labor was probationary and led to an advancement to superior privileges higher points of knowledge and at the last to that honorable preeminence of a master of the holy work  solomon himself was an extraordinary personage and his wisdom and magnificence had gained him the wonder and attention of the neighboring nations  but this splendid structure the wonder of the earth thus raised by the pious hands of men laboring in the worship and service of the god of israel would of consequence extend his fame and attract the admiration of the more distant parts of the world  his name and his artificers would become the wonder of mankind and his works their example and emulation  from thence the masons of solomon would be dispersed into different states to superintend the works of other princes and there would convert insidels initiate brethren in their mysteries and extend their order over the distant quarters of the known world  we find that the like distinction was retained on rebuilding the temple in the reign of cyrus and that the work was performed by the religious of the israelites and not by ordinary mechanics for they refused to admit the samaritans to a share of the work although they petitioned it under the denomination of servants of the same god  but they were rejected as unworthy of the works of piety and unacceptable to the god of israel for though they professed themselves to be servants of the true god they polluted their worship by idols  josephus in his history of the antiquities of the jews speaking of solomons going about to erect the temple at jerusalem gives copies of the epistles which passed between solomon and hiram of tire on that matter and which he says remained in his days preserved in their books and amongst the tyrians also eusebius preparat evanget ix      has these letters though greatly disguised by eupolemeus from whom eusebius had his copies  which epistles are as follow  solomon to king hiram know thou that my father would have built a temple to god but was hindered by wars and continual expeditions for he did not leave off to overthrow his enemies till he made them all subject to tribute  but i give thanks to god for the peace i at present enjoy and on that account i am at leisure and design to build an house to god for god foretold to my father that such an house should be built by me  wherefore i desire thee to send some of thy subjects with mine to mount lebanon to cut down timber for the sidonians are more skilful than our people in cutting of wood  as for wages for the hewers of wood i will pay whatsoever price thou shall determine   hiram to king solomon there is reason to bless god that he has committed thy fathers government to thee who art a wise man and endowed with all virtues  as for myself i rejoice at the condition thou art in and will be subservient to thee in all thou requirest  for when by my servants i have cut down many and large trees of cedar and cypress wood i will send them to sea and will order my subjects to make floats of them and to sail to what place soever of thy country thou shall desire and leave them there after which thy servants may carry them to jerusalem but do thou take care to procure corn for this timber which we stand in need of because we inhabit an island   josephus speaking of the progress of the building says solomon sent for an artificer out of tire whose name was hiram by birth of the tribe of naphthali on the mothers side  this man was skilful in all sorts of works but his chief skill lay in working in gold in silver and brass the one of the pillars which he set at the entrance of the porch at the right hand he called jachin and the other at the left hand he called boaz  solomon was wise in all the learning of the ancients he was possessed of all the mystical knowledge of the eastern nations and to perfect the same was enlightened by the immediate gift of heaven  it was also the mode and manners of the times in which the temple of jerusalem was erected to use emblematical and symbolic ornaments in the public edifices a fashion derived from the hieroglyphic monuments of the egyptians and the mysterious mode in which their sages concealed their wisdom and learning from the vulgar eye and communicated science to those of their own order only  the pillars erected at the porch of the temple were not only ornamental but also carried with them an emblematical import in their names boaz being in its literal translation in thee is strength and jachin it shall be established which by a very natural transposition may be put thus o lord thou art mighty and thy power is established from everlasting to everlasting  or otherwise they might imply as boaz was the father of david the house of david shall be established for ever i am justified in this latter application by the express words of nathan the prophet unto david inspired by the vision of the lord    samuel vii    and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shall sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom  ver     he shall build an house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever ver    and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever in commemoration of this great promise to the faithful we ornament the entrance into our lodges with these emblematical pillars from our knowledge of the completion of that sacred sentence accomplished in the coming of our redeemer  lecture viii on geometry it is now incumbent upon me to demonstrate to you the great signification of the letter g wherewith lodges and the medals of masons are ornamented  to apply its signification to the name of god only is depriving it of part of its masonic import although i have already shown that the symbols used in lodges are expressive of the divinitys being the great object of masonry as architect of the world  this significant letter denotes geometry which to artificers is the science by which all their labors are calculated and formed and to masons contains the determination definition and proof of the order beauty and wonderful wisdom of the power of god in his creation  geometry is said originally to have signified nothing more than the art of measuring the earth or any distances or dimensions within it but at present it denotes the science of magnitude in general comprehending the doctrine and relations of whatsoever is susceptible of augmentation or diminution so to geometry may be referred the construction not only of lines superficies and solids but also of time velocity numbers weight and many other matters  this is a science which is said to have its rise or at least its present rules from the egyptians who by nature were under a necessity of using it to remedy the confusion which generally happened in their lands by the overflowing of the nile which carried away yearly all boundaries and effaced all limits of their possessions thus this science which consisted only in its first steps of the means of measuring lands that every person might have his property restored to him was called geometry or the art of measuring land and it is probable that the draughts and schemes the egyptians were annually compelled to make helped them to discover many excellent properties of those figures and which speculation continually occasioned to be improved  from egypt geometry passed into greece where it continued to receive new improvements in the hands of thales pythagoras archimedes euclid and others the elements of geometry which were written by euclid testify to us the great perfection to which this science was brought by the ancients though much inferior to modern geometry the bounds of which by the invention of fluxions and the discovery of an infinite order of curves are greatly enlarged  the usefulness of geometry extends to almost every art and science  by the help of it astronomers turn their observations to advantage regulate the duration of times seasons years cycles and epochas and measure the distance motions and magnitude of the heavenly bodies  it is by this science that geographers determine the figure and magnitude of the whole earth and delineate the extent and bearings of kingdoms provinces oceans harbors and every place upon the globe  it is adapted to artificers in every branch and from thence as i said before architects derive their measures justnesses and proportions  this naturally leads me to conjecture why the square is had by masons as one of the lights of masonry and part of the furniture of the lodge to explain my ideas on that matter i will only repeat to you the words of a celebrated author treating of the rise and progress of sciences  he says we find nothing in ancient authors to direct us to the exact order in which the fundamental principles of measuring surfaces were discovered they probably began with those surfaces which terminated by right lines and amongst these with the most simple  it is hard indeed to determine which of those surfaces which are terminated by a small number of right lines are the most simple  if we were to judge by the number of sides the triangle has indisputably the advantage  yet i am inclined to think that the square was the figure which first engaged the attention of geometricians  it was not till some time after this that they began to examine equilateral triangles which are the most regular of all triangular figures  it is to be presumed that they understood that rectilinear figure first to which they afterward compared the areas of other polygons as they discovered them  it was by that means the square became the common measure of all surfaces  for of all ages and amongst all nations of which we have any knowledge the square has always been that in planimetry which the unit is in arithmetic  for though in measuring rectilinear figures we are obliged to resolve them into triangles yet the areas of these figures are always given in the square  thence i am led to determine that the square was the first and original figure in geometry and as such was introduced to our lodges  the square was the figure under which the israelites formed their encampments in the wilderness and under which they fortified or defended the holy tabernacle sanctified with the immediate presence of the divinity  as i before declared it to be my opinion that this society was never formed for or of a set of working architects or masons but as a religious social and charitable establishment and never were embodied or exhibited to the world as builders save only under moses and at the temple at jerusalem where with holy hands they executed those works of piety as the patriarchs erected altars to the honor of the divinity for their sacrifices and religious offices genesis iv     viii  0 xxii   xxviii    xxxiii  0 xxxi    exodus xx    xxvii   xxx    joshua xxii  0        so i am persuaded that the adoption of geometry by masons or any emblem of that science implies no more than a reverence for such device of the mind of man as should demonstrate the wisdom of the almighty in his works whereby the powers of abrax are defined and the system of the starry revolutions in the heavens determined  if we should look upon the earth with its produce the ocean with its tides the coming and passing of day the starry arch of heaven the seasons and their changes the life and death of man as being merely accidents in the hand of nature we must shut up all the powers of judgment and yield ourselves to the darkest folly and ignorance  the august scene of the planetary system the day and night the seasons in their successions the animal frame the vegetation of plants all afford us subject for astonishment the greater too mighty but for the hand of a deity whose works they are  the least too miraculous but for the wisdom of their god  then how much ought we to esteem that science through whose powers it is given to man to discover the order of the heavenly bodies their revolutions and their stations thereby resolving the operations of the deity to an unerring system proving the mightiness of his works and the wisdom of his decrees  it is no wonder then that the first institutors of this society who had their eye on the revelation of the deity from the earliest ages of the world unto the days of its perfection under the ministry of the son of god that they should hold that science hallowed amongst them whereby such lights were obtained by man in the discovery of the great wisdom of the creator in the beginning  lecture ix the master masons order as i at first proposed to investigate the three progressive orders of masons apprentices craftsmen and masters by a definition and description of the several circumstances which attended the worshipers of the true god  so have i in the former lectures shown that by order in the apprentices is implied the first knowledge of the god of nature in the earliest ages of man  under the craftsmen i have shown the mosaic legation and the jewish temple at jerusalem together with the light which men received for the discovery of the divine wisdom by geometrical solutions  i now proceed to the third stage the most sacred and solemn order of masons the master masons order  under the jewish law the service of god became clouded and obscured by ceremonies and rites which had daily crept in upon it through imitation of the neighboring heathen  when the morals of the jewish nation were corrupted civil jurisdiction reeled upon its throne  innovations sapped the religious rule and anarchy succeeded  no sooner was this compact loosened than the strength of the jews was dissolved and the heathen triumphed in jerusalem  the gracious divinity perceiving the ruin which was overwhelming mankind in his benevolence was moved to redeem us  he saw that the revelation which he had deigned to make of his divinity might majesty and wisdom to the jewish tribes was not sufficient to preserve them in their duty he weighed the frailty of mankind in the balance which his justice suspended and to their deficiencies he bestowed his mercy  the egyptians had abused their learning and wisdom  the jews had polluted gods ordinances and laws  and sin had made her dominion in the strong places of the earth  piety which had planned the temple at jerusalem was expunged  the reverence and adoration due to the divinity was buried in the filth and rubbish of the world  persecution had dispersed the few who retained their obedience and the name of the true god was almost totally lost and forgotten among men  religion sat mourning in israel in sackcloth and ashes and morality was scattered as it were by the four winds of the air  in this situation it might well be said that the guide to heaven was lost and the master of the works of righteousness was smitten  the nations had given themselves up to the grossest idolatry solomon had fallen and the service of the true god was effaced from the memory of those who had yielded themselves to the dominion of sin  in order that mankind might be preserved from this deplorable estate of darkness and destruction and as the old law was dead and become rotteness a new doctrine and new precepts were wanting to give the key to salvation in the language of which we might touch the ear of an offended deity and bring forth hope for eternity true religion was fled  those who sought her through the wisdom of the ancients were not able to raise her she eluded the grasp and their polluted hands were stretched forth in vain for her restoration  those who sought her by the old law were frustrated for death had stepped between and corruption defiled the embrace sin had beset her steps and the vices of the world had overwhelmed her  the great father of all commiserating the miseries of the world sent his only son who was innocence itself to teach the doctrine of salvation  by whom man was raised from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness  from the tomb of corruption unto the chambers of hope  from the darkness of despair to the celestial beams of faith  and not only working for us this redemption but making with us the covenant of regeneration whence we are become the children of the divinity and inheritors of the realms of heaven  we masons describing the deplorable estate of religion under the jewish law speak in figures  her tomb was in the rubbish and filth cast forth of the temple and acacia wove its branches over her monument  being the greek word for innocence or being free from sin implying that the sins and corruptions of the old law and devotees of the jewish altar had hid religion from those who sought her and she was only to be found where innocence survived and under the banner of the divine lamb  and as to ourselves professing that we were to be distinguished by our acacy or as true acacians in our religious faith and tenets acacia  akakia in antiquity a roll or bag represented on the medals of the greek and roman emperors some think it is only an handkerchief which they used as a signal others take it for a volume or roll of memorandums or petitions and others will have it to be a purple bag filled with earth to remind the prince of his mortality acacians acaciani in church history the name of a sect of religious and professed christians some of whom maintained that the son was only of a like not the same substance with the father and others that he was not only of a distinct but also of a dissimilar substance  acacy in johnsons dictionary  gr innocence or being free from sin     the acquisition of the doctrine of redemption is expressed in the typical character of huramen  inveni and by the applications of that name with masons it is implied that we have discovered the knowledge of god and of his salvation and have been redeemed from the death of sin and the sepulcher of pollution and unrighteousness the mason advancing to this state of masonry pronounces his own sentence as confessional of the imperfection of the second stage of his profession and as probationary of the exalted degree to which he aspires in this greek distich  struo tumulum i prepare my sepulcher i make my grave in the pollutions of the earth i am under the shadow of death  this distich has been vulgarly corrupted among us and an expression takes its place scarcely similar in sound and entirely inconsistent with masonry and unmeaning in itself     thus the master mason represents a man under the christian doctrine saved from the grave of iniquity and raised to the faith of salvation  as the great testimonial that we are risen from the state of corruption we bear the emblem of the holy trinity as the insignia of our vows and of the origin of the masters order  this emblem is given by geometricians as a demonstration of the trinity in unity    on receiving this ensign the mason professes himself in a short distich in the greek language which from the rules of our order i am forbid to commit to writing the literal meaning of which is vehementer cupio vitam ardently i wish for life meaning the everlasting life of redemption and regeneration an avowal which carries with it the most religious import and must proceed from a pure faith  the ceremonies attending this stage of our profession are solemn and tremendous during which a sacred awe is diffused over the mind the soul is struck with reverence and all the spiritual faculties are called forth to worship and adoration  this our order is a positive contradistinction to the judaic blindness and infidelity and testifies our faith concerning the resurrection of the body  the divine construction put upon this emblem of the masters order which he declares is the principle by which he is raised from darkness so it is also the emblem of moral duties professed by the mason and which in former ages were most religiously performed these also are principles immediately resulting from the christian doctrine  the master mason imposes a duty on himself full of moral virtue and christian charity by enforcing that brotherly love which every man should extend to his neighbor  first that when the calamities of our brother call for our aid we should not withdraw the hand that might sustain him from sinking but that we should render him those services which not incumbring or injuring our families or fortunes charity and religion may dictate for the saving of our fellow creature  second from which purpose indolence should not persuade the foot to halt or wrath turn our steps out of the way but forgetting injuries and selfish feelings and remembring that man was born for the aid of his generation and not for his own enjoyments only but to do that which is good we should be swift to have mercy to save to strengthen and execute benevolence  third as the good things of this life are partially dispensed and some are opulent whilst others are in distress such principles also enjoin a mason be he ever so poor to testify his good will toward his brother  riches alone do not allow the means of doing good virtue and benevolence are not confined to the walks of opulence  the rich man from his many talents is required to make extensive works under the principles of virtue and yet poverty is no excuse for an omission of that exercise for as the cry of innocence ascends up to heaven as the voice of babes and sucklings reach the throne of god and as the breathings of a contrite heart are heard in the regions of dominion so a masons prayers devoted to the welfare of his brother are required of him  fourth the fourth principle is never to injure the confidence of your brother by revealing his secrets for perhaps that were to rob him of the guard which protects his property or life  the tongue of a mason should be void of offense and without guile  speaking truth with discretion and keeping itself within the rule of judgment  maintaining a heart void of uncharitableness locking up secrets and communing in charity and love  fifth of charity so much is required of a mason in his gifts as discretion shall limit  charity begins at home but like a fruitful olive tree planted by the side of a fountain whose boughs overshoot the wall so is charity it spreads its arms abroad from the strength and opulence of its station and lends its shade for the repose and relief of those who are gathered under its branches  charity when given with imprudence is no longer a virtue but when flowing from abundance it is glorious as the beams of morning in whose beauty thousands rejoice when donations extorted by pity are detrimental to a mans family they become sacrifices to superstition and like incense to idols are disapproved by heaven  as moses was commanded to pull his shoes from off his feet on mount horeb because the ground whereon he trod was sanctified by the presence of the divinity so the mason who would prepare himself for this third stage of masonry should advance in the naked paths of truth be divested of every degree of arrogance and come as a true acacian with steps of innocence humility and virtue to challenge the ensigns of an order whose institutions arise on the most solemn and sacred principles of religion  lecture x the secrecy of masons in this age when every thing serious is received with laughter every thing religious treated with contempt and whatever is moral spurned from the doors of the polite no wonder if my intentions to prove this society of religious as well as civil institution is ridiculed and despised  it is not to be doubted many assemblies of masons were held before the christian era the first stage of masonry took its rise in the earliest times was originated in the mind of adam descended pure through the antedeluvian ages was afterward taught by ham and from him amidst the corruptions of mankind flowed unpolluted and unstained with idolatry to these our times by the channel of some few of the sons of truth who remained uncontaminated with the sins of nations saving to us pure and spotless principles together with the original symbols  these ancients enlightened with original truth were dispersed through many states  they were called to join the jewish nation and many of them became united with that people the wisehearted were employed in the construction of the tabernacle of moses they were embodied at the building of the temple at jerusalem and might from thence emigrate into distant countries where they would superintend other religious works the ceremonies now known to masons prove that the testimonials and insignia of the masters order in the present state of masonry were devised within the ages of christianity and i am confident there are not any records in being in any nation or in any language which can show them to be pertinent to any other system or give them greater antiquity  in this country under the druids the first principles of our profession most assuredly were taught and exercised how soon the second stage and its ceremonials were promulged after the building of the temple at jerusalem we have no degree of evidence as to the third and most sacred order no doubt it was adopted upon the conversion of those who attended the druidical worship who had professed the adoration of the one supreme being and who readily would receive the doctrines of a mediator a system in religion which had led the sages of old into innumerable errors and at last confounded them with idolatry  under our present profession of masonry we allege our morality was originally deduced from the school of pythagoras and that the basilidian system of religion furnished us with some tenets principles and hieroglyphics but these together with the egyptian symbols and judaic monuments are collected only as a successional series of circumstances which the devotees of the deity in different and distant ages of the world had professed and are all resolved into the present system of masonry which is made perfect in the doctrine of christianity from these united members gaining alone that evidence of antiquity which shows that we are descendants of the first worshippers of the deity  that there were builders of cities towers temples and fortifications from the earliest ages is indisputable  but that the artificers were formed into bodies ruled by their own proper laws and knowing mysteries and secrets which were kept from the world i am greatly doubtful  for so plain easy and intelligible is the mechanic art of building that it is comprehensible to any capacity and needed not to be wrapped up in mystic rules neither was there any occasion for the artificers to go about as conjurers professing a science unrevealed to the world  man would be taught building by the animals daily under his observation the fox the rabbit and many other creatures form themselves caves the beaver is an architect in wood and builds hovels and sheds the birds at a season for their increase prepare their nests for the protection of their young the be labors in constructing cities and storehouses the ants are cloistered in their little mount perforated with labyrinths where their provender and progeny are secured  all these would instruct men in building  so that whilst our race were reaping the first rudiments of knowledge from the book of nature after the darkness which had overwhelmed them in their disobedience this could remain no secret  besides if we should be resolved into the successors of mechanics and as such should take our grand progress from the building of the temple at jerusalem we shall find that hiram who was sent from tire to assist in that structure had not his excellence in architecture only but in molten work and also in dying as is said in chronicles he was skilful to work in silver and gold in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue in fine linen and in crimson also to grave all manner of graving  he was the subject of a state wherein the worship of idols was established  this kind of religion gave encouragement to and greatly advanced the fine arts as it employed statuaries sculptors painters and those who made graven images  solomon ornamented his temple with cherubins and palm trees fruits and flowers from whence i do not doubt hirams knowledge was in the business of a statuary and painter that he made graven images of stone and wood and molten images in metals  in kings it is said only that hiram was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass  as to solomons part in this great structure he being inclined to this mighty work of piety through the ordinances of heaven and the promises made to his father david was the executor of that plan which was revealed to him from above  he called forth the sages and religious men amongst his people to perform the work  he classed them according to their rank in their religious profession as the priests of the temple were stationed in the solemn rites and ceremonies instituted there  this distinction was maintained in most religious societies but especially with the primitive christians  the chosen ones of solomon as a pious and holy duty conducted the work  if we regard them as architects by profession by reason of this duty so we may abel noah abraham jacob moses and david by reason of the building of their altars which were no other than works of piety and devotion  from those circumstances i am bold to say that if we trace the antiquity of masonry on the operative principles and derive such principles from the building of solomons temple we may as well claim all the professions which hiram excelled in  but i will leave this speculation for more material subjects  some masters of design have brought their works to a singular justness symmetry and order in egypt and greece in italy and many other european states but they like proficients in painting and music had their excellence from a degree of genius and taste peculiar to themselves  it was a singular gift and they needed not mysteries to keep it secret for as mens geniuses are as various as their features so was this excellence in architecture as free from usurpation as if it had been wrapped up in the most profound magic  i am persuaded there was no occasion to form such secret rules for the compact of operative masons  solomon for the conduct of such a multitude wisely preserved the order of the religious and the mysteries of their initiation for the rule of his people employed in the temple  assuredly the secrets revealed to us were for other uses than what relate to laboring up masses of stone and our society as it now stands is an association on religious and charitable principles which principles were instituted and arose upon the knowledge of god and in the christian revelation  soon after the time that christianity became the established religion of this country the professors of it employed themselves in founding religious houses and in the building of places of public worship  on any reform of religion it is observable the first professors are inclinable to enthusiasm  such was the case in this land on the advancement of the christian doctrine  a fervor for endowments infatuated the minds of the converted  certain days were assigned for the purpose of attending to religious works and edifices called hallywarkdays on which no man of what profession rank or estate soever was exempt from attending that duty  besides there were a set of men called halywerkfolk de hermitorio finchalensis ranulphus dei gratia dunelmensis episcopus omnibus hominibus suis francis et anglis de haly werc folc salutem etc  many other grants are in my possession of this kind ralph flamberd was consecrated bishop of durham in  0      to whom were assigned certain lands which they held by the service of repairing defending or building churches and sepulchers for which pious labors they were exempt from all feodal and military services these men being stonecutters and builders might also be of our profession and most probably they were selected from thence the two being in no wise incompatible with each other  the county of durham hist dunelm apud wartoni aug sax entertained a particular set of those halywerkfolk who were guards of the patrimony and holy sepulcher of st cuthbert  these men come the nearest to a similitude of solomons masons and to the title of free and accepted masons of any degree of architects i have gained any knowledge of but whether their initiation was attended with any peculiar ceremonies or by what laws they were regulated i have not been able to discover and must lament that in the church records of durham or in any public office there there are not the least remains of evidence touching these people and the constitution of their society it was a matter to be coveted by me lecturing on this subject as most probably such constitution or evidence would have confirmed every hypothesis i have raised on the definition of our emblems and mysteries  the emblems used by these people very much resembled those of our society several tokens of which have been found of late years in pulling down old ruins  it is much to be wished that those noblemen etc in whose possession ancient abbeys stand would on all occasions of pulling down or repairing give instructions to their workmen to preserve with care any antique marks characters or emblems they may find  there are some double walls or hollow pillars in which such things were deposited  few men will be at the expense of digging to the foundations of such buildings where valuable marks and curious inscriptions would be found on the foundation or what was called the anglestone which formed a perfect cube  this was a very ancient custom the unbelieving jews accused our savior of having stolen the mystic words the tetragrammaton or urim and thummim from the foundation of the temple at jerusalem which they said he carried concealed about him whereby he was enabled to work his miracles  soon after the progress of christianity in this land all europe was inflamed with the cry and madness of an enthusiastic monk who prompted the zealots in religion to the holy war in which for the purpose of recovering the holy city and judea out of the hands of infidels armed legions of saints devotees and enthusiasts in tens of thousands poured forth from every state of europe to waste their blood and treasure in a purpose as barren and unprofitable as impolitic  it was deemed necessary that those who took up the ensign of the cross in this enterprise should form themselves into such societies as might secure them from spies and treacheries and that each might know his companion and brother labourer as well in the dark as by day as it was with jepthas army at the passes of jordan so also was it requisite in these expeditions that certain signs signals watchwords or passwords should be known amongst them for the armies consisted of various nations and various languages  we are told in the book of judges that the gileadites took the passes of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite if he said nay then said they unto him say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right then they took them and slew them at the passage of jordan the application which is made of the word sibboleth amongst masons is as a testimony of their retaining their original vow uninfringed and their first says with the brotherhood uncorrupted and to render their words and phrases more abstruse and obscure they selected such as by acceptance in the scriptures or otherwise might puzzle the ignorant by a double implication  thus sibboleth should we have adopted the elusimian mysteries would answer as an avowal of our profession the same implying ears of corn but it has its etymology or derivation from the following compounds in the greek tongue as it is adopted by masons viz  colo and  lapis so  sibbolithon colo lapidem implies that they retain and keep inviolate their obligations as the juramentum per jovem lpidm the most obligatory oath held amongst the heathen  the name lapis or as others write lapideus was given to jupiter by the romans who conceived that juramentum per jovem lapidem an oath by jupiter lapis was the most obligatory oath and it is derived either from the stone which was presented to saturn by his wise ops who said that it was jupiter in which sense eusebius says that lapis reigned in crete or from lipide silice the flint stone which in making bargains the swearer held in his hand and said if knowingly i deceive so let diespiter saving the city and the capital cast me away from all that is good as i cast away this stone whereupon he threw the stone away pantheon     no project or device could answer the purposes of the crusadors better than those of masonry  the maxims and ceremonials attending the masters order had been previously established and were materially necessary on that expedition for as the mahomedans were also worshippers of the deity and as the enterprizers were seeking a country where the masons were in the time of solomon called into an association and where some remains would certainly be found of the mysteries and wisdom of the ancients and of our predecessors such degrees of masonry as extended only to the acknowledgment of their being servants of the god of nature would not have distinguished them from those they had to encounter had they not assumed the symbols of the christian faith  all the learning of europe in those times as in the ages of antiquity was possessed by the religious  they had acquired the wisdom of the ancients and the original knowledge which was in the beginning and now is the truth  many of them had been initiated into the mysteries of masonry  they were the projectors of this enterprise and as solomon in the building of the temple introduced orders and regulations for the conduct of the work which his wisdom had been enriched with from the learning of the sages of antiquity so that no confusion should happen during its progress and so that the rank and office of each fellow laborer might be distinguished and ascertained beyond the possibility of deceit in like manner the priests projecting the crusades being possessed of the mysteries of masonry the knowledge of the ancients and of the universal language which survived the confusion of shinar revived the orders and regulations of solomon and initiated the legions therein who followed them to the holy land  hence that secrecy which attended the crusaders  amongst other evidence which authorizes me in the conjecture that masons went to the holy wars is the doctrine of that order of masons called the higher order i am induced to believe that order was of scottish extraction separate nations might be distinguished by some separate order as they were by singular ensigns but be that as it may it fully proves to me that masons were crusaders  as my intention in this lecture was not only to speculate on the ancient secrecy amongst masons but also to treat of the secrecy of masons in this age i must therefore turn my thoughts to the importance secresy is now of amongst us when there are no holy structures to erect no holy wars to wage and nothing but charity and brotherly love to cherish among masons  this institution which was first founded in the mysteries of religion as i have before rehearsed to you is now maintained by us on the principles of lending mutual aid and consolation to each other  how should we be able to discern the brethren of this family but through such tokens as should point them out from other men language is now provincial and the dialects of different nations would not be comprehensible to men ignorant and unlettered hence it became necessary to use an expression which should be cognizable by people of all nations  so it is with masons  they are possessed of that universal expression and of such remains of the original language that they can communicate their history their wants and prayers to every brother mason throughout the globe  from whence it is certain that multitudes of lives have been saved in foreign countries when shipwreck and misery had overwhelmed them when robbers had pillaged when sickness want and misery had brought them even to the brink of the grave the discovery of masonry has saved them the discovery of being a brother has staid the savage hand of the conqueror lifted in the field of battle to cut off the captive has withheld the sword imbrued in carnage and slaughter and subdued the insolence of triumph to pay homage to the craft  the importance of secrecy with us is such that we may not be deceived in the dispensing of our charities  that we may not be betrayed in the tenderness of our benevolence and others usurp the portion which is prepared for those of our own family  to betray the watchword which should keep the enemy from the walls of our citadel so as to open our strongholds to robbers and deceivers is as great a moral crime as to show the common thief the weaknesses and secret places of our neighbors dwellinghouses that he may pillage their goods  nay it is still greater for it is like aiding the sacrilegious robber to ransack the holy places and steal the sacred vessels devoted to the most solemn rites of religion  it is snatching from the divine hand of charity the balm which she holds forth to heal the distresses of her children the cordial cup of consolation which she offers to the lip of calamity and the sustenance her fainting infants should receive from the bosom of her celestial love  as this then is the importance of masons secrecy wherefore should the world wonder that the most profligate tongue which ever had expression has not revealed it the sport is too criminal to afford delight even to the wickedest of mankind for it must be wantonness only which could induce any man to divulge it as no profit could arise therefrom nor selfish view be gratified  it was mentioned by divine lips as a crime not in nature what man is there of you whom if his son ask for bread will give him a stone or if he ask a fish will give him a serpent  then can there be a man so iniquitous among masons as to guide the thief to steal from his sick brother the medicine which should restore his health the balsam which should close his wounds the clothing which should shield his trembling limbs from the severity of the winter the drink which should moisten his fainting lip the bread which should save his soul alive  such is the importance of our secrecy  were there no other ties upon our affections or consciences than merely the sense of the injury we should do to the poor and the wretched by a transgression of this rule i am persuaded it would be sufficient to lock up the tongue of every man who professes himself to be a mason  lecture xi of charity as one of the principal characteristics of a mason in this lecture i will treat of charity  i do not mean to make strictures on that modern error of indiscriminately dispensing alms to all suppliants without regard to their real wants or real merits whereby the hypocrite and knave often eat the bread which virtue in distress ought to be relieved by  this is a mistaken character of charity in which she is too often abused  though the bounties of benevolence and compassion are given with a righteous wish yet they should be ruled by discretion  the ancients used to depict the virtue charity in the character of a goddess seated in a chair of ivory with a golden tire upon her head set with precious stones  her vesture like the light of heaven represented universal benevolence her throne was unpolluted and unspotted by passions and prejudices and the gems of her fillet represented the inestimable blessings which flowed variously from her bounty  they also represented the charities otherwise called the graces under three personages  one of these was painted with her back toward us and her face forward as proceeding from us and the other two with their faces toward us to denote that for one benefit done we should receive double thanks  they were painted naked to intimate that good offices should be done without dissembling and hypocrisy  they were represented young to signify that the remembrance of benefits should never wax old  and also laughing to tell us that we should do good to others with cheerfulness and alacrity  they were represented linked together arm in arm to instruct us that one kindness should prompt another so that the knot and bond of love should be indissoluble  the poets tell us that they used to wash themselves in the fountain acidalius because benefits gifts and goodturns ought to be sincere and pure and not base sordid and counterfeit  charity in the works of moralists is defined to be the love of our brethren or a kind of brotherly affection one toward another  the rule and standard that this habit is to be examined and regulated by among christians is the love we bear to ourselves or that the mediator bore toward us  that is it must be unfeigned constant and out of no other design than their happiness  such are the general sentiments which the ancients entertained of this virtue and what the modern moralists and christians define it to be at this day  in what character charity should be received among masons is now my purpose to define as it stands limited to our own society the principles which alone should attend a candidate for initiation to our society are pathetically represented in the following psalm  psalm xv   lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall abide in thy holy hill    he that walks uprightly and works righteousness and speaks the truth in his heart    he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor does evil to his neighbor nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor    in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honors them that fear the lord he that swears to his own hurt and changes not    he that puts not out his money to usury nor takes reward against the innocent  he that does these things shall never be moved     as being so limited we are not through that channel subject to be imposed on by false pretenses and are certain of the proper and merited administration of it it is hence to be hoped that it exists with us without dissembling or hypocrisy and lives in sincerity and truth  that benefits received impress a lively degree of gratitude and affection on the minds of masons as their bounties should be bestowed with cheerfulness and unacquainted with the frozen singer of reluctance  the benevolence of our society should be so mutual and brotherly that each ought to endeavor to render good offices as readily as he would receive them the misplacing of a benefit is worse than the not receiving of it for the one is another mans fault but the other is mine the error of the giver does often times excuse the ingratitude of the receiver for a favor ill placed is rather a profusion than a benefit it is the most shameful of losses an inconsiderate bounty i will choose a man of integrity sincere considerate grateful temperate wellnatured neither covetous nor sordid and when i have obliged such a man though not worth a groat in the world i have gained my end if we give only to receive we lose the fairest objects for our charity the absent the sick the captive and the needy seneca of benefits the rule is we are to give as we would receive cheerfully quickly and without hesitation for there is no grace in a benefit that sticks to the fingers a benefit should be made acceptable by all possible means even to the end that the receiver who is never to forget it may bear it in his mind with satisfaction the same it is not the value of the present but the benevolence of the mind that we are to consider that which is given with pride and ostentation is rather an ambition than a bounty the same   in order to exercise this virtue both in the character of masons and in common life with propriety and agreeable to such principles we should forget every obligation but affection for otherwise it were to confound charity with duty  the feelings of the heart ought to direct the hand of charity  to this purpose we should be divested of every idea of superiority and estimate ourselves as being of the same rank and race of men  in this disposition of mind we may be susceptible of those sentiments which charity delights in to feel the woes and miseries of others with a genuine and true sympathy of soul  compassion is of heavenly birth  it is one of the first characteristics of humanity  peculiar to our race it distinguishes us from the rest of creation   corinthians chap xiii ver   though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal    and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all says so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing    and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing    charity suffers long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up    does not behave itself unseemly seeks not her own is not easily provoked thinks no evil    rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth    bears all things believes all things hops all things endures all things    charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away    for we know in part and we prophesy in part   0 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away     when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things     for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known     and now abides faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity     he whose bosom is locked up against compassion is a barbarian  his manners must be brutal  his mind gloomy and morose  and his passions as savage as the beasts of the forest  what kind of man is he who full of opulence and in whose hand abundance overflows can look on virtue in distress and merit in misery without pity  who could behold without tears the desolate and forlorn estate of a widow who in early life having been brought up in the bosom of a tender mother without knowing care and without tasting of necessity was not befitted for adversity  whose soul was pure as innocence and full of honor  whose mind had been brightned by erudition under an indulgent father  whose youth untutored in the school of sorrows had been flattered with the prospect of days of prosperity and plenty  one who at length by the cruel adversity of winds and seas with her dying husband is wrecked in total destruction and beggary driven by ill fortune from peace and plenty and from the bed of ease changes her lot to the dank dunghill for the relief of her weariness and pain  grown meagre with necessity and sick with woe  at her bosom hanging her famished infant draining off the dregs of parental life for sustenance bestowed from maternal love  yielding existence to support the babe  hardhearted covetousness and proud titles can ye behold such an object dry eyed  can avarice grasp the mite which should sustain such virtue  can high life lift its supercilious brow above such scenes in human life above such miseries sustained by a fellow creature  if perchance the voice of the unfortunate and wretched widow is heard in complainings when wearying patience and relaxing resignation breathes a sigh whilst modesty forbids her supplication is not the groan the sigh more pathetic to your ear you rich ones than all the flattering petitions of a cringing knave who touches your vanity and tickles your follies extorting from your very weaknesses the prostituted portion of charity  perhaps the fatal hours at hand when consolation is required to close the last moments of this unfortunate ones life  can the man absorbed in pleasure roll his chariot wheels beyond the scene of sorrow without compassion and without pity see the last convulsion and the deadly gaze which paint misery upon the features of an expiring saint  if angels weep in heaven they weep for such  if they can know contempt they feel it for the wealthy who bestow not of their superfluities and snatch not from their vices what would gladden souls sunk in the woes of worldly adversity  the eyes of cherubims view with delight the exercise of such benevolence as forms the character of the good samaritan  saints touch their golden lyres to hymn humanitys fair history in realms of bliss and approbation shines upon the countenance divine of omnipresence when a man is found in the exercise of virtue  what should that human wretch be called who with premeditated cruelty and avarice devises mischief whilst he is conscious of his neighbors honesty  whilst he sees him industriously day by day laboring with sweaty brow and weary limbs toiling with cheerfulness for bread  on whose exerted labor an affectionate and virtuous wife and healthy children crowding his narrow hearth with naked feet depend for sustenance  whilst he perceives him with integrity more than human taking scrupulously his own and wronging no man for his hunger or his wants  whilst he sees him with fatigued sinews lengthen out the toil of industry from morn to night with unremitting ardor singing to elude repining and smoothing his anxieties and pain with hope that he shall reward his weariness by the overflowings of his wifes cheerful heart and with the smiles of his feeding infants  what must he be who knows such a man and by his craft or avarice extorts unjust demands and brings him into beggary  what must he be who sees such a man deprived by fire or water of all his substance the habitation of his infants lost and nothing left but nakedness and tears  and seeing this affords the sufferer no relief  surely in nature few such wretches do exist but if such be it is not vain presumption to proclaim that like accursed cain they are distinguished as the outcast of gods mercies and are left on earth to live a life of punishment  the objects of true charity are merit and virtue in distress  persons who are incapable of extricating themselves from misfortunes which have overtaken them in old age  industrious men from inevitable accidents and acts of providence rushed into ruin  widows left survivors of their husbands by whose labors they subsisted  orphans in tender years left naked to the world  what the claims of such on the hand of charity when you compare them to the miscreants who infest the doors of every dwelling with their importunities wretches wandering from their homes showing their distortions and their sores to prompt compassion with which illgotten gains in concert with thieves and vagabonds they revel away the hours of night which conceals their iniquities and vices  charity when misapplied loses her titles and instead of being adorned with the dress of virtue assumes the insignificance the bells and feathers of folly  lecture xii on brotherly love i shall treat of brotherly love in this lecture in that light which solely appertains to masons  the necessity there is for the exertion of brotherly regard among masons in the lodge is obvious to every one  peace regularity and decorum are indispensible duties here  all the sire of resentment and remembrance of injuries should be forgotten and that cordiality ought to be warm among us which brings with it cheerfulness and rejoicing  the true worshipers of the deity men who held just notions of the principles of nature in the times of barbarous ignorance durst not publicly practice the one or promulgate the other  but happy is our estate in this lettered age and this land of liberty we profess our sentiments with freedom and without fear we exercise our religious principles under a full toleration and as social beings we assemble in the lodge to enjoy the pleasures of friendship and the breathings of true benevolence without alloy  after the business of the lodge is dispatched we are met together to open out the cheerfulness of our hearts without guile for here are no talebearers censors or revilers among us  our lodge is sacred to silence  hence we may say figuratively it is situate in the secret places where the cock holds not his watch where the voice of railing reaches not where brawling as the intemperate wrath of women cannot be heard  without suspicion of being betrayed in our words or ensnared in the openness of our dealings our mirth here is undisguised is governed by prudence tempered with love and clothed in charity  thus it stands void of offense  no malicious mind warps innocent expressions to wicked constructions or interprets unmeaning jests into sarcasms or satyrs but as every sentiment flows full of benevolence so every ear here is attuned to the strain in harmonious concord and tastes the pleasures of festivity so pure that they bear our reflections in the morning without remorse  peace regularity and decorum which i said were indispensible duties here are not the offspring of control or the issue of authority but a voluntary service which every man brings to the lodge  there are seasons indeed in which authority is properly exercised  man is frail  the most prudent may sometimes deviate  it was a maxim of the ancient philosophers that to err was human therefore in the lodge there ought to be a constant governor who should restrain the improprieties which may creep in among us by any brother coming here after an intemperance in liquor  another degree of brotherly love which should prevail here is to hear the petitions of every member of this society with tenderness and attention  where there is at any time a brother of our community sick or in distress the case of his calamities should come here represented by a brother who will neither deceive us nor hold back any part of his merits  and the lodge must testify all due regard by receiving the petition patiently and giving relief according to the deserts  the most material part of that brotherly love which should subsist among us masons is that of speaking well of each other to the world  more especially it is expected of every member of this fraternity that he should not traduce his brother  calumny and slander are detestable crimes against society  nothing can be viler than to traduce a man behind his back it is like the villainy of an assassin who has not virtue enough to give his adversary the means of selfdefence but lurking in darkness stabs him whilst he is unarmed and unsuspicious of an enemy  of this crime the muchadmired poet shakespeare has given a just description  the man who steals my purse steals trash it was mine it is his and may be slave to thousands but he who pilfers from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him but makes me poor indeed calumny has this direful consequence that it carries with it not a momentary effect only but endures for time uncounted  the wickedness of the world is such that it is greedy of scandal and when once the voice of defamation has uttered its poison like a pestilence it smites and contaminates  it spreads jealousies in families division and wrath among friends urges fathers against children and brother against brother  when once the pernicious tale gets birth it cannot be recalled and thence the sinners penitence is not capable of expiation for the evil consequences may lay dormant in the womb of futurity and become an intail of sorrow on the third and fourth generation of him that is injured  what malice and mischief what infernal disposition must actuate the mind which is capable of defaming the innocent  there is no crime of which such a wretch might not be the perpetrator  against such a villain there is no armor for defense  he assaults the naked and unsuspicious and like the contagion of some horrid disease he smites whilst the victim sleeps  justice is disarmed against such a sinner as concealment is his safeguard and only the eye of heaven discovers his iniquity  it is not only expected of masons that they should with a conscientious soul rerefrain from evilspeaking but also that they should speak well of each other  to give a man his just and due character is so easy a duty that it is not possible for a benevolent mind to avoid it  it is a degree of common justice which honesty itself prompts one to  it is not enough that we refrain from slander but it is required of masons that they should speak graciously and with affection withholding nothing that can be uttered to a brothers praise or good name with truth  what a pleasure does it give the heart feeling benevolent dispositions to give praises where due  there is a selfish joy in good speaking as selfapprobation succeeds it  besides the breast of such a man feels enlarged whilst he utters the praise due to his neighbor and he experiences all the finest sensations of love whilst he moves others to the same object of his regard  the neutral disposition frigid and reserved neither speaks good nor evil  but the man tasting brotherly love is warm to commend  it is an easy and cheap means of bestowing good gifts and working good works  for by a just praise to industry you recommend the industrious man to those to whom he might never be known and thereby enlarge his credit and his trade  by a just commendation of merit you may open the paths of advancement through those whose power might never have been petitioned  by a proper praise of genius and art you may rouse the attention of those patrons to whom the greatest deservings might have remained a secret it is a degree of justice which every man has a right to from his brother that his virtues be not concealed  to shroud the imperfections of our friend and cloak his infirmities is christianlike and charitable consequently besitting a mason  even the truth should not be told at all times for where we cannot approve we should pity in silence  what pleasure or profit can there arise by exposing the secrets of a brother  to exhort him is virtuous  to revile him is inhuman  and to set him out as an object of ridicule is infernal  from hence we must necessarily determine that the duty of a good man leads to work the works of benevolence and his heart is touched with joy whilst he acts within her precepts  let us therefore be steadfast and immovable in our ordinances that we be proved to have a tongue of good report  lecture xiii on the occupations of masons in my former lectures i have declared it to be my opinion that masons in the present state of masonry were never a body of architects  by the book of constitutions published by authority we see no grand communication held in form till of very late date neither is there any evidence therein to contradict the propositions i have laid down  the succession therein described is by no means to be accepted and understood in a literal sense but as a pedigree or chronological table of the servants of the deity working in the duties of righteousness  i ground my judgment of the nature of our profession on our ceremonials and am convinced they have not their relation to building and architecture but are emblematical and imply moral spiritual and religious tenets  it appears to me selfevident that the situation of the lodge and its several parts are copied after the tabernacle and temple and are representative of the universe implying that the universe is the temple in which the deity is every where present our mode of teaching the principles of our profession is derived from the druids our maxims of morality from pythagoras our chief emblems originally from egypt to basilides we owe the science of abrax and the characters of those emanations of the deity which we have adopted and which are so necessary for the maintenance of a moral society  i am induced to believe that our present ceremonies were more generally taught and more candidates were initiated therein on the opening of the crusades than in any other era or on any other known occasion  the english historians agree that in the reign of henry the second and in the year      at an interview between the kings of england and france attended by the prelates and nobility of both nations the archbishop of tire pronounced such a melancholy account of sladines success in the holy land and the miseries of the christians in that country that the audience was greatly affected with the relation and the two kings agreed to convert their whole attention to the relief of those adventurers  they received the cross from the hands of the archbishop resolving to go there in person and their example was followed by philip count of flanders and a great number of the prelates and nobility there present  a plenary indulgence was published in the popes name for all that would make a fair confession of their sins and engage in the crusade  the different nations assumed crosses of a different color and rules and orders were established for preventing riot luxury and disorder on the enterprise  these were the principal rules made for the regulation of the crusaders  we may conjecture these religious campaigns being over that men initiated in the mysteries of masonry and engaged and enrolled under those rules and orders which were established for the conduct of the nations in the holy war would form themselves into lodges and keep up their social meetings when returned home in commemoration of their adventures and mutual good offices in palestine and for the propagation of that knowledge into which they had been initiated  as a further argument that builders and architects were not the original members of our society the masons of the city of london obtained their incorporation and charter in the reign of king henry the fifth in or about the year      they taking on themselves the name of free masons  by their charter they are governed by a master and two wardens with twentyfive assistants  of this incorporated body sixtyfive are of the livery of london  it has never been pretended that the society of free and accepted masons have in any manner been connected or much less have united themselves with the incorporated body of masons enchartered but on the contrary have kept themselves totally apart  it has been alleged that in the reign of king henry the sixth an obsolete law was enacted setting forth that by the yearly congregations and confederacies made by masons in their general assemblies the good course and effects of the statute of laborers were openly violated and broken and making the future holding of their chapters and congregations felony  it is impossible that this statute should relate to any other persons than the incorporated body of working masons who under an exclusive charter by secret combinations raised the prices of their labor and prevented craftsmen of their fraternity not members of the charter from exercising their trade within the limits of london which might occasion a grievance worthy of parliamentary redress  but in what manner the statutes of laborers could be affected by the associations of this fraternity of ours is not in my power to comprehend our records give us no evidence of any such convocations at the time mentioned  by the charter of masons they assumed the title of free masons being entitled to the franchises of the city of london  why the title of free is annexed to our society or that of accepted i hope i may be allowed to conjecture was derived from the crusades  there the volunteers entering into that service must be freemen born free and not villains or under any vassallage for it was not until long after the crusades that vassallage and feudal services together with the slavish tenures were taken away  they were entitled to the style of accepted under that plenary indulgence which the pope published for all that would confess their sins and inlist in the enterprise of the holy war whereby they were accepted and received into the bosom of the father of the church  some authors have presumed to tell us that it was the original design of the christian powers in their enterprise in the holy land to rebuild the temple at jerusalem but i cannot discover any good authority for this assertion  in modern masonry it is given as a principle why our dedication of lodges is made to st john that the masons who engaged to conquer the holy land chose that saint for their patron  i should be sorry to appropriate the balsarian sect of christians of st john as an explanation of this principle  st john obtains our dedication as being the proclaimer of that salvation which was at hand by the coming of christ and we as a set of religious assembling in the true faith commemorate the proclamations of the baptist  in the name of st john the evangelist we acknowledge the testimonies which he gives and the divine  which he makes manifest  but to return to the subject of the crusaders  it is probable that the same enthusiastic spirit which engaged men to enter into the crusades at the vast expense and hazard which history describes also led them into as enormous a folly in the building of religious houses  during the reign of henry the second when the english first engaged in the holy war there were not less than one hundred and eleven abbeys nunneries and religious houses founded in this kingdom  during the reign of richard the first eighteen  and during the reign of henry the third forty which shows the religious infatuation which had totally overrun the minds of the people in those reigns  the ecclesiastics in imitation of the works of solomon might become the masters of those works and superintend and conduct the labors of the inferior sect of halywarkfolk that by acceptable hands such pious works might be conducted and from whence the ignorant and profane might be rejected like the samaritans  these might assume the honorary title of masons which from vulgar acceptance would naturally confound them with ordinary mechanics  in the anglanorman antiquities it is said of free masons that they were an association of religious who engaged in the founding and erecting of churches and religious houses in palestine  i have already mentioned the religious sect who were really architects and builders of churches the halywarkfolk with no small degree of respect they were a body of men subsisting before the crusades  they were maintained by the church under which they held lands for the service of erecting and repairing churches and for the guarding of the sepulchers of saints  it is not improbable that when the rage of holy works and holy wars and the desire of palestine fired the minds of all europe but a body of those people might embark in the enterprise and be transported thither to build churches for the better planting or propagating the christian doctrine or to guard and maintain the holy sepulcher  i would be ready at all times to admit these emigrants might possess some rules and ceremonies for initiation peculiar to themselves so far as the bearers of burdens were admitted under solomon in the building at jerusalem and that they might retain their singular maxims and principles in secrecy  and it may also be admitted that in honor of that gradation of masonry and of their profession they should claim the greatest antiquity from solomons temple at least  they might even be more than a collateral branch of the free and accepted masons as i have before admitted and be initiated in the mysteries of masonry their occupation being in no wise incompatible with our profession and they might be known and distinguished by the title of operative masons as the essenes were divided into theoricks and practicks  but from the writings of the author of the anglanorman antiquities i am convinced he was not a free and accepted mason himself and as the secrecy of that society had attracted the attention of many who as their curiosity was exercised raised conjectures on the name of masons to discover their origin and principles or to reconcile their own opinions from whence nothing was more likely to strike the attention of an historian than this body of men the halywarkfolk rambling in palestine were to his purpose  were we claimants only of the title of mechanics we might have chose as ancient and a more honorable branch of the arts or sciences  we might have substituted geometry to a more worthy duty and have honored our maker in some profession more expressive of our sense of his power and dignity  our origin in this country is thought to be from the phoenicians who came here with the tyrian hercules and introduced the doctrines of ham and the amonian rites together with the hebrew customs and afterward the emigrants from the holy land who taught us the rules instituted by solomon at the temple of jerusalem and finally the propagators of the christian doctrine who brought with them the principles of the masters order and taught the converted those sacred mysteries which are typical of the christian faith and professional of the hope of the resurrection of the body and the life of regeneration yet i fear few among us are equal to the character we have assumed our lodges are not now appropriated to worship and religious ceremonies we meet as a social society inclined to acts of benevolence and suffer the more sacred offices to rest unperformed  whether this neglect is to our honor i presume not to remonstrate in our present state professing ourselves free and accepted masons we are totally severed from architects and are become a set of men working in the duties of charity good offices and brotherly love  christians in religion  sons of liberty and loyal subjects  we have adopted rules orders emblems and symbols which enjoin us to live a life of morality  we have furnished our lodges with those striking objects which should at once intimate to us the mightiness and wisdom of god the instability of the affairs of man and the various vicissitudes in human life and have set before our eyes preceptors of moral works and to strengthen our faith we have enlightened our lodge with the emblem of the trinity  it is well known to us that there is scarce a state in europe in which our fraternity have not formed a body  the wisdom of the ancients would pass abroad into many regions and those who had assisted in the pious labors at jerusalem would like pythagoras teach the sciences and mysteries which they professed and communicate the system to which they had been initiated  religious men would retain the doctrines and mysteries with reverence and with caution reveal them to those they thought worthy to receive hence the original knowledge would pass into many countries  but there is no accounting for this universality of the society upon the principles of architecture and operative masonry  the rage of churchbuilding had not contaminated all europe as it did england neither is there any probable means to be deduced from architecture and the practice of builders to account why in every tongue and in every kingdom the ceremonials of being made a mason should be the same  if the honor of architecture was all that was to be regarded in the society various would be the devices by which the members in each nation would profess it  as architecture according to its present orders had its progress from egypt and greece some nations would have borrowed symbols and ensigns peculiar to those people or we should have had in our ceremonies or in our workings some devices which might have distinguished to us the beauties orders ornaments proportions or symmetries of some or all of the rules modes or orders of architecture either from the plains of shinar from egypt jerusalem tadmore or greece or have retained some geometrical problems on which the general principles of proportion in architecture were grounded or demonstrated  but instead of that it is well known to us that there is nothing of that kind revealed on the contrary our mysteries are totally abstracted from the rules of mechanics they are relative to religion and morality and are conducive to pious works they are unfurnished with any type symbol of character but what appertains to demonstrate the servants and devotees of the great   there is not an instance of the european states uniting in any one enterprise save the holy war and from thence we most rationally must conceive the present number of masons dispersed over the face of europe was principally derived the amonian rites are almost totally distinguished religious zeal has imbrued the sword in carnage and europe has groaned under persecutions the romans extirpated the druids christians have glutted their cruel hands with slaughter bigotry and enthusiasm in every age have reigned in bloodshed  by the crusades the number of our society would be greatly augmented the occasion itself would revive the rules of masonry they being so well adapted to that purpose and also professional of the christian faith from whence sprang the spirit of the enterprise  after these pursuits subsided bodies of men would be found in every country from whence the levies were called and what would preserve the society in every state even during the persecutions of zealots the master masons order under its present principles is adapted to every sect of christians it originated from the earliest era of christianity in honor to or in confession of the religion and faith of christians before the poison of sectaries was diffused over the church  to the ancient rules deduced from solomon other laws rules and ordinances were added upon the enterprises of the crusaders for the prevention of riot luxury and disorder and for the maintaining that necessary subordination which the command of such armies required many of these rules we retain in the conduct and government of our lodge which can in no wise be deduced from any other original  lecture xiv a corollary i shall now conclude these lectures with collecting into one view the propositions and maxims which have engaged my attention throughout the whole work thereby to give a clear idea of the mysteries of masonry the progression and spirit of its institution origin and present state  i may have seemed prolix and have filled my arguments or representations with repetitions but where that seeming impropriety takes place it was necessary to urge a position which contended with some accepted error prepossession or vulgar prejudice  from the ancient rites and ceremonies which i have laid before you it will be easy for you to trace the origins of our own and to discover the foundations on which our society was erected it is evident they had their progress in the postdeluvian world from ham i am under a necessity sometimes to use terms of art or expressions which to others may not carry distinct and clear images but to my brethren breathe an energy which flows from the united force of technical terms symbols and hieroglyphics when i speak of masons under the denomination of a society i mean masons as embodied in lodges according to the present manners in which such lodges are held  our antiquity is in our principles maxims language learning and religion  these we derive from eden from the patriarchs and from the sages of the east all which are made perfect under the christian dispensation  the light and doctrines which we possess are derived from the beginning of time and have descended through this long succession of ages uncorrupted but our modes and manners are deduced from the different aeras of paradise the building of the temple at jerusalem and the christian revelation  i have explained to you that the structure of the lodge is a pattern of the universe and that the first entry of a mason represents the first worship of the true god  we have retained the egyptian symbols of the sun and moon as the emblems of gods power eternity omnipresence and benevolence and thereby we signify that we are the children of light and that the first foundation of our profession is the knowledge and adoration of the almighty  who seateth himself in the center of the heavens  we derive from the druids many of the amonian rites and i am bold to say that we retain more of the ceremonials and doctrines of the druids than is to be found in the whole world besides and have saved from oblivion many of their religious rites in our initiation to the first degree of masonry which otherwise would have slept in eternity these we seem to have mixed and tempered with the principles of the essenes who are a sect as ancient as the departure of the children of israel out of egypt  the philosophy of the egyptians and the manners principles and customs of the hebrews were introduced to this land by the phoenicians and make a part of our profession so far as they are adapted to the worship of natures great author unpolluted by idolatry  we hold our grand festival on the day of st john which is midsummerday in which we celebrate that season when the sun is in its greatest altitude and in the midst of its prolisic powers the great type of the omnipotence of the deity  the famous lawyer lord cook in his treatise on littletons institutes says prudent antiquity did for more solemnity and better memory and observation of that which is to be done express substances under ceremonies  i have pointed out to you that the furnitures of the lodge are emblems excitive of morality and good government  prudence shines in the center or if you would apply this object to more sacred principles it represents the blazing star which conducted the wise men to bethlehem and proclaimed the presence of the son of god it is here placed in your view that you may remember to work out the works of salvation which is at hand  and that you may pass on in acts of strict propriety with greater alacrity the tassalata or mosaicwork intimates to you the chequered diversity and uncertainty of human affairs that you may not set your hearts on the things of this world but lay up your treasures where the rust cannot deface their polish and luster neither can the moth despoil the garment for the wedding feast  to protect and support us under the infirmities of nature and lead us to the paths of propriety the book of true knowledge is in the lodge  the master circumscribes you as with the sweep of the compass and the square is your trial whereby you shall prove the rectitude and uniformity of your manners  in my next lecture i demonstrated to you that to be a worthy servant in the temple of god you must be clothed with innocence that your service may stand in approbation and you may be accepted in heaven  our jewels are emblems of that good working in a moral mind which adorns the life of man faith charity and uprightness  in the succeeding lecture i have led you to a discernment of the second race of the servants of god under the mosaic law the truth being stripped of the errors of idolatry  this stage is adapted to the second gradation of masonry  i have argued for the propriety of our adopting geometry in this society as being a science from whence the mighty powers of god are revealed and demonstrated to mankind  afterward i attended to the estate of the worshippers of the deity under the corruptions of the house of israel and under the rottenness of the old law  in this assembly of christians it is in no wise requisite to attempt an argument on the necessity which there was upon earth for a mediator and savior for man  in the rubbish superstitions ceremonials and filth of the jewish temple the true worship of god was buried and confounded and innocence became only the ornaments of its monument  then it was that the divinity looking down with an eye of commiseration on the deplorable state of man in his mercy and love sent us a preceptor and mediator who should teach to us the doctrine of regeneration and raise us from the sepulcher of sin to which the human race had resigned themselves  he gave to us the precepts of that acceptable service wherewith his father should be well pleased he made the sacrifice of expiation and becoming the first fruits of them that slept manifested to mankind the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting  in the masters order this whole doctrine is symbolized and the christian conduct is by types presented to us  we masons have adopted three particular characteristics secrecy charity and brotherly love  i have explained my sense of these three great duties and of what especial import they are of to masons or to men who have separated themselves from the rest of mankind and professed they are servants of him who rules in the midst of heaven  lastly i have attempted to examine into the origin of our society and in many instances wandering without evidence i have been left to probability in conjecture only  it does not now seem material to us what our originals and predecessors were if we occupy ourselves in the true spirit of masonry in that divine spirit which inspired the patriarchs when they erected altars unto the lord if we are true servants to our king faithful and true to our chartered liberties christians in profession and in practice and to each other and mankind in general affectionate and upright  whether masons were originally builders or religious it matters not to us in this age  comparing these works with the righteousness to which i have exhorted you the honor of the antiquity would be swallowed up in the virtues of practice and in the splendour of that light of acceptance which at once proclaims to the world that we are servants of the true god who saves our souls alive  if our ceremonies mean not the matter which i have expressed if they imply not the moral and religious principles which i have endeavored to unveil i ask you masons what they do imply import or indicate  can we presume so many learned and noble personages would for many successive ages have been steady members of this fraternity if the mysteries were unimportant and the ceremonies unintelligible  it cannot be  take away their spirit and they become ridiculous  has it been for ages a maxim of foolish sport to induce men to a silly snare in which the guide having been entrapped into ridicule longs to laugh at another for revenge  it is too ridiculous to be presumed  besides if it was only so the snare might be formed and ornamented with simple things and there was no need to introduce sacred matters into the device  this renders the conjecture so absurd that it will bear no further animadversions  we masons profess that we are pilgrims in progression from the east  the almighty planted a garden in the east wherein he placed the perfection of human nature the first man full of innocence and divine knowledge and full of honor even bearing the image of god  learning had its first progression from the east after the flood the egyptians were the first devisers of the zodiac and the first discerners of the wisdom of the great architect of the world in the revolutions of the heavens they were the first projectors of the science of geometry  in regard to the doctrine of our savior and the christian revelation it proceeded from the east  the star which proclaimed the birth of the son of god appeared in the east  the east was an expression used by the prophets to denote the redeemer  from thence it may well be conceived that we should profess our progress to be from thence if we profess by being masons that we are a society of the servants of that divinity whose abode is with the father coeternal in the center of the heavens  but if we profess no such matter then why should not we have alleged our progress to have been from the north and the regions of chaos and darkness  but i will now my brethren forbear all further argument and close the labors of my year with a sincere exhortation that you will continue to act in this society as upright and religious men  that you will exert yourselves in the promotion of its honor  and let the wicked and ignorant revile never so maliciously be strenuous in your duties as masons and as brethren  exercise your benevolence with openness of heart and your charity with cordiality and not as hypocrites  with attention endeavor to arrive at the utmost knowledge of your profession the end of which i presume to proclaim to you is to work out the works of righteousness  the end appendix a letter from the learned mr john lock to the right hon thomas earl of pembroke with an old manuscript on the subject of freemasonry my lord  th may      i have at length by the help of mr collins procured a copy of that m s in the bodleian library which you were so curious to see and in obedience to your lordships commands i herewith send it to you most of the notes annexed to it are what i made yesterday for the reading of my lady masham who is become so fond of masonry as to say that she now more than ever wishes herself a man that she might be capable of admission into the fraternity  the m s of which this is a copy appears to be about   0 years old yet as your lordship will observe by the title it is itself a copy of one yet more ancient by about  00 years for the original is said to have been the handwriting of k henry vi where that prince had it is at present an uncertainty but it seems to me to be an examination taken perhaps before the king of some one of the brotherhood of masons among whom he entered himself as it is said when he came out of his minority and thenceforth put a stop to a persecution that had been raised against them but i must not detain your lordship longer by my preface from the thing itself  i know not what effect the sight of this old the paper alluded to by mr lock is the immediately following one paper may have upon your lordship but for my own part i cannot deny that it has so much raised my curiosity as to induce me to enter myself into the fraternity which i am determined to do if i may be admitted the next time i

leylande was appointed by henry viii at the dissolution of monasteries to search for and save such books and records as were valuable among them he was a man of great labor and industry    his highness meaning the said king henry viii our kings had not then the title of majesty    what mote ytt be that is what may this mystery of masonry be the answer imports that it consists in natural mathematical and mechanical knowledge some part of which as appears by what follows the masons pretend to have taught the rest of mankind and some part they still conceal      first men in the este etc it should seem by this that masons believe there were men in the east before adam who is called the ffyrste manne of the weste and that arts and sciences began in the east some authors of great note for learning have been of the same opinion and it is certain that europe and africa which in respect to asia may be called western countries were wild and savage long after arts and politeness of manners were in great perfection in china and the indies    the venetians etc in the times of monkish ignorance it is no wonder that the phenicians should be mistaken for the venetians or perhaps if the people were not taken one for the other similitude of sound might deceive the clerk who first took down the examination the phenicians were the greatest voyagers among the ancients and were in europe thought to be the inventors of letters which perhaps they brought from the east with other arts    peter gower this must be another mistake of the writer i was puzzled at first to guess who peter gower should be the name being perfectly english or how a greek should come by such a name but as soon as i thought of pythagoras i could scarce forbear smiling to find that philosopher had undergone a metempsycosis he never dreamt of we need only consider the french pronunciation of his name pythagore that is petagore to conceive how easily such a mistake might be made by an unlearned clerk that pythagoras traveled for knowledge into egypt etc is known to all the learned and that he was initiated into several different orders of priests who in those days kept all their learning secret from the vulgar is as well known pythagoras also made every geometrical theorem a secret and admitted only such to the knowledge of them as had first undergone a five years silence he is supposed to be the inventor of the   th proposition of the first book of euclid for which in the joy of his heart it is said he sacrificed a hecatomb he also knew the true system of the world lately revived by copernicus and was certainly a most wonderful man see his life by dion hal    grecia magna a part of italy formerly so called in which the greeks had settled a large colony    wyseacre this word at present signifies simpleton but formerly had a quite contrary meaning weisager in the old saxon is philosopher wiseman or wizard and having been frequently used ironically at length came to have a direct meaning in the ironical sense thus duns scotus a man famed for the subtilty and acuteness of his understanding has by the same method of irony given a general name to modern dunces   0 groton groton is the name of a place in england the place here meant is crotona a city of grecia magna which in the time of pythagoras was very populous     first made the word made i suppose has a particular meaning among the masons perhaps it signifies initiated     maconnes haueth communycatedde etc this paragraph has something remarkable in it it contains a justification of the secrecy so much boasted of by masons and so much blamed by others asserting that they have in all ages discovered such things as might be useful and that they conceal such only as would be hurtful either to the world or themselves what these secrets are we see afterward     the arts agricultura etc it seems a bold pretense this of the masons that they have taught mankind all these arts they have their own authority for it and i know not how we shall disprove them but what appears most odd is that they reckon religion among the arts     art of ffyndinge neue arts the art of inventing arts must certainly be a most useful art my lord bacons novum organum is an attempt toward somewhat of the same kind but i much doubt that if ever the masons had it they have now lost it since so few new arts have been lately invented and so many are wanted the idea i have of such an art is that it must be something proper to be applied in all the sciences generally as algebra is in numbers by the help of which new rules of arithmetic are and may be found     preise it seems the masons have great regard to the reputation as well as the profit of their order since they make it one reason for not divulging an art in common that it may do honor to the possessors of it i think in this particular they show too much regard for their own society and too little for the rest of mankind     art of keepyng secrettes what kind of an art this is i can by no means imagine but certainly such an art the masons must have for though as some people suppose they should have no secret at all even that must be a secret which being discovered would expose them to the highest ridicule and therefore it requires the utmost caution to conceal it     art of chaunges i know not what this means unless it be the transmutation of metals     facultye of abrac here i am utterly in the dark     universelle longage of maconnes an universal language has been much desired by the learned of many ages it is a thing rather to be wished than hoped for but it seems the masons pretend to have such a thing among them if it be true i guess it must be something like the language of the pantomimes among the ancient romans who are said to be able by signs only to express and deliver any oration intelligibly to men of all nations and languages a man who has all these arts and advantages is certainly in a condition to be envied but we are told that this is not the case with all masons for though these arts are among them and all have a right and an opportunity to know them yet some want capacity and others industry to acquire them however of all their arts and secrets that which i most desire to know is the skylle of becommynge good and parfyghte and i wish it were communicated to all mankind since there is nothing more true than the beautiful sentence contained in the last answer that the better men are the more they love one another virtue having in itself something so amiable as to charm the hearts of all that behold it  a glossary to explain the old words in the foregoing manuscript allein only alweys always beithe both commodytye convenience confrerie fraternity faconnynge forming
