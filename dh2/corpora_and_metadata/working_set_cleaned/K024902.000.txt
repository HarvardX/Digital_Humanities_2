an account of the success of inoculating the smallpox in a letter to dr william whitaker  by tho nettleton m d  london printed by s palmer for j batley at the dove in paternoster row        price   d  advertisement all persons concerned in the practice of inoculating the smallpox are desired to keep a register of the name age and habitation of every person inoculated the manner of the operation the days of sickening and of the eruption the sort of smallpox that is produced and the event  where the true smallpox is not produced by inoculation it will be of use to take particular notice whether the patient had any other kind of eruption what symptoms preceded or attended it whether the incisions inflamed and run and for what time their running continued  in case any person shall happen to die after inoculation either in the course of the smallpox or after they are gone off it is desired that a particular relation of the case may be made and attested if it be judged necessary by the nearest relations of the party deceased or by other credible persons that were witnesses to the fact  they are entreated to send these accounts or an extract from them comprehending all persons inoculated from the beginning to the end of the years      and      to dr scheuchzer m d and f r s at sir hans sloanes bart in great russel street by bloomsburysquare some time in january or at farthest in february next that so the result of them may be published early in the spring  nov        sir having too often found with no small grief and trouble how little the assistance of art can avail in many cases of the smallpox i was induced to try the method of incision or inoculation which came so well recommended by several physicians from turkey and which had also been lately practiced at london this i thought was sufficient to justify the attempt and what success it has met with i have here sent according to your desire a faithful account of and of every thing that has been done or observed here relating to that affair that might be worth your notice  it was in december last that i first began to put this method in practice and finding it to succeed beyond my expectation in the first instance i was encouraged to repeat it upon some others and afterward several seeing with how much ease these got through the distemper were desirous to have the same done to themselves or to their children so that there are now upwards of forty here who have received the smallpox by inoculation who are all through gods blessing in very good health  what was done by way of preparation was chiefly purging with rhubarb for children and sometimes vomiting very rarely bleeding though that may be sometimes necessary and many have had no preparation at all but i always found as far as i was able to judge that those whose bodies were prepared especially by vomiting had more favorable symptoms than others in the same circumstances where that was omitted  the method which i always took in the operation was to make two incisions one in the arm and another in the opposite leg i believe it is not very material whether the incisions be large or small but i commonly found that when they were made pretty large in grown persons of an inch in length proportionably less in children and so deep as to cut through the skin in the middle of the incision the quantity of matter discharged afterward at those places was greater and the more plentiful that discharge the more easy the rest of the symptoms generally are and they are also by this means the best secured from any ill consequence afterward  at first i collected some of the matter from the pustules of one who had the smallpox of the natural sort into a shell or a viol and infused two or three drops of it into the wound but finding it sometimes to be very troublesome and difficult to get any quantity of the matter and observing also that the least imaginable will be sufficient for the purpose i generally take small pledgetts of cotton and ripping the pustules when they are ripe with the point of a lancet roll the pledgetts over them till they have imbibed some of the moisture i put one of these upon each wound covering them with any common plaster till the next day when i commonly take away both the cotton and the plaster leaving the wound to itself only covering it with a slight linen roller to defend it from the air i have sometimes rubbed the pledgett only once over the wound without binding it on which i found to answer the end as well and from some other observations i have made i have been surpised to see the smallpox produced this way when i was very well assured the quantity of matter received into the vessels could not amount to the hundredth part of a grain  the persons inoculated have not been confined to any regimen only to keep themselves moderately warm and those who were grown up to live very temperate and regular to keep their minds easy and composed and to use proper means to drive away all fear and concern some have been obliged from the time of the inoculation to abstain from flesh and all strong liquors but i found afterward that the eruption did not proceed so well when they were obliged to live too low perhaps in warmer climates where they are not so much accustomed to live upon flesh such abstinence may be necessary but here i find it best to let them cat and drink as usual though something more sparingly till the fever begins to rise and then but not before we enjoin such a regimen as is usual in like cases  the first thing that occurred after the incision was the inflammation of the wounds which commonly happened about the fourth day when they began to appear very red round about and to grow a little sore and painful in about two days more they began to digest and run in some they begin to run sooner and the quantity discharged is much greater than in others i generally found that in those who discharged most this way the fever was more slight and the smallpox fewer though i have known some do very well when these places have only appeared very red but have not run at all as it usually happens when the incision is made so superficial as not to cut through the skin  about the seventh day the symptoms of the fever begin to come on which are the very same that we always observe in the smallpox of the distinct kind in the natural way a quick pulse great heat and thirst pain in the head and back and about the region of the stomach vomiting dosedness startings and sometimes convulsions all were not seized with these symptoms nor in the same degree or continuance some began on the seventh day and continued ill without any remission till after the eleventh many not till the eighth or ninth day and the fever in these was more moderate with great intermissions but some have scarce had any illness at all during all this time the places of incision continued to be very sore and swell very much so as to appear large and deep and to discharge a great deal of matter  on the tenth day the smallpox most commonly did appear sometimes on the ninth and sometimes not till the eleventh but i never found that any difference of age constitution or any other cause ever made them vary above one day from the tenth the number was very different in some not above ten or twenty most frequently from fifty to two hundred and some had more than could well be numbered but never of the confluent sort their appearance was the same with those of the distinct kind they commonly come out very round and florid and many times rise as large as any i have observed of the natural sort going off with a yellow crust or scab as usual though it sometimes happens especially when the sores discharge a very great quantity of matter that they are both few in number and do not rise to any bulk but having made their appearance for four or five days they waste insensibly away  after the smallpox comes out the feverish symptoms gradually abate and when the eruption is completed they usually cease without any second fever or any farther trouble in any respect  while the pustules were rising and for some time after they were gone the sores continued to swell and to run very much the longer they did so the better but they never failed to heal up without any trouble after a certain time  i very rarely saw occasion for any medicines in the course of the distemper only sometimes when the symptoms run very high i gave a gentle anodyne to be repeated as occasion should require and once or twice i thought it necessary to blister after the smallpox is gone they have always been purged twice or thrice and sometimes let blood which is all that has been usually done  it has happened in one instance or two that the symptoms in the distemper have been worse than usual and some few after the smallpox were gone off have been subject to other indispositions of all which i shall give you a particular account  the first that was inoculated tho thorps son of hallifax a boy about a year and half old began to be ill on the eighth day and had a brisk fever for about two days when the pustules began to appear they were but few in number and rose very large the child was soon well and continued so for about three weeks when being carried out and kept a long time in the cold he fell into a feverish disorder accompanied with a cough and was ill for four or five days after that time it went off and he has ever since been in very good health  the second was a girl of two years old jer turners daughter in a family where they had formerly buried their children successively of the smallpox and this they feared might undergo the same fate the fever came on about the seventh day and she continued very ill till the tenth on which day about noon she had a strong convulsive fit toward evening the pustules appeared and the child grew better and though she had more in number than usual yet she grew well as soon as they were fully come out and has continued so ever since  the eighth and ninth were in a family where they had four children none of whom had had the smallpox mr john sympsons children i was called to the eldest who was seized in the common way with the most malignant sort i ever saw attended with the worst symptoms that could be so that he died on the fourth day all full of purple and livid spots the parents were very desirous that any means might be used to preserve the rest but here i was in great doubt and perplexity what part to act i knew very well that if i should venture to make the incision whatever should happen would be charged upon that and it was not improbable but some of them might have already taken the infection in which case it was very uncertain what the event might be on the other hand if it was omitted i thought it probable they might all dye the contagion which was got amongst em being of such a destructive nature wherefore i was willing to run the risque of my reputation rather than that the children should all perish they were therefore all three inoculated the day before the eldest died after having told the parents that i could not answer for the consequence in case they had already caught the infection which would be known if any of them fell ill before the seventh day according as we feared one of them began on the second day much after the same manner with the eldest and the smallpox came out on the third day or rather an universal redness all over the skin interspersed with many purple spots there were none of these spots near the places of incision which began to swell a little as usual about the fourth day and the smallpox did rise a little more about those places than elsewhere but nature was too much oppressed with the violence of the distemper and though she continued longer than her brother and was not delirious as he was yet she dyed on the seventh day i did not reckon this child in the number of those who received the smallpox by inoculation for i thought there was sufficient reason to conclude that she had taken the infection before but of this we must leave all persons to judge as they please i only give you a relation of facts the other two continued well till the eighth day when they both fell ill together the smallpox came out on the tenth of a very good sort though more in number than some others had and they both got very easily through the distemper without any indisposition since it was observable that the elder of these children two days before the eruption had many red spots which appeared upon him very much like those of the other two children which changed in them to purples afterward which the mother was very much concerned at fearing they would prove the same in this but when the smallpox came out these spots grew gradually less and at last quite disappeared the other child had been very subject to convulsions for a long time when young and it was afflicted with the same very much from the time that the fever came on till the smallpox appeared  the twenty seventh was a married gentlewoman aged about twenty six who got very well through the distemper but about a week after was seized with a very great coldness and shivering which were followed by a burningheat with a violent pain and disorder in her head which continued for several hours she had about two years ago an intermitting fever which i took this to be a paroxism of and expected its return but she felt no more of it and has ever since continued in good health  of her two sons who were both inoculated about the same time the younger got through the distemper with a great deal of ease the smallpox being few and the symptoms very slight but the elder a boy about five years old fared quite otherwise the symptoms before the eruption were more than usually severe especially the vomitting the pustules appeared at the usual time but more numerous than ordinary and when the eruption was finished the fever did not cease as it has done in every instance but this on the fifth day after he was seized the swelling of his face began which was followed by a pain and swelling in his throat and a salivation which continuing till the cleventh day were succeeded by a swelling in his hands and feet the usual symptoms of the distinct sort when they are very full and though there appeared some little signs of malignity yet he got through the distemper without any danger but with much more pain and trouble than any of the rest have endured after the smallpox were gone off we found a hard swelling upon his shoulder which disabled him for some time from moving his arm but by the use of some common applications that is in a great measure gone in this family the only child they had before these dyed of the smallpox of a very malignant sort and this boy was of an ill habit of body and has had many dangerous illnesses  the twenty third was a girl about nine months old mr is hansoos daughter in this child about a fortnight after she was well of the smallpox the mother discovered that one of her thighs was a little swelled which was painful to her for some time and made her unwilling to move that part some of the inguinal glands were also swelled but these went off in a few days there only remaining a hardness above the knee which also disappeared in a short time without coming to suppuration  the thirty seventh was a girl mr jo haighs daughter six years of age she got very easily through the distemper but before the smallpox were gone we found a small tumor upon the muscles of the loins which ripened very speedily and was opened and healed up in a very short time her sister a young woman about eighteen had also a swelling of the same kind in her leg but it lay something deeper and gave her a great deal of pain for three or four days afterward it dischard a great quantity of matter and was healed without any farther trouble  all the rest excepting these i have mentioned got very well through the distemper without any manner of trouble or hazard or any ill consequence afterward whether those slight indispositions which some have been subject to afterward were owing to the incision i have not been able to judge but i presume what they have endured in the course of the distemper and what has followed after is not to be put in the balance with what is undergone in the common way by those who are thought to come off very well and if this method were more generally practiced it is probable some means would be found out to prevent even these subsequent disorders which are no more frequent nor near so bad as those which follow the natural sort  in two instances the inoculation had no effect the reaof which in michacel blands daughter one was because the child had the smallpox before in the wm clarks son other the matter was taken whenthe pustules were withered and almost gone and that little moisture which they contained i suppose had lost its virtue the boy to whom it was made use of was no way affected the places of incision did not at all inflame and swell as usual nor did any pustules appear but about a fortnight after he was seized with the distemper in the common way and did very well  some of those who have been inoculated that are grown up have afterward attended others in the smallpox and it has often happened that in families where some children have been inoculated others have been afterward seized in the common way and they have laid together in the same bed all the time but we never found that ever any had the distemper twice neither is there any reason to suppose it possible there being no difference that can be observed betwixt the natural and the artificial sort if we may be allowed to call them so but only that the latter have commonly fewer there is one observation which i have made though i would not yet lay any creat stress upon it that in families where any have been inoculated those who were afterward seized never had an ill sort of smallpox but always recovered very well  thus sir i have given you a short and plain account of what has occurred to me concerning this method of inoculation it is not any pains or care i have taken in writing this letter will make it acceptable to you for i am sensible it is deficient in every respect but a faithful history of matters of fact i could have inoculated a much greater number than i have done if i would have pressed it but i only took such as desired it of themselves being cautious of persuading any body to it because i had no authority hereabouts to support me i know not whether i shall have an opportunity of doing much more this way at present the smallpox being in a great measure gone from this town and country but i have already seen so much of it that i should never be afraid of its success  there is only one thing more which i am obliged to mention and which i would rather have passed over in silence and that is the vigorous opposition it has met with from many honest wellmeaning persons who cannot but fancy it is an unlawful and unwarrantable practice they have gained a great majority on their side here as well as in other places where it has been practiced i only wish that as they act upon a principle of conscience they would have been less busy in raising and spreading false and groundless reports whereby this matter has been much misrepresented and many entertaining a wrong notion of it have been deterred from making use of this method for themselves or their children who have since unhappily been taken off by the smallpox but when this affair it set in a true light and found to be always safe and effectual i believe all the objections raised against it will fall of course it would be of the greatest moment that the world should know more fully what you think of it in town and how you have found it to succeed it is commonly objected here that it is not approved of in london but if those gentlemen who have justly gained the greatest honor and reputation in our profession should by finding it successful see cause to declare publicly in its favor that would be the greatest means to forward it in the country and soon reconcile people to a method which i believe has no where been put in practice with any other aim than to do some service to mankind for which reason i doubt not but these lines though writ in haste will be acceptable to you from  sir your sincere friend and humble servant tho nettleton hallifax apr
