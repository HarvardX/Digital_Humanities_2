york mr yates dr yarborough principal of brazen nose college oxford poems the authors apology my works are advertised for sale and censures fly as thick as hail while my poor scheme of publication supplies the dearth of conversation what will the world say  that is your cry who is this world and what am i once but thank heaven those days are over and persecution reigns no more one man one hardy man alone usurped the critics vacant throne and thence with neither taste or wit by powerful catcall from the pit knocked sarce and play and actor down who passed the sentence then  the town so now each upstart puny elf talks of the world and means himself yet in the circle there are those who hurt even more than open foes whose friendship serves the talking turn just simmers to a kind concern and with a wondrous soft expression expatiates upon indiscretion flies from the poems to the man and gratifies the favorite plan to pull down others reputation and build their own on that foundation the scholar grave of taste discerning who lives on credit for his learning and has no better claim to wit than carping at what others writ with pitying kindness friendly fear whispers conjectures in your ear i am sorry  and he is much to blame  he might have published  but his name the thing might please a few no doubt as handed privately about  it might amuse a friend or two some partial friend like me or you but when it comes to press and print you will find i fear but little in it he stands upon a dangerous brink who totters over the sea of ink where reputation runs aground the author cast away and drowned and then  twas wilful and absurd so well approved so well preferred abruptly thus a place to quit a place which most his genius hit the theater for latin wit with critics round him chaste and terse to give a plaudit to his verse latin i grant shows college breeding and some schoolcommonplace of reading but has in moderns small pretension to real wit or strong invention the excellence you critics praise hangs on a curious choice of phrase which picked and chosen here and there from prose or verse no matter where jumbled together in a dish like spanish olio fowl flesh fish you set the classic hodgepodge on for pedant wits to feed upon your woudbe genii vainly seek fame from their latin verse or greek who would for that be most admired which blockheads may and have acquired a mere mechanical connection of favorite words  a bare collection of phrases  where the labored cento presents you with a dull memento how virgil horace ovid join and club together half a line these only strain their motley wits in gathering patches shreds and bits to wrap their barren fancies in and make a classic harlequin  were i at once empowered to show my utmost vengeance on my foe to punish with extremest rigor i could inflict no penance bigger than using him as learnings tool to make him usher of a school for not to dwell upon the toil of working on a barren soil and laboring with incessant pains to cultivate a blockheads brains the duties there but ill befit the love of letters arts or wit for whosoeer though slightly sips their grateful flavor with his lips will find it leave a smatch behind shall sink so deeply in the mind it never thence can be erasd  but rising up you call it taste twere foolish for a drudge to choose a gusto which he cannot use better discard the idle whim what is he to taste or taste to him for me it hurts me to the soul to brook confinement or control still to be pinioned down to teach the syntax and the parts of speech or what perhaps is drudging worse the links and joints and rules of verse to deal out authors by retail like penny pots of oxford ale  oh it is a service irksome more than tugging at the slavish oar yet such his task a dismal truth who watches over the bent of youth and while a paltry stipend earning he sows the richest seeds of learning and tills their minds with proper care and sees them their due produce bear no joys alas his toil beguile his own lies fallow all the while yet still he is in the road you say of learning  why perhaps he may but turns like horses in a mill nor getting on nor standing still for little way his learning reaches who reads no more than what he teaches yet you can send adventurous youth in search of letters taste and truth who ride the highway road to knowledge through the plain turnpikes of a college true  like wayposts we serve to show the road which travelers should go who jog along in easy pace secure of coming to the place yet find return whenever they will the post and its direction still which stands an useful unthankd guide to many a passenger beside it is hard to carve for others meat and not have time ones self to eat though be it always understood our appetites are full as good but there have been and proofs appear who bore this load from year to year whose claim to letters parts and wit the world has never disputed yet whether the flowing mirth prevail in wesleys song or humorous tale or happier bournes expression please with graceful turns of classic ease or oxfords wellread poet sings pathetic to the ear of kings these have indulged the muses flight nor lost their time or credit by it nor suffered fancys dreams to prey on the due business of the day verse was to them a recreation used but by way of relaxation your instances are fair and true and genius i respect with you i envy none their honest praise i seek to blast no scholars bays still let the graceful foliage spread its greenest honors round their head blessed if the muses hand entwine a sprig at least to circle mine come  i admit you tax me right prudence it is true was out of sight and you may whisper all you meet the man was vague and indiscreet yet tell me while you censure me are you from error found and free say does your breast no bias hide whose influence draws the mind aside all have their hobbyhorse you see from tristram down to you and me ambition splendor may be thine ease indolence perhaps are mine though prudence and our natures pride may wish our weaknesses to hide and set their hedges up before em some sprouts will branch and straggle over em strive fight against her how you will nature will be the mistress still and though you curb with double rein she will run away with us again but let a man of parts be wrong it is triumph to the leaden throng the fools shall cackle out reproof the very ass shall raise his hoof and he who holds in his possession the single virtue of discretion who knows no overflow of spirit whose want of passions is his merit whom wit and taste and judgment flies shall shake his noddle and seem wise part of homers hymn to apollo translated from the greek god of the bow apollo thee i sing thee as thou drawst amain the sounding string the immortal powers revere with homage low and every godhead trembles at thy bow all but latona she with mighty jove eyes thee with all a tender parents love closes thy quiver thy tough bow unbends and high amid the ethereal dome suspends then smiling leads thee her allglorious son to share the mighty thunderers awful throne goblets of nectar thy glad fire prepares and thee his fairest noblest son declares while every god sits rapt latonas breast beats with superior joy and hails her son confessed thrice blessed latona from thee goddess sprung diana chaste and phoebus everyoung delos and ortygia are mentioned as different islands in the original her in ortygias isle and him you bore at cynthius hill on delos seagirt shore where the tall palm uprears its lovely head and clear inopus laves the slowry mead o phoebus where shall i begin thy praise well can thou rule the poets artless lays often on the craggy rock or mountain hoar by riverside or on the seas hoarse shore wandering wellpleased with musics magic sound and airs divine thou charmst the region round say shall i sing how first on delos shore thee glorious progeny latona bore here several verses containing nothing but a mere list of the names of islands are omitted  how first from other isles beset with grief in vain thy tortured mother sought relief each to her outcast woe denied abode nor durst one isle receive the future god at length to delos came the laboring fair and suppliant thus besought her needful care delos receive apollo and o raise a glorious temple to record his praise then shall he govern thee with gentle sway and only phoebus shall thine isle obey what though no flocks nor herds nor juicy vine nor plants of thousand natures shall be thine swift to the temple of the bowyerking bowyerking and bowyergod are expressions frequently used by dryden in his version of the first iliad to signify apollo  oblations rich shall every nation bring for ever from thy altars shall arise the fragrant incense of burntsacrifice no longer then regret thy barren soil receive the god and live by others toil she spoke with inward rapture delos smiled and soothed the suppliant power with answer mild latona mighty caeus daughter fair full willingly would delos ease thy care full willingly behold her barren earth witness the glories of apollos birth the mighty god would raise my lowly name and consecrate his native isle to fame one fear alone distracts my beating heart that fear o goddess list while i impart second to none amid the ethereal skies apollo soon all terrible shall rise all nations shall adore the mighty god and kings and kingdoms tremble at his nod happily for ah dire fears my soul infest and fill with horror my tumultuous breast soon as the glorious godhead shall be born my desert region will he view with scorn indignant spurn me curse my barren soil and plunge into the waves my hated isle triumphant then to happier climes remove there fix his shrine plant there his sacred grove whelmed in the briny main shall delos lay to all the finny brood a wretched prey but o latona if to quell my fear you will deign a solemn sacred oath to swear that here the god his glorious seat shall hold and here his sapient oracles unfold your sacred burden here latona lay here view the godhead bursting into day thus delos prayed nor was her prayer denied but soon with solemn vows thus ratified witness o heaven and earth o stygian lake dire adjuration that no god may break in delos shall apollos shrine be reared delos his best beloved most honored most revered thus vowed latona delos hailed her earth blessed in the glories of apollos birth nine hapless days and nights with writhing throes and all the anguish of a mothers woes latona tortured lay in sorrowing mood around her many a sistergoddess stood alost in heaven imperial juno sat and viewed relentless her unhappy fate lucina too the kind assuaging power that tends the laboring mothers childbed hour and mitigates her woes in golden clouds high on olympus top the goddess shrouds her large full eyes with indignation roll and livid envy seized her haughty soul that from latonas loins was doomed to spring so great a son the mighty bowyerking the milder powers that near the laboring fair viewed all her pangs with unavailing care fair iris sent the many colored maid to gain with goodly gifts lucinas aid but charged her heed lest juno should prevent with prohibition dire their kind intent fleet as the winged winds the flying fair with nimble pinion cut the liquid air olympus gained apart she called the maid then sought with many a prayer her needful aid and moved her soul when soon with dovelike pace swiftly they measured back the viewless airy space soon as to delos isle lucina came the pangs of travail seized latonas frame her twining arms she threw the palm around and pressed with deepindented knee the ground then into day sprung forth the jolly boy earth smiled beneath and heaven rang with joy the sister powers that round latona stood with chaste ablutions cleansd the infantgod his lovely limbs in mantle white they bound and gently drew a golden swathe around he hung not helpless at his mothers breast but themis fed him with an heavenly feast pleased while latona views the heavenly boy and fondly glows with all a mothers joy the lusty babe strong with ambrosial food in vain their bonds or golden swathes withstood bonds swathes and ligaments with ease he broke and thus the wondering deities bespoke the lyre and sounding bow and to declare the thundrers counsels be apollos care he spoke and onwards all majestic strode the queens of heaven awestruck viewed the god delos beheld him with a tender smile and hailed enriched with gold her happy isle her happy isle apollos native seat his sacred haunt his bestbelovd retreat graced with apollo delos glorious shines as the tall mountain crowned with stately pines now stony cynthus would the god ascend and now his course to various islands bend full many a fane and rock and shady grove river and mountain did apollo love but chiefly delos the ionians there with their chaste wives and prattling babes repair there gladly celebrate apollos name with many a solemn rite and sacred game the jolly dance and holy hymn prepare and with the caestus urge the manly war if when their sacred feast the ionians hold their gallant sports a stranger should behold view the strong nerves the brawny chiefs that brace or eye the softer charms of female grace then mark their riches of a thousand kinds and their tall ships born swift before the winds so goodly to the sight would all appear the fair assembly gods he would declare there too the delian virgins beauteous choir apollos handmaids wake the living lyre to phoebus first they consecrate the lays latona then and chaste diana praise then heroes old and matrons chaste rehearse and sooth the raptured heart with sacred verse each voice the delian maids each human sound with aptest imitation sweet resound their tongues so justly tune with accents new that none the false distinguish from the true latona phoebus dian lovely fair blessed delian nymphs apollos chiefest care all hail and o with praise your poet crown nor all his labors in oblivion drown if happily some poor pilgrim shall enquire o virgins who most skilful smites the lyre whose lofty verse in sweetest descant rolls and charms to ecstasy the hearers souls o answer a blind bard in chios dwells in all the arts of verse who far excells then over the earth shall spread my glorious fame and distant nations shall record my name but phoebus never will i cease to sing latonas noble son the mighty bowyerking thee lycia and maeonia thee great power the blessed miletus habitants adore but thy loved haunt is seagirt delos shore now pythos stony soil apollo treads and all around ambrosial fragrance sheds then strikes with matchless art the golden strings and every hill with heavenly music rings olympus now and the divine abodes glorious he seeks and mixes with the gods each heavenly bosom pants with fond desire to hear the lofty verse and golden lyre drawn by the magic sound the virginnine with warblings sweet the sacred minstrel join now with glad heart loud voice and jocund lays full sweetly carol bounteous heavens praise and now in dirges sad and numbers slow relate the piteous tale of human woe woe by the gods on wretched mortals cast who vainly shun afflictions wintry blast and all in vain attempt with fond delay deaths certain shaft to ward or chase old age away the graces there and smiling hours are seen and cytherea laughterloving queen and harmony and hebe lovely band to sprightliest measures dancing hand in hand there of no common port or vulgar mien with heavenly radiance shines the huntressqueen warbles responsive to the golden lyre tunes her glad notes and joins the virgin choir there mars and mercury with awkward play and uncouth gambols waste the livelong day there as apollo moves with graceful pace a thousand glories play around his face in splendour dressed he joins the festive band and sweeps the golden lyre with magic hand mean while latona and imperial jove eye the bright godhead with parental love and as the deities around him play well pleased his goodly mien and awful port survey the translator when he begun this piece had some thoughts of giving a complete english version of all homers hymns being the only parts of his works never yet translated but to say nothing of his opinion of this specimen of his translation fearing that this species of poetry though it has its beauties and does not want admirers among the learned would appear far less agreeable to the mere english reader he desisted they who would form the justest idea of this sort of composition among the ancients may be better informed by perusing dr akensides most classical hymn to the naiads than from any translation of homer or callimachus  to     about to publish a volume of miscellanies written in the year      since now all scruples cast away your works are rising into day forgive though i presume to send this honest counsel of a friend let not your verse as verse now goes be a strange kind of measured prose nor let your prose which sure is worse want naught but measure to be verse write from your own imagination nor curb your muse by imitation for copies show however expressed a barren genius at the best  but imitations all the mode  yet where one hits ten miss the road the mimic bard with pleasure sees mat priors unaffected ease assumes his style affects a story sets every circumstance before ye the day the hour the name the dwelling and mars a curious tale in telling observes how easy prior flows then runs his numbers down to prose others have sought the filthy stews to find a dirty slipshod muse their groping genius while it rakes the bogs the commonfewrs and jakes ordure and filth in rhyme exposes disgustful to our eyes and noses with many a dash  that must offend us and much                             hiatus non deflendus o swift how would thou blush to see such are the bards who copy thee this milton for his plan will choose wherein resembling miltons muse milton like thunder rolls along in all the majesty of song while his low mimics meanly creep not quite awake nor quite asleep or if their thunder chance to roll it is thunder of the mustard bowl the stiff expression phrases strange the epithets preposterous change forced numbers rough and unpolite such as the judging ear affright stop in mid verse ye mimics vile is it thus ye copy miltons style his faults religiously you trace but borrow not a single grace how few say whence can it proceed who copy milton ever succeed but all their labors are in vain and wherefore so  the reasons plain take it for granted it is by those miltons the model mostly chose who cannot write verse and will not write prose others who aim at fancy choose to woo the gentle spensers muse this poet fixes for his theme an allegory or a dream fiction and truth together joins through a long waste of flimsy lines fondly believes his fancy glows and image upon image grows thinks his strong muse takes wondrous flights whenever she sings of peerless wights of dens of palfreys spells and knights till allegory spensers veil to instruct and please in moral tale with hims no veil the truth to shroud but one impenetrable cloud others more daring fix their hope on rivaling the fame of pope satyrs the word against the times  these catch the cadence of his rhymes and borne from earth by popes strong wings their muse aspires and boldly flings her dirt up in the face of kings in these the spleen of pope we find but where the greatness of his mind his numbers are their whole pretense mere strangers to his manly sense some few the savrites of the muse whom with her kindest eye she views round whom apollos brightest rays shine forth with undiminishd blaze some few my friend have sweetly trod in imitations dangerous road long as tobaccos mild perfume shall scent each happy curates room often as in elbowchair he smokes and quaffs his ale and cracks his jokes so long o isaac hawkins brown esquire author of a piece called the pipe of tobacco a most excellent imitation of six different authors brown shall last thy praise crowned with tobaccoleaf for bays and whosoeer thy verse shall see shall fill another pipe to thee epistle to j b esquire      again i urge my old objection that modern rules obstruct perfection and the severity of taste has laid the walk of genius waste fancys a flight we deal no more in our authors creep instead of soaring and all the brave imagination is dwindled into declamation but still you cry in sober sadness there is discretion even in madness a pithy sentence which wants credit because i find a poet said it their verdict makes but small impression who are known liars by profession rise what exalted flights it will true genius will be genius still and say that horse would you prefer which wants a bridle or a spur the mettled steed may lose his tricks the jade grows callous to your kicks had shakespeare crept by modern rules wed lost his witches fairies fools instead of all that wild creation he would formed a regular plantation a garden trim and all enclosed in nicest symmetry disposed the hedges cut in proper order nor even a branch beyond the border now like a forest he appears the growth of twice three hundred years where many a tree aspiring shrouds its airy summit in the clouds while round its root still love to twine the ivy or wild eglantine but shakespeares allcreative fancy made others love extravagancy while cloudcapt nonsense was their aim like hurlothrumbos mad lord flame true  who can stop dull imitators those younger brothers of translators those insects which from genius rise and buzz about in swarms like flies fashion that sets the modes of dress sheds too her influence over the press as formerly the sons of rhyme sought shakespeares fancy and sublime by cool correctness now they hope to emulate the praise of pope but pope and shakespeare both disclaim these low retainers to their fame what task can dullness ever affect so easy as to write correct poets it is said are sure to split by too much or too little wit so to avoid the extremes of either they miss their mark and follow neither they so exactly poise the scale that neither measure will prevail and mediocrity the muse did never in her sons excuse it is true their tawdry works are graced with all the charms of modern taste and every senseless line is dressed in quaint expressions tinsel vest say did you never chance to meet a monsieurbarber in the street whose ruffle as it lank depends and dangles over his fingers ends his olivetand complexion graces with little dabs of dresden laces while for the body monsieur puff would think even dowlas fine enough so fares it with our men of rhymes sweet tinklers of poetic chimes for lace and fringe and tawdry clothes sure never yet were greater beaux but fairly strip them to the shirt they are all made up of rags and dirt and shall these wretches bards commence without or spirit taste or sense and when they bring no other treasure shall i admire them for their measure or do i scorn the critics rules because i will not learn of fools although longinus fullmouthed prose with all the force of genius glows though dionysius learned taste is ever manly just and chaste who like a skilful wise physician diffects each part of composition and shows how beauty strikes the soul from a just compact of the whole though judgment in quintilians page holds forth her lamp for every age yet hypercritics i disdain a race of blockheads dull and vain and laugh at all those empty fools who cramp a genius with dull rules and what their narrow science mocks damn with the name of hetrodox these butchers of a poets fame while they usurp the critics name cry  this is taste  that is my opinion and poets dread their mock dominion so have you seen with dire affright the petty monarch of the night seated aloft in elbow chair command the prisoners to appear harangue an hour on watchmens praise and on the dire effect of frays then cry you will suffer for your daring and d  n you you shall pay for swearing then turning tell the astonished ring i sit to represent the king the hare and tortoise      a fable genius blessed term of meaning wide for sure no term so misapplied how many bear thy sacred name that never felt a real flame proud of the specious appellation thus fools have christened inclination but yet suppose a genius true exempli gratia me or you whatever he tries with due attention rarely escapes his apprehension surmounting every opposition you would swear he learnt by intuition should he rely alone on parts and study therefore but by starts sure of success whenever he tries should he forego the means to rise suppose your watch a graham make gold if you will for value sake its springs within in order due no watch when going goes so true if never wound up with proper care what service is it in the wear some genial spark of phoebus rays perhaps within your bosom plays o how the purer rays aspire if application fans the fire without it genius vainly tries however sometimes it seems to rise nay application will prevail when braggart parts and genius fail and now to lay my proof before ye i here present you with a story in days of yore when time was young when birds conversed as well as sung when use of speech was not confined merely to brutes of human kind a forward hare of swiftness vain the genius of the neighboring plain would often deride the drudging crowd for geniuses are ever proud he would boast his flight twere vain to follow for dog and horse he would beat them hollow nay if he put forth all his strength outstrip his brethren half a length a tortoise heard his vain oration and vented thus his indignation oh puss it bodes thee dire disgrace when i defy thee to the race come it is a match nay no denial i lay my shell upon the trial twas done and done all fair a bet judges prepared and distance set the scampring hare outstript the wind the creeping tortoise laggd behind and scarce had passed a single pole when puss had almost reached the goal friend tortoise quoth the jeering hare your burthens more than you can bear to help your speed it were as well that i should ease you of your shell jog on a little faster prythee i will take a nap and then be with thee so said so done and safely sure for say what conquest more secure whenever he waked that is all that is in it he could overtake him in a minute the tortoise heard his taunting jeer but still resolved to persevere still drawld along as who should say i will win like fabius by delay on to the goal securely crept while puss unknowing soundly slept the bets were won the hare awake when thus the victor tortoise spoke puss though i own thy quicker parts things are not always done by starts you may deride my awkward pace but slow and steady wins

with frost when families get all together and feelingly talk over the weather when  pox on the descriptive rhyme  in short it was the winter time it was a pedlars happy lot to fall into a satyrs cot shivering with cold and almost froze with pearly drop upon his nose his fingers ends all pinched to death he blew upon them with his breath friend quoth the satyr what intends that blowing on thy fingers ends it is to warm them thus i blow for they are froze as cold as snow and so inclement has it been i am like a cake of ice within come quoth the satyr comfort man i will cheer thy inside if i can youre welcome in my homely cottage to a warm fire and mess of pottage this said the satyr nothing loath a bowl prepared of savry broth which with delight the pedlar viewed as smoking on the board it stood but though the very steam arose with grateful odor to his nose one single sip he ventured not the gruel was so wondrous hot what can be done  with gentle puff he blows it till its cool enough why how now pedlar what is the matter still at thy blowing quoth the satyr i blow to cool it cries the clown that i may get the liquor down for though i grant you have made it well you have boiled it fir as hot as hell then raising high his cloven stump the satyr smote him on the rump begone thou double knave or fool with the same breath to warm and cool friendship with such i never hold who are

sophocles his scenes are grown even as familiar as our own no more shall taste presume to speak from its enclosures in the greek but all its fences broken down lie at the mercy of the town critic i

perfection it is but a word ideal that bears about it nothing real for excellence was never hit in the first essays of mans wit shall ancient worth or ancient fame preclude the moderns from their claim must they be blockheads dolts and fools who write not up to grecian rules who tread in buskins or in socks must they be damned as heterodox nor merit of good works prevail except within the classic pale it is stuff that bears the name of knowledge not current half a mile from college where half their lectures yield no more besure i speak of times of yore than just a niggard light to mark how much we all are in the dark as rushlights in a spacious room just burn enough to form a gloom when shakespeare leads the mind a dance from france to england hence to france talk not to me of time and place i own i am happy in the chase whether the dramas here or there it is nature shakespeare every where the poets fancy can create contract enlarge annihilate bring past and present close together in spite of distance seas or weather and shut up in a single action what cost whole years in its transaction so ladies at a play or rout can flirt the universe about whose geographical account is drawn and pictured on the mount yet when they please contract the plan and shut the world up in a fan true genius like armidas wand can raise the spring from barren land while all the art of imitation is pilfring from the first creation transplanting flowers with useless toil which wither in a foreign soil as conscience often sets us right by its interior active light without the assistance of the laws to combat in the moral cause so genius of itself discerning without the mystic rules of learning can from its present intuition strike at the truth of composition yet those who breathe the classic vein enlisted in the mimic train who ride their steed with double bit never run away with by their wit delighted with the pomp of rules the specious pedantry of schools which rules like crutches never became of any use but to the lame pursue the method set before em talk much of order and decorum of probability of fiction of manners ornament and diction and with a jargon of hard names a privilege which dullness claims and merely used by way of fence to keep out plain and common sense extol the wit of ancient days the simple fabric of their plays then from the fable all so chaste tricked up in antientmodern taste so mighty gentle all the while in such a sweet descriptive style while chorus marks the servile mode with fine reflection in an ode present you with a perfect piece formed on the model of old greece come prythee critic set before us the use and office of a chorus what silent why then i will produce its services from ancient use it is to be ever on the stage attendants upon grief or rage to be an arrant gobetween chiefmourner at each dismal scene showing its sorrow or delight by shifting dances left and right not much unlike our modern notions adagio or allegro motions to watch upon the deep distress and plaints of royal wretchedness and when with tears and execration they have poured out all their lamentation and wept whole cataracts from their eyes to call on rivers for supplies and with their hais and he is and hoes to make a symphony of woes doutless the ancients want the art to strike at once upon the heart or why their prologues of a mile in simple  call it  humble style in unimpassiond phrase to say fore the beginning of this play i hapless polydore was found by fishermen or others drowned or i a gentleman did wed the lady i would never bed great agamemnons royal daughter who is coming hither to draw water or need the chorus to reveal reflections which the audience feel and jog them left attention sink to tell them how and what to think oh where is the bard who at one view could look the whole creation through who traversed all the human heart without recourse to grecian art he scorned the modes of imitation of altering pilfering and translation nor painted horror grief or rage from models of a former age the bright original he took and tore the leaf from natures book it is shakespeare thus who stands alone   but why

fathers maid with child and robbed his master to defray the money he had lost at play all means to save him now must fail what can it end in  in a jail however the dame doats over her youth my gossip says the very truth but as his vices love would hide or torture them to virtues side so friendships glass deceives the eye a glass too apt to magnify and makes you think at least you see some spark of genius even in me you say i should get fame i doubt it perhaps i am as well without it for what is the worth of empty praise what poet ever dined on bays for though the laurel rarest wonder may screen us from the stroke of thunder this mind i ever was and am in it is no antidote to famine and poets live on slender fare who like chameleons feed on air and starve to gain an empty breath which only serves them after death grant i succeed like horace rise and strike my head against the skies common experience daily shows that poets have a world of foes and we shall find in every town gossips enough to cry them down who meet in pious conversation to anatomize a reputation with flippant tongue and empty head who talk of things they never read their idle censures i despise their niggard praises will not suffice tempt me no more then to the crime of dabbling in the font of rhyme my muse has answered all her end if her productions please a friend the world is burdened with her store

age to age let players nicely mark them as they will can ever entail hereditary skill if amongst the humble hearers of the pit some curious vetran critic chance to sit is he pleased more because twas acted so by booth and cibber thirty years ago the mind recals an object held more dear and hates the copy that it comes so near why loved we wilkss air booths nervous tone in them twas natural twas all their own a garricks genius must our wonder raise but gives his mimic no reflected praise thrice happy genius whose unrivaled name shall live for ever in the voice of fame it is thine to lead with more than magic skill the train of captive passions at thy will to bid the bursting tear spontaneous flow in the sweet sense of sympathetic woe through every vein i feel a chilness creep when horrors such as thine have murdered sleep and at the old mans look and frantic stare it is lear alarms me for i see him there nor yet confined to tragic walks alone the comic muse too claims thee for her own with each delightful requisite to please taste spirit judgment elegance and ease familiar nature forms thy only rule from rangers rake to druggers vacant fool with powers so pliant and so various blessed that what we see the last we like the best not idly pleased at judgments dear expense but burst outrageous with the laugh of sense perfections top with weary toil and pain it is genius only that can hope to gain the playrs profession though i hate the phrase it is so mechanic in these modern days lies not in trick or attitude or start natures true knowledge is his only art the strongfelt passion bolts into the face the mind untouched what is it but grimace to this one standard make your just appeal here lies the golden secret learn to feel or fool or monarch happy or distressed no actor pleases that is not possessed once on the stage in romes declining days when christians were the subject of their plays ever persecution dropped her iron rod and men still waged an impious war with god an actor flourished of no vulgar fame natures disciple and genest his name a noble object for his skill he chose a martyr dying midst insulting foes resigned with patience to religions laws yet braving monarchs in his saviors cause filled with the idea of the secret part he felt a zeal beyond the reach of art while look and voice and gesture all expressed a kindred ardour in the players breast till as the flame through all his bosom ran he lost the actor and commenced the man professed the faith his pagan gods denied and what he acted then he after died the players province they but vainly try who want these powers deportment voice and eye the critic sight it is only grace can please no figure charms us if it has not ease there are who think the stature all in all nor like the hero if he is not tall the feeling sense all other want supplies i rate no actors merit from his size superior height requires superior grace and what is a giant with a vacant face theatric monarchs in their tragic gait affect to mark the solemn pace of state one foot put forward in position strong the other like its vassal dragged along so grave each motion so exact and slow like wooden monarchs at a puppetshow the mien delights us that has native grace but affectation ill supplies its place unskilful actors like your mimic apes will writhe their bodies in a thousand shapes however foreign from the poets art no tragic hero but admires a start what though unfeeling of the nervous line who but allows his attitude is fine while a whole minute equipoisd he stands till praise dismiss him with her echoing hands resolved though nature hate the tedious pause by perseverance to extort applause when romeo sorrowing at his juliets doom with eager madness bursts the canvas tomb the sudden whirl stretched leg and listed staff which please the vulgar make the critic laugh to paint the passions force and mark it well the proper action natures self will tell no pleasing powers distortions ever express and nicer judgment always loathes excess in sock or buskin who oerleaps the bounds disgusts our reason and the taste confounds of all the evils which the stage molest i hate your fool who overacts his jest who murders what the poet finely writ and like a bungler haggles all his wit with shrug and grin and gesture out of place and writes a foolish comment with his face old johnson once though cibbers perter vein but meanly groupes him with a numerous train with steady face and sober humrous mien filled the strong outlines of the comic scene what was writ down with decent uttrance spoke betrayed no symptom of the conscious joke the very man in look in voice in air and though upon the stage appeared no playr the word and action should conjointly suit but acting words is labor too minute grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong while sober humor marks the impression strong her proper traits the fixed attention hit and bring me closer to the poets wit with her delighted over each scene i go wellpleased and not ashamed of being so but let the generous actor still forbear to copy features with a mimics care it is a poor skill which every fool can reach a vile stagecustom honored in the breach worse as more close the disingenuous art but shows the wanton looseness of the heart when i behold a wretch of talents mean drag private foibles on the public scene forsaking natures fair and open road to mark some whim some strange peculiar mode fired with disgust i loath his servile plan despise the mimic and abhor the man go to the lame to hospitals repair and hunt for humor in distortions there fill up the measure of the motley whim with shrug wink snuffle and convulsive limb then shame at once to please a trifling age good sense good manners virtue and the stage it is not enough the voice be found and clear it is modulation that must charm the ear when desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan and whine their sorrows in a seesaw tone the same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes can only make the yawning hearers doze the voice all modes of passion can express that marks the proper word with proper stress but none emphatic can that actor call who lays an equal emphasis on all some over the tongue the labored measures roll slow and delibrate as the parting toll point every stop mark every pause so strong their words like stageprocessions stalk along all affectation but creates disgust and even in speaking we may seem too just nor proper thornton can those sounds appear which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear in vain for them the pleasing measure flows whose recitation runs it all to prose repeating what the poet sets not down the verb disjointing from its friendly noun while pause and break and repetition join to make a discord in each tuneful line some placid natures fill the allotted scene with lifeless drone insipid and serene while others thunder every couplet over and almost crack your ears with rant and roar more nature  and finer strokes are shown in the low whisper than tempestuous tone and hamlets hollow voice and fixed amaze more powerful terror to the mind conveys than he who swoln with big impetuous rage bullies the bulky phantom off the stage he who in earnest studies over his part will find true nature cling about his heart the modes of grief are not included all in the white handkerchief and mournful drawl a single look more marks the internal woe than all the windings of the lengthened oh up to the face the quick sensation flies and darts its meaning from the speaking eyes love transport madness anger scorn despair and all the passions all the soul is there in vain ophelia gives her flowrets round and with her straws fantastic strews the ground in vain now sings now heaves the desperate sigh if phrenzy sit not in the troubled eye in cibbers look commanding sorrows speak and call the tear fast trickling down my cheek there is a fault which stirs the critics rage a want of due attention on the stage i have seen actors and admired ones too whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue in their own speech who whine or roar away yet seem unmoved at what the rest may say whose eyes and thoughts on different objects roam until the prompters voice recall them home divest yourself of hearers if you can and strive to speak and be the very man why should the wellbred actor wish to know who sits above tonight or who below so mid the harmonious tones of grief or rage italian squallers often disgrace the stage when with a simpring leer and bow profound the squeaking cyrus greets the boxes round or proud mandane of imperial race familiar drops a curtsie to her grace to suit the dress demands the actors art yet there are those who overdress the part to some prescriptive right gives settled things black wigs to murdrers feathered hats to kings but michael cassio might be drunk enough though all his features were not grimd with snuff why should pol peachum shine in satin clothes why every devil dance in scarlet hose but in stagecustoms what offends me most is the slipdoor and slowlyrising ghost tell me nor count the question too severe why need the dismal powdered forms appear when chilling horrors shake the affrighted king and guilt torments him with her scorpion sting when keenest feelings at his bosom pull and fancy tells him that the seat is full why need the ghost usurp the monarchs place to frighten children with his mealy face the king alone should form the phantom there and talk and tremble at the vacant chair if belvidera her loved loss deplore why for twin specter bursts the yawning floor when with disordered starts and horrid cries she paints the murdered forms before her eyes and still pursues them with a frantic stare it is pregnant madness brings the visions there more instant horror would enforce the scene if all her shuddrings were at shapes unseen poet and actor thus with blended skill mould all our passions to their instant will it is thus when feeling garrick treads the stage the speaking comment of his shakespeares page often as i drink the words with greedy ears i shake with horror or dissolve with tears o never may folly seize the throne of taste nor dullness lay the realms of genius waste no bouncing crackers ape the thundrers fire no tumbler float upon the bending wire more natural uses to the stage belong than tumblers monsters pantomime or song for other purpose was that spot designed to purge the passions and reform the mind to give to nature all the force of art and while it charms the ear to mend the heart thornton to thee i dare with truth commend the decent stage as virtues natural friend though often debased with scenes profane and loose no reason weighs against it is proper use though the lewd priest his sacred function shame religions perfect law is still the same shall they who trace the passions from their rise show scorn her features her own image vice who teach the mind it is proper force to scan and hold the faithful mirror up to man shall their profession ever provoke disdain who stand the foremost in the mortal train who lend reflection all the grace of art and strike the precept home upon the heart yet hapless artist though thy skill can raise the bursting peal of universal praise though at thy beck applause delighted stands and lists briareus like her hundred hands know fame awards thee but a partial breath not all thy talents brave the stroke of death poets to ages yet unborn appeal and latest times the eternal nature feel though blended here the praise of bard and playr while more than half becomes the actors share relentless death untwists the mingled fame and sinks the player in the poets name the pliant muscles of the various face the mien that gave each

and held the laurel full to sight for vanity the poets sin had taken possession all within and he whose brain is versepossest is in himself as highly blessed as he whose lines and circles vie with heavens direction of the sky however the river rolls its tides the cork upon the surface rides and on inks ocean lightly buoyed that cork of vanity is lloyd let me too use the common claim and souse at once upon my name which some have done with greater stress who know me and who love me less poets are very harmless things unless you teaze one till he stings and when affronts are plainly meant we are bound in honor to resent and what tribunal will deny an injured person to reply in these familiar emanations which are but writing conversations where thought appears in dishabille and fancy does just what she will the sourest critic would excuse the vagrant sallies of the muse which lady for apollos blessing has still attended our caressing as many children round her sees as maggots in a cheshire cheese which i maintain at vast expense of pen and paper time and sense and surely twas no small miscarriage when first i entered into marriage the poets title which i bear with some strange castles in the air was all my portion with the fair however narrowly i look in phoebuss valorum book i cannot from enquiry find poets had much to leave behind they had a copyhold estate in lands which they themselves create a foolish title to a fountain a right of common in a mountain and yet they lived amongst the great more than their brethren do of late invited out at feasts to dine eat as they pleased and drank their wine nor is it any where set down they tipped the servants half a crown but passed amid the waiting throng and paid the porter with a song as once a wag in modern days when all are in these bribing ways his shillings to dispense unable scraped half the fruit from off the table and walking gravely through the crowd which stood obsequiously and bowed to keep the fashion up of tipping dropped in each hand a golden pippin but there is a difference indeed twixt ancient bards and modern breed though poet known in roman days fearless he walked the public ways nor ever knew that sacred name contemptuous smile or painful shame while with a foolish face of praise the folks would stop to gape and gaze and half untold the story leave pulling their neighbor by the sleeve while the index of the finger shows  there  yonder is horace  there he goes this finger i allow it true points at us modern poets too but it is by way of wit and joke to laugh or as the phrase is smoke yet there are those who are fond of wit although they never used it yet who wits and witlings entertain of taste virtu and judgment vain and dinner grace and gracecup done expect a wondrous deal of fun yes  he at bottom  dont you know him that is he that wrote the last new poem his humours exquisitely high you will hear him open by and by the man in print and conversation have often very small relation and he whose humor hits the town when copied fairly and set down in public company may pass for little better than an ass perhaps the fault is on his side springs it from modesty or pride those qualities ashamed to own for which he is happy to be known or that his natures strange and shy and diffident he knows not why or from a prudent kind of fear as knowing that the worlds severe he would not suffer to escape familiar wit in easy shape left gaping fools and vile repeaters should catch her up and spoil her features and for the childs unlucky maim the faultless parent come to shame well but methinks i hear you say write then my friend  write what  a play the theaters are open yet the market for all sterling wit try the strong efforts of your pen and draw the characters of men or bid the bursting tear to flow obedient to the fabled woe with tragedys severest art anatomize the human heart and that you may be understood bid nature speak as nature should that talent george though yet untried perhaps my genius has denied while you my friend are sure to please with all the powers of comic ease authors like maids at fifteen years are full of wishes full of fears one might by pleasant thoughts be led to lose a trifling maidenhead but it is a terrible vexation to give up with it reputation and he who has with plays to do has got the devil to go through critics have reason for their rules i dread the censure of your fools for tell me and consult your pride set garrick for a while aside how could you george with patience bear the critic prosing in the playr some of that calling have i known who hold no judgment like their own and yet their reasons fairly scan and separate the wheat and bran you would be amazed indeed to find what little wheat is left behind for after all their mighty rout of chattring round and round about it is but a kind of clockwork talking like crossing on the stage and walking the form of this tribunal past the play received the parts all cast each actor has his own objections each character new imperfections the mans is drawn too course and rough the ladys has not smut enough it wants a touch of cibbers ease a higher kind of talk to please such as your titled folks would choose and lords and ladyships might use which style whoever would succeed in must have small wit and much good breeding if this is dialogue  ma foi sweet sir say i pardonnez moi as long as life and business lasts the actors have their several casts a walk where each his talents shows queens nurses tyrants lovers beaux suppose you have found a girl of merit whod show your part in all its spirit take the whole meaning in the scope some little lively thing like pope you rob some others of a feather they have worn for thirty years together but grant the cast is as you like to actors which you think will strike tomorrow then  but as you know i have never a comedy to show let me a while in conversation make free with yours for application the arrows flight cannot be prevented  tomorrow then will be presented the jealous wife tomorrow right how do you sleep my friend tonight have you no pitpat hopes and fears roastbeef and catcalls in your ears mabbs wheels across your temples creep you toss and tumble in your sleep and cry aloud with rage and spleen that fellow murders all my scene tomorrow comes i know your merit and see the pieces fire and spirit yet friendships zeal is ever hearty and dreads the efforts of a party the coach below the clock gone five now to the theater we drive peeping the curtains eyelet through behold the house in dreadful view observe how close the critics sit and not one bonnet in the pit with horror hear the galleries ring nosy black joke god save the king sticks clatter catcalls scream encore cocks crow pit hisses galleries roar even cha some oranges is found this night to have a dreadful sound till decent sables on his back your prologuizers all wear black the prologue comes and if its mine its very good and very fine if not i take a pinch of snuff and wonder where you got such stuff that done agape the critics sit expectant of the comic wit the fiddlers play again pellmell  but hist  the prompter rings his bell  down there hats off  the curtain draws  what follows is  the just applause prologue to the jealous wife spoken by mr garrick the jealous wife a comedy poor man a charming subject but a wretched plan his skittish wit oerleaping the due bound commits flat trespass upon tragic ground quarrels upbraidings jealousies and spleen grow too familiar in the comic scene tinge but the language with heroic chime it is passion pathos character sublime what round big words had swelled the pompous scene a king the husband and the wife a queen then might distraction rend her graceful hair see sightless forms and scream and gape and stare drawcansir death had raged without control here the drawn dagger there the poisoned bowl what eyes had streamed at all the whining woe what hands had thundered at each hah and oh but peace the gentle prologue custom sends like drum and sergeant to beat up for friends at vice and folly each a lawful game our author flies but with no partial aim he read the manners open as they lie in natures volume to the general eye books too he read nor blushed to use their store  he does but what his betters did before shakespeare has done it and the grecian stage caught truth of character from homers page if in his scenes an honest skill is shown and borrowing little much appears his own if what a masters happy pencil drew he brings more forward in dramatic view to your decision he submits his cause secure of candor anxious for applause but if all rude his artless scenes deface the simple beauties which he meant to grace if an invader upon others land he spoil and plunder with a robbers hand do justice on him  as on fools before and give to blockheads past one blockhead more the nightingale the owl and the cuckoo a fable addressed to david garrick esquire on the report of his retiring from the stage dec    0 critics who like the scarecrows stand upon the poets common land and with severity of sense drive all imagination thence say that in truth lies all sublime whether you write in prose or rhyme and yet the truth may lose its grace if blurted to a persons face especially if what you speak should crimson over the glowing cheek for when you throw that slaver over him and tumble out your praise before him however just the application it looks asquint at adulation i would be honest and sincere but not a flatterer or severe need i be surly rough uncouth that folks may think i love the truth and she good dame with beautys queen was not at all times naked seen for every boy with prior knows by accident she lost her clothes when falsehood stole them to disguise her misbegotten brood of lies why should the prudish goddess dwell down at the bottom of a well but that she is in piteous fright lest rising up to mortal sight the modest world should fleer and flout her with not a rag of clothes about her yet she might wear a proper dress and keep her essence neertheless so delias bosom still will rise and fascinate her lovers eyes though round her ivory neck she draws the decent shade of specious gauze i hear it buzzed about the table what can this lead to  sirs a fable  when birds allowed the eagles sway ever eagles turned to fowls of prey his royal majesty of air took music underneath his care and for his queen and courts delight commanded concerts every night here every bird of parts might enter the nightingale was made praecentor under whose care and just direction merit was sure to meet protection the lark the blackbird and the robin this concert always bore a bob in the best performers all were in it the thrush canarybird and linnet but birds alas are apt to aim at things to which they have smallest claim the staring owl with hideous hoot offered his service for a flute the cuckoo needs would join the band the thrush is but a paultry hand and i can best supply that place for i have a shake a swell a grace the manager their suit preferred both tuned their pipes and both were heard yet each their several praises missed for both were heard and both were hissed the cuckoo hence with rancour stirred a kind of periodic bird of nasty hue and body scabby no wouldbe playwright half so shabby reviles abuses and defames screams from a branch and calls hard names and strikes at nightingale or lark like lisbon russians in the dark the owl harangues the gaping throng on powers and excellence of song the blackbirds note has lost its force the nightingale is downright hoarse the linnets harsh the robin shrill   the sparrow has prodigious skill at length they had what they desired the skillful nightingale retired when folly came with wild uproar and harmony was heard no more two odes i take the liberty of inserting the two following odes though i cannot with strict propriety

errors side with signal prudence blessed with patriot zeal firm to his church and to the public weal censor of courtiers but by courts beloved romes fierce assailant and by rome approved across two rocks where with tremendous roar the foaming ocean lashes either shore to dieppes strong port the heros steps repair the ready sailors ply their busy care the towering ships old oceans lordly kings aloft in air display their canvas wings not swelled by boreas now the glassy seas flowed calmly on with zephyrs gentle breeze now anchor weighed they quit the friendly shore and land receding greets their eyes no more jocund they sailed and albions chalky height at distance rose full fairly to the sight when rumbling thunders rend the affrighted pole loud roar the winds and seas tempestuous roll the livid lightnings cleave the darkened air and all around reigns horror and despair no partial fear the heros bosom knows which only trembled for his countrys woes it seemed his looks toward her in silence bent accused the winds which crossed his great intent so caesar striving for a conquered world near epires banks with adverse tempests hurled trusting undaunted and securely brave romes and the worlds fate to the swelling wave though leagued with pompey neptures self engage opposed his fortune to dull oceans rage mean time that god whose power the tempest binds who rides triumphant on the wings of winds that god whose wisdom which presides over all can raise protect or crush this earthly ball from his bright throne beyond the starry skics beheld the hero with considering eyes god was his guide and mid the tempests roar the tossing vessel reached the neighboring shore where jerfey rises from the oceans bed there heavenconducted was the hero led at a small distance from the shore there stood the growth of many years a shadowy wood a neighboring rock the calm retirement saves from the rude blasts and hoarseresounding waves a grotto stands behind whose structure knows the simple grace which natures hand bestows here far from court removed a holy sage spent the mild evening of declining age while free from worldly toils and worldly woe his only study was himself to know here mused regretting on his misspent days or lost in love or pleasures flowery maze no gusts of folly swell the dangerous tide while all his passions to a calm subside the bubble life he held an empty dream his food the simple herb his drink the stream tranquil and calm he drew his aged breath and looked with patience tward the port of death when the pure soul to blissful realms shall soar and join with god himself to part no more the god he worshipped eyed the zealous sage and blessed with wisdoms lore his silvered age gave him the skill of prophecy to know and from fates volume read events below the sage with conscious joy the prince addressed and spread the table for his royal guest the prompt repast which simple nature suits the streams fresh water and the forests roots not unaccustomed to the homely fare the warrior sat for often from busy care from courts retired and pomps fastidious pride the hero dared to throw the king aside and in the rustic cot wellpleased partook of labors mean repast and cheerful look found in himself the joys to kings unknown and self deposed forgot the lordly throne the worlds contention to their minds supplies much converse wholesome to the good and wise much did they talk of woes in human life of christian kingdoms torn with jarring strife the zeal of mornay like a stubborn fort attached to calvin stood his firm support henry still doubting sought the indulgent skies that lights clear ray might burst upon his eyes must then said he the truth be always found to mortals weak with mists encompasd round must i still err my way in darkness trod nor know the path which leads me to my god if all alike he willed us to obey the god who willed it had prescribed the way let us not vainly gods designs explore the sage replied be humble and adore arraign not madly heavens unerring laws for faults where mortals are themselves the cause these aged eyes beheld in days of yore when calvins doctrine reached the gallic shore then though with blood it now distains the earth creeping in shade and humble in the birth i saw it banished by religions laws without one friend to combat in the cause through ways oblique i saw the phantom tread slow winding and ashamed to rear her head till at the last upheld by powerful arms midst cannons thunder and mid wars alarms burst forth the monster in the glare of light with towering front full dreadful to the sight to scoul at mortals from her tyrant seat and spurn our altars at her impious feet far then from courts beneath this peaceful cot i waild religions and my countrys lot yet here to comfort my declining days some dawn of hope presents its cheerful rays so new a worship cannot long survive which mans caprice alone has kept alive with that it rose with that shall die away mans works and man are bubbles of a day the god who reigns for ever and the same at pleasure blasts a worlds presumptuous aim vain is our malice vain our strength displayed to sap the city his right hand has made himself has fixed the strong foundations low which brave the wreck of time and hells inveterate blow the lord of lords shall bless thy purged sight with bright effulgence of diviner light on thee great prince his mercies he will bestow and shed that truth thy bosom pants to know that god has chose thee and his hand alone safe through the war shall lead thee to a throne conquest already for his voice is fate for thee bids glory open her golden gate if on thy sight the truth unnoticd falls hope not admission in thy paris walls though splendid ease invite thee to her arms o shun great prince the syrens poisoned charms over thy strong passions hold a glorious reign fly loves soft lap break pleasures silken chain and when with efforts strong all foes overthrown a leagues great conqueror and what is more your own when with united hearts and triumphs voice thy people hail thee with one common choice from a dread siege to fame for ever known to mount with glory thy paternal throne that time affliction shall lay by her rod and thy glad eyes shall seek thy fathers god then shall thou see from whence thy arms prevail go prince  who trusts in god  can never fail each word the sages holy lips impart falls like a flame on henrys generous heart the hero stood transported in his mind to times when god held converse with mankind when simple virtue taught her heavenborn lore and truth commanding bid even kings adore his eager arms the reverend sage embrace and the warm tear fast trickled down his face untouched yet lost awhile in deep surprise stood mornay brave for still on mornays eyes hung errors mist and gods high will concealed the gifts from him to henrys breast revealed his wisdom idly would the world prefer whose lot though rich in virtues was to err while the wrapped sage fulfilling gods beheft spoke inspiration to the princes breast hushed were the winds within their caverns bound smooth flowed the seas and nature smiled around the sage his guide the hero sought his way where the tall vessels safe at anchor lay the ready sailors quit the friendly strand hoist the glad sails and make for albions land while over her coast his eyes admiring range he praised in silence britains happier change where laws abused by foul intestine foes had erst entailed a heap of dreadful woes on prince and people on that bloody stage where slaughtered heroes bled for civil rage on that bright throne from whence descended springs the illustrious lineage of a hundred kings like henry long in adverse fortune schooled over willing english hearts a woman ruled and rich in manly courage female grace closed the long luster of her crowded race eliza then in britains happiest hour held the just balance of contending power made english subjects bow the willing knee who will not serve and are not happy free beneath her sacred reign the nation knows no sad remembrance of its former woes their flocks securely grazed the fertile plain their garners bursting with their golden grain the stately ships their swelling sails unfurled brought wealth and homage from the distant world all europe watched britannias bold decree dreaded by land and monarch of the sea wide over the waves his fleet exulting rode and fortune triumphed over oceans god proud london now no more of barbarous fame to arms and commerce urged her blended claim her powers in union leagued together sat king lords and commons in their threefold state though separate each their several interest draw yet all united form the steadfast law all three one bodys members firm and fit make but one power in strong conjunction knit power to itself of danger often found but spreading terror to its neighbors round blessed when the people dutys homage show and pay their king the tribute which they owe more blessed when kings for milder virtues known protect their peoples freedom from the throne ah when cried bourbon shall our discord cease our glory albion rise like thine in peace blush blush ye kings ye lords of jarring states a woman bids and war has closed its gates your countries bleed with factious rage oppressed while she reigns happy over a people blessed mean time the hero reached the seagirt isle where freedom bids eternal plenty smile not far from williams tower at distance seen stood the famed palace of the virgin queen hither the faithful mornay at his side without the noise and pageant pomp of pride the toys of grandeur which the vain pursue but glare unheeded to the heros view tue prince arrived with bold and manly sense he spoke his frankness all his eloquence told his sad tale and bowed his lofty heart for frances woes to act submissions part for needful aids the british queen addressed while in the suppliant shone the king confessed come thou replied the queen with orange surprise come thou from valois for die wished allies askst thou protection for a tyrant foe whose deadly hate worked all thy fortunes woe far as the golden sun begins to rise to where he drives adown the western skies his strise and thine to all the world is known standst thou for him a friend at britains throne and is that hand which valois often has feared armed in his cause and for his vengeance reared when thus the prince a monarchs adverse fate wipes all remembrance out of former hate valois was their a slave his passions slave but now himself a monarch firm and brave he bursts at once the ignominious chain resumes the hero and asserts his reign blessed if of nature more assured and free he would sought no aid but from himself and me but led by fraud and arts all insincere he was my foe from weakness and from fear his faults die with me when his woes i view i have gained the conquest  grant me vengeance you for know the work is thine illustrious dame to deck thy albions brows with worthiest fame let thy protection spread her ready wings and fight with me the injured cause of kings eliza then for much she wished to know the various turns of frances longfelt woe whence rising first the civil discord came and paris kindled to rebellions flame  to me great prince thy griefs are not unknown though brought imperfect and by fame alone whose rapid wing too indiscreetly flies and spreads abroad her indigested lies deaf to her tales from thee illustrious youth from thee alone eliza seeks the truth tell me for you have witnessed all the woe valois brave friend or valois conquering foe say whence this friendship this alliance grew which knits the happy bond twixt him and you explain this wondrous change it is you alone can paint the virtues which yourself has shown teach me thy woes for know thy story brings a moral lesson to the pride of kings and must my memory then illustrious queen recall the horrors of each dreadful scene o had it pleased the almighty power which knows how my heart bleeds over all my countrys woes oblivion then had shatchd them from the light and hid them buried in eternal night nearest of blood must i aloud proclaim the princes madness and expose their shame reflection shakes my mind with wild dismay  but it is elizas will and i obey others in speaking from their smooth address might make their weakness or their crimes seem less the flowery art was never made for me i speak a soldiers language plain and free familiar epistle to  apothecary when once a man so far is gone to wet his lips at helicon not all the hellebore which you buy in the lord knows what to do his head can settle or restore his reason as it was before talk about physic what you will and magnify the doctors skill mention the names of all the college thole shining miracles of knowledge or more to justify your praise call in the learned of former days let mead friend boorehave ratcliffe join their mightyknowing heads to thine consult together and survey the whole materia medica the various powers of medicine state and find out virtues or create try all old ways if they will not do experimentally try new and when all is ended rest assured poetic madness cannot be cured when haughty caelias vain desires inflame her brain and fancy fires when on her bed she sits elate and takes it for a throne of state and with a scepter made of straw keeps the subjected world in awe or when clarissa hapless fair with downcast eye and pensive air treads her lone cell and now complains of broken vows and perjured swains now blames her own too easy heart which took the base deluders part or when the poets rolling eye proclaims his hour of phrenzy nigh when on imaginary horse from pole to pole he takes his course or of fantastic trophies proud bestrides some easypacing cloud or wildly running through the streets pours couplets out to all he meets can addington with all his care the shattered seat of sense repair when madness now my worthy friend i must insist that you will attend for of distinctions fond i am grown and so will make one of my own a nice distinction not a jot it matters whether true or not for he proceeds on surest grounds who when he cannot convince confounds and to the credit of his brain puzzles the cause he cannot maintain when madness of all sorts and sizes from bodily disease arises whether the blood half froze remains and scarce moves laboring through the veins or overhot with sanguine pride impetuous rolls her rapid tide if the mind is no more affected than as with body it is connected physic may then of service prove abate the grief perhaps remove but if the body and the brain only toblige the mind complain and the distempers in the heart it is beyond the reach of art but to distinguish farther still  read it or not just as you will or if you read commend or blame to me old boy it is all the same say if you please perhaps say true this nothing is to me or you or say what observation says of many great men nowadays of most indeed that i am one of great distinction judgment none but once more to return for this you will read in a parenthesis though i had left you in the dark by leaving out the usual mark all kinds of madness we shall find even those which spring out of the mind more readily a cure admit than that which flows from love of wit in other phrenzies pains endured the patient wishes to be cured if ever some lucid interval the scattered rays of sense recall whereas the poets highest pleasure and frequently his only treasure in madness lies his joys still vary joys real or imaginary as his head turns and he is most blessed when most with madness he is possessed phoebus himself that we may quote example of undoubted note phoebus who well is known to be of physic god and poetry when first he found by symptoms sure his brain affected thought of cure tried every way but tried in vain to settle his distracted brain convinced at length that naught would do the useless drugs aside he threw and smiling to the listening crowd this maxim he declared aloud a maxim since most sacred had no poets wise who is not mad a tale venus of laughter queen and love the greatest demirep above who scorned restriction hated custom knew her own sex too well to trust em proceeded on the noble plan at any rate to have her man looked on decorum as mere trash and lived like  and  from paphos where they her revere as much as we do caelia here or from cythera where her altars are decked with daggers truelove

cuckolds made than vulcan and his brawny dolts ever for jove forged thunderbolts slipped gently down and ran before em ringing the bell with due decorum but truth to say i cannot tell whether it knocker was or bell this for virtue an anecdote is which used to give caecilia notice when any lady of the sky was come to bear her company but this i am sure be which it will thomas performed his part with skill methinks i hear the reader cry  his part with skill why you or i or any body else as well as thomas sure could ring a bell nor did i ever hear before of skill in knocking at a door poor lowlivd creature i suppose nay and am sure youre one of those who at what door soever they be will always knock in the same key thinking that bell and knocker too were found out nothing else to do but to inform the house no doubt that there was somebody without who if they might such favor win would rather choose to be within but had our servants no more sense lord what must be the consequence error would error still pursue and strife and anarchy ensue punctilio from her altar hurled whence she declares unto the world whatever by fancy is decreed through all her niceties must

admittance gain when his good lordship hoped to see some rascal of his own degree and what is more unhappy still the stupid wretch who brings a bill might pass through all the motley tribe as free as one who brings a bribe my lady too might pique her grace which carriage stiff and formal face which she deceived had taken care for some inferior to prepare or might some wretch from lombard street

thousand airs skimd through the hall and tripd up stairs caecilia met her with a smile of great delight when all the while if her false heart could have been seen she wished she had at cyprus been but

generous before they are just and that their charity this way shall bind over heaven their debts to pay and serve their tempral turn no doubt better than if they would put it out whilst naught hereafter can prevent their sure reward of cent per cent who honest labor scorn and say none need to work who love to pray for heaven will satisfy their cravings by sending of elijahs ravens or rain

profane yet all the ceremony here is pure as the mysteries of ceres who gods elect with triumph feel within themselves salvations seal and will not must not dare not doubt that heaven itself cannot blot it out after they have done their holy labors return to scandalize their neighbors and think they cannot serve heaven so well as with its creatures filling hell so that inflamed with holy pride

knavish business drives but tell me what is the master who connives hence you will infer and sure the doctrines true which says no quarter to a foul review it matters not who vends the nauseous slop master or prentice we detest the shop critics of old a manly liberal race approved or censured with an open face boldly persud the free decisive task nor stabbed concealed beneath a ruffians mask to

strongest light or damn the blockhead to his native night but as all states are subject to decay the state of letters too will melt away smit with the harlot charms of trilling sound softness now wantons even on roman ground where thebans spartans sought their honored graves behold a weak enervate race of slaves in classic lore deep science language dead though modern witlings are but scantly read prosessors the author takes this opportunity notwithstanding all insinuations to the contrary to declare that he has no particular aim at a gentleman whose abilities he sufficiently acknowledges fail not who will loudly bawl in praise of either with the want of all hailed mighty critics to this present hour  the tribunes name survived the tribunes power now quack and critic differ but in name empirics frontless both they mean the same this raw in physic that in letters fresh both spring like warts excrescence from the flesh half formed half bred in printers hireling schools for all professions have their rogues and fools though the pert witling or the coward knave casts no reflection on the wise or brave yet in these leaden times this idle age when blind with dullness or as

when the wise vetran knows you by your style with critic scales weighs out the partial wit what i or you or he or no one writ denying thee thy just and proper worth but to give falshoods spurious issue birth and all selfwilled with lawless hand to raise malicious slander on the base of praise disgrace eternal wait the wretchs name who lives on credit of a borrowed fame who wears the trappings of anothers wit or fathers bantlings which he could not get but shrewd suspicion with her squinting eye to truth declared prefers a whispered lie with greedy mind the proffered tale believes relates her wishes and with joy deceives the world a pompous name by custom due to the small circle of a talking few with heartfelt glee the injurious tale repeats and sends the whisper buzzing through the

this heavy tax for being great ii there stood an ancient mount yclept parnass the fair domain of sacred poesy which with fresh odours everblooming was besprinkled with the dew of castaly which now in soothing murmurs whispering glides watring with genial waves the fragrant soil now rolls adown the mountains steepy sides teaching the vales full beauteously to smile dame natures handiwork notformd by laboring toil iii the muses fair these peaceful shades among with skilful fingers sweep the trembling strings the air in silence listens to the song and time forgets to ply his lazy wings palevisagd care with foul unhallowed feet attempts the summit of the hill to gain ne can the hag arrive the blissful seat her unavailing strength is spent in vain content sits on the top and mocks her empty pain iv often phoebus self left his divine abode and here enshrouded in a shady bower regardless of his state laid by the god and owned sweet musics more alluring power on either side was placed

winged her flight with careful eye each realm she did explore ne mote she ought of happiness observe for happiness alas was now no more since every one from virtues paths did swerve and trample on religion base designs to serve xiii at length on blessed parnassus seated high their temple circled with a laurel crown spenser and milton met her scowling eye and turned her horrid grin into a frown full fast unto her sister did she post there to unload the venom of her breast to tell how all her happiness was crossed since others were of happiness possessed did never gloomy hell send forth like ugly pest xiv within the covert of a gloomy wood where funeral cypress starproof branches spread oergrown with tangling briers a cavern stood fit place for melancholy drearyhead gloominess drearyhead here a deformed monster joyd to won which on fell rancour ever was ybent all from the rising to the setting sun her heart pursued spite with black intent ne could her iron mind at human woes relent xv in flowing sable stole she was yclad which with her countenance did well accord forth from her mouth like one through grief gone mad a frothy sea of nauseous foam was ponrd a ghastly grin and eyes asquint display the rancour which her hellish thoughts contain and how when man is blessed she pines away burning to turn his happiness to pain malice the monsters name a foe to god and man xvi along

hardyhead xvii impatient envy through the aetherial waste with inward venom fraught and deadly spite unto this cavern steered her panting haste enshrouded in a darksome veil of night her inmost heart burnt with impetuous ire and fell destruction sparkled in her look her ferret eyes flashed with revengeful fire a while contending passions uttrance choke at length the fiend in furious tone her silence broke xviii sister arise see how our power decays no more our empire thou and i can boast since mortal man now gains immortal praise since man is blessed and thou and i are lost see in what

more hideous rendered to the sight by reason of her raging cruelty she burnt to go equipt in dreadful plight and find fit engine for her forgery her eyes inflamed did cast their rays askance while hellish imps prepare the monsters car in which she might cut through the wide expanse and find out nations that extended far when all was pitchy dark ne twinkled one bright star xxii black was her chariot drawn by dragons dire and each fell serpent had a double tongue which ever and anon spit flaming fire the regions of the tainted air among a lofty seat the sistermonsters bore in deadly

dragons on amain ne mote their anger suffer cold delay until the wished for region they obtain and land their dingy car on caledonian plain xxiv here eldest son of malice long had dwelt a wretch of

when such are pleased alas then measure back the air with swifter pace until they reach the foot of mount parnass hither in evil hour the monsters came and with their new companion did alight who long

blissful seat long burnt he sore but still he burnt in vain mote none come there who come with impious feet at lenth at unawares he out does spit that spite which else had to himself been bane the

darkness disappears may darkness ever thus to light give place erst grieved apollo jocund looks resumes the nine renew their whilom cheerful song no grief parnassus aged breast consumes forth from the teeming earth new flowers sprung the plenteous rivers flowed full peacefully along xxx the stricken bard fresh vital heat renews whose blood erst stagnate rushes through his veins life through each
