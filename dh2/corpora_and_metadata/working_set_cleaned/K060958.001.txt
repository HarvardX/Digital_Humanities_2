memoirs of william owen gwin vaughan esquire the day i was born was the first of my misfortunes for the moment that gave me birth robbed my dear mother of life and i came into the world an innocent murderer the last of five sons  though my father had a considerable estate yet as i was the youngest of all there was but little to expect for me and ere i arrived to my fourth year a motherinlaw was brought into the family that had one son and two daughters but she secured to my father a considerable estate while she lived though after her death it was to devolve on her own children and i am pretty well informed that was the chief motive of my fathers wishing her a long life  sure marriage must be an unfortunate state on such conditions especially on one side for every body agreed my motherinlaw from her outward behavior was very fond of my father but she laid out her whole portion of goodnature upon him she having not one grain left for any of his children and between em both good housekeeping was banished that lived with us in my mothers days  my father give him his due was raking enough to provide for his children and his wife was not an ace behind him in taking care for hers  my motherinlaws son was much of my own age so to school we were sent together which was the happiest time of my life for my good motherinlaw being overfond of her only son allowed him handsomely of every thing and my father that there should be no difference between us did the like by me so we both fared the better by their emulation and whatever brother jack had one day to be sure billy meaning myself had the next but though it favors of vanity to praise myself yet i will declare i was a better proficient in learning than my schoolfellow for i took a great pleasure in my studying but on the contrary my brother was very idle and i often received good part of his money for the week to make his exercise for him so by this method our parents imagined him a better scholar than he was  our master though a rigid one was something deceived in him for i was very cautious of letting any one understand the helps i gave him well knowing if it was once discovered i should lose my perquisites as i called em but one christmas it all came out  the parson of the parish being at dinner and as it proved which does not always happen a good scholar was desired to examine the yonkers as they called us my mother being gone out of the room just before domine set upon me first paying as he thought a compliment to my father and i went through my examination so readily that my father gave me a crownpiece to encourage me but at the same time whispered me to put it up before the good woman my motherinlaw came back again  when the parson had finished several elaborate speeches on the ripeness of my genius and what not adding among the rest he did not fear in time but he should see me a great statesman he took my schoolfellow john to task who came to examination like a thief to his trial i stood just behind him and prompted him unheard by the rest of the company yet he made so many blunders that like sir martin and his man warner we were both discovered at which i was very much grieved for i soon apprehended such care would be taken of mr dunce that i should finger no more of his money and all the praises i received from the company for the aptness of my parts etc could not extinguish the thoughts on it but to mend the matter my motherinlaw who happened to come in just as he was beginning his fiery trial big with expectation of her son johnny proving a prodigy of learning and finding herself so much disappointed could not contain her temper but flew out in a manner little pleasing to the company she did not doubt she said but there had been much pains taken with that jackanapes meaning my worship but she would take care for the future to choose a master that was in her interest to instruct her child that it was much against her inclination at first to let him go where all my brothers had gone before being the teacher was in my fathers interest and a thousand such speeches which struck my father into amazement and though the parson with a great deal of reason that perhaps you will say is a wonder used many fine speeches to qualify this matter yet they all proved like words uttered in a desert but when brother jack in tears told her my father had given me a crown she grew outrageous and with a great deal of dexterity gave me a handsome box on the ear less gentle i believe than the boor gives the duke of carinthia is a province of germany upon the borders of italy whenever the ducal coronet is vacant the person who is to be installed is seated in a chair of great antiquity made like two great chairs put back to back with two seats in one the intended duke sits in the other a boor of the country who is to offer two oxen to the duke one the leanest the other the fattest that can be got but the duke is to return the fat one to the boor which is to intimate he is to improve his country or dukedom for sometimes it is the emperor of germany who is chose duke of carinthia from the poverty of the lean ox to that of the fat one when that part of the ceremony is over the boor or countryman rises up comes to the duke who is fitting with his face to the east and gives him a gentle box on the ear after that he puts on his feet a pair of shoes filled with the earth of the country and that concludes the installment though the last part of the ceremony they omit when a proxy is installed which often happens when the title is conferred on the emperor or some other potentate carinthia at his installation my father to be even with her returned my brother john one as like it as a couple of billiardballs my good motherinlaw perceiving it was resolved to be even with him and gave it me handsomely on both sides my ears which was returned smartly back upon the chops of my schoolfellow by my father till we got handsomely cuffd between em  my father seeing his wifes rage rather increased than diminished laid hold of both her hands she struggling to get loose and finding it impossible spit in my fathers face who was so much confounded that he let her go and she waddled out of the room like a goose upon a common  when she was gone my father sat him down in his chair without speaking for some time but at last broke out with an exalted voice this is the first time i ever wished myself unmarryd and i am very much in fear it will not be the last for when once man and wife have broke through the respect they owe each other continual jarrs will succeed and the first quarrel will soon be followed by many others i have no notion continued he after this breach we can ever be properly reconciled  the good parson said many things in order to excuse both parties but my father gave him no manner of answer he seeing things in so much confusion took his leave  when he was gone my father began to examine me about my brother jack and the reason why my master did not acquaint him with his indocibility i well knowing he abhorred a lie declared to him the whole truth but begged his pardon telling him my young apprehension could not conceive such confusion would follow  well returned my father i have reason to believe you will never be guilty of such inadvertencies again therefore i freely pardon you but for the future you must go to school by yourself at least till this matter is blown over and my wife and i are thoroughly reconciled if there is a possibility of it upon saying this he waved his hand that i might leave him to himself  as soon as i got into the courtyard before the house my brother jack met me ah said he my mother has given me a crown as well as my father did you i am glad on it returned i i believe that is a lie said my mother who was coming out of the garden and had staid to listen as i suppose madam i have learnt said i to speak truth whatever may be the consequence and in most of the books we are to learn we are informed our tongue and heart should always go together ha said she what i suppose you are setting up for a young philosopher but i believe you have got a few sentences by rote as parrots have that you sputter out unseasonably i told her whatever i had learnt i would take care never to say any thing to offend her no said she you will always be an offense to me silent or speaking i told her i was very sorry for it and went back again with the tears running down my cheeks intending to go up into the room where i lay but was met by my father who seeing the tears trickling down my face asked me hastily the reason of my grief i told him nothing  come said he you know i will have the truth therefore tell me without delay i then finding he would be satisfied told all that had passed between my mother and me though in as tender terms as i could when my father had heard me out he seemed very much concerned and making a long pause at last cried well i will have a remedy and tomorrow continued he you shall go to your uncles who desires to see you where you shall remain till the time of your breakingup is over  the next morning i had orders to prepare for my journey when i was ready to get on horseback i waited on my father who bid me go to my mother and take my leave of her i went but i must confess very unwillingly when i came to her dressing room i kneeled down as usual upon which she said hastily bless you bless you which i understood by her manner of speaking was dammee dammee  i am come madam said i to take my leave of you by my fathers command why pray sir returned my mother very scornfully where are you going to my uncles madam said i go then said she and a good riddance i made my honors and down stairs i went again to my father  well will said he what said your mother to you did she give you any thing no sir said i she only gave me leave to go about my business well said my father you shall never trouble her again in the mind i am in go said he get on horseback i will ride before and conduct you some part of the way  when i went into the stable i heard my brother jack tell the groom i must not have the little horse for it was his and he was to go abroad with his mother brother said i i must have him for my fathers gone before and will wait for me no matter for that said he you shall not have him many words passed between us and all the while he was endeavoring to get the bridle out of my hand but finding he was not strong enough he let go just as i had got one foot in the stirrup with a prong that he had got out of the stable he ran me into the thigh with one of the points the other piercing the horse in the flank who feeling himself hurt gave a spring and before i could get upon his back he dragged me with one foot in the stirrup out into the road and would have certainly beat me to pieces if my father coming back wondering at my delay had not stopped him the servant told him i was certainly wounded for there were streams of blood upon the ground examining my hurt they found my boot was full of blood i was carried in again though with loss of blood the violence of the fall together with the dragging of the horse i was deprived of my senses for some time  a surgeon was immediately sent for yet my father was not presently informed how i came by the hurt but when he knew the truth of it he was so very much provoked that just that instant meeting with my brother jack coming up stairs he kicked him down again and in the fall he broke his arm i mention these little circumstances only as they were the occasion of right breach in the family  when the surgeon came he informed us there was no danger but loss of blood and with a great many hard words told em what a narrow escape i had for if it had been an inch higher and touched such and such a thing all the world could not have saved my life to be sure  when he had made an end of dressing my wound he went to the assistance of my brother the servants had taken him up and brought him into the same room where i was for our beds were together i must own the sight of him instead of moving my pity stirred my indignation and i was inwardly satisfied with my fathers just revenge but while they were setting his arm my mother came among us alarmed it seems with his cries like one of the furies with her hair about her ears out of her dressing room not having been acquainted with the matter through the confusion of the family she cast many furious eyes toward me and i believe if she had not been prevented by my father had made me feel the effects of her indignation madam said he i am sorry for the accident that has happened to your son not but he deserves it for his young wicked intention though i dont doubt but he was instigated by his mother by me thou barbarous wretch said she  you are sorry for the accident what accident did not you do it for the purpose with an intention to break his neck i suppose but i will be revenged on your young darling with all his learning upon saying that she rushed upon me in spite of em and seized violently upon me endeavoring to tear me out of the bed notwithstanding my weak condition but my father laid hold of her and with a pull swung her to the farther end of the room now madam said he since i see the inveteracy of your malice and having broke the bonds of duty love and tenderness i will make you feel the power of a husband you shall be close confined to your apartment never once to converse with me or mine you shall want nothing but your liberty where you will have time enough to reflect upon your conduct and what it is to injure a husband by your violent proceedings so saying he seized upon her maugre her strugglings carried her to the nursery and locked her in the reason of his putting her there was as he said afterward to prevent her making any attempts to get out of the windows being there were bars fixed for fear of any accident among us when we were under the nurses care  notwithstanding her violence of temper she had certainly at least in every bodys opinion a tender regard for my father and if he did not return it he gave her no cause to complain he had too much humanity to use any one ill much less a wife i have often heard him say while my wife continues her good humor to me she shall never find me in the least to blame in my conduct to her but whenever that alters i shall have so much regard to myself to be easy  during my illness my father was hardly ever from me i did not think it was proper for one of my years to ask him any questions concerning his matrimonial warfare but as he was sitting upon my bed about the fifth day of my illness my mothers maid brought him a letter which my father perused then read it to me as follows sir i am sensible the serenity of temper you have often promised to yourself if any breach should happen between us gives you very great satisfaction whatever uneasiness i feel but as i have cause to believe the burden will be weightier if you will not allow me one favor which i am almost assured you will comply with that is to have the company of my hurt son in my confinement besides maternal affections i believe there is another motive which convinces me i shall not be denied you will get rid of an object which cannot but be ungrateful to you because it belongs to one who formerly thought it her chiefest happiness to be called  yours     confinement i find said my father is a good mortifier but i shall very willingly comply with her request upon your account for i cannot suppose it is very pleasing to you to have always before your eyes the cause of your pain and illness sir said i there is no motive more prevalent with me than the satisfaction of my mother besides i hope i have it not in my nature to bear malice therefore i have long since forgiven my brother imagining it to be only the heat of passion and want of years my child said my father your years are the same both in your thirteenth and yet i am convinced he has not the consideration that thou have which i am pleased with not for his want of understanding but that thine seems to exceed thy years pray heaven continue it sir said i it is all i ask the blessing of heaven and you in having them i shall want nothing but possessed with all the gifts of fortune wanting them i shall be poor indeed my boy said my father and kissed me once more heaven bless thee grant that i may be able to provide for thee according to my inclination  by this time the maid who had retired while my father was perusing the letter came in to expect an answer tell your mistress said my father i shall comply with her request as i shall to all others that are reasonable upon this answer the maid went out and my father gave immediate orders to remove the boy then with a gentle press by the hand took his leave of me i must own i was very much delighted at his expressions of kindness to me being it was what i never received from him before it is true he never used me harshly but he did not seem to me to have the least regard or playing and toying with children as i have known parents do his manner of behavior to me before begot respect in me it was enough if he did but look at me to make me observe him though i cannot fansy it is a proper carriage from a parent to a child neither the way to beget obedience there is a kind of indulgence to the harmless follies of children that insensibly wins the affections of the child i remember my own brother that was one year elder than me never cared to come in my fathers sight which proceeded from his stiff behavior to us but i am not laying down rules or examples between parents and children though really i think some parents want as much instruction that way as their children though i am wellassurd my father had a tender regard for his notwithstanding his rigid behavior for he punished severely for faults openly and as i found afterward rewarded em secretly when they did well but my readers may with reason say this is but little to the purpose  in the next visit my father made me he told me he fansyd my mother had a great mind to be making her peace but added he will i will take care if it comes to that you shall be included in the treaty i told him i should be pleased let it go which way it would if he would be so i have received another letter since morning said he with her desire to speak with me in the evening i shall comply with her request and the result of our conference thou shall know tomorrow morning for added he it will be late before i can go to her for i expect your schoolmaster this evening who is to stay all night on purpose to see you as he sends me word and accordingly before night the good old man came to condole with me and in some sort to chide me in neglecting to tell him of my brothers want of learning however said he i forgive you and have prevailed on your father that i may have you again for i should be much concerned to lose the flower of my flock as he was pleased to call me as for your brother jack added he i have advised with your father to prevail on your mother to put him out to some creditable trade and not longer to lose his time in fruitless endeavors to learn what he can never attain to for continued he i have just now been examining him in the garden for as he had the use of his legs he could go any where but i am in the utmost confusion to find him such a dunce and that i could be so long imposed on between you  i begged my master to mention my folly no more for i assured him it was want of thought and tenderness to him that occasioned the deceit i had sufficiently repented of it and if it was to come over again would sooner die than be guilty of any such proceedings i added it was the greatest grief i ever did or ever should feel that from so trivial a thing as i thought such difference should be created between my father and mother rest contented replied my master thy motherinlaw has proved what i always thought her a turbulentspirited woman only she had art enough to hide it so long from your father indeed her first husband sir charles many years ago hinted some such thing to me i am pleased she has declared herself upon so slight an occasion that your good father may be armed in time against her contrivances for i am apt to believe even her affection to him is only counterfeited and once women can counterfeit love i give em lost to all virtuous principles their endearments are the worst of crimes and the greatest affront they can put upon a man i have known some women who have proved false to their husbands bed yet have carried it with such a tenderness and regard to them that if the world had not been convinced of their baseness twere enough to call truth a liar  i interrupted my master by telling him i thought there was no grounds even for suspicion of any such thing concerning my mother i hope so too replied my schoolmaster  after some other discourse of the weaknesses of women he left me to my own thoughts but i must own they were not very pleasing ones i began to consider my condition if my mother proved an ill woman as i had some reason to suspect from the hints and discourses of my master i should certainly suffer in the end for if my father was reconciled to her through her cunning i did not doubt but she would improve it and make me the butt of her resentment and notwithstanding my fathers good sense and knowledge of the world there was not an impossibility but he might fall into the snares of a subtle designing woman the thought of this spread a melancholy cloud over my face which was perceived by my father who entered in the midst of my cogitations  how now will said he does thy wound pain thee that thou look with such a sorrowful countenance no sir said i i was only entered into thinking of what may happen for the future and the fear of losing your kindness made me sad well said he as i am assured from your behavior that will never happen i hope your concern will cease i told you continued my father when i parted with you last that i would not let thee know the result of the interview till the morning but as we are reconciled i could not so long delay thee thy part of the satisfaction tomorrow in the morning thy mother thy master and all of us are to come into thy room to breakfast where i hope all animosities will cease on my side sir said i they were never begun nor ever shall without my temper and inclination should be inverted i believe there is no danger of that replied my father and so my good boy goodnight  as soon as my father was gone my master came in again billy said he i could not go to bed without seeing you to desire since your father and mother are reconciled to take no manner of notice of the discourse you and i had together concerning her if told him without any caution it should have been as secret as if no one had known it but himself i believe it said he yet i thought caution might have been necessary and so bid me goodnight  when i was once more left alone reflection began to be stronger than before and weighing according to my young judgment the affairs and condition of the family thought verily my circumstances would suffer by it i was in the midst of a thousand confused ungrateful thoughts when the surgeon came in to dress me and viewing my wound was very much surpised to see it look so angry i am afraid young gentleman said he you have met with something today that makes you uneasy or have tasted something that you should not have done which occasions this alteration in your hurt pray said he what have you had to eat today when i informed him that said he could never hurt you the alteration i perceive must proceed from some disturbance of mind and i value my patient so much that i must know the cause that i may speak to your father to have it remedied i found him so pressing that i was obliged to tell him some little accidents in the family had given me some uneasiness which were now reconciled and would soon be forgot yes said he i hear your father and mother are come to an agreement and i cannot say i am over well pleased at it for if she does not play him and all of you some trick i will be hanged i have reasons best known to myself for what i say  i am sorry said i you have any secret reason to suspect my mothers future conduct and without you disclose em to me i shall imagine they are chimaeras of your own brain that flow from your too much drinking for he was famed for a great toer or otherwise from her refusing you the cure of my brother jack for when my motherinlaw heard he was my surgeon her resentment run so high that she would not employ him  nothing of all this i can assure you returned the surgeon but i shall say no more at present till i have observed her future behavior and if she deserves it i shall disclose some things that will be very surprising o all of you i wish said i you would either have mentioned nothing of it now or would resolve to tell me what it is you know or i fear if you leave me in doubt it will not at all help me in the cure  i am sorry returned the surgeon i have inadvertently said any thing to make you uneasy but to reconcile you to your rest tonight be assured whenever i disclose it twill help you rather than injure you and though i have many follies i have discretion enough to keep this a secret till it shall prove advantageous to your father and you  i used many arguments to persuade him to let me know this great secret but all to no purpose so after he had dressed me he left me with more cause of uneasiness than i had before which i too plainly showed by my countenance the maid who attended me in my illness who was one that lived with my mother in her lifetime and had the bringing of me up told me i should not be uneasy at what the surgeon said he was nothing but a mere rattle for it was his usual way to make people imagine he knew something concerning their affairs and when he came to be strictly examined denied it all or made an excuse that he supposed he was drunk when he said so  what the maid said seemed probable enough yet i could not put it out of my head that notwithstanding his character there was something in his knowledge concerning our family  the thought of this with other affairs kept me from sleeping many hours and when i did it was broken and interrupted with frightful dreams in one i thought my mother invited my father and me to walk with her in a garden at the end there was a prodigious high mountain which we ascended with much difficulty and when we had gained the summit my mother gave my father a push down the brow of the mountain on the other side where my troubled fancy gave him for lost she then flew toward me and violently thrust me down the same way we came up i thought i fell to the bottom much bruised as also scratched by brambles and stones that lay in my way that the pain i felt awaked me i told my dream to the maid that sat up with me she replied it was nothing but a disturbed fancy with the pain of my hurt and begged i would compose myself to sleep which after some time i did  i reassumed my dream where i left off my sleeping imagination represented my mother on the brow of the hill hurling stones and clods of earth at me yet i thought none of em came near me to do me any damage and as she was endeavoring to come down the hill in order as i thought to hurt me she vanished away but i could not perceive which way she went upon the instant i awoke in a very great agony when i told the maid the cause of my uneasiness she laughed at me and said twas only formed from my uneasy thoughts whatever she could say to me upon the invalidity of dreams i could not put this out of my head nor go to sleep again and the rest of our discourse till morning was stories of dreams proving true which i had often heard repeated but she called those things visions i would have persuaded her mine was such but she laughed me out of it or at least i had discretion enough to say no more to her concerning it whatever were my thoughts about it  when the time of breakfast came my father entered the room and asked me how i had rested last night the maid answered for me that i had been disturbed by frightful dreams my father returned he had none of the best but continued he dreams were the only work of a disturbed fancy and were as far from truth as the glowworms dim shine from light and heat the creatures of the drowsy brain  but sir said i many have been forewarned by dreams of accidents that have happened to em witness calphurnias dream of the butchery of caesar and ceasars dream before he overcame pompey or that mentioned by valerius maximus of the two arcadians valerius maximus in his account of dreams gives this particular one two arcadians friends to each other traveling together came to the city of megara in the province of achaia formerly a dependant on the athenians one of em went to lodge at a friends house the other at a public inn the person that lay at his friends in his sleep fansyd he heard his companion call out for help from the violence of his landlord which awaked him and stamped such an impression on his mind that he rose and endeavored to find out the inn but fortune not allowing him that happiness he went to his lodging and addressed himself to sleep again laughing to himself that a dream should so much disturb him when sleep had once more taken possession of his faculties he dreamt that his friend came to his bedside covered with wounds who told him that since fate had not permitted him to prevent his end he hoped he would see his death revenged my body said the apparition is now carrying in a cart covered with rubbish out of the gate of the city by the innkeeper who murdered me for my money arise and bring him to the punishment he deserves the friendly arcadian at this second warning arose and taking assistance with him stopped the innkeeper with the cart where he found the bleeding body of his friend the man confessed his guilt and was executed accordingly  nothing child replied my father but the fancy of poets and historians and i hope you have understanding enough to slight em it is nothing but superstitious opinion that gives any credit to dreams and omens but continued he i would have thee put on a more pleasing countenance for thy mother brother and i are coming presently to breakfast with thee in order for a reconciliation on all hands and if she perceives that cloud upon thy face she will be apt to conjecture her presence is irksome to thee i replied i would do my endeavor to be composed as indeed i had reason but i told him i would ever have my face the index of my heart for i should find it a very hard task to counterfeit any passion well said my father smiling we shall be with you presently and went out  when he was gone i resolved to rise and put on my gown in order to receive such a visit decently though the maid would have dissuaded me i was but just dressed and set down in mv chair for i was not able to stand when my father mother and her son entered the chamber as soon as my mother came in she said to my father he had informed her i had kept my bed indeed my dear returned my father i am something surpised for i left him in bed not a quarter of an hour ago i answered that i thought it my duty to come as near my knees as i could and i hoped my mother would pardon the posture i was in but i threw an humble heart at her feet and hoped she would give me her blessing with her pardon heaven bless thee said she my dear and for pardon it is i ought to ask that of thee who have really offended but acknowledging a fault is the way to repentance and all my hope is we shall bury in oblivion past transactions she then brought my brother forward who told me with a cloudy countenance he begged my pardon and would do so no more i told him i had long since learnt to forget every thing for forgiveness was not a word became a childs mouth we all kissed round  when our mutual caresses were over i could perceive tears of joy stand in my fathers eyes for this our reconciliation and i imagined my mothers countenance looked with a pleasing contentment in it but alas it is hard to know the heart of woman a fair face with a smiling countenance often harbor rancour in the soul and as they study to set off their features they also study to make their face a mask to their mind  they staid with me some time nor perhaps had gone so soon if word had not been brought in that the surgeon was come to dress me my mother begged leave to retire telling me she had not courage enough to support the sight of my hurt so my father led her out and my brother followed em  immediately after the surgeon came in well said he i find all is right again i met your father leading your mother through the hall as if he had just begun to court her i wish it may hold on her side i hope there is no fear of it said i but i can assure you what you hinted to me yesterday has given me a great deal of uneasiness  think on it no more returned the surgeon think on it no more master i am very sorry i mentioned any thing to you and beg you would speak of it no more how said i do you endeavor to calumniate persons out of a whim of your brain and not expect to be called to an account for it i have been informed of your temper or rather the villainy of your opprobrious tongue and can farther assure you that the chimerical aspersions you would endeavor to fix upon my motherinlaw shall not go unpunished if my father retains his usual spirit unless you this moment tell the truth and either make out what you would insinuate or clear her by asking pardon for the injury you would have done her  the surgeon seemed very much in confusion during my speech to him which i observing did not doubt but it was as the maid said his constant custom to calumniate every body  i see said i by the confusion in your countenance you seemed to confess your error i will give you my word to mention what has past between you and i to no one on condition for the future you will leave off that vile custom of aspersing the characters of every body you know for it may prove of dangerous consequence to other people as well as yourself and it is a crime neither becoming a christian or a man  sir returned the surgeon i must own to you you have opened my eyes more by your discourse than all that i have ever had said to me upon the like occasion and the vile trick has crept upon me through custom for come where you will even all sexes ages and degrees are fond of hearing a little scandal and willing to know the frailties of their neighbors not considering the parasite to the next company makes as free with the last he came from and i must own the success i have met with or indeed the willingness of my hearers have often put me upon inventing stories to please my patients and their families but i now repent and am resolved never to be guilty of the like again and my repentance is owing to your advice after this he ran on with many encomiums of the ripeness of my understanding and a long rigmerole of nothing to the purpose but said he concerning your mother i know something that i am sure would cause great uneasiness in the family yet i beg you would not insist upon knowing any thing farther for the character i perceive i have got in the world would fly in my face and spoil my evidence till i can plainly prove what i say which if i ever see there is a necessity for it i can in a few days bring to pass i strove many ways to get something out of him but it proved to no purpose yet i verily believed he knew somewhat against the reputation of my motherinlaw  when he was gone i began to lose myself in confused thoughts and notions as i had formerly done which gave me vail uneasiness that led me to imagine my mothers conduct to my father and me all an artifice this put me upon a resolution of observing nicely her carriage that i might be able to form my behavior afterward  we lived very lovingly together a whole year and i began to bury all my fears imagining still the surgeon had wrongfully aspersed my mother therefore i applied myself hard to my studies with my tutor for since the first falling out my father would not let us go to school any more but provided a tutor for us in the house though he could make nothing of my brother john for he was resolved to remain a dunce which did not a little grieve both my father and mother but there was no remedy therefore john was resolved for behind the counter the time was fixed to put him apprentice to a mercer and me to the university i could easily perceive this resolution though both father and motherinlaw seemed to consent to it was a great grief to my mother and in a few days i was confirmed in it  at the end of our garden was a large summer house which i frequently made my place of study having just made an end of claudian i was going into the house to fetch another book but perceiving my mother at the end of one of the walks in order as i supposed to come into the summer house i stepped behind it that i might not meet her when she came near me i could perceive by her countenance she was mightily disturbed she staid in the walk for her maid a few minutes when she came to her they both went up into the summer house i found they were deep in discourse therefore must own i had curiosity enough to listen awhile but they spoke so low that i could only hear now and then a word but yet enough to pick out it concerned my brother john and my self  i had left my claudian above in the window of the summer house which my mother perceiving took it up ha said she this i suppose is some of the jackanapess books ay it is latin i believe it is his well i will take care he shall have reading enough i will warrant him and then spoke so low that i could not hear the rest i listened farther but whether they mistrusted somebody was near em or they were consulting something that was wicked i cannot tell but they spoke so low that i could not hear any thing but a continual humming between em  i went to my study but had no inclination to read my head run too much upon what i had heard and what i suggested the more i thought the more reason i had to be uneasy i sent a servant to the summer house for the book i had forgot when he returned i asked him if there was any body in the summer house he answered there was my lady and mrs betty in close conference and farther added they looked upon him with damned four countenances for disturbing em as he supposed  i found every thing concurred with my thoughts which added very much to my discontented mind when my tutor came in he perceived by my looks my spirits were discomposed and pressing me to know the reason i told him i was not very well at supper for my tutor being a gentleman of a good family that had suffered many misfortunes in the world my father allowed him the privilege of eating with us he desired my father to order me a little physic for i had complained i was indisposed my father pressed me to take it on the next morning but i told him it was nothing but too much reading and i should be well presently but if i found myself worse i would take physic in a day or two ay says my mother whether you are better or no you ought to take physic this springtime and johnny shall take some along with you so it was agreed in two days to take it and word was sent to the apothecarys accordingly though i resolved with myself not to take any as believing i wanted none mine being an illness of the mind when the time came the doses were sent us but i conveyed mine away without taking it  at dinner my mother seemed as i thought to look through me and asked me many questions concerning the operation i answered her as i thought proper as she asked her maid who always waited on her alone for a glass of wine i observed she looked upon her with an odd sort of a countenance the maid seemed to return her another look which plainly told me there was a meaning between em but the discourse was turned on another subject as being not altogether so proper at dinner yet every now and then my mother would come out with  sure billy you did not take your physic i confidently told her i did though i abhor a lie many odd looks passed every moment between the mistress and the maid during dinner when it was ended they both went up into her dressing room i could not help following em with my eyes and secretly wished i could have been near enough to hear their conversation but as that could not be i was obliged to be contented without it  in a little time my mother came down again after some short stay in the dining room my father mother brother john and i as usual went to walk in the garden john as was his custom ran scampering before and played many of his childish tricks why billy said my father why dont you do as your brother jacky does twill make you strong and lusty all study will spoil you weaken your constitution ay and impair your health so it will replied my good mother i dont think he has a good state of health for he seems to me as if he were in a consumption observe how pale he looks ay but returned my father that may be his physic i dont know but it may says she but if i might advise he should take more in a few days as well as jacky for i am assured twill do em good nay further my dear said she to my father i intend to see billy take his for it runs in my head he made away that he was to take in the morning for i know he hates physic i endeavored to convince her of the contrary which she seemed to believe  the time drew near that we were to take physic again and i was putting my invention on the stretch how to avoid it for i found she had resolved to be by when we were to take it which accordingly happened when she gave me mine i let it slip out of my hand upon the ground this put her into such a passion that she gave me a box on the ear but in a little time after she begged my pardon kissed me put her hand to her purse and gave me half a guinea desiring i would forget it i promised her i would though i really could not  when my father came in she told him in a merry manner i was resolved not to take any physic for the young rogue said she let it slip through his fingers which convinces me he played the same trick with that the other morning i told my father it was purely accident well well billy said my motherinlaw let it be what it will we shall take care of the next i warrant you i dont know when that can be my dear said my father for he must go to his uncles this afternoon who begs to see him and i cannot tell when he will return my mother made no answer to it but seemed to be in much confusion  i was very well pleased to go to my uncles not only to get rid of my mothers physic but to see him who was more indulgent to me than my own father and it was thought by every one that i should be his heir for he was an old bachelor and never intended to marry  while i was in my study pleasing myself with the thoughts of going to my uncles my father came in to me billy said he thy mother has convinced me it is necessary you should take physic before you go so that i have sent an excuse to your uncle and let him know you will wait on him in two or three days at farthest i was confounded at what he said yet i answered him what he pleased i could not tell him what i thought of my mother and that i believed she intended to give me something to injure me for as it could not be proved it would look only like fear or malice so i even set myself to think how to avoid it  at last i thought to get a phial the same size of that she brought me in the morning and fill it with something near the color which seemed to me to be a dark brown but then the difficulty would be how to put the change upon her in the morning i had prepared my phial and when my mother was going to pour it into a glass for me to drink i begged she would be pleased to let me drink it out of the phial for the sight of it in a glass turned my stomach against it ay my dear with all my heart any how so thou do but take it replied my good mother when i had got it i put the change upon her and drank what i had prepared my mother seemed mightily pleased taking her leave of me with a it is a good child keep thyself warm my dear when she was gone i went into my study and began to examine the bottle my mother would have had me taken i found it had no ill smell but as i had not any inclination to taste it i had thoughts of trying the experiment upon some dumb creature but could not find in my heart to be so cruel yet had a vast inclination to know its effects at last i resolved to give it to a greyhound bitch whose surliness had given me occasion enough not to have any great compassion for her i did not think it proper to do it in the house so took my opportunity to wheedle her into the stable when no one was there but going to open her jaws to pour it into her mouth she flew at me and ran away in the surprise i let the phial fall out of my hand which broke with the fall i was very uneasy i could not make proof of what i designed for i knew it would be to no purpose to discover my suspicions only  when dinnertime came i was called down and observed the confusion of faces were increased between the mistress and the maid insomuch that my father could not help taking notice of it pray my dear what has betty said my father done for you look at her as if she had committed some great crime what i warrant she has not washed your headcloaths to please you or some such trifle she knows what she has done said my motherinlaw well enough but i dont think it worth my while to be angry about it well but dont give her such sour look then returned my father but pardon her you will spoil her stomach to her dinner child my father went on in a jocose manner all dinnertime yet notwithstanding now and then looks past between em that no body could interpret but myself or at least i thought i could i see my dear cried my father the peace is not made up between you give me leave to be the judge in this matter but first let me know the case come betty continued my father you seem to be the offender confess your crime and that is the way to find pardon the sooner why sir returned the maid i have forgot to wash my mistresss laced pinners for which she has been angry with me all this morning and is this the full and whole history of her crime my dear said my father to my motherinlaw yes returned the good woman why then i proceed to judgment said my father  you mrs betty not having the fear of god before your eyes etc here my father ran on with the whole sentence that a judge repeats to one arraigned for murder and during the time of speaking i observed betty to be very much startled shall for your punishment before you sleep wash and starch these same headcloaths and in so doing it shall remain as a sufficient punishment for your heinous crime though you know you deserve much worse and be sure for the future you are never guilty of the like betty promised in a great deal of confusion to mend for the future  the next day was designed for me to wait on my uncle and though i had a great desire to go yet i was not satisfied i was in various minds sometimes i fully intended to inform my father with my suspicions with all the circumstances and grounds for it but then again i considered my suspicions might strengthen my opinion and they might be really innocent while i was wrapped in my cogitations i observed my mother and her maid were going into the garden and i did not doubt but they would get into the summer house in order to another conference i slipped into the garden and got to my hiding place behind the jessaminehedge before they came as soon as they were up the stairs of the summer house my mother asked her maid if she were assured there was no one in the garden she told her no nor none could come in but she could perceive em from the window where she sat  what can be the meaning said my mother that this devilish brat does not feel the effects of what he has taken i am afraid either the apothecary or you have betrayed me madam returned the maid i can assure you we are both innocent of your suspicion as for his part he does not know who or what it is for yet madam i dont doubt but you will be surprised at what i am going to say to you  i would not continued betty be guilty of what before dinner i made no scruple of for the whole world if you had observed my countenance while my master was judging my fictitious crime with the formal introductions in cases of murder you might have read my guilt in my face i am assured master billy observed me most heedfully and to my thinking his eyes told me he knew my real crime in the intention i was some time before i could recover my confusion and i then weighed in the scales of justice the reason of your resentment o him and found the intention to be the utmost wickedness and i thanked my god our nhuman designs had not taken effect you see heaven is displeased and shows the abhorrence of the fact by hindering the effect i looked in his face during the latter part of dinner and wondered how we could plot to take away the life of so mucn innocence that never injured us i thank heaven my eyes are opened nor even the worst of torments should make me once think of such a crime therefore let me beg of you my dear mistress to forget it bury even the thought of it consider the crime murder is the greatest sin against god it is even striking at him by murdering his image let my repentance be as the alarm to yours i am sure if you will give yourself time to think your conscience must awake and teach you to abhor the crime no one knows our wicked intention but allseeing heaven which will pardon us on a sincere repentance we are obliged to keep each others counsel therefore let me conjure you by the love you ought to owe your husband by your duty to heaven which i should have mentioned first by the worth of your eternal soul by the affection you ought to owe your children for those of your husbands must be yours since you are but one consider what it is to have a clear and a quiet conscience it is the only happiness on this side the grave it is that which sweetens all the ills of life the innocent will be happy let fortune empty her quiver of malice on em if the weight of this will have no consideration with you think on the welfare of this world if you can lull to sleep your conscience murder has many tongues to speak even things inanimate have divulged the guilty and when once revealed think on the punishment that must follow i beg madam take some little time to ruminate on what i have said before you answer me weigh it well for it is of the last importance for though a poor ignorant weak woman you will find what i utter to be the oracle of heaven  here betty paused as expecting an answer and during the interval of speech the agonies i felt at the intended wickedness were next to death itself after about a minutes silence my mother spoke as follows  betty words can hardly speak the torments of my mind yet i have this to comfort me it is in repentance to set my soul at rest and i do repent from the bottom of my heart what a fiend had i entertained in my breast how very near the brink of hell his proper habitation had he brought me thou were my guardianangel that saved me from destruction to heaven and thee i owe my thanks now this fury is gone forth my bosom i think with thee how it could be possible to harbor such a hellish thought against the poor child but now i feel reviving love even equal to that of my own son i long to embrace and kiss him with a real mothers fondness  the joy i felt at this declaration had almost made me discover myself and it was hard to keep my legs from running to my mother to accept the longedfor blessing but reason got the better of my transport that told me i ought to conceal from all the world my knowledge of the whole affair while i was in my musing i could hear betty say madam my masters coming up the walk i beg you will compose yourself i will do what i can replied my motherinlaw but no one can imagine what torments i feel then sit here madam said betty for here it is dark and my master cannot perceive your disorder my mother as i supposed removed to the place she desired her immediately after my father came in and asked em if they had seen me for they had been searching me all over the house but could not find me my brothers man said my father is waiting for him my mother replied i had not been there but must certainly be in the study no said my father he is not there neither can i imagine where he can be and the not finding him makes me very uneasy  upon saying this my father went up and down the walks calling me when he had left the two women betty cried out i hope in heaven my repentance is accepted and he has not now felt the effect of the poison you fright me out of my senses returned my mother let us run to seek him away they went when i was certain they were out of sight i clamberd over the wall and came in the street way just as my mother with her maid came out of the garden as soon as my mother met me she clasped me about the neck and kissed me with as much transport as if i had been her own son which affected me in such a manner i could not help weeping with excess of satisfaction what means these tears my child said my mother madam said i be not offended they are tears of joy to see you so kind bless thee my dear boy returned my mother i hope always to prove so  when my father came in he asked me where i had been i told him only to take a walk in the fields after my physic we thought we had lost you said my father and were sending for the crier to cry a great boy of fifteen years of age but come continued he mount your uncles man waits for you and has done this hour your things shall be there tomorrow morning i begged leave only to pack up a few books and i would wait on him instantly  as i was in my study putting together what i intended to take with me betty came up to me well sir said me how do you find yourself after your physic better than was expected this morning betty said i i am very glad on it replied betty i now believe you are said i but there is a great alteration since morning and i hope it will continue while i said this i looked steadfastly in her face she observing me blushed very much come betty said i it is never too late to repent repent sir replied betty of what of doing ill i returned or even thinking ill i had but an ill opinion of you this morning but i have reason to think i have done you wrong and i ask you pardon be satisfied i can sometimes read peoples thoughts why then said betty if it be so you know you have no reason to ask my pardon for i am sure you never offended me but if i have ever offended you i ask you and heaven pardon and i hope i shall obtain both be assured you will i replied she seeing me ready to go down took her leave of me modestly begging leave to kiss me as i was going away sir said she if we both are alive ten year hence and i have the honor to see you i may make you acquainted with something very extraordinary nothing but what i partly understand already i returned keep in the honest path you are in then heaven will bless you  i got on horseback after taking leave of the family and observed betty in much confusion i shook my head at her with a smile and rid away  when i arrived at my uncles which was about fourteen miles from my fathers i was told by the servants he was gone out a little way not expecting me so soon but he would return in a quarter of an hour during his stay a coach came to the door with a couple of old ladies and a young one about thirteen years of age the beautifullest creature my eyes ever beheld i could not help gazing upon her with a great deal of delight they came to visit my uncle but finding he was gone out would not stay i looked after the coach which carried this young angel away as far as ever i could see and began to feel a certain tenderness which people i thought of my years had but little knowledge of  i was pleasing myself with the charming idea when my uncle came in who expressed a great deal of satisfaction to see me after the first civilities were over i told him there was a coach with some ladies to wait upon him but not meeting with him at home would not come in my uncle being a merry jocose man said to me sirrah you should have done the duties of my house and made em come in but who were they i told him i could not tell but the servant replied they were my lady  her sister and daughter odso you young dog returned my uncle there would be a fine wife if you had but money enough she is an heiress and will be worth fifty thousand pounds well sir said i when i think on marriage i must not turn my thoughts that way no why so replied my uncle a woman with a fortune is as soon got as one without and when i die you dont know what may happen  sir said i if i never marry till i wish your death i hope to live single a great while i believe thee will said my uncle but it is time enough to talk of these things ten year hence i would have no man marry till they are past twenty nor women till past sixteen i wonder sir said i you never thought of that state why you young rogue so i have replied my uncle so much on it that i resolve to live single all my life and i am of the opinion few people marry only to better their condition that is a little too hard sir said i do you imagine no one marries for love o yes a great many replied my uncle but it does not last long lovers have large stomachs but are soon cloyed they very often surfeit the first meal i told him my mother his sister i thought loved my father till the day of her death she was contented i believe replied my uncle but come young man this discourse is a little too wise for one of your years not at all said i uncle i hope you will not take it ill if i declare your notions of matrimony will not hinder me to try my fortune when my inclination serves and a good match should offer no said my uncle i hope to see thee wedded to a good fortune before i die therefore i intend to carry thee to my lady s  and there you may grow acquainted with the young lady your age is much the same and your correspondence may be continued as your years increase beside i would have you have some place to go to for it would be hard to have nothing but an old musty uncle to converse with age does not very well agree with youth  our conversation lasted much longer upon this topic and it might have lasted longer than it did if supper had not come in to stop my uncles mouth his housekeeper sat down at supper with us which i thought a little odd but i soon found how matters went and young as i was i could perceive madam was mistress of the family she appeared extremely civil to me even as i thought too civil for her behavior seemed to say observe i am mistress of the house and it is to me you are beholden for your entertainment  the next day i could not help hinting to my uncle something of his housekeepers behavior why billy said my uncle this woman is a good woman in her way and i should be at a great loss without her for as i have many servants and being a single man i should be but a scurvy manager of em now this woman being prudent and discreet knows how to manage such a kennel of wild hounds as i am forced to keep out of state indeed for i have not service for em half but a man of fortune must live something answerable to it or he will be despised by his neighbors once a man has got in that road he must not get out of it again  sir said i i beg your pardon for being so inquisitive and may be impertinent billy replied my uncle you may say and do just what you will here for i would have you to understand this house and all that is in it is not only yours when i die but the estate that belongs to it which is upward of two thousand pounds a year and to convince you of it i design to make my will forthwith i have so much confidence in you to believe i shall never have occasion to alter it i beg you sir said i dont talk of making of wills and death it is a melancholy subject and whatever you will be pleased to leave me will not compensate the grief i should feel for the loss of so good an uncle why you fool replied my uncle i believe you but i hope a man is never the nearer death for talking on it or making his will  we were interrupted in our discourse by a servants giving my uncle a letter which he read to himself and smiled here said my uncle read that there is a billet whose style may be altogether new to you it is wrote by a young lady and a fine lady though dictated by an old one i took it and read as follows mr ironface we all think you a goodfornothing fusty old fellow as indeed all old batchelors are which is the only motive prevails upon us to forgive your being abroad yesterday when we came to wait upon your worship however you must not expect absolution before you have done penance which is to come and dine with us to day and stay as long as we shall think fit your compliance shall bespeak some favor from  your enraged judges minos rhadamanthus and aeacus     a very merry free epistle indeed sir said i it is the style said my uncle we use in writing to one another and if any other form should pass between us we should fansy each other offended at something but come youth continued my uncle you must smug up yourself and go along with me for this is the place i intend to bring you acquainted in for now they have honored me with the title of knight of the shire i am now and then obliged to be with some bottlecompanions which will not altogether agree with your age or constitution so that i hope you will like the company i shall provide for you and though the one is the mother and the other aunt to the young creature i was speaking of yet they are neither of em forty the one is a widow and the other an old maid if we may call her one at eight and thirty but she has nothing of the stiffness or formality of that state but is as easy and goodhumored as if she had lost that weighty burden a maidenhead twenty year ago and what is more surprising resolves to die a maid except some brawny rascal does her the favor to ravish her the widow and mother to the young lady has been in the state of widowhood near fourteen year for her daughter was posthumousborn yet though she is mistress of a vast fortune and consequently been sought by many in marriage for money is the loadstone that draws all the world yet she resolves never to change her state these three with their family live as contentedly as any three in the universe it is here i go when i have a mind to be innocently merry without bringing any scandal to the family because i am an old fellow they have fitted up an apartment for me in particular and i very often stay all night sir said i i suppose the reason why the widow does not marry again is the love she bears to the memory of her former husband rather i believe the vexation she received from him replied my uncle hinders her for i have heard her often say he used to lead her a damned sort of life and his behavior to her has confirmed the sister in the same mind she often declares to me in her thoughts the best of husbands are but plagues which i return by imagining the same thing by the wives so we strengthen each others opinion by our conversation which is something odd you will say  but i forget continued my uncle that i am talking to a schoolboy all this time sir i returned whatever you say to me shall do me no injury but rather improve my understanding things of moment i shall justly weigh and what is not necessary to be remembered shall be forgot my uncle made me many compliments of my forward sense but at the tag of all to qualify em told me ripe fruit was soon rotten and so we both went to equip ourselves for our short journey  in the coach my uncle told me i should do well to ingratiate myself with the family for if i was ever to enter into the matrimonial state i could not do better for myself for added he though marriage is a very bitter pill yet there is gold enough to gild it over and a handsome young lady toboot i told him whenever that time came i should value his advice at the highest rate come come replied the old gentleman i dont love compliments they savor of insincerity i returned my tongue and heart ever did and i hoped ever would go together and whatever i said it should be truth ay but boy answered the old gentleman you know the old saying truth is not to be spoke at all times many a poor man has suffered for speaking truth  when we came to the end of our short journey the two sisters who were both comely women came to the gate to bid us welcome the young lady they gave us to understand was walking in the garden when we were brought into the parlour after the usual civilities my uncle told em he had brought along with him a person that he designed one of their acquaintance and if they balkd his intention he threatened em severely with his indignation the ladies replied i should be welcome upon my own account without his recommendation well well replied my uncle i dont care how it is done so it is done but hold cried the aunt will not it be something dangerous to allow him the conversation and acquaintance of isabella meaning the young lady he will perhaps in time wipe away from her memory the good advice against matrimony we have taken much time and labor to inculcate  fear not that replied my uncle for i have and shall take as much pains with the youth that they may be on a footing upon this the young lady came in to whose acquaintance i was introduced though she was the handsomest creature my eyes ever beheld the charms of her person were equaled by those of her understanding and i soon found young as i was love had taken full possession of my heart  the conversation of the day was chiefly composed of mirth and laughing at former transactions which were larded every now and then with contempt upon the connubial state and i was almost ready to die with despair to hear the fair isabella join with em with more than ordinary malice and satyr  my uncle desired she would not be so inveterate for she was taking the only method for him to fall directly in love with her and that is the only way replied the sister to get rid of your troublesome company i told the lady i hoped my uncle would not prove troublesome till such a declaration i believe not young gentleman replied the lady but i fear there is much more danger from your worship than your uncle your years will bring you forward but his will make him lag behind i told her i should always endeavor to keep myself in the good graces of that family and that nothing but destiny should make me forfeit it  oh then returned the lady if it ever comes to that the fault must be laid on destiny fate ill stars and i know not what i tell you continued the sister smiling if your years did not plead for you i should begin to think you guilty i must own though this was but rallying i could not help blushing at what she said as knowing myself a criminal already  bedtime broke up our company and every one retired to their several apartments when i was alone reflection began to make me very uneasy the blind god had wounded me though not so deep as if i had more years over my head yet enough to break my rest and trouble and confuse my young imagination i got up at the dawn of day as uneasy as i went to bed and walked in the garden alone for none of the family were stirring all my thoughts were busied on the fair object of my wishes i continued in my uneasy contemplation several hours  the first that interrupted my meditations was the charmer of my heart who came to me with a smiling countenance i am informed sir said she you were early up this morning i fear you did not like your lodging there is nothing in this house i replied but what i have the utmost regard for but i continued it was my usual custom of rising early to my studies we fell insensibly into the affairs of the family for i had not courage once to mention what i felt within my breast neither did i imagine she could have a right conception of what my inclination would have declared to her among other things i told her we should have the world unpeopled if every body was of her mother aunt and my uncles mind she replied there was no danger of that for the men would find means to have heirs to their estates without troubling the parson  i was a little confused at her answer for i imagined she insinuated i was designed my uncles heir and therefore could hardly make her an answer for my uncle told me when he mentioned making his will that i was the first that knew his inclination and gave me a particular charge to keep it a secret from every one till he himself divulged it it was some time before i could recover my confusion for i was not assured they might not hint something of it to my uncle and do me a prejudice with him not as to the estate for i little regarded my interest but fearing i was not capable of keeping a secret even of the utmost consequence  the young lady finding she had created some confusion in my thoughts began to comfort me with telling me my uncles mind might alter and tho he was stiff in his opinion concerning matrimony did not doubt but his eyes would be open enough to see merit where it was so conspicuous her endeavoring to bring me out of confusion plunged me farther into it and sometimes i was thinking she was uttering riddles and i knew not how to answer upon the topic but at last i told her whatever my uncle should think fit to do concerning his worldly affairs should never trouble me while he continued to do things correspondent with honor and honesty i am very glad to hear it replied the young lady and i fansy young gentlemen like you who study much acquire understanding fortitude and resolution and all other manly virtues before their years write em men madam i replied in some it might be so but i had made no progress in any of em but one and that i feared will be rather counted a weakness  i fansy then returned the lady since you own it a frailty you will make me your confessor and if i judge it to be as you call it a weakness i will tell you what penance you shall undergo for pardon madam i replied you are the only person in the world that i will confess to but then you must promise me like a true confessor to keep it for ever a secret from all the world whether it displeases you or not though i am under dismal apprehensions of losing your favor more dear to me than all the world  heyday replied isabella if we were not both too young i should imagine you were going to make love to me madam i answered you have guessed the very secret of my heart the tender thoughts my breast contains are all for you dont think it a boyish passion apt to change for whatever usage i meet with from you i must continue to adore you i have weighed our years yours and your familys aversion to matrimony by your yesterdays discourse and no consideration can put a stop to my passion all the favor i ask or desire is only leave silently to adore you and if you find your heart averse to my constant wishes let me beg you to grant me pity for all that i shall suffer and i shall rejoice at every pang i feel because they are for you i am convinced your understanding far exceeds your years therefore i entreat you to think beyou speak and consider this it is in your power alone to make me live or die i own our fortunes are at present unequal but time may produce many things inspired by you i would aim at every thing that is honorable to deserve you that way nor should i doubt succeeding i said every thing my tongue could utter prompted by love and had this satisfaction to observe her face was not dressed in frowns after many rallying speeches finding me continue in my distress  well said she as i promised to be your confessor i will keep it a secret as we agreed on and perhaps if i thought you in earnest i should think of some punishment equal to what your crime deserves but you have been reading ovid lately i suppose and you would be endeavoring to put some of his rules in practice upon me it is a pleasing satisfaction to me i replied to hear you understand ovid so well and by your choice i hope you will remember all his rules what returned the young lady because i have read that author as our english translators have given him to us for i own i am not so happy to understand the original would you interpret for me that i like the subject no continued isabella i have read reynolds on murder and yet i hope you will believe i abhor the facts related there i hope fo too madam i replied therefore you will consider that what my tongue uttered was from the very bottom of my soul and if you will not receive my declaration favorably you will be the death of me which will make you a passive murderer  few people i believe die for love in this age replied isabella however our years will protect both of us i told her the tree that took deepest root stood the longest yes returned isabella and the impressions cut in young barks soonest wear out and often kill the tree madam said i well well cried isabella we have had enough on this subject for once madam said i does the word once imply you would pardon me whenever fortune will give me another opportunity of declaring my passion i have not time now to answer you said isabella for i perceive your uncle my mother and aunt are coming toward us but i thought her words were accompanied with so sweet a look that bid me hope and hope is all the pleasure of our lives  when we had joined company we were the theme of the old folks raillery for some time hark you young man said my uncle how came you to rise so early this morning only because i do it every morning sir said i to read why sirrah said my uncle if i had thought you had brought a book along with you here i would have taken it from you and burnt it is not here contemplation enough for you pointing to the ladies yes sir replied the mother i think he does well to have something to entertain his thoughts alone for i dont much relish the young ones getting together so early i dont well know how they could entertain themselves without talking of love why if we should replied isabella twoud be only to fortify each other against that passion well well said the aunt your ages secure you at present but i should be loath to trust you five or six years hence ay but said my uncle will studies the mathematics and he knows every thing of geography and navigation already but just going to sea and can tell you in what latitude the cape of good hope lies under though he was never there he has all the theory and only wants the practice  none of your allegories replied the mother i have a very good opinion of the young gentleman therefore hold your tongue for what you can say for him will only lessen it come come the tea stays for us said the aunt i am glad on it cried my uncle for now we shall have a little scandal tea has no relish without it  my uncle having no business at home we continued in this agreeable company three whole days and though we were to receive a visit from them in two more yet the separation from that i held most dear on earth was very irksome to me but the hope of seeing her so soon mitigated my grief  when we came home to my uncles i observed a youth walking in the garden very near my own age as i could guess at the distance i saw him for as soon as he perceived me he walked another way as not being willing i should see him i asked one of the servants that happened to be in the garden who that youth was i just before saw at the fountain he replied it was the housekeepers son what is the housekeeper married then said i not now replied the servant and smiled observing the humor of the man by his countenance i asked him many questions concerning the housekeeper and her child but could not learn who was the father positively yet he gave me hints enough to imagine my uncle had some interest in the affair which created in me a great deal of uneasiness for it soon occurred to my memory what the divine isabella told me in her mothers garden that heirs to estates might be procured without the help of the parson my uneasiness did not proceed from any disappointment relating to the estate any farther than i thought it might have reconciled me to isabellas family for i imagined if ever i could move her heart to love me she would as much despise riches as myself for even young as i was i could have been contented to have got my subsistence from my daily labor if isabella would have submitted to have shared my fortune for i never once thought of hers but i wished it much less or rather none at all that i might have been more on the equality  while i was musing on the state of my love i was interrupted by my uncles housekeeper who with a familiar air inquired concerning our entertainment at the widows i found by her discourse the poor creature was jealous of my uncle and to increase her opinion i told her i fansyd we should shortly have a wedding for it looked very like it between whom asked the housekeeper hastily why between my uncle and the widow i answered i observed her countenance change at what i said and a very great disorder appeared about her but i did not think fit to have any further conversation with her so left her to her own disordered thoughts  when my uncle and i were together he asked me how i liked the young lady for he had not an opportunity to ask me in the coach as we came home because we brought a neighboring gentleman home with us that came to make a visit at the widows i told him i had a very great regard for her and i did not doubt but my years would increase it i would advise you said my uncle to make your addresses there but secretly for i am convinced you will not meet with a more beneficial match i answered my uncle i was of his opinion though not from the greatness of her fortune but from the charms of her person and understanding why i would have you affect what you marry but i hope you dont imagine young man said my uncle a good fortune will be any hindrance not in the least sir said i but i would have no two join in that holy ceremony if they could not despise fortune well well replied my uncle experience will tell you another tale when you have a few years more over your head which is now filled with notions of honor and i know not how many chimerical ideas that have their being in thy brain you read too much  i hope sir said i reading is designed to cultivate the understanding and raise our imaginations above the vulgar i am of the opinion a man of quality with a plebeian soul is a plebeian and on the contrary a plebeian with exalted merit ought to change fortunes with him but you forget with all your learning and philosophy that fortunes blind young man replied my uncle and distributes her favors as blindly i have seen dullness and stupidity in a coach and six while virtue merit and a whole library of learning walk on foot the more shame to the degenerate age you will say young man true sir said i and if i had a fortune answerable to my inclination i would never see one of those you mentioned last twice in the same condition  dont think replied my uncle that i am endeavoring to blot out those notions of virtue that i see wrote in thy soul for it is on the consideration of thy noble inclinations that i have lately resolved in my will to leave thee a considerable fortune being assured thou will make the right use of it the bulk of my estate was left me by an uncle an old bachelor as i am which i intend to leave to thee in the same manner neither can i think thy good understanding boy continued my uncle will receive any prejudice from our contempt of the marriage state though the reason why i have not changed my condition is that the first object of my wishes was by fate denied me but i suppose you have heard your father often repeat the story never in my life i replied for i have been at school ever since five years old and very seldom conversed with any of the family and i may justly say sir that i am almost as great a stranger in the knowledge of my ancestors as one that never heard of us well then said my uncle i will let you into as much as i know of em  we are originally welsh many of our ancestors have flourished in the church as well as state and left a sweet scent of virtue in their ashes i was the youngest of three the eldest dying in the wars when he had gained many everliving laurels your father proved heir to the estate who is one year elder than myself my fathers brother having acquired a great estate by merchandise in the indies and having an inclination for me always declared me his heir and i lived with him as such therefore i think it almost your due to be heir to mine about the age of seventeen i fell in love with a young lady of a very small fortune but that was supplied by the charms of her mind and person her mother for her father had been dead many years was averse to my passion she would often tell her daughter i was but a younger brother and though every body imagined i was to be heir to my uncle yet no body was assured of it old men were as subject to change their minds as young ones therefore she would by no means consent to my courtship but when she found i continued my addresses she secretly informed my uncle who took me to task on the other side with many arguments proved i should be much to blame to think of a woman of such a narrow fortune when in prospect i was master of such a large one and hinted to me if i continued in my folly as he called it i might be balkd of my expectation  though my love was as great as could be yet i thought it was but common prudence to dissemble and i told my uncle i hoped i should never give him any occasion to forfeit the good opinion he had already conceived of me he gave me very good advice which i promised to follow but every thing must submit to love fortune interest relations and friendship must give way to that soft passion and i doubt not young man notwithstanding your learning and pretended fortitude but time will convince you of what i say i sighed and was in some confusion at my uncles discourse but made him no answer because i would not interrupt him  by secret interviews continued my uncle i gained the heart of the young lady unbiased by her interest for in the mean time she was courted by a gentleman possessed of a fortune much beyond the hopes of her family who soon gained the mothers consent and being an obstinate woman she promised him her daughters in the mean time we met almost every night by the help of the maid who by bribes and promises was in my interest and one evening among the rest i took possession of the willing fair one  our amors were not so secret as we imagined for my rival being informed of our correspondence though he had no notion how far our intimacy was carried sent me a challenge which i accepted of though unwillingly for i am of that opinion mens honor often prompts em on to those acts their consciences and wills would leave undone we met and fortune declared in my favor by dangerously wounding my adversary without my receiving the least hurt the mother to the fair one was exasperated to the last degree and in the heat of her blind rage took her daughter along with her to visit her intended soninlaw where she agreed notwithstanding his wounds and her daughters cries and lamentations to marry em immediately which was performed  you may guess what we both felt at this shock of fate for possession had heightened my passion i tore and raved like a madman and was almost inconsolable and nothing but the regard i owed my uncle kept me from doing some rash act but time that cures most sorrows gave me some consolation as imagining i should have still a correspondence with the disconsolate fair one for her continued sorrow convinced me she mourned for the same cause  i took an opportunity and got a letter conveyed to her but what was my surprise and sorrow at her answer i have read it so often and it is so well imprinted in my memory that i can repeat it verbatim  sir though i love you more than life which i am convinced i shall not long keep yet the duty i owe my husband shall prevent any future interviews strive to forget me as i willingly would you though impossible and never more think there ever was such a wretch as the unfortunate  maria   i strove many ways to come to a better understanding but she as carefully avoided it i lingered out many days in this interval of life if i may call it so for i could not say i was alive one morning her maid brought me a letter and though i offered her gold to stay the reading of it yet she would not the contents of this last were as surprising as the first  my dear i am now going i firmly believe into another world to answer for my miscarriages in this for i find the pangs of childbirth upon me which i hope and am almost assured i shall not outlive it is the fruit of our guilty joys let me conjure you if the infant should survive find some means to prove a father for it can not expect any other in this world and cherish the memory of your unfortunate  maria   i was so far plunged in grief at the knowledge of her state that i went into the fields to have more freedom for contemplation and though it was morning when i received the letter i had not thought of returning if the curtain of the night had not began to spread the hemisphere but ere i could get out of the fields i heard somebody walk very fast behind me and turning about i was somewhat surpised to see the husband of maria with his sword drawn in his hand as ready to attack me though i was weary of life i had no thought of rendering it to one i had no very kind thoughts for yet i was resolved to parley with him and do my endeavor to bring him to temper for i considered he had matter enough to gall him but words signified nothing and he pressed so violently upon me that i was obliged to oppose him and in a little time left him dead upon the ground  i immediately got home to my uncles who waited for me and was going to chide me but seeing me look so pale and confused and without my sword for in the last thrust that gave him his death he fell down toward me and i let it fall out of my hand and his body fell upon it he very tenderly asked me the cause of my concern when i had informed him well said my uncle be not so troubled since you have killed him fairly i will warrant thy pardon but were there any witnesses of the action several said i on the other side of the river though i know not who they were i was in so much confusion however he deserved death said my uncle for killing the unfortunate maria and her innocent infant i did not hear what more my uncle said for the use of my senses was taken from me and i fell into a swoon yet when i recovered i found myself in bed for my uncle imagining i had received some wound in the encounter ordered a surgeon to be brought but when he was informed of the truth he was convinced that twas pure grief that had overcome me and almost compelled me to be let blood i was in such a condition that despair had got the ascendant over me and had resolved with myself not to live and in order to put my design in execution being informed my uncle was gone out upon some urgent affairs i ordered my man to go to another surgeon of my acquaintance and bring him along with him which was quickly done i then took an occasion to send my servant out of the way and desired the surgeon to let me blood in the other arm which he complied with not knowing i had been let blood before  as soon as he was gone i undid both the bandages the blood poured out of my veins and i soon became insensible heaven forgive me for i now declare i had no other thought but following my dear mistress whom it was plain i loved more than life which that day would have put an end to if it had not been purely for an accident for the last surgeon meeting with him that first bled me among other discourse told him he was going to see how i did after my bleeding by the order of my uncle who was obliged to go out and that he was to stay with me till his return  the last surgeon in a sort of surprise told him he had not been long come from me and had let me blood and soon finding there must be some extraordinary meaning in my proceeding came both together and broke open the door that i had locked before i let loose my arms i was so far gone that they gave my uncle no hopes of life which i was informed almost put him into my condition twas two whole days ere i opened my eyes and three more before i recovered my understanding and the thoughts of the catastrophe of my dear maria had made me resolve to take nothing to support life if i had not been prevailed upon by my uncle whose sorrow quite confounded me and a religious man who set before me the heinous sin of selfmurder a sin he told me could never be pardoned for it was directly flying in the face of heaven without a possibility of repenting the action  the thoughts of eternity made me repent of the act and resolve to live by degrees i recovered my former strength and meeting one day with marias maid by accident i desired she would give me some account of the melancholy action  sir said she when my poor mistress felt the pangs and throes of labor upon her she wrote that letter and ordered me to return upon the instant i had delivered it for she should want me in her unhappy condition when i came back i found her pains grew worse when i found how it was i told her i would go and send for the midwife do then said she for though i wish for death the poor innocent has done nothing to deserve it that may live to meet with a better fate than its unhappy mother and in her utmost pangs she softly uttered your name the midwife came and she was delivered after great agonies of a fine girl whose early features promised to exceed her mothers beauty  marias mother and the rest of her relations were in the utmost confusion at what they saw for seeing it a beautiful fullgrown child they were well convinced the husband was not the father of it the mother came up to her and notwithstanding her weak condition gave her all the ill language she could think of the poor lady at last faintly told her it was her own fault to force her to that marriage that she was joined to you by heaven and she believed she had no guilt to answer for what she had done for she had ever lived with her husband virtuously and ceased all correspondence with you since the day of her unfortunate marriage which i witnessed for her in the letter she had wrote to you she was brought to bed pretty early in the morning her husband was gone to hunt with some gentlemen of the country but when he returned he soon came to the truth of every thing for there was no concealing how matters went is is so cried he all enraged and am i an antedated cuckold i will have no man say i keep a whore or bastard of his therefore upon the instant he flew to the bed first ran his sword into the unfortunate marias breast and snatching the lovely infant from the nurses arms threw it against the ground and dashed out its innocent brains  it was some time before either of us could proceed in the sad narration for tears at the unhappy act when the maid had a little recovered herself she proceeded  the wound the barbarous wretch gave the unfortunate maria did not immediately rob her of life but she lived to make all the hearers weep at what she related even her unkind mother could not refrain tears wishing a thousand times she had died before she had forced her to that unlucky match dear mother replied the fainting fair one do not repine but learn to forget me and this unhappy day consider fate is in every thing i beg yours and heavens forgiveness and then began to faint she would see the infant though in that piteous condition after looking upon it for some time poor babe said she thou have severely paid though innocent for the crime of thy father and mother which i hope is forgiven by heaven here she began to faint again and only said heaven forgive me preserve and support my dear  here her tongue failed she only gave a groan and expired we all supposed it was your name she would have uttered but death stepped between  this relation had almost brought me to my former despair and i often wished the wretch alive once more that had been the cause of poor marias death that i might have killed him again  twas several years before i could wipe away the thoughts of my dear maria nay i can never forget her nor seldom remember her without bringing tears into my eyes as i have at this repetition of my former sorrow for indeed we both could not refrain from weeping but for her sake only i am resolved to live and die a bachelor which said he reassuming some of his former gaiety is the better for you though my uncle often told me added the old gentleman if he had known my passion had been so strong and sincere he would not have been against our marriage since i have assumed a freer air and having got acquainted in this family rail along with em they having known nothing of my story for it did not make any great noise because my uncle procured witnesses enough that heard our discourse and the barbarous act spoke so much that i was never tried for it which was in some sort too prevented by my illness and weak condition  this story of my uncles seemed to me an introductory history to my misfortunes which caused me much sorrowful thinking yet i had ever some secret hoping that kept up my sinking spirits when we went to dinner madam the housekeeper looked very glum upon my uncle though she continued her civility to me yet i took but little notice of it after dinner i went to fish in a river at the bottom of the garden and in an hours time my uncle came to me  hark you young man said he i have a crow to pluck with you what is the reason good young spark that you have disturbed my housekeeper with a story of a cock and a bull about marriage and i know not what with i know not who why really sir said i she examined me so strictly this morning that i hope you will pardon me if i tell you i thought her impertinent neither did i imagine she had any right to be angry or pleased at what i said though i must own i saw it disordered her but i suppose that only proceeded from her interest for if she imagined you married you would have no occasion for a housekeeper for added i smiling my lady would take that work off her hands well young spark said my uncle i find you are a prying young gentleman and since you resolve to know all my secrets i will declare another to you this woman is now and then pleased to tuck me up and moreover has laid a child to me but the boy is so unlike the reputed father i have no notion i had any hand in the forming him now this makes her assume an authority and to let you know further it is the very maid that lived with the unfortunate maria i thought it was my duty to do something for her and at my uncles death i took her into the house the freedom i gave her in talking now and then of that melancholy adventure grew at last into an intimacy flesh and blood being frail and different sexes at all hours of opportunity together will show themselves  sir said i what you have entrusted me with shall only teach me to pay her more respect than i have done without letting her know i am let into the secret and for the future i shall not tell her any thing that will perplex her upon your account nay said my uncle smiling i shall ever make her know the difference between the handmaid and the master and whether her child be mine or not whenever i die i shall provide handsome enough for em both though perhaps not according to her expectation the boy is ignorant who his father is pursuant to my instruction to the mother and i am apt to believe she has kept it a secret for he is not yet of age to be trusted with it though the lad is forward enough in every thing but just learning which makes me the more suspect i am none of his father  our conversation has lasted for six and twenty years and in fifteen of my juvenile years she never pretended to make me a father i know she has fed herself with vain hopes i would make a will and put him down for heir but i can assure you it never was my intention nor ever will be and i shall leave em the less for impertinence whatever you please sir said i but dont leave em the less upon my account well a few days answered my uncle will put an end to their hopes or fears and though when an heir is settled to an estate he looks like a coffin to some people yet youth i dont know how to part with you to the university i am convinced you will have little to learn but ill customs which many scholars imbibe where they should avoid em but i am not at all in pain for you i believe the tenets of virtue sufficiently stamped in your mind therefore i have some thoughts of riding over to your father to prevail upon him to let you and your tutor live with me i will take care you shall not want books i have a good library of my own and if that will not do let me but know your wants and they shall be supplied i gave him thanks suitable to so agreeable an offer but hinted to him a person is not so well esteemed in the world without a universityeducation that is but a small consideration replied my uncle and if we meet with no other difficulties i hope we shall get over that  from this subject we proceeded to that of the widows family i believe sir said i isabella is and will be as averse to marriage at least by her discourse as her mother or aunt i fansy young man replied my uncle you begin to fear it come come continue your correspondence there is a great deal in the first impression and nature will prevail but enough of this i will now show you my library which you have not yet seen and give you the key that you may make use of it when you please but added he if you use it too much i will take it from you again  when we came into the library which was a spacious room built on purpose i was surpised to find it so well stored with such variety and valuable books especially all the classics of the best editions i told my uncle i liked my situation so well that if he would give me leave i would employ myself a few hours to look em over that was one reason why i brought you here now replied my uncle for i am obliged to go for some hours upon some urgent affairs and imagining i should bring you into company you would like made me the more willing to introduce you to em and if you find yourself tired and their conversation should not please you they will not be disobliged at your leaving em so saying he gave me the key and shut me in while i was in high delight for i had even forgot the fair isabella i heard whispering in the next closet which made me awake from my pleasing amusement and in a little time i could hear the good housekeeper say you may speak louder for i am assured there is no one within hearing for the old gentlemans gone out ay but replied the mans voice what is become of the young one gone with him to be sure returned the housekeeper for he does not stir a foot without him and therefore let us make good use of our time for i fear our meetings will be less frequent i am convinced this young gentleman will be a thorn in our side for when he and his uncle were together the day that he came i heard him inform him that he would make his will shortly and put him down his heir now as you no doubt are to draw the writings i would have you find some means to provide for our child which he imagines to be his that i think will be impossible answered the man for be assured he will read it over before he signs it or if he does not do it then he may at some other time no no that will never do we must even wait with patience till his death and i will find it easy enough to make a will for our advantage of a later date than what he intends to make i own said the housekeeper it goes against me to think of defrauding the young gentleman but when you consider replied the man you do it for your own flesh and blood you ought to have no scruple well returned the housekeeper i must leave the whole affair to you i should be contented to share the estate between the two boys and i think if he does otherwise as he imagines our child his he will not do justice we shall see what he intends to do when he makes his will replied the man and in short till then we cannot make a judgment on any one thing  i found afterward they had left speaking aloud and were making themselves as merry as they could they were so boisterous that several folios i had leaned against the wainscot tumbled down which alarmed em very much bless me cried forsooth what is that i cannot tell returned the man i hope the squire is not in his study no that i am sure of said the housekeeper now i recollect myself continued she it is some of the books tumbled off the shelves they made themselves easy with that supposition and continued their game after some time i could hear em go softly down stairs i waited at the window some time and at last saw him go through the courtyard he was a tall thin man had a cast of an eye and seemed about forty  as soon as i found all was still i went softly out of the library and went into my own room a pair of stairs higher to avoid all suspicion when i was there i resolved to acquaint my uncle with the whole truth for i thought it would be injustice to conceal it if it had not concerned myself when my uncle came in he was in a very good humor and would often smile at his own imagination i told him it was a great pity he should stay at home as he usually did if going abroad made him so merry billy replied my uncle i have so much reason to be merry at least in my own opinion that i will tell you the cause of my mirth and i have so good a regard for your understanding that i will rule my risibility for this once by it and if you declare i am in the wrong to be merry i will do my endeavor to be otherwise  sir said i if that is the only reason in letting me into the secret of your mirth you need not give yourself that trouble for i am apt to believe you will be right in every thing you do no compliments boy replied my uncle i have told you before i dont like em but to proceed  you remember that gentleman we brought in the coach from the widows yesterday that gentleman is about five and thirty three years ago he was one of the most eminent merchants upon the exchange and his credit would have stretched as far as the best of em  in the time of his prosperity he fell in love with a widowlady of a vast fortune without the encumbrances of children upon it the lady gave him all the encouragement he could expect the day of their espousals was fixed and near approaching when the uncomfortable news was brought him of the loss of almost all his fortune for three of his richest vessels were taken by pirates this as you may suppose was a very great shock to him but being a person of the utmost philosophy he calmly resigned himself to the will of heaven he immediately left off trade and when his debts were paid he that was but ten days before in every bodys opinion worth a hundred thousand pounds found himself master of seventy pounds a year and his country house which he instantly sold and as i thought it a good bargain i became the purchaser his greatest satisfaction in his misfortunes was the thoughts of the widows proving constant to him and he did not doubt but with her assistance to recover his losses but few women my boy are sincere in their protestations it is true sometimes the blind spark stings em in the tail that they become as blind as fortune or otherwise they are as hard to deal with as a parson for his tithes  the gentleman after his misfortunes i can with justice declare was more welcome to me than before for it would be a hardship indeed to have the unfortunate slighted and i am assured that generous minds resent things that are offered em in their adversity that they would not have regarded in their prosperity one morning at breakfast i observed him very melancholy insomuch that he refused his chocolate i encouraged him as much as i could as imagining the thoughts of his losses had attacked him but i was very much surpised to hear him say his former losses were nothing to what then oppressed him i must own said he i had some omens of it yesterday for when i went to visit the widow as usual i was told she was not at home but returning by the gardenwall i heard her talking to her maid and when i called to her could get no answer this morning my suspicions are confirmed for she has just now sent me a letter where she tells me she is very much grieved at my losses and as merchandising is so very precarious she hopes i will pardon her if she intends to keep her fortune to herself and endeavor to mend my credit with somebody else the loss of her money does not vex me half so much as her insulting me and though i must own i have a very great regard for her person yet i would not wed her now if she should repent of her usage  i believe there is little danger of that said i women have obstinacy enough to keep bad resolutions all i could say to him gave him but little comfort and i must confess his uneasiness infected me but as i have told you time is an excellent doctor for the almost bald gentleman wrought a cure so that he often wished it in his power to be revenged on the widow  many weeks passed on and his inclination strengthened though no accident could assist him till about two months ago an old barn that belonged to the house i ordered to be pulled down with an intention to make an addition to my garden for i had some overtures made me by a nobleman concerning a purchase in which i should make a considerable profit though with a secret intention to give it to the gentleman i had bought it of the barn in reality did still belong to him for it served a farm near the house i had bought which was the remainder of the gentlemans estate and the same he lived in  in digging the earth of the foundation there was found a pot of money that contained upwards of a hundred pound which was given the gentleman as we were at supper and pretty merry at the accident an odd thought came into my head why may we not said i to the gentleman report we have found a larger sum no one knows what we have found but the man that dug it up and we can instruct him to favor the deceit but to what end returned the gentleman why to be revenged on the widow said i i am assured twas covetous interest at first made her comply with your addresses and when once she finds it her interest she will receive em willingly again and if we can bring matters about to complete your revenge you must even marry her the gentleman smiled at my project but thought it would be impossible to bring it to any thing well said i you shall have little to do i warrant i will make your part easy enough accordingly i went to work we reported about the country that such a gentleman had found a vast treasure in his barn supposed to be hid there in the civil wars even enough to recompense all his losses the fellow that dug up the money was an arch rogue one fit for our design i took care to instruct him and to carry every thing on with a good face as i wanted a coach i bought a new one sent the gentleman to his house again as if he had made a new purchase of it in the new coach and attendance suitable i also let the sister to isabellas mother into the secret who by her contrivance received the addresses of the gentleman you must imagine this surpised every body and soon came to the fickle widows ear she it seems began to be very inquisitive had sent for the fellow that dug the money up and examined him he afterward came and informed us what passed between em i was very much pleased to hear it and we instructed him how he should behave to her we ordered him to let her know that we were to meet to settle our matters at a neighboring tavern in the town and several people along with the fortunate squire  when the fellow came back from her we took him into examination again as soon as i came before her said the fellow she asked me if i was the man that had found the money yes madam said i well and is it as much as the world reports really i cannot tell forsooth said i there was sixteen great pots that would hold about a gallon apiece and in one of em there was abundance of such stuff as your ladyship has about your neck forsooth and in your ears i cannot tell what they are good for not i but they say they are worth twenty thousand pounds well but said the lady to him do you know what was in the pots why in nine pots forsooth said i there was nothing but pieces of old gold and the rest had all silver in em but i did say sir i thought it was too good for you for you gave me but ten pounds in old jacobuss for my honesty for you know madam said i i could have secured a pot or two for myself but when i told her you were to meet at the tavern she gave me a crown and said she would give me another if i could find means to bring her into the next room to where you were i am to bring her word tomorrow when you are all met and she will be ready to come with me  well what say you now said i to the gentleman our plot begins to thicken why indeed he replied i begin to conceive some hopes of it we gave the fellow his instructions and i told him i would make one of his lies a truth if we succeeded and that should be the ten pounds he gave us good assurance that he would not fail in his part  the next day we met at the place appointed with gentlemen that we had let into the secret and among the rest one to represent a lawyer for we did not much care to trust a real one there is so little honesty among em the fellow was to give notice when the widow was come by shutting a casement in the room where she was to be for it was an oldfashioned window and made noise enough in the shutting to be heard all over the house we at last heard the signal to begin our farce i had provided a great number of old writings and papers that if she should have the curiosity to peep she might perceive we had all our implements one of our company told our gentleman the most that could be made of his jewels was eighteen thousand five hundred pounds another cried there is your bills for the forty thousand pounds from the goldsmiths and there is the five thousand bank notes but added he the tellers were surpised they had not seen so many pieces of old gold in their lives neither would they accept em but by weight it cannot be helped cried our gentleman they will have a good profit by it for i suppose it will all be paid out to the full currency  every body played their parts to admiration and when our business was over we sat in to drinking with many healths to the gentleman as top of our company we had not been at it long ere our emissary came in who told us madam had got intelligence enough he believed for after we were set in to drinking she presently retired first giving me a guinea as a golden key to lock up my tongue which i promised her faithfully to perform and masters you may perceive i intend to keep my word we spent the rest of the evening with good wine though at a tavern and the hopes of succeeding in our design  the next morning we found it began to work for this letter pulling one out of his pocket came from the widow to the gentleman  sir i am surpised i have neither seen or heard from you these three months i expected an answer from a letter i sent you out of a joke to see how you would resent a refusal but that passion is not very strong to be thrown down at a seeming denial i have something to say to you which is not altogether so proper to commit to writing but if you will take the trouble to come our way i can inform you of a person that would be glad to see you  yours to command etc   why now friend said i she begins to nibble and it is your own fault if you dont catch her i will engage she takes the bait if you will be but careful in playing her why what would you have me to do said the gentleman do said i do as you should do marry her for you cannot be sufficiently revenged without it i cannot do that he replied that will be too fullgrown a cheat you must consider that station lasts for life and to have all my hours embittered with upbraidings would prove a hell upon earth why said i the world will but laugh at the trick i mean those that know it and for those that dont know the artifice we have used they will have the better regard for your wife besides when she finds the imposition her understanding will make her quiet for my part i think it will be a fitting punishment besides i am assured she must have some inclination for you or she would not have accepted your first addresses but that her avarice proved too weighty for her love this ought to reconcile you to the design if you have any regard for her you will soon find means to make all even and if you have none your conscience will not long trouble you i will assure you if i thought there was the least guilt in it i would not have any hand in it besides in the long run she may not prove a loser fortune has fair looks as well as frowns and her ill humor may be worn out the consideration of that said he has wiped away all scruples and i will venture through all dangers in short he made his visit and in all his discourse hinted that the report of finding so much wealth was false and told her the truth in hopes not to be believed to cut my story short he once more gained her consent and this evening they were married now this is the great business i have been about what makes me smile is the ladys mighty inclination to live in the house where the money was found imagining there were more mines of wealth to be worked out yet tomorrow i intend to visit em and let her know the whole truth of the matter which i did not care to do till after consummation and now continued my uncle i have let you into the secret of my mirth though it is impossible to inform you of all the merry circumstances i wish said i sir your punishment is not too severe for the poor woman i warrant you said my uncle she will soon forget her resentment a blessing you know billy must always follow wedlock i wish it may sir said i  our discourse was interrupted by a loud ringing at the door we all ran to the window to see who it was in such haste and saw a person at the door with his horse all in a foam enquiring for squire bridgford which was the name of the gentleman who was married that evening the wedding being a secret my uncle told him he would not be in town till the morning he seemed very uneasy which my uncle perceiving began to enquire into his concern sir said the man i bring him welcome news and the sooner he knows it the sooner i shall be easy he was invited in and his horse taken care of the person told my uncle he had brought the squire news of above forty thousand pounds that is news indeed replied my uncle and welcome if it be true it is true by g  d said the person being a blunt sailor for i am an eyewitness of it after the man was refreshed he told my uncle that one of his ships had made her escape from the pirates we were all taken said the tar near the coast of malabar by french pirates who used those men that refused to make part of their crew vilely some they cut their noses off some their ears etc which the major part considering resolved to seem to comply till a fitter opportunity should offer to get out of their clutches i understanding a little french was their spokesman i told em we did not comply out of the fear of punishment but that it was what we all chose many of us had a long time before thoughts of running away with the ship they received us very kindly gave us good usage and those that did not come into their measures were not only tortured as i said before but put under confinement in fetters we took an opportunity to inform the poor wretches of our intention which made em repent they had not thought of the same method most of em hoping for better usage begged to be admitted but the wily frenchman utterly denied em well knowing they would not be true pirates  they carried all their prizes to their rendezvous into a bay upon the island of madagascar where we had the liberty to go on shore and consort among their hellish crew we fitted out again and took several chinese joncks richly laden and in every engagement behaved so well that the captain of the pirates set very much by us when we came back to our rendezvous there was some disturbance among em concerning some former shares but we thought it was all hushed they had loaded one of the largest ships that was taken from us with goods out of the other two in order to go and trade with the dutch at batavia and one night seventy of the discontented party got in her cut some that were on board in pieces slipped their anchors and stole away in the night the next morning the captain was out of his wits and the rest of the men were as mad as himself but in short the whole fleet which consisted of four stout ships were sent after em different ways  we steered n n w three days and on the fourth discovered a sail we crowded all we could to come up with her and soon perceived twas she we wanted while they were busied in getting ready to engage i stole down into the powderroom which i had the care of opened all the barrels and poured water into most of em and with the rest i mixed some of the ballast of the ship  when we came up with em a desperate fight ensued as long as the good powder lasted then i ran up to the captain called him into the cabin where i told him in a seeming confusion i was certain some of the men were in the interest of the other ship i then informed him what was done to the powder the captain asked me what was to be done board em sir said i and fight em sword in hand what shall i do said he there is no trusting our own men why said i there is sixty english of us i will engage we shall soon overcome em i would have you replied the captain inform em of it and tell them they shall be well rewarded  we bore off a little while we were consulting for we could overtake the other ship when we would because she was heavyladen i acquainted all my shipmates with the resolution i had taken and they one and all came into it when we had consulted proper measures we bore after em again i informed the captain when we had overcome the other ship i would put him in a way to find out the knaves that had played him that trick he thanked me and away we went to work we boarded her upon the starboardquarter entered her pellmell and soon cut to pieces those that made resistance with the loss of seven frenchmen and one englishman for we had fifteen french to assist us six and twenty of our opposers called for quarter but it was not granted before the inveterate frenchmen had knocked in the head nine of em five more were so wounded it was thought they could not live which still answered my purpose the others were clapped under hatches and a guard put over them  the next day the captain put me in mind of my promise to find out the guilty sir said i call all the men upon the quarter deck all i put on the larboardside order to be seized and clapped under hatches you may tax em with their crime when they are secured though they deny it i will prove what i say upon every one of em before night my advice was followed the men were called up to the number of sixty eight forty one i placed on the larboardside of those men that were out of the captains sight during the engagement though doing their duty the other twenty seven were on the starboard the men on both sides could not imagine the meaning of this division all the englishmen were upon the main deck and by some means or other according to my directions had their arms about em those that could not conceal em made as if they were cleaning em the captain told those on the larboardside they were suspected to be in the confederacy with the runaways therefore he would not have em take it ill if they were confined till their guilt or innocence were made to appear  they were all amazed at the captains speech which he took for the signs of guilt some were refractory but at last they consented to be confined well knowing their innocence they were put under hatches accordingly as they were going down the captain said the innocent shall be rewarded when they were below a guard was set upon em and i had taken care to have all their arms secured  the captain then told the starboardside men the whole story and that it was by my advice and conduct the ship was taken etc the men were surpised to be sure it was pleasant to hear their discourse they found em guilty i always thought there was something in the wind in such a mess says one says another i even heard something of their design last night but as i was not sure i did not care to speak on it nay says another i believe jaques suchaone had a great mind to corrupt me for he followed me every where yesterday and only wanted an opportunity of breaking his mind to me in short most of em had something to say and all to prove em guilty it was matter sufficient for our mirth afterward but i was a little too much concerned to laugh then  the remaining frenchmen were got into cabals by fives and sixes all over the deck and our englishmen were impatiently expecting the word of command to seize em  when we had proceeded thus far i told the captain if he would please to go into the great cabin i would convince him how he should prove em when we two were there by ourselves i took a pistol out of my pocket and told him i was the man that had damaged his powder in order to bring that to pass which was happily effected i let him know i had gone too far not to take his life if he resisted or called out and informed him it would signify nothing if he did for i had two signals to my countrymen one to seize his men and do em no further hurt and the other to kill em all immediately and i farther added not one of em should suffer if they would be quiet and that we only contrived this stratagem to gain our liberty  the captain thanked me and told me he could not blame me for what i had done but wondered at himself that he should be imposed upon in such a manner he submitted himself to be tied very patiently  when i had done i went upon the deck and gave the word now which was to seize em only the other was now do your work though i did not intend to use those words except i had found resistance upon the word the frenchmen were all seized it is impossible to tell their astonishment but their surprise was heightened when i brought out their captain bound who soon let em into the whole matter they were all struck dumb for some time and then fell a gabbling out their mort de ma vie like so many disturbed geese but though their tongues were at liberty we did em the favor to bind em all by the hands some of our men whom the others had released those i mean that were ill used for not consenting to turn pirates who by good fortune were all in our ship though in the frenchmens reign did all the servile offices of the vessel were for cutting to pieces those that were instrumental in their ill usage but as they gave me the command i ordered not one should be touched which the frenchmen thanked me for  the one and forty below soon found what we were at and we as soon prevailed upon em to be tied to their good behavior when we had secured em all in the steerage and great cabin and ordered centries with a great gun charged with musquetball to fire in upon em if they seemed to make any resistance we went on board our prize and took care of the other ten frenchmen that were set on as a guard to the thieves as the rest called em as if they were none we carried em all on board when every thing was quiet we directed our course for england and in two days more we took every thing out of the pirate that would be useful to us in our voyage leaving em a months provision we secured all their arms and ammunition and cut some of their rigging leaving em only a foresail with a main topsail to prevent their getting into harbor too soon for us and cause us to be pursued  thus every thing being ordered as we hoped for the best we englishmen went on board our own ship and left them to steer their course back to pirates harbor as we called it we continued our voyage to england where we happily arrived meeting nothing to molest us all the way  we were mightily pleased with his narrative and highly commended his undertaking and resolution said my uncle mr bridgford is obliged to you for his good fortune and i doubt not but he will reward you accordingly he told us he was a relation of mr bridgfords and mate of the ship the captain dying when he was in the pirates hands and all he desired was only to make his promise good to the sailors which was to allow em double wages for the whole voyage my uncle told him he would assure him of that after a little conversation and repast the messenger was sent to rest for he had come sixty miles that day upon one horse  when he was gone we could not but admire at his conduct in the affair and the providence of god to mr bridgford this good fortune said my uncle will be a great means of bringing on a reconcilement now you see sir said i there is a blessing attends the marriagestate yes said my uncle but nothing to provoke me to enter into the noose it must bring some cares along with it be the comforts ever so many i fansy sir said i there is cares attend your present way of living it may be so said my uncle but none that i am tied to bear  i finding a fit opportunity thought it a proper time to inform him of what i had heard in the library but conjured him not to take any notice of it till we could find an occasion of his being an earwitness well then said my uncle i will take your advice and let it rest till after my friend bridgfords affair is over and then well contrive some way or other to catch em in their own snares  the next morning my uncle took me along with him to wait upon the newmarryd couple and the sailor with us we gave him instructions to wait till we called for him when we came to the ladys house we were ushered up into the bedchamber where we found the bride in tears for though it was agreed not to open the affair till my uncle came yet the husband could not be easy till he had told her all she took it very heinously at first but weighing every thing well she had only recourse to her tears which she wiped away as soon as she perceived us  come sir said she to my uncle i can now forgive your plot upon me though i must own the disappointment caused me much uneasiness yet i find what is appointed by heaven must be i am satisfied we have enough and i begin already to loath my former temper why now madam said my uncle you strike a true harmony and to indulge it i have brought you a present one must never come emptyhanded to a newmarryd pair billy continued my uncle call in the man when he came in mr bridgford was surpised cousin brooks said he i am very much pleased to see you and this is a very acceptable present for i thought you in the hands of pirates pray how got you from them why to bring home to you the good ship elizabeth replied mr brooks we then let him into the whole story and he bore his joy as he did his grief with a serenity of temper he was as my uncle said always master of i am pleased with this present from a fortune madam said he only that it may be a means to make you forget some part of your loss in your chimerical one she made him a suitable reply and all past actions were soon forgot  mr bridgford gave his cousin brooks a ring off his finger with a promise of a thousand pounds and to make him captain of the ship he had so worthily saved but my dear said the lady you give the gentleman a present which i suppose he is not to dispose of but never consider he has been in the hands of pirates and perhaps all his readymoneys gone and added she smiling you have not received the money for your jewels yet therefore i must do something for you with that she went out and immediately returned with a hundred guineas which she gave to mr brooks there sir said she that is something better than promises however it is only as earnest my husband shall keep his word  we finding her in so good a humor took our leaves she much entreated us to stay dinner but my uncle told her her husbands old sweetheart was to dine with him who longed to hear how matters went what more confederates returned the lady but i forgive all and thank you for tricking me into my happiness  as we were going home my uncle told me he was very well pleased he had been instrumental in converting one woman but i had almost forgot that i have one at home out of the pale of salvation yet i shall not take any pains in her conversion if it is as you say which i believe continued my uncle i shall turn her and her cub to grass though with a moderate maintenance yet much more than they deserve but well let all thoughts of that affair sleep awhile for the ladies will be here by and by and i have never any thing that looks like discontent when we are together  i found a secret pleasure in the hopes i had of seeing the amiable isabella but then intruding fears would creep in to disturb my thoughts i imagined i should be slighted or perhaps she might disclose my passion to her mother or aunt and then all my hopes would be entirely lost for i had not any notion they would either of em consent to my desires the time was spent between hopes and fears till the arrival of the ladies when they came in any one might have perceived my passion by my countenance but they were so much taken up with their discourse about mr bridgfords affairs they had not the leisure to mind any thing else my concern was redoubled at the little notice isabella took of me and her entering so readily into the conversation without so much as vouchsafing me a single look almost distracted me so that i took a proper opportunity to retire to conceal my confusion i went into the garden to indulge my melancholy finding so many reasons to increase it that had almost distracted me i was so lost in thought that i did not consider how the time went away and it is possible i might have remained in my musing till night if a servant had not told me dinner was served  i was in some confusion to think what excuse i should make for my long absence when i came into the dining room my uncle asked me where i had been so long i told him i found them so very deeply engaged in their story that as i knew my company would not contribute any thing to the conversation i chose to take a walk in the garden and my imagination wandering i had lost myself for some time i was very much rallied for my speech by every body i thought said the aunt the company of isabella would have had sufficient strength to have held you here i suppose returned isabella the young gentleman has been so well tutored by his uncle that he is beginning to put his advice in practice by shunning the women i told her whatever advice i followed of my uncles i was assured neither his inclination or mine would debar me of the satisfaction of their conversation whatever i suffered in person or censure i continued my excuse by telling em the story was not new to me and i thought it would be some time before they would have leisure to enter upon any other subject whatever i had to say in my justification had not stopped their mouths if dinner had not while it lasted i narrowly observed isabella but could not get one look from her i had but little stomach as those in my circumstances may easily imagine though none made any observation upon it when dinner was over we all walked in the garden and my endeavors to single out isabella proved fruitless which much increased my agony of mind  in the afternoon mr bridgford his new wife and mr brooks the sailor came to visit my uncle though said mr bridgford it is not usual for newmarryd people the day after their wedding to make visits yet my wife and i thought it partly our duty to wait upon this good company to take our leaves of em for continued he though a week past i was no man of business yet now i find i have work enough on my hands not to mention my matrimonial affair i am obliged to leave you for twenty days the smiles of fortune must be regarded or she may change her countenance i have experienced it therefore am resolved to keep up her good humor if it lies in my power i must own the sorrows that touch me at present are raised from what i feel in parting though but for a short time with such company as will always be very dear to me many compliments passed between the parties but they were ended by taking leave for mr bridgford set out for london from my uncles with his spouse and his kinsman the sailor who found it necessary for his immediate presence after the usual compliment of tea the ladies were resolved to go fish it seems it was their common recreation and accordingly their implements were carried to the river no farther than the bottom of my uncles garden i was resolved to be only a lookeron as not being composed enough to follow the pastime and perhaps i might have run the hooks into my fingers instead of the baits every one had tolerable good sport but isabella and her ill luck made her fret much billy said my uncle this is a diversion you delight in you know the fishes retiring holes pray see if you can help the young lady to a little better fortune i told my uncle i would contribute all i could to isabellas entertainment with a very good inclination come madam said i if you will be pleased to walk a little farther well see if change of place may not change your luck she made me no answer but with a condescending nod followed me i took care to take her out of the sight and hearing of the rest of the company i then looked a little carefully after her bait and tackle and she caught a fish presently  well said she i find my luck is changed but yet i am but half reconciled to the barbarous diversion it does not suit with the tender sentiments of our sex to rob any thing of life neither can i see the death of a poor partridge or the most diminutive bird widiout a secret tenderness and sorrow for its being robbed of life which it is not in our power to restore again but yet madam said i with all this tenderness of soul you can see a poor suffering wretch in all the agonies of despair without thinking once of pity i am sorry replied isabella you should tax me with a crime i most abhor but as i am innocent it does not give me much uneasiness madam i replied i speak of proof i am the poor suffering wretch wounded by your resistless charms which you know very well and you will neither give me death nor ease why indeed young gentleman returned isabella this playing at lovers is what we now should leave off we are too young to act in reality and too old to act in jest i will allow your understanding runs something before your years but to tell you ingenuously if it were otherwise i dont think for myself i have a mother and aunt who have the privilege to think for me and they so worthily deserve those characters i hope i shall never have a thought against their inclination i replied it was my desire she never should i only wished she would have a favorable regard for me and give me the smallest grounds to hope i was not hateful to her she replied hate was not in her nature and that she could say no more than that she esteemed me equally with all mankind and enough to be concerned at any ill accident that should happen to me  i was so transported at this faint glimpse of hope she gave me that my tongue broke out in extravagant expressions of thanks hold sir said she you will disturb the fish and spoil the diversion i expect beside my mother and aunt will hear ypu and i have kept your former confession from them according to your desire but will not promise secrecy for the future it is a great task for one of my years i had not time to make her a reply for the rest of the company had near joined us to know whether isabellas luck was changed or no truly said she i have no reason to complain i have caught two with the assistance of this young gentleman and had like to have caught another but for want of experience had let him go again ay but billy said my uncle can teach you how to play a fish up and down the stream when once you have it fast and be in no danger of losing it you must manage a fish as you will hereafter do hearts though i must own if handsome women are mere fools which is not isabellas case they soon learn that we dont allow you to be a judge replied isabella your heart has been eyeproof all your life or else you have concealed that part of it from us why replied my uncle if i have never loved i might have had attempts made upon me enough to find out the cunning of the sex as your aunt i suppose may answer for ours i dont desire to have the question begged replied the aunt but this i am sure of there is no knowing whether a man courts the purse or the person for my part returned my uncle i think a woman without a purse is but a despicable creature i wish we could find out some other discourse returned the widow i think when we meet we can never talk upon any other subject and because we despise it i think it the best way quite to forget it  while this discourse lasted i observed isabella more thoughtful than usual and i could not help secretly hoping i might have some concern in her musing yet i was very uneasy i could not get an opportunity to speak to her the whole evening as we were taking leave my uncle promised to dine with em the third day following and the thought gave me some consolation  when the company was gone my uncle and i walked in the garden again well said he i must own the thoughts of the persidy of this ungrateful woman do not sit so easy upon me as i could have wished in spite of all my fortitude it stole in upon the pleasure of the day and sourd my satisfaction but continued he i am resolved to have an end put to every thing on that account tomorrow if it is possible but i am a little at a nonplus about it it would vex me if we could not bring it about for doubt is a very uneasy companion sir said i you have a back way up to your study and i believe it will be no great difficulty to steal in unobserved of any body you must give it out tonight that you will be abroad tomorrow all the morning and i must wait on you that shall be done at supper said my uncle till that time came my distracted thoughts were roving on the dear isabella and hope and fear by turns possessed my soul young as i was i perceived death would be more welcome to me than her disdain at supper my uncle told me we should rise betimes to go a hunting with some gentlemen that he named and added he i design to take my leave of that diversion for some time having some business will keep me at home for a few days i obsevd the countenance of the housekeeper and thought i saw her shut up in her brain some secret intention when she was gone from table my uncle said he did not know how to order it for it is possible she may go to this rogue of a lawyer and consult there and then our project will come to nothing we must trust to that sir said i we shall soon find it out and if it proves so we must wait till some fitter opportunity well said my uncle we shall see how it proves tomorrow but billy i would have you go up into the study unbolt the door that leads to the backstairs lock it only then bring me the key  as i was coming from doing what he ordered me i took notice the housekeeper was busy in talk with her son immediately after the boy took his hat and went out i told my uncle what i had seen we both imagined the boy was gone to give notice of our going abroad the next day for mr  the lawyer lived but a little way from my uncles why said my uncle after all suspicion strengthens our imagination and every action of a suspected person alarms us i wish i could be sure he is gone there that you shall presently sir said i upon saying that i immediately followed him and walking a good round pace got sight of him just as he rung at the door i got time enough at the backside of the porch unobserved just as the door was opened the boy asked for mr  who came out to him presently as soon as he saw him i understood he was very fond of him and called him his dear boy sir said the boy my mother gives her service to you and sent me to tell you that the squire goes out tomorrow to hunt till dinnertime and will expect you by ten in the morning my love said he i will be sure to come i will not ask you to stay now because i have some company with me so away went the boy whistling home and i followed a more slow pace than i went out  when i came to my uncle i informed him all i had heard well said he i find it will come to the catastrophe tomorrow i will go to bed and think over my part so we parted and i am apt to believe both our pillows were uneasy enough though my passion kept me long awake yet i could not choose having some concern at what would happen on the morrow when we rose in the morning we both mounted with a servant and after riding about a quarter of a mile my uncle as we had concerted told me he had no very great gout to the sport therefore would even go back again but you said he to me and tom meaning the man may go if you please no sir said i i dont care for going without you so we turned our horses heads homewards and as we were going slowly along my uncle ordered the man to take all the three horses to town about two mile from my uncles and bespeak new saddles so we alighted walked over the park and got into the library unperceived of any when we were in we bolted the door on the inside and each of us took a book in our hands to pass away the time till the play was to begin for it was not proper to talk to each other but yet i believe we neither of us well knew what we were reading  the private door we came in at was contrived by my uncle that he might more conveniently make madam a visit unobserved by the family when his concerns called him and the door of her apartment joined to it upon the head of the stairs which we soon heard open the lawyer entered alone where he staid some time and diverted himself with humming a song at last the lady came to him who informed him she could not come sooner being she was obliged to see the coast a little clear  we soon found by the lawyers discourse he had some inclination to be merry before they talked of their affairs come come said madam let us mind business first we shall have time enough to divert ourselves i will warrant you ay but replied the lawyer it is better to be caught in conversation than the other affair therefore let us make an end of that first and we soon found he was resolved not to be denied  during this business twas pleasant to see my uncles countenance which was composed of half a smile about one fourth part shame as i suppose to have me a sort of an auditor in this unlookdfor dumb work and the other fourth anger i believe such a face could not be compounded out of le bruns passions when their loving affair was over consultation came on  well said the lady what is to be done i have reason to fear every thing for i find this boy grows upon him every day to tell you the truth replied the lawyer i am at a fault and have lost the scent and know not how to proceed i know you women are more fruitful in inventions of this kind indeed if the squires head were once laid i could find an expedient to secure the best part of the estate without danger or finding out it is not the first time i have disinherited the true heir without the consent of the predecessor even for a small sum and you may be sure i should use my utmost skill for thomas who is our own child though the squire i believe imagines himself sole proprietor in you and him it is a very perplexing thing i vow replied the housekeeper i wish both their necks broke today in hunting with all my heart ay that would do replied the lawyer i would find a will by tomorrow night like moscas in the fox should disappoint every boby else without coming near his punishment well i hope it is no crime returned the housekeeper to wish em both in heaven nay if i lent a helping hand to fit em for their journey i believe my conscience would be as drowsy as if it had sipd off a dose of laudanum oh fie returned the lawyer let us not think of murder however though if we were in italy i could soon procure a tradesman or two that deal that way would do the work neatly and very cheap too but let us not think of that any farther than in our good wishes and now let me hear what you can propose what readymoney does he generally keep at home not that i purpose to rob him i have a better principle or what bank or goldsmiths notes has he at a time i dont know replied the housekeeper he keeps himself very close as to those matters and i seldom see any of his money but his paltry hundred a year that he allows me and what i can ship out of housekeeping cutting off tradesmens bills and so sorth which does not amount to above fifty more  come come returned the lawyer that is good pay only for rubbing a mans head that is turned of fifty he does not give you much trouble i believe i wonder how you would conceal your joy to see that head we speak of dangling over the horses tail brought home as crookbackd richards was with his neck broke that would be a joyful sight indeed returned the virtuous housekeeper my uncle could bear no more but rushed in upon them just as she had ended but since i have saved my neck hitherto returned my uncle i am resolved to hunt less that i may not cause such an alteration in your minds for those violent emotions of the soul often endanger the body  perseuss shield could not have a greater effect on those that saw it than the presence of my uncle had upon those two wretches for they both stood like statues but my uncle put a little life into the lawyer with his cane yet not being fully revived he ran round the room several times before he could find the door at every stroke of acknowledgment my uncle gave him for the favors designed him he expostulated with him and to end his favors kicked him down stairs telling him he would not take any other revenge because indeed he did not think it worth while but bid him go like a villain as he was and let his crime be his punishment but if he offered to make any words in the affair he would find some other method besides exposing him to have him punished  the lawyer made no reply and i believe thought himself very well off neither was there much fear of his tattling because it would only expose himself now came the ladys share of the matter who stood quaking and trembling in a corner of the room will your ladyship be pleased said my uncle with your utmost expedition to pack up your trumpery and walk off all the ill usage you may expect from me is to forget you though i think no punishment bad enough for you neither shall i leave you or your brat to starve who in deed is innocent but allow him the hundred pounds a year for his life that he may not suffer for the faults of his parents go continued my uncle let me have no reply take what you can with you and send for the rest when you think fit she went down stairs followed by my uncle and when she had taken a few things went out without opening her mouth but whether grief or anger tied her tongue i cannot tell when she was gone my uncle ordered all her things to be put together ready against they were sent for to the great surprise of the rest of the servants  after dinner my uncle took me with him to town to a lawyer of his acquaintance and ordered him to fill up a deed that made his estate liable to a hundred pounds per annum to be paid during the life of the housekeepers son though not quite fourteen i was made one of the witnesses the next morning my uncle ordered it to be sent to his mother for her to be satisfied but the lawyer that made it was to be the trustee whose honesty and probity were as great as the others villainy we then set out for the widows house and my uncle told me in the coach he was resolved to be merry notwithstanding this bustle that happened and young man said he you have sufficient cause for mirth at what has fallen out for your estate will be increased for if i had made my will before or not have found em out i should have left em more considerably  when we came to the widows my uncle told em the whole story and they all seemed mightily pleased upon my account for they imagined the son of the housekeeper was to have been heir yet i fansyd isabellas countenance seemed the least concerned which struck me to the soul after dinner i got the happy opportunity of being alone with her though i imagined it was with much regret on her side madam said i my uncles expected fortune does not give me half that satisfaction as this opportunity if you would be pleased to consider my passion i have considered it so far sir returned isabella that i desire we may think of it no more the answer she gave struck me dumb with grief and it was some time before my troubled heart permitted my tongue to speak well madam then said i you have resolved my death i own even the hopes of fortune do not give me merit enough to raise my eyes to such a pitch of happiness but time that produces very strange things may befriend me in that i have told you sir returned the young lady our years are too few to admit of love but whenever i shall feel the gentle flame i have very good reasons to believe i shall not much consult fortune i am convinced that moneymatches are not always the happiest yet the first thing asked in this age is what fortune has she if that answers their expectations then they proceed if not they look out farther and barter for a wife as they would for a set of coachhorses  in all our discourse i had some hope because i could not find any grounds for hating me neither could i prevail upon her to declare any thing in favor of me her general answer was her want of years yet she told me she had discretion enough to conceal my passion for her and she would often say her reason was that if a person could not have an inclination for a lover yet they ought to have some regard for em i was pressing her to give me some token that i was not indifferent to her when my uncle came in and interrupted us it was i own the first time i ever thought his company a trouble come young man said he you will be suspected you have been together a long time the mother and aunt sent me to part you besides yonder is matter for the young ladys tears the burial of two lovers we all went into the garden and saw two coffins bearing to the church we were told the young man had lived in the neighborhood and courting a young woman of the next parish her father had prevailed upon her to marry another of a better estate which occasioned the young mans death for the morning of the marriage was the last of his life making the river his winding sheet the bride and bridegroom coming from church were stopped by his corpse lying in their way the melancholy object had such an effect upon the bride that she fell down speechless on the body and in a few days expird with grief and her last request was to be buried together  the story made us all very melancholy and isabella could not forbear shedding tears at the relation but we rallied one another out of our sorrow methinks said the mother this story would make a very good tender ballad you need not fear the ballad replied the aunt by some grubstreet bard or other why said my uncle cannot you make a ballad billy i have seen some of your translations from ovids elegies and such a dismal subject in my imagination will fit your muse to a hair isabella seemed mighty fond of such a thing though i declined it as having never drank of the streams of helicon but when we came home i sat down and lanchd out though i did not understand how to steer my muse but the hopes of pleasing isabella made me embark and the next day i sent her the following letter by a servant of my uncles with a charge to deliver it into her own hands  madam in the pleasing hope of giving you some small satisfaction i have ventured to walk out into the field of poetry and though perhaps i have gathered weeds yet you must consider it is for want of knowledge in the amiable flowers but i had rather err in endeavoring to please you than not to obey your commands i beg you will not expose em i know you have goodnature enough not to let any one else laugh at my want of numbers consider all the faculties of my soul are yours and i fear poor damons fate will be mine for i am assured i neither could or would survive his fortune but i too much doubt if it comes to that i shall never after death meet with the same pity as the unfortunate damon i fear what i have already writ has disgusted you but consider it comes from one that shall ever esteem it his only happiness to subscribe himself  your eternal admirer etc  the ballad i damon whose tuneful pipe had charms to wound and heal the wondering throng long courted caelia to his arms twas caelia that inspired his song ii the lovely virgin joys to hear his thrilling pipe and humble verse yet frowns when sighs his pains declare regardless of his happiness iii a sullen swain whose wealth was great by force of gold her parent gains poor damon he bewails his fate in sighing melancholy strains iv and thus complains  accursed gold thou base betrayer of my love mean are the hearts are bought or sold it is interest does the fair one move v the nuptial day was fixed and near which added to poor damons smart who every moment dropped a tear the prelude to a broken heart vi the dusky morn came lowering on when all for church prepare to go the sable clouds obscured the sun as loath to see the lovers woe vii the jocund bridegroom swelled with joy eyed caelia as he passed along exulting over the lovesick boy who faintly pressed among the throng viii with watery eyes he viewed the bride who seeing damon sighed aloud and trembling by the bridegrooms side the wonder of the gazing crowd ix some pitied damon others rail such wretches are no friends to love on such the god will never prevail to sigh within the paphian grove x poor slaves to low and base desires it is love that newcreates the mind without his pleasing gentle fires we are sordid metal unrefind xi damon depressed with mortal grief walks slowly by the rivers side by hope forsaken no relief and all his thoughts were on the bride xii ye murmuring streams the shepherd cried who often have heard my plaintive voice convey my body to the bride and show that death is now my choice xiii fond love farewell adieu vain dream farewell to every grief and pain thus said he plunged amid the stream and never rose up to life again xiv the rapid torrent rolls him down deprived alas of breathing life regardless now of caelias frown who now returns a virgin wife xv the stream repenting of the deed threw damons corpse upon the grass scarce cold from worldly troubles freed where caelia and her train must pass xvi but when she viewed the wellknown face and knew each pale dead feature there she cried poor damon hapless case my stubborn heart was too severe xvii but why do i accuse my heart twas always thine poor lifeless boy in all thy pains it bore a part a part in every grief or joy xviii my rigid parent caused this woe whose flinty heart no love can prove it is he has wrought thy overthrow and robbed me of my only love xix but since on earth we could not wed this only comfort still i have my heart shall join our hands though dead well keep our nuptials in the grave xx then kneeling down his lips she pressed and eager clasped his pale cold hand the other beat her troubled breast while all the hearers wondering stand xxi come gentle death the virgin cried give damon to my longing breast she sighing wept and sighing died replete with woe and sunk to rest  when the servant returned he informed me he had given it into her own hands unperceived of any one i showed my uncle the song who told me he believed it as good as any of the grubstreet quilldrivers could write but he would not allow it to be a degree better however said he it may please the women well enough who seldom consider sense but sound i replied i was to be excused it being my first essay and very probably might be my last  while we were at dinner a messenger came with a letter from my father desiring my uncle to let me come home for a few days in order to get every thing ready for the university when that was done i should return and stay with him till i was to go there my uncle agreed to it and would accompany me himself sir said i would it not be proper to wait upon the ladies to take leave ho returned my uncle are you so loath to part with em for so short a time what will you do when you are at the university where you must not return for the first year for a whole year sir said i is there a necessity for staying so long before i wait on you or any of my relations yes replied my uncle if you would be thought to mind your studies but i cannot perceive continued he there is a necessity for going there at all and that is the reason why i shall wait on your worship to your father to endeavor to persuade him to let you and your tutor be with me i dare answer for you it will not hinder the progress of your learning you shall want neither masters books nor money and i am convinced the universities often spoil more youth than they cultivate with good education youth is like wax fit for any impression they as soon take an ill as a good one though i must own i have nothing to fear from you and i freely confess it is the regret i have to part with you makes me desire your not going to the university though if it does not agree with your sentiments i shall say no more about it i told him i was very well inclined to it and could not but agree with his thoughts well then said my uncle well away immediately and if it is possible return tomorrow i hope that short absence from the ladies will not break your heart  i made him no reply but went to prepare for my journey with a good inclination for i must own i longed to see my father and observe how matters were carried on at home not doubting but my motherinlaw was still in the way of goodness though i had received no recommendation from her either in my fathers letter or by the messenger but i knew my father seldom regarded those formal matters  as we came within three mile of my fathers my uncles servant stopped a horse that was running away without his rider and a little farther we could perceive a man lying weltring in blood when we approached him we found him senseless and i was something surpised to find it the surgeon that had the care of me when i was wounded by my brother my uncle was as much concerned as i was when he knew who it was we took him up and found his scull was fracturd but we did not doubt if we could get timely aid but he might be recovered we put him into my uncles coach and drove to the next town with all the expedition was consistent with the surgeons condition by good fortune we met with one of his own acquaintance and profession who took him in hand dressed him and brought him to his senses though with much fear of his life he being a gross man a fever had seized the blood and all agreed his life was in danger however he seemed very much pleased to find me so near him and i had some thoughts it might prove a convenient opportunity to work out that secret he informed me he knew of my motherinlaw but finding it not proper to talk much i resolved with myself to come to him again so we took our leaves and arrived safe at my fathers who not expecting us the same day he sent to us was gone to visit a neighboring gentleman  my mother seemed very much rejoiced at our arrival and welcoming me with tears her tenderness gave me no small satisfaction my brother john indeed looked as glum upon me as if i had been come to rob him of his birthright my uncle perceiving his behavior rattled him in his merry way but it had no other effect than bringing tears into his eyes and running to tell mama zounds says my uncle when he was gone what a country cub it is why dont they put him prentice to a farmer for he will never be fit for any thing but to follow the plough  when my father came home he told my uncle he did not think he should have complied with his desires so soon as not expecting me in two or three days why said my uncle we made the more expedition here that we may return the sooner and because you should not keep him too long i came with him to carry him back in short the matter was made up that night it was agreed my tutor and i should go back with my uncle i must own i was not a little pleased for i feared the good woman my motherinlaw might oppose it but she readily consented to save charges i suppose  while i was walking in the garden alone betty came up to me and wept for joy to see me well said i betty how go matters between you and my mother is the affair made up i hope i am to take no more physic the poor girl was ready to sink at the word physic indeed sir said she after a long pause i believe you know every thing of former affairs but if you do you also know i have sufficiently repented of my part and i hope my mistress has of hers i gave her so many hints that she confessed every thing i was struck with horror at her relation for she discovered such traps they had designed to get rid of me that i thought it almost impossible they should enter into the minds of women sir said betty you may find by my story i am at a true confession nay i would kneel down at your feet for pardon if it might not be observed by any body i told her i had pardoned her long ago as well as my mother who might have had something of a stronger tie to use me well than she i hope said betty she has forgot what is past or if she remembers it it is only as i do to think with horror on what was designed and a high satisfaction in knowing we are innocent of the fact though pursued she there does not seem to be that candor and freedom between us as there was when we were wickedly caballing against your innocent life therefore i have some intention of leaving her service and going to my relations in wales where i hope i have enough to last me moderately all my life i told her i was assured my uncle would accept of her for his housekeeper upon my recommendation if she thought fit for at present he had never a one she seemed mightily rejoiced at the proposal telling me it was the only thing she should desire i bid her not take any notice of it to any body till she heard from me again which she promised and we parted  the next day i took an opportunity early in the morning to visit the surgeon and found him much better than any one expected though he himself had no thoughts of recovery he told me he was very much obliged to me for the care i had taken of him and notwithstanding he was convinced his end was near yet he thought providence had a hand in sending me to his assistance therefore as i would not willingly go out of the world said he without acquainting you with what i had formerly hinted to you for fear you should nourish the opinion that i wanted only to create uneasiness without any grounds therefore if you please now i find i have strength enough i will acquaint you with all i know if you will order the room to be cleared for a little while which was soon done i sat down by his bedside when he began as follows  you know we countrysurgeons are generally bred apothecaries i served my time with one eminent in both faculties and it was allowed by every body i was not behindhand in my masters experience he used to trust his patients in general to me after my capacity had been thought equal to such a charge  sir charles your motherinlaws former husband lived near die town and my master was very great there insomuch that it was thought the knight was in a fair road to heaven with my masters assistance but it is often the fate of cuckolds to be one of the last in discovering his own horns for several years the knight and my master were very gracious they often rid a hunting together but one day when it was supposed my master wanted an opportunity of conversing with the knights wife took an occasion of leaving him making all the haste he could to visit the lady the knight missing my master though not mistrusting any thing of the matter went home likewise and going up to his ladys chamber found the door shut but peeping through the keyhole perceived she had got his companion with her and both in a posture not very decent the knight being neither a hercules nor an ajax stood some time to consider what he should do as he told me afterward but at last summoning all his courage he burst the door open and surpised em very disadvantageously giving my master several strokes upon the naked buttocks ere he could put up the proper covering but being a goodhumored easy man and a wittol to boot at their tears and entreaties forgave em both but would not allow of my masters correspondence any more when any thing was wanted from the shop i always carried it till by degrees i got into the good graces of the knight and rid out a hunting with him though not so often as my master used to do but i believe he gave me leave more readily that he might have a better opportunity of visiting the lady  in one of the knights drunken moods he discovered what i have told you between his wife and my master which i was ignorant of before but said he they have promised me never to do the like again i only smiled at his simplicity and confirmed him in his belief though i was pretty well convinced when i looked a little backwards they only met as often as they had an opportunity in a few days after this confession when i was a hunting with him he seemed to be less merry than usual i asked him the reason he told me he believed his wife continued to see my master in a criminal manner though he was not convinced by proof i asked him the reason of his belief said he going into my wifes chamber this morning as she was dressing herself a letter dropped from her bosom which i took up and was well assured twas your masters hand i opened it and had but just time to read my dear when my wife in some confusion snatched it out of my hand and told me it was a letter from a relation of hers i told her i was assured it was the doctors hand well said she if you are jealous you shall not see it now but i will give you leave to read it when you come back from hunting i was forced to be satisfied continued the knight but i shall be convinced it is so if she pretends to have lost the letter the knight took an opportunity of seeing me the same evening he told me with a great deal of joy in his countenance that he was deceived see here the letter that gave me so much uneasiness i took it from him and soon knew my masters hand though he had endeavored to write not like himself  i could not choose but smile at the cheat that was put upon him it was plain enough that she had acquainted my master with the matter and while the knight was gone a hunting he wrote her another in a womans name beginning as the other did about nothing at all to any purpose i was convinced in my supposition when i came home for my master pulling out a parcel of papers gave me one to take directions for compounding some medicines i soon found it was the father to the letter the knight showed some time before for it began as the other did and sir charless name was mentioned in it i told my master smiling i could find no directions there for me odso said he i have given you the wrong letter that neither concerns you nor me he immediately fumbled out the right one and went away in some confusion of countenance i was very uneasy myself that he knew i had discovered the secret of his intrigue though it could not properly be called a secret that was whispered every where  some time after my master was caught again making the beast with two backs with the knights wife which so enraged the cuckold that he resolved to have recourse to law for redress but as i was now his oracle i persuaded him from it though with some difficulty and in a little time his resentment began to sleep again though he watched his wife so narrowly there could be no time to graft another antler for i must own to you i did all i could to prevent it giving him notice when i suspected any movement that way yet i must confess had it been my own case i should sooner have thought of revenging myself on the cuckoldmaker than bore it so patiently but there is nothing to be said for the tempers of men  this strictness continued for near half a year and i verily believe much to the discontent of the lady at last the knight fell sick perhaps through his perturbation of spirit or for want of his usual exercise for he had undertaken a voluntary confinement in order to inspect the actions of his wife during his illness she seemed very tender of him hardly ever being from his bedside which the goodnatured knight took so kindly that i even fansyd he was resolved when he was recovered to leave her to her own conduct for she expressed so much sorrow for her past actions that i was myself deceived the disposition to goodness of the wife had an extraordinary effect on the husband and he began to mend apace he left his bed where through weakness he had remained for ten days and walked about his chamber gathering strength hourly in less time than his illness had kept him in bed he had recovered his former strength and had fixed a day with me to ride out but in the mean time he was to take some physic which i sent him but to my great surprise and confusion the day he had taken it i found him expiring in the utmost agonies he was speechless when i came to him and in less than five minutes breathed his last  the lady was all in tears raved at me telling me i had certainly given him something by mistake i assured her to the contrary and informed her it was composed by my master before my face and what he had taken could not hurt an infant she held her tongue when she understood who it was that had made up what he took which immediately struck my fancy there was some villainy in the case  my master hearing of the knights death came while i was there and examining the body seemed in very great confusion we both went home together without one word passing between us when we had been there some time my master told me he had something to disclose if i would swear solemnly to keep it a secret i answered him if he was in any doubt of my fidelity to keep the secret to himself well then said he give me your word not to discover it and i will tell you which i did  i am afraid said he the knight has not had fair play for his life for viewing his body i could easily perceive strong symptoms of poison and what strengthens my opinion is that some time ago she prevailed upon me to let her have some ratsbane in order as she said to clear the granary of vermin i easily came into my masters opinion and by his declaring it to me was well assured he was innocent i am so shocked said my master at the barbarity of the woman that i am resolved never to go near her more neither will i make any further enquiry into the business but leave her to her own wicked thoughts though perhaps i have not in my past days had any great regard for religion and might leave it to be decided by chance as the king of macasar did macasar is a large kingdom on the south part of the celebes an island in the indian sea near three centuries ago they worshipped the sun and moon as the most worthy objects of their adoration two macasarian merchants trading to ternate the chief of the molucca islands settled by the portuguese were so well pleased with the integrity of the priests and the tenets of the christian religion that their chief business was to make themselves perfect in it which liked em so well that they were soon baptized and returning into their own country prevailed upon the king of macasar to follow their steps which was soon done with a great number of the inhabitants that were christened but the priests that were sent by the portuguese to instruct em in the christian religion miscarrying in their voyage the king began to have doubts which none of the new christians could answer some mahometans being at the court when these doubts arose recommended the alcoran to him and by their reasons began to stagger his new faith yet still continuing a friend to the christian religion he resolved to put his choice on this hazard he gave commission to the christians and mahometans to send for teachers of both religions and the first that arrived whether christian or mohammedan should be allowed the established religion the followers of mahomet sent without losing time to the queen of acihn a kingdom on the island of sumatra one that followed the laws of mahomet the queen immediately dispatched several learned bonzis or priests who arrived before the christians and ever since the people of macasar have been zealous mahometans  yet she has so alarmed my drowsy conscience that i shall for the future endeavor to lead a life consonant to one that thinks of futurity we both agreed it was the best way to be silent in the unhappy affair  in a few days the knight was buried without the least suspicion of any thing but a natural death my master and i were invited to the funeral but neither of us went and for my own part i never cared to go near the house for the thought of its harboring so cruel a woman made me abhor it my master i believe imagined the same for he never made the widow a visit in a fortnight after the funeral she sent a letter to my master which was to this effect for he gave it to me to read having before that freely declared to me the correspondence that had past between em she wondered mightily at his long absence and that she would have come to him long before if decency would have permitted her but she hoped to see him that evening having disposed every thing to favor their meeting  my master returned her an answer i believe little to her expectation telling her plainly he resolved never to see her more also hinting her unnatural barbarity to her husband i cannot tell you what effect it had upon her but she sent no more letters or messages i often told my master i was afraid she would resent his slighting of her to his prejudice he laughed at that as imagining himself out of her power but in less than a months time my unfortunate master going to visit a relation about ten miles from the place where we lived was found murdered and thrown into a copse near the road he lay several days before he was found and might have laid longer if a gentleman had not gone through that way a hunting i must confess my heart forboded some such mischance when sending to seek him at his relations was informed he went from thence the same evening he came there  great inquisition was made after the murderer but was never found to this day yet whoever did it i was well assured within my self the widow had put em on but as i could not bring any proof i kept my opinion to myself well knowing if i should endeavor to prosecute her it would be a certain charge to me and perhaps discover nothing yet i must own i could never give her a good word and though i had always a watch upon my tongue yet i could not avoid raving against her in all companies  some time after the death of my master i imagined i had found out the murderer a trooper that was quartered in the town of a sudden had got into the equipage of a gentleman and it was shrewdly suspected he occupyd the widow i was convinced in my suspicion one morning early being called to one that was taken suddenly ill and being obliged to pass by the widows door i could perceive though dark her door open and this trooper mentioned before let in by the widow herself this fellow whenever he passed by our shop i could perceive always a sudden turn of countenance from what he had on before one day as he was passing by some of my neighbors were talking with me concerning the murder of my late master and i could not help saying loud enough to be heard by the trooper that i suspected a person that often passed by our door had been his murderer and looked full in the fellows face he changed as pale as ashes but all the while i staid in that town which was upward of two years afterward i never set eyes on him and the next time i saw him i found him lurking about your fathers house which convinces me not only that he was the murderer of my master but that he corresponds with your motherinlaw at this time  now sir added the doctor i have told you this secret which i have kept near seventeen years neither should i have discovered it now if i did not firmly believe i am going into another world for notwithstanding every one tells me i am much better i am convinced i have not ten days to live i endeavored to put him out of that idle conceit but all to no purpose so i took my leave after promising him to keep his secret and within the time he mentioned i was informed he died after telling the very hour of his death i returned home full of many disjointed thoughts wondering how providence had ordered my father to marry such a wicked woman but then again i did not doubt but she had repented of her former wickedness and walked in the paths toward grace which gave me some comfort but not enough to hinder my wishing she never had been one of our family  betty had told me nothing of this affair neither was i assured she lived with her at that time but i was resolved to be informed the first opportunity in the afternoon i took an occasion to get my tutor out of the way and being alone beckoned betty to come to me pray said i betty do you know any thing of my mothers former husband sir charles no sir said she i came to live with my lady not long before her marriage to your father but said i know you nothing of a galant of my good motherinlaws for i have some reason to suspect her of being guilty that way indeed said she blushing that is the only thing i have kept a secret from you and i believe the very reason of my ladys coldness to me for the person she corresponds with or rather the person she has corresponded with for i have great hopes she has left it off coming to me as usual i flatly denied him entrance and farther told him i was assured my lady would break off with him being ashamed of the injury she had done so good a husband i never acquainted my lady with what i said to him but i observed her coldness took beginning some time after this i asked her what sort of person he was she told me a young gentleman of a very good family fallen to decay who she believed was forced through necessity to what he did that cannot be the person said i that i suspect for he i mean must be above forty there is said betty sometimes a man of that age with my lady but she ever took care to keep their affair private even from me but however i am assured there is no criminal conversation between em  i did not tell betty any thing that i knew of what the doctor informed me but we parted with an assurance of my succeeding with my uncle in what i promised her in the afternoon my uncle rid out with me when i broke the matter about betty i thought said my uncle you had enough of housekeepers already sir said i i have enough of such a one as your last neither am i afraid of any great familiarity between you for betty is neither young nor handsome nay said my uncle i can give you a better reason than all that which i am assured you will soon come into and that is i am not so young by twenty years as i was twenty years ago that is true sir said i but i am flattered i can give you a better reason that you should accept of betty that is it is the only thing i can desire of you well said my uncle your desires shall be granted but we must limit bettys power for you know the former had all in her own hands i told him i wanted nothing else but that she might be accepted we would both leave the terms to him but hold said my uncle i have one scruple just now arose concerning this affair which must be got over and that is whether my sister will be willing to part with her sir said i if you will hear me a little while with patience and give me your word never to disclose what i shall tell you i will inform you of something will very much surprise you well said my uncle i shall come to your terms be they what they will  i then related to him all that had happened while i was at home in every circumstance when i had finished my uncle was quite confounded is it possible said he there can be such a woman breathing if i did not give credit to you continued he i should have imagined i had heard a romance but however i am convinced and think my service for betty but poor recompense for her return to virtue but i know not how to look on that injurious woman who may under the cover of affection still retain her barbarity i think it would be but just and reasonable to give my brother some hint of her former inhumanity a woman of her cunning may counterfeit virtue when she is replete with vice i begged my uncle not to take any farther notice of it till we had some grounds of her returning to wickedness and if we should find the least swerving from virtue to bring betty for proof of what was past and put my father out of all manner of danger from her wiles or resentment  i know not said my uncle i like it not and shall hardly be persuaded to conceal the knowledge of her perfidy you know the old saying boy what is bred in the bone is never out of the flesh dear uncle said i let me entreat you to conceal what i have told you till we perceive something in her conduct to give us cause to suspect her again and then you may do just as you please he promised to comply with my request which gave me no small satisfaction  when we came home we found my father and motherinlaw very merry in the garden but finding myself little inclined to mirth i left my uncle to make one of the company beside i wanted to confer with betty but could not find her all over the house i imagined she might be walking under the trees before the house so upon that supposition went to seek her when i had got through the courtyard i perceived betty was not there but i could not help observing an old woman prying about the house with a basket upon her arm i went to her and demanding of her whether she had any business there she answered she had some fine oranges for my lady my lady is at present busy said i but pray let me see your oranges which she did after some awkward difficulty her reluctance in showing me her fruit raised a suspicion in my mind which made me resolve to be satisfied if possible they are fine oranges good woman said i and i believe my lady will buy em all but i wish you had some peaches for i have a great mind to some and would give a good price for em i wish i had known that said the old woman i could have brought you some of the finest in england i told her if she would go back and fetch em i should be very much obliged to her you may leave your basket in that greenhouse to secure em i will lock the door and give you the key she seemed willing to consent to that so i did as i said gave her the key and away she went as soon as she was out of sight i went the backway and got into the greenhouse through the window i began to examine her basket very narrowly yet found nothing that i expected to find but handling the oranges i perceived one of em to be very light and at last found it was hollow i undid it with much difficulty for it was put together with pins without heads in it i found a slip of paper rolled up whose contents i transcribed with a pencil my dear i am out of my senses burleigh has been with me and threatens to discover both you and me to your husband and farther adds if you miss sending him fifty pounds in three days he will declare a secret that will endanger your life and yet escape himself i know not what he means but if he has any such secret the best way will be to stop his mouth by sending him the money shall we never meet again consider how long it is since you blessed me last i am amazed at the treatment i received from betty and notwithstanding in your last you gave me hopes of a sudden meeting yet i am apt to believe she spoke truth when she declared you would shake of all commerce with me therefore if you would not have me believe her let me see you tomorrow at the bearers house where i shall wait the whole day with impatient expectation if you will comply and have not an opportunity of writing tell her all is well and by those words i shall be satisfied till tomorrow for ever yours  s w     when i had done i put it up again and with much difficulty left it in the same order as i found it i then returned to expect the woman i really imagined by this letter that my motherinlaw designed to be honest and what she had wrote to her galant was only a pretext to keep him quiet however i did design to suspend my judgment till the next day and if i perceived my mother went to the place appointed it would not be unnatural to believe her still guilty  when the woman brought me the peaches i asked her if i should acquaint my mother that she was there yes sir said she if you please and thank you too i immediately went and met her coming out of the garden when i told her who wanted her i could perceive her countenance change but she hid her confusion by wiping her face with her handkerchief i would fain have followed her to have observed though at a distance her behavior to the woman but she took her into a back parlour shutting the door after her they were a pretty while together and when they parted i could perceive a great deal of discontent in the countenance of my motherinlaw when the woman was gone i resolved to follow her and try if by any stratagem i could find my mothers resolutions i soon overtook her at which she seemed something surpised good woman said i i came after you to know whereabouts you dwell for your fruit was so good as i ride out now and then i design to call upon you to buy some more for though added i we have fruit enough in our own garden it is so narrowly watched by the gardener according to my mothers directions that i can never get any that is replied the old gobetween for fear you should eat too much however if you have a mind to traffic that way with me i live in such a place i am easy enough to be found every child knows goody  well then said i i will come to see you tomorrow in the afternoon odso returned the old woman now i think on it i shall not be at home tomorrow but any other time you will be sure to find me why if you are not said i i suppose you have somebody at your house that can serve me no indeed have not i returned the woman i asked her so many questions that though a woman ignorant enough she began to smell a rat and seemed so very shy in her answers afterward that plainly informed me she was tired of my company she at last told me she would not sell me any fruit if i came for it for fear it should do me an injury i tried many ways to bring her into humor again but to no purpose and i did not care to say any more for fear she should be confirmed in her suspicions however i kept her so long in talk that a man met us who i observed wanted to discourse the old woman when he came up with us i could perceive the old woman wink at him and seemed to exact from him a cautious behavior the person seemed to be in some confusion however he called her by her name and asked whose child i was with a great many common words of pretty youth and so forth but when she told him who i was his countenance expressed the utmost confusion he asked her in a hasty manner what business i had with her i dont know said the old woman master wants to buy some fruit of me and would fain come tomorrow and i have told him i shall not be in the way if that be all answered the gentleman looking wistfully on the old woman you may comply with the young man for i suppose you will not be abroad all day no said the old woman only in the afternoon why said i it is only in the morning that i can come out but you seem said i to the old woman not very willing to part with what you deal in to me as perhaps doubting my pay but to convince you i am sincere in what i say there is money beforehand and i desire you will save me two dozen of the same i had of you today and i will be with you by seven a clock in the morning  she made several awkward speeches in receiving my money but i found the sight of it pleased her very well and so we parted i had a strong desire to know their conference but i was obliged to be contented till the next day i did not doubt of my motherinlaws going to the place of rendezvous but then i imagined she might go to pacify that burleigh mentioned in the note however i resolved with myself to keep it a secret from my uncle and use my utmost endeavor to know something of their conference the next day  i arose next morning without sleeping a wink all night my thoughts were so confused and troublesome to me i got out before my uncle or any of the family were stirring except some of the servants i directed my steps toward the town and met the old woman before i had got half way i was somewhat surpised because it was not much past six which was an hour before i promised to come so said i good woman you are resolved to save me a walk i see no sir said she not for that but i have a fresh parcel of oranges come in last night and my lady ordered me to bring some of the first i had why good woman said i she cannot want any yet sure you brought her a sufficient quantity yesterday to serve her a great while even as long as they will last good i cannot tell for that said she but as long as she ordered me to bring her some i will even carry em but said i why did not you bring my fruit at the same time laud said the old woman i protest i forgot it but i shall be back presently and then i will gather em fresh for you for as yet i will assure you they are growing i soon found by all this hurry there was another letter to be delivered and i was resolved to read it by fair means or otherwise pray said i good woman how do you sell your ware a dozen why truly sir said she half a crown why then said i i will give you the money and make my mother a present of em  the woman was struck dumb at what i said but at last she recovered her confusion and with a stammering tongue told me she would not do such a thing for all the world pray good woman said i can you out of your wisdom tell me what reason you have for refusing me your oranges when i offer to pay you for em and carry em home myself without giving you any farther trouble she could not give me any reasonable answer to my question so i even resolved to declare to her my knowledge of her affair which when i had done she fell down upon her knees and begged i would forgive her telling me she would never be guilty of the like again good woman said i the way to make me excuse you and keep this a secret though such a guilty commerce is the greatest crime is to deliver me your whole affair and deal ingenuously with me i have given you convincing proofs that i know your proceedings hitherto and shall be able to judge whether you are sincere or no why then truly sir said she all i have done was merely out of necessity mr wigmore you know has a very persuasive tongue especially backed with his money well good woman said i go on for at present i have no acquaintance with the person you mention really nor i neither but that he has come often to our house to meet my lady and it was the same person you saw with me yesterday  i was too eager to ask many questions therefore i bid her tell me what was her present errant nothing sir but to carry a letter in an orange as i did yesterday in the afternoon upon that i took out the orange she told me it was in and read as follows dear madam though i was infinitely rejoiced at your kind letter yesterday and the pleasing hope of seeing you today yet i must beg of you for both our safeties to defer my longing expectations till we can find some more convenient place of meeting that villain burleigh has been with me again and has by some means unknown to me discovered our meeting therefore let me once more entreat you to think of some other place where we may feed our famished joys the time will not permit you to send me any answer by our emissary who i believe is very faithful therefore i will wait in my usual disguise at the usual place but let me beg you by our past enjoyments to fix by this afternoon a secure place where i may take to my arms all that is valuable in this world to the expecting  wigmore p s i beg you for both our quiets to stop the mouth of the implacable burleigh       when i had read the note i was well convinced my mother was returned to her former vice but could not determine which was the best way either to send the letter or keep it to show my father and uncle to convince em of her perfidy while i was reading the epistle the woman had time to come to herself and asked me how she should behave in the affair for said she if i go back mr wigmore will certainly discover me therefore if you will please to instruct me in what i shall say to him i will be sure to follow your directions well good woman said i since you are so condescending i will ask your advice for i dont doubt however you express yourself in words you have cunning enough in your business to advise me if you think so sir said she you shall have my counsel such as it is hold then said i since it is so let me do as a client should do pay my fee beforehand upon saying this i gave her a crown she was very much surpised at it and viewed me from head to foot as if she had said she could not imagine i was master of such a sum when she had recovered her speech for old women dont want tongue long i find said she by your fee you expect good counsel therefore i would advise you if you can counterfeit a hand any thing like your mothers to send him an answer that shall forewarn him to come to her any more i fear said i good woman we shall be found out for such an answer will be too sudden for the kind return she sent him yesterday why i think you are in the right there replied the old woman and i believe it was kind enough for he kissed it several times when he first had it seeming greatly pleased and since you dont approve of my advice i dare swear you can tell what to do without me prythee said i good woman know you any thing of the affair between my motherinlaw and this wigmore your sincerity in your confession shall oblige me to find a recompense really replied the woman i know nothing more than that they have met at my house about some dozen times and i was so well paid that i must freely own i wish it had been oftener for indeed young sir i am a very poor woman and money as i told you before carries a great deal of persuasion with it though i must needs own i would much rather have gotten money honestly but then again if i had not undertaken the affair somebody else would so i thought it was as much my business as  well well mistress i am not asking what was the motive that induced you to it i am pretty well acquainted with it already but i would know what correspondence has been carried on between the parties indeed sir i know no more than i have told you before that they meet at my house and have a private room to themselves mr wigmore and your mother both were strangers to me a twelvemonth ago and i know no more of mr wigmore now but that he comes to our town almost every day and they say he lives at a lords about ten mile off but i have forgot his name but sir i would not have you defer what you intend to do any longer for mr wigmore will think me long a coming and perhaps come to meet me as he has often done you advise well i returned one word more and i have done have you no knowledge of one burleigh that is mentioned in this note no really sir said she but i know there has been a man with mr wigmore and his visits have given him much uneasiness but i dont know the reason of it  i was convinced by the womans manner of speaking that she was sincere in what she said and as she knew nothing more i was resolved to ask her no more questions but being fortunately provided with a pencil and some paper i wrote the following words mr wigmore i have at last repented of my behavior to a husband that deserves the best of wives therefore i beg you will do your endeavor to forget me it being the safety conduct for us both i fear i am suspected already and the way to wipe off all manner of suspicion is no more to be guilty farewell and be happy     i read the note to the old woman who approved of it i had counterfeited my mothers hand so well that it could hardly be distinguished especially being wrote with a pencil and i ordered the woman to tell mr wigmore that my mother was in a chamber where she had not the convenience of pen and ink the old woman put it up in the room of the other giving me her promise to be very faithful in her new commission i gave her assurance of being well rewarded for her pains and so we parted  as i was going home i began to consider what i had done and soon imagined this affair of my mothers could not be long a secret therefore i resolved within myself to take an opportunity of disclosing it to her with a faithful account of all the proceedings as well as the knowledge i had of her intended barbarous design against me i did not know but this might deter her from her cruel intentions but then i began to consider that in all my readings i had learnt the cruelty of a woman was hard to be removed therefore i determined to declare all to my uncle and take his advice upon it  when i came home the family were at breakfast which was something earlier than usual but i was soon acquainted with the reason for my good motherinlaw it seems did design to set out immediately to see a friend that was dangerously ill as this was no new thing so it alarmed no one but me for the good woman pretended to understand abundance of things and was a second lady bountiful this practice i suppose she took up to blind the eyes of my father and family that they might not look too narrowly into her actions when i was sat among em i was asked to drink tea but i excused myself by telling em i had my breakfast already and looked my mother full in the face but she regarded me not having i suppose her thoughts taken up concerning that days business pray said my uncle have you broke your fast with homer or virgil this morning neither sir said i i have kept no other company but juvenal today and why so fond of satyr sir said my uncle that favors of ill nature true sir i returned for i cannot think the writings of either juvenal or petronius true copies of those times i cannot imagine either the men or the women such monsters of iniquity as those authors represent em that replied my uncle proceeds from the simple innocence of thy own thoughts but we have instances every day of the inhumanity and all other vicious principles of either sex are not the sessionspapers frequently filled with barbarous and inhuman murders men of their wives and wives of their husbands and children but the crying sin of murder is oftener perpetrated by the women than the men being their passions are more violent and vindictive and once entered in the road of wickedness they generally travel to the end on it  i observed my motherinlaw did not very well relish the discourse therefore ordered her pad to be ready what said my uncle does my sister go alone sure it will not be improper for a servant to wait on her no sir replied my mother i always visit my patients alone for this reason if i should take a servant with me they would presume on the benefit the patient might hope to receive expecting some reward which to avoid i never take one with me beside i am so well known round me country that i never met with any insults from any one nay said my uncle smiling innocence and virtue are sufficient guards and those i dont doubt but my sister takes along with her she made him no answer but immediately mounted and rode away as soon as she was gone i ran up to the top of the house where was a cupola that commanded a large prospect i perceived ere she had got a quarter of a mile from our house she met a countryman who stopped and discoursed together i had a perspective in my study which i had brought up with me and i could plainly perceive they were very earnest in discourse for i could distinguish their countenances as plain as if they had not been forty yards from me after talking some time i observed my mother stoop down to kiss him first looking about if the coast was clear then turned her horses head in order to come home again as i thought upon this i immediately went down to acquaint my uncle with my mornings adventure but was informed that my father and he were shut up together in his closet as they had locked the door i supposed they had no mind to be disturbed therefore retired with a mind in the utmost confusion of thought for i imagined with probability enough that my uncle was acquainting my father with what i had informed him of my motherinlaw  the anxiety i felt for what i supposed would follow when all was discovered almost robbed me of my understanding i took several hasty turns in the courtyard without knowing where i was at last it occurred to my memory that i had seen my motherinlaw turn her horses head in order as i imagined to come home but wondered at her delay for more time was past than was necessary for her return at a moderate pace after waiting and not seeing her i began to think she had altered her resolution and proceeded on her intended wicked journey while i was ruminating on this wretched affair my father and uncle came to me my uncle told me he had been depositing a copy of his will into my fathers hands that if death should pay him a visit unexpectedly and the lawyer out of the way we might by having recourse to that copy know how far i was beholden to him  after some talk i took an opportunity to let my uncle know i had something to communicate to him who was as forward to give me an occasion of talking with him when we were disengaged from my father i acquainted my uncle with what i had done yesterday and this morning and what observations i had made on my motherinlaw certainly said my uncle this woman as far exceeds the lascivious queen of naples in wickedness as she did the rest of her sex what think you sir said i if we take horse and follow her it may be we may have the fortune of finding the bottom of this intrigue or at least from thence know how to form your behavior to her and my father my uncle liked my advice so well that we immediately mounted our horses without letting my father know of our going ere we had gone half a mile the horse my uncle rode on which was one of my fathers fell a neighing and was answered by another in a neighboring thicket as we went forward the horse seemed willing to go that way nay said my uncle if you have such a mind to go out of the road i will humor you for once it may be as we are knightserrant we may meet with some extraordinary adventure accordingly he gave the horse the reins and he readily entered the copse the first thing our eyes encountered was my mothers pad tied to a tree and a little farther behind some shrubs we discovered my good motherinlaw and a likely countryfellow very familiar together you may guess their surprise at the sight of us and ours was almost as great but my motherinlaw recovered herself the soonest ran to horse mounted without any help and rode off on my conscience said my uncle the honest countryman has put vigor into her ladyship but i think it a pity he should go unrewarded and that he may be the fitter for running well make him something lighter  the man found it was to no purpose to attempt running away as he was on foot therefore he approached us with a submissive behavior and begged our pardon imagining we were strangers to my father and his wife telling us he hoped we would not expose a lady to an injured husbands resentment sir said i i remember you now notwithstanding your disguise and this is not the first time you have seen me call to mind yesterday look in my face and then consider the injury you have done my worthy father and his family i then informed my uncle this was the person that met me yesterday conversing with the old woman who was the lettercarrier then said the disguised countryman i find all is discovered but if you are persons of honor you will not oppress a naked man i own my guilt nay will confess the whole progress of it if you will forgive me do but keep it a secret from the husband and i farther vow never to be guilty that way again  i am a gentleman of a good family but fallen to decay necessity first drew me into this criminal conversation with the lady though i must own notwithstanding our disparity of years i have a tender regard for her youth do not always weigh their actions and for want of thought plunge into crimes we are afterward ashamed of well young man said my uncle though you have injured a noble family yet as you seem to repent of your past folly and if you fulfill your promise of revealing this black correspondence i shall freely pardon you and desire never to see you more i thank you replied the offender but i must farther beg you to mend your promise by concealing this affair from all the world well said my uncle notwithstanding this womans wickedness which you are a stranger to at least the worst part of her vile intentions i will with this young gentlemans consent pointing at me keep this a secret till we have reason to suspect she continues in her wicked courses that is all i ask or can well desire said the gentleman in disguise and began as follows  i was born younger brother to a numerous issue and therefore designed for a tradesman i was put prentice to a mercer in the city where i learnt little else but idleness and intriguing and wronging my master by mispending his time and money you may perceive gentlemen said he i intend to be sincere by revealing the crimes of my first setting out in the world my fellowprentices i believe had no more honesty than myself though we were never privy to each others secrets before i had served three years of my time my master found his business in a very declining condition as indeed how could it be otherwise when he had so many harpies about him his friends to do him service had a statute of bankrupcy taken out against him which in a year or two turned much to his advantage for by that means he got rid of his creditors and his servants  he has since married a good fortune and drives a flourishing trade my relations pressed him to accept of me for the remainder of my time but he had too just an opinion of me to comply with their requests the character i bore was the obstacle that no one of the trade would entertain me and my relations perceiving how matters went thought it was to no purpose to think of the counter for me therefore prevailed upon a noble lord to accept me for his gentleman who out of regard to my family used me like one it is needless to inform you of the many intrigues i went through while i was a retainer with this noble peer but i shall proceed to the affair with this lady  the first time i saw her was at a neighboring gentlewomans a relation to our family and a lover of intrigues once every week she had an assembly where all the idle people of fashion resorted to game and make merry i observed she often cast a favorable eye upon me though it was some time before i took any notice of it but one day losing a considerable sum at quadrille i was walking very melancholy alone in the garden with troubled thoughts how to get more i was interrupted in my meditations by this lady who after much talk of indifferent matters told me a young gentleman without money made but a dismal figure come come said she dont let us lose your company for want of a little trash gamesters have various fortune she may cast a more favorable eye upon you at your next trial therefore there is a hundred pieces to tempt her i dont doubt but you will soon be in a capacity to pay me  i was so overjoyed at the sight of the money that i was too eager for play to return her then the suitable thanks for so great a favor but immediately hurried among the gamesters and in less than an hour recovered my own money and a handsome sum beside at basset immediately after the company broke up play and went to supper my good fortune had so much elevated me that i had no stomach to eat for i believe extremes either way for some time spoil the appetite therefore i took a walk in the garden again in a far better temper than when i was there before i had not walked long ere i perceived the lady in the same walk but whether she had continued there or had come after me i could not tell for my good fortune had quite blinded me however i went up to her and thanked her for the great favor i had received and was fumbling for the money to repay her come said she i am not in such haste well find a time to be paid after supper no doubt you will try the fickle dame again therefore keep it till i demand it of you it is very possible i may soon stand in as much need of it as you did some time ago till then you shall be my banker  i dont know how much farther we should have proceeded if we had not been interrupted by some of the company which she perceiving coming toward us gave me a gentle press by the fingers and left me it was not very difficult to guess she had a farther meaning in leaving her money in my hands and i must own i was not displeased with the thoughts of it for even her person did not seem despicable to me so on that score i should not need much constraint in my compliance but the pleasure of being paid for whatever trouble i should be at was the most prevailing argument the next assembly i was prevented in making one of the company because my lord took me out a hunting the morning following an old woman brought me this letter pulling one out of his bosom which i took from him by my uncles order see billy said he if it be that ill womans hand when i assured him it was i read the contents as follows sir i should have been very well pleased if you could have made one of the company yesterday for fortune was so favorable to me to keep me in countenance during the whole evening i have another sum to put into my bankers hands and if he will follow the directions of the bearer he may have full possession of it this evening  yours etc     i was very well pleased with this billet and took instructions where to wait on the lady when evening came i went to the place appointed where i found her waiting with some impatience as she told me the old woman left us alone and it was not long ere we came to a right understanding which acquaintance has continued upwards of four years yet i must own to you her conversation was always agreeable to me setting aside my interest but sir said i in one of your letters you sent a day or two ago you mention one burleigh and that you feared some rash proceedings from him pray what do you know of him really very little replied wigmore but i am very much surpised that you know any thing of that letter i never thought the old woman would have betrayed me no said i she has not betrayed you she was only overreached though now i believe she repents of her past actions why then said wigmore the hand of heaven has pointed her out as a mark for my repentance which i will sincerely for all my past follies well sir said my uncle i am inclined to believe you but pray to make me stronger in that faith deliver us what letters you have of hers upon my honor i will never put em to a wrong use i shall confide in you replied mr wigmore and therefore put em into your hands i carry em always about me that no accident should discover our affair but i am convinced heaven will not let such actions be ever a secret you may see added he how they followed one another because i have numbered em as i received em after my uncle had given him some wholesome advice relating to conduct in life we left him  well said my uncle now let us examine the contents of these fine epistles come billy your eyes are younger than mine read em i then opened numb   having read numb   before which was as follows what words can express the satisfaction i received at our last conversation i am impatient till i see the light of my life again and if you would not leave me for ever in darkness come this evening to the same place to receive with the utmost transports from one all that is in her power to give who thinks it her only happiness to call herself  yours etc     well said cried my uncle the woman was well pleased i find she writes pretty plain but what will not women do when they abandon modesty but come to the next let us have some more of her wit and parts  numb iii my dear boy some hated familybusiness will prevent my seeing the darling of my soul tomorrow but be assured the usual time of the day following shall bring me to your arms where we will revel in delight and laugh at my foolish credulous husband who imagines when i come to see you i am visiting the sick but the poor man is very wicked and i can think of no other way of sending him to heaven but with the assistance of my dear wigmore i would have you make our gobetween goody  a present of a pair of sheets for she complained to me heavily of the want of em and though i believe she is very faithful to us yet now and then a small trifle that way will not only keep her in humor but make it her interest to observe us farewell and be happy though i shall not taste of it till i see those eyes  yours etc   o woman woman said my uncle how ripe in wickedness the most profligate of man would not have been openhearted so soon but come let us make an end with her as fast as we can for i have almost enough of her  numb iv what a despicable creature is a husband after the ardent embraces of a lover i thought nothing could have added to the aversion i had already conceived for him but since i have known thee thou charmer of my soul i find that aversion daily increase i yield to his fulsome caresses as the criminal receives the parting kiss of the executioner and what is the greatest torment i am obliged to fain a wanton joy which you know is real but i must dissemble to all the world but my dear wigmore and whatever i say or do to him comes from the warm blood of my heart i am sick of this evil of a husband but one touch from you will heal my disease i only wish as we have shown him the ready road to heaven he would set out toward his journey nay to make the more haste i would lend him a hand to pull on his boots but let us have a little patience time kills as well as cures tomorrow i shall open my heart to him that has the soul of  j v   sure said my uncle this is the quintessence of all ill women put together but on  numb v pity my dear wigmore the grief of mind i lie under but you may guess the cause when i declare it is not in my power to see you these ten days except you can think of some disguise for my son johnny is taken ill of the smallpox i am obliged to attend him myself for he will not let any of the family give him the least nourishment but if you can think of any disguise and venture at the back of our garden near the tree where i hide my letters in the dusk of the evening though no disguise can hide the dear wigmore from me who will ever carry his image in my heart i will find an opportunity of seeing him in reality who is always present to the imagination of one who shall be ever  yours etc   pray said my uncle is there no date to these loving epistles no sir said i but we may guess pretty near the time by my brothers having the smallpox which is near three years ago well on to the next said my uncle  numb vi i thank my stars my boy is past all danger that and the hopes of seeing my dear wigmore again at a more convenient place than our last made me comply with my husbands request of making one bed serve us both but as i thought of you all day i dreamt of you all night when wished morning came my husband went out a hunting and having an opportunity with a poetical fancy in my head i have put my dream into as good verse as ever i could but you must forgive bad numbers since love of you has made me a poet  when balmy sleep my eyelids closed and half the world their cares reposed your image filled my fancied breast my eager arms the phantome pressed waked with thimaginary bliss i strove to give my love a kiss but death to love and all loves charms i found my husband in my arms the nauseous joy his tongue expressed quite robbed my gentle heart of rest but yet to cover the deceit i was compelled to aid the cheat and kiss for kiss return again when nothing could be greater pain for bankrupts too to make demands curse on the priest that joined our hands but all my grief and all annoy at sight of thee will turn to joy when you my dazzled eyes shall bless all sorrow turns to happiness  oh the devil said my uncle shall such a wicked wretch as this woman pretend to taste of the heavenly drops of poetry when all hell is in her soul it is the greatest profanation to the muses yet though clio cannot tune her lyre melpomene presides over her black soul together with alecto and the rest of the furies this woman would have been well pleased to have been a samorin wife the country of the samorins reaches along the seacoast of the east indies from ticori to chitwa it is the custom of that country for the women to have twelve husbands if they think fit yet they all agree very well taking their turns to cohabit with the wife the husband whose turn it is leaves his arms at the door of the wifes chamber which must not be removed on pain of death when the wife is with child she names the husband who is to father it and he is to take care of its education but those children do never inherit their fathers estate that descends to the male issue of the fathers sister but if she have no issue the estate comes to the nearest relation of the fathers grandmother  but i hope continued my uncle there is not many more yes sir said i there is five more and i find by the numbers there is some wanting for the next is numb   those replied my uncle no doubt contained something too dangerous to be kept as we were preparing to read the next letter we could perceive running toward us the person they were sent to we were something surpised at his return but when he came up to us for we stood still to read the letters he told us almost out of breath with running that burleigh was coming the same way and no doubt for no good for i know he has been disappointed by my lady concerning the receiving of money which disappointment has so much exasperated him that he resolves to ruin my lady though i know not by what means we perceived a man about a quarter of a mile behind us bending his course toward our house the footway my uncle asked what was best to be done why sir said mr wigmore if you will give me leave to advise you i would have you prevent his getting to my ladys if possible for this time who knows what may follow i intend if you approve of it to write to my lady which letter if you please you shall see first wherein i will declare all correspondence for the future shall be entirely broke off between us and to convince her i am sincere in what i write to crush all her hopes at once in a few days i intend to embark for virginia where i have some relations in power that i am assured will provide for me do so said my uncle but how shall we see this letter why returned mr wigmore i will be walking before the courtgate under the great trees three hours hence my disguise will prevent my being known by any one but you two gentlemen or my lady and if i can meet with my lady i should be pleased to deliver the letter to her myself well said my uncle let it be so but will tells me there is some letters missing as you have numbered em pray what might they contain if it is not improper to know really replied mr wigmore i cannot very well remember the contents but in gross they were something too free for a womans pen i believe said my uncle if the story of the norman monk was true richard sirnamd the religious grandson to rollo duke of normandy was esteemed a prince of singular piety among many monkish stories of him the following one seems to be calculated for those of large faith  a monk of normandy given more to the flesh than the spirit used to visit his mistress by night for more secrecy one very dark evening going to the rendezvous his way lying over a bridge he fell in and was drowned when his soul was descended into the regions of the dead an angel of light and another of darkness had many strugglings about it but not agreeing they resolved to put it to the decision of the pious duke richard the angels pleaded like themselves before their judge who wisely weighing the matter gave sentence the body should have its soul again and placed near the bridge where he fell from if he fell in the black gentleman should take him for his perquisite the sentence being put in execution the priest had learnt more wit returned to his convent and there defied the devil and all his works this affair was so quick in the dispatch that duke richard going to the convent to see what was become of the monk found his habit all wet with his fall into the river    and this woman was in his condition it would not be hard to guess which angel would have the guardianship of her ladyship come sir said mr wigmore may be heaven intends all for the best i hope so too replied my uncle but i fear without a miracle she will go the other way for all that however i will wait patiently though with little hope more for the peace and quiet of my brother and his family than any good will to such a wicked woman  i fear sir said i you will not have time enough for reflection now for burleigh walks at a very great rate therefore the sooner we think how to prevent his getting to the house the better od so said my uncle that is true then let us be gone and leave mr wigmore to think of his epistle  the horseroad to our house was even with the footroad till within a furlong of the gate and then there was no other way but the common road we kept just before burleigh all the way and as he came over the last style he stumbled and fell on his face why how now honest friend said my uncle you seem so much in haste that you dont regard your way take care remember the old saying the more haste the worse speed which has indeed no other meaning than when people go about things unlawful they should not succeed if you were a roman now you should take that for an ill omen why replied burleigh something surlily what matter is it to you or any body else whether i am a roman or a protestant a dissenter or a muggletonian an anabaptist or a quaker or  hold hold cried my uncle smiling at his absurdity you seem to be pretty perfect in the names of many opinions and yet i fancy you are a mere stranger to the tenets of any of em i am well skilled in physiognomy and to assure you that i am you are now going about a black work that let it go which way it will must of mere necessity bring you into extreme danger and trouble  why the devils in the gentleman replied burleigh with a lessassurd tone than at first or if the devil is not in you you must be the devil himself or at least a conjuror good friend returned my uncle i am neither the devil nor a conjuror and yet i can tell and foretell and farther i assure you looking him full in the face which put the other out of countenance if you proceed in this business you will be in some danger of a halter examine your conscience you know if what i say be true or no return from whence you came and for the future amend your life and know me for your friend amend your life and know me for your friend cried burleigh muttering sure i am asleep and all this is a dream he stood some time gazing at my uncle and then at me pray sir said he after a pause who the devil are you and what business have you with me i am going about my affairs and shall not stay any longer losing my time upon saying this he was pressing on but my uncle crossed him with his horse and calling him by his name with a menacing tone told him he should severely repent it if he moved a step farther toward that house pointing at my fathers neither is the lady whom you go to seek at home she is gone to visit a sick person return three days hence and it may be you will meet with better success than you expect whether my uncles stern looks frighted him or that he really thought him the devil i cannot tell but at those last words he went back again over the style turned to give us another look and ran back the way he came as fast as his legs could carry him  there is more said my uncle in a guilty conscience than a brace of evidences it is not impossible but this is the sure means of your mothers getting rid of this troublesome retainer so i suppose there will be an annual pension saved but what shall we do with this woman if she has any grace left the best way of showing it will be to hang herself out of the way for i must own i cannot find any other method to give peace to the family if we should conceal these horrible crimes in hopes of her amendment and she should commit more we are in some sort accessory but heaven guide us for the best we must proceed as things occurr when the groom had taken our horses my uncle asked him if he knew where his master was he answered that he rid out presently after us being informed we were taking the air and that he took the same road as we had done sure said my uncle softly to me providence by its secret workings intends to reclaim this woman or by its mysterious darkness will have her stumble into more wickedness for my brothers missing us must be almost a miracle prythee let us go into the summer house and think on these wretched accidents over again  as we went through the hall i saw betty at work and letting my uncle go before i informed her in brief of the days affair she seemed quite dead with my relation for gods sake said she if you have any value for your own life get out of her power for if she can be so wicked to do as you say i fear she will arrive at the same pitch she was at before i must own continued she my own life is but of small value and i would freely part with it to atone for my past crimes if it could save my dear masters but methinks i would not have it made a sacrifice to a revengeful woman who will be sure to rid her hands of me because she remembers i know her former wicked intention  well betty said i rest contented you are provided for if you can like my uncles service for i have prevailed upon him to accept you for his housekeeper therefore whenever you think fit you may leave my lady and be received there without any other recommendation she was very much rejoiced at the agreeable news telling me such good fortune was far beyond her hopes yet nothing she told me could make her easy till i was entirely out of my motherinlaws reach well betty i returned i hope every thing will be determined in a few days and so followed my uncle  when i came into the summer house to him he asked me why i staid when i informed him he did not seem pleased it had not been much matter said he billy whether betty had been let into the secret so soon but however it cannot be helped i must own she knows enough already to be trusted with every thing we canvassd the matter over several times but could make very little of it and before we could come to any resolution betty interrupted us by bringing a letter directed to my uncle which she said the messenger that brought it told her it required no answer prythee billy said my uncle read it for i have no secrets shall be hid from you as soon as i had cast my eyes on the directions i told him it was my motherinlaws hand odso said he this is an honor indeed for i never was favored so far before but let us hear what her ladyship can say for herself may be it is a letter of leave to dispose of her sweet person or rather now i think on it to be careful of her dear wigmore but read it that we may be acquainted with her commands  sir what shall i say to gain credit that what i write to you is sincere if the ripping out my false heart would do it it should be done this moment what you have guided by fate seen today i must confess is not my only crime but whatever i have been guilty of shall be remembered only with a sincere repentance do not imbitter our lives by discovering to my too indulgent husband the faults of his wicked wife if you knew with what horror my soul is filled not for the fear of punishment but for what my unthinking heart has dene even you would pity me consider the rarer virtue is in forgiveness it is that which distinguishes us from brutes do you stand in the place of my husband think no more of what is past and upon the assurance of a hearty repentance i will never have a thought of my former guilt but to bewail my fall from virtue though you are no great admirer of the female sex i am assured you have humanity i shall expect no answer but come home in the evening as usual where if i find all discovered i shall not in my heart blame you but i will to get rid of my shame put an end to the life of  your affectionate sister j v   that word affectionate at last said my uncle puts me out of conceit with all the rest however well comply and beg the hand of heaven to guide us while we were debating my father came in i thought said he you were both run away you disappeared so suddenly pray which way went you and how was it possible for me to miss you we only rid into the copse after a hare replied my uncle that a countryman informed us he saw there but the greyhound lost her  we took several turns in the garden and i could not look upon my father without the tears coming into my eyes how different thought i is this woman from my dear mother and how unhappy has a second marriage made the family my father took notice of my melancholy asking if i was out of order but my uncle made him an answer for the question came so much unlooked for that i could not tell what to say billy said he i believe is out of humor because i hindered his going to pore over his books for he thinks every hour lost out of such company i made him no answer which confirmed what my uncle said i hope billy returned my father has read enough not to take any thing ill his uncle says my uncle finding he could not make me dissipate that discontent that sat on my countenance turned the discourse and by that brought me out of my confusion our uneasy conversation was broke by the ringing of the bell for dinner where i was forced to eat against my stomach for fear my father should take more notice of me  when we had dined my father went to take a nap as usual which gave my uncle and me an opportunity of waiting without observation for mr wigmore with his letter about three in the afternoon we saw him approach us in the same disguise he had on in the morning we went out to meet him that we might not be observed by the servants of the house when he was within hearing my uncle bid him turn back and we would follow to the copse  when we came there said mr wigmore this place strengthens the memory of my crimes i have already repented of and shall to my dying breath here sir is the letter i promised in the morning and whatever fault you find with it i will do my endeavor to mend it my uncle took the letter and gave it me to read which was as follows madam if my life would call back past years i would freely render it for that satisfaction to die an innocent heaven sees our guilt and if we do not repent i fear will severely punish us all the hours i have to come i shall remember our past crimes with horror and i do not in the least doubt but you will do so too when you reflect what it is to defile the marriage bed even with a thought do not imagine fear obliges me to write to you in this manner no it is the result of my thoughts from an unquiet conscience i do not say it is easy for me to part with you for ever therefore as i am assured our guilty commerce ought to have an end i intend tomorrow to imbark for another climate where i shall have leisure to reflect on my past follies those i confess are very numerous but my capital sin was my tenderness for you and that i fear will press in sometimes in a manner not pleasing to virtuous men which character for the future heaven assist me to maintain so wishing you an eternal farewell i beg you to think on the advice of your sincere friend in virtue  t wigmore     well said my uncle as there is i hope truth in it there is no want of rhetoric but how must this be delivered to the good gentlewoman now it will not be at all proper for either my nephew or me to have a hand in it for that may raise suspicions suppose replied mr wigmore we should give it mrs betty with all my heart said my uncle if billy approves on it i must own i replied that is the safest method we can take but as the case stands betty must know the contents or she will not deliver it we agreed it should be so and took our leaves of mr wigmore with thoughts of never seeing him more i must confess i could not look upon him without the utmost horror though his guilt was not near of so black a dye as my motherinlaws and i had such a conflict between reason and rage that i had often thoughts young as i was to call him to a more strict account but the hopes of his going abroad laid asleep my resentment i thought i made but an odd figure in tamely listening to these interviews and told my uncle afterward what i had suffered it is well boy said he smiling he that conquers his passions overcomes his greatest enemy even scipio could do no more  when we came home we were told my father was still asleep i therefore went to find out betty to give her the letter and proper instructions first acquainting her with the contents this betty may work upon her i pray heaven it may says betty for if she still continues her ill life there is no farther hopes we must discover all to your father to prevent her ill designs for the future while i was talking with betty my uncle came to us and in a merry manner told her he should soon have occasion for her nay he would be sure to manage it that her mistress should give her consent but said my uncle i think i ought to limit your power for my last lady had something too much however i will take your word and williams bond for the performance of articles but to think of more serious matters continued my uncle i wish my brother could be got out of the way when his good lady arrives that we may have a little more freedom of conversation for i am not yet fully determined what to do with her sir said i i know the ready way to send him abroad only tell him in such a place is a covy of partridges and he and his man will soon leave us neither is it a falsehood for the other morning as i was going to meet the old woman a covy sprung up almost under my feet be it so then said my uncle and here he comes get him out of the way as fast as you can i then went to my father and informed him of what i knew who immediately called for his man his dog and his gun and out he went first asking us if we would accompany him but my uncle excused himself and me too  he had not been gone above half a hour but my motherinlaw came in with a countenance full of penitential sorrow as soon as ever she had an opportunity she fell at my uncles feet and with her face sprinkled with tears and a broken voice interrupted with sighs spoke to my uncle after this manner  how shall i look up or what shall i do to gain credit for what i am going to say it is but justice to suspect the sincerity of my words after what your eyes have seen but be assured from this day i will take my date of virtue while i have life never will i wrong my worthy husband even with a thought what a gaping ruin have i avoided if you will be prevailed upon by repentance to believe me and to gain more credit from you i am obliged to let you know that even adultery is not my greatest sin i have since you saw me last weighed well my past crimes and think there is not such another wicked woman breathing but heaven i hope has in its infinite stock of mercy forgiveness in store for a sincere repentance if my words cannot gain credit let your sword blot out with my blood my former wickedness i know i have deserved death and shall with satisfaction resign my self to your punishment if you can conceal my crimes you may term it accident or whatever you think fit for i am even weary of this world made burdensome to me by the weight of sin i have laid upon myself and would freely make an end of this wretched being with my own hands but that i consider i should commit a crime never to be repented of and take away all hopes of salvation even in the very act though i doubt not but sorrow in a few days will end my crimes with my life and the sooner that day comes the sooner i shall be rid of a terrible load of reflection even worse than death itself here tears choked her words and she sunk to the ground quite overwhelmed with sorrow  well madam said my uncle raising her if all this grief is not real you are an excellent counterfeit but i am willing to believe you sincere in your confession and for my own part i will strive to forget all that is past or think of it as a dream but you must pardon me if i am more careful for the future in observing your actions for if you should make an ill use of my credulity i should in some sort be guilty sir said my motherinlaw words are too poor to speak my thanks but you shall find my sincerity by my actions if in the least of all my future ones you find me erring i shall expect no admonition from you but to be delivered up to the hands of justice and that you may have it in your power to call me to an account when you please i shall succinctly tell you which way i deserve the worst of deaths she then related what you have read already concerning her first husbands death but solemnly protested the poison was given him by mistake for though she procured it for that intent yet she had repented of her wicked design and it being put into the closet by mistake among some cordials the nurse gave it her husband as such for she was so far from believing that he came by his death through her means that she accused the apothecarys man and had followed the accusation if she had not found out the mistake i must own i had a guilty commerce with the apothecary who left off making his visits after my husbands unfortunate end this proceeding exasperated me so far that i often wished his death and the devil to back my wishes brought me acquainted with one burleigh who used to work in the gardens as helper to the gardener though otherwise a trooper he undertook the black deed and the day he first knew my mind he put me past the power to recall it by making an end of the unfortunate man for even as soon as i parted with him i repented of the crime and though i sought him all the day after to prevent the deed i never set eyes on him till he came to tell me my commands were obeyed the concern i felt at the wicked news could hardly be expressed by words but the wretch taking hold of my weakness made me comply with every thing he desired and even to this day compels me to maintain him  all the while she was relating her horrid deeds my uncle seemed perfectly thunderstruck who would think said he one woman could be so wicked sir said she that is not all then she proceeded to tell us of her designs against me but that said she i have long since repented of as my worst of crimes  well said my uncle i hope by this confession we shall find your future sincerity but what do you propose to do with this burleigh it was with some difficulty i prevented his coming here today though i am amazed to find you know any thing of him said my motherinlaw yet i should be much obliged to you for your advice in this affair well said my uncle in hopes of future amendment i have it in my head to get rid of him which shall be done tomorrow if you will let me know where to find him this sir said she will double all my obligations to you i will give you a direction in writing while she was writing the direction betty brought her mr wigmores letter which she took and read well said she i take heaven to have a hand in my conversion for here is another convert which very much pleases me because i was troubled before how to make an end with him she then related what had past between em and all her relations agreed so well with what we knew before that we thought it a crime in us not to believe her promises for her future behavior  a little while after word was brought us my father was come home how said my motherinlaw shall i look upon that dear injured face without betraying my guilt when i was envelopd in sin without thought of repentance i could form my behavior as i thought fit without any difficulty but now i cannot tell how to appear before him without the utmost confusion pray said my uncle let this be the last act of dissembling and hide from him the combat in your mind time will bring you to the tranquillity of virtue again  when my father came to us he seemed very much pleased with his diversion what said he you must be idling at home while i am obliged to go abroad to procure you a supper well i have got every man his bird it is your duty replied my uncle to provide for your family though billy and i are at present interlopers heyday cried my father what is the matter with jane meaning his wife are your patients got well upon your hands my dear that you have not an opportunity of showing your art you look so melancholy i am not very well my dear replied my mother in some confusion i am sorry for that returned my father but as you can cure other people i hope you know what is good for yourself yes sir said she i have been troubled with it a great while it is a heaviness of heart but i have taken that i hope will cure it a heaviness of heart replied my father there is nothing cures that distemper like a glass or two of good wine nay i think it a general cure for all diseases and the sooner you take the remedy the sooner you will get rid of your malady i think said my uncle that physic is good for us all therefore let us have it while the wine was gone for my father seemed to caress his wife which occasioned her bursting into tears pray said he my dear tell me what is it disturbs you in truth sir said she i am not very well and beg leave i may go to bed perhaps rest may help me so saying she took leave of the company and retired when my father had drank a glass of wine he followed her to know how she did and left my uncle and me together  well billy said he what think you of affairs do you believe she is sincere in her protestations yes really sir said i if she does continue it i am confounded returned my uncle at what i have heard if she should be as good as her word and let murdering sorrow make an end of her i must confess i should be very easy notwithstanding her penitence however we must find out burleigh tomorrow and get rid of him and though i am assured he deserves an halter yet i will give him a few pieces to send him into another part of the world with all my heart and then sure she will be easy i am of your opinion sir said i i fansy her decline of years will prevent her seeking another lover i do not know that replied my uncle that itching folly never considers years however i believe we have nothing to fear from her but if we should be deceived i should never forgive myself i must own it is but seldom virtue succeeds vice yet such things have been and therefore may happen again we have all the prospect we can desire in the confession of her guilt for as she was ignorant of our knowledge of it she might have spared the relation if she had not intended for the future to amend her life we had much discourse concerning her till interrupted by my father who told us his wife seemed very much indisposed but he hoped rest would restore her for my own part i freely declare her death would certainly have grieved me but the content i should have found from the familys being entirely out of her power would have soon wiped away my tears  after supper i informed betty of all passages whose hopes and fears agreed with mine though our hopes by far overbalancd our fears  in the morning my uncle told my father that he and i had a visit to make and very possibly might be obliged to stay dinner accordingly we took horse but in order to find out burleigh who lived in an obscure village three miles from my fathers when we arrived we could perceive him running out of the backdoor at the first sight of us and i believe would have got away from us if his overhaste had not often made him fall in the stubble when we overtook him my uncle asked him why he made such haste from his best friends why to tell you the truth sir said he i dont care for conversing with the devil for i can hardly take you for any thing else why said my uncle were you not afraid of conversing with him when you made away with mr  the apothecary for murder is always instigated by the devil at these words the fellow fell a trembling and cried out i am a dead man no said my uncle though murder should never be forgiven and though i am no devil yet i have sufficient reasons to assist you in making your escape for if you stay four and twenty hours justice will lay hold on you and there will be no other road to get away but that of the gallows in short such a person naming my motherinlaw has discovered it now i would save both your lives which cannot be done without you fly immediately alas sir said burleigh whither should i fly i have no money or friends or i would be gone with all my heart for that said my uncle i will take care go and provide yourself with what necessaries you have and then follow me we were not long before we mounted and pursued our journey toward bristol  as we rid along my uncle asked him how he could be so inhuman to murder a man in cold blood and one very probable almost a stranger to him why indeed replied burleigh i had but little knowledge of him but as to murdering him i cannot give it that name for i fairly fought with him though indeed that cannot be proved because i am only my own witness what do you mean by fighting fairly cried my uncle is taking a mans life without any provocation to be called fair i cannot directly argue the point with you sir returned burleigh but when a person has equal arms to his opposer and the other fairly runs the risk of death i say it cannot be called murder for he always rode with a pair of pistols as i did the same and i gave him fair warning told him either he or i had breathed our last hour it is true he was not very willing to fight but he found it was to no purpose and i must own if he had not i must of necessity have killed him but he fired both his pistols and missed me and i with one of mine shot him through the throat after he fell from his horse i dragged him into the neighboring unfrequented wood tied his horse to a tree in the same wood and rid home with my own the same day i got leave to be absent a few days returned to the wood took the horse i had left there and sold him at chester with a pretense i was bound for ireland so returned home on foot i must own i was too hasty in executing my ladys desire for she never peremptorily bid me but i was willing to get him out of the way that i might have her all to my self i continued my correspondence for three or four years and constantly received an annual pension but when she was about marrying she gave me three years allowance together telling me at the same time that what i then received was the utmost she could do for me and indeed gave me good advice but my money was soon gone therefore i applied myself to her again and almost forced a subsistence from her by threatening to declare what she has now done herself like a silly woman as she is i must own i often threatened a young gentleman who i am assured keeps company with her of declaring something might endanger her life but i can assure you it was only to fright some money out of her  this talk had brought us to the towns end we went directly to my uncles friend and by good fortune found him at home my uncle in private declared to him the cause of this unexpected visit and the bargain was soon struck for the disposal of my friend burleigh my uncle at parting gave him twenty guineas for his own use but with a strict charge to his friend not to trust him out of his sight and in three days after we were informed by letter that the ship set sail on her voyage to new york  now said my uncle i hope we have laid an excellent plan for raising your mothers virtue and i hope the superstructure will answer the basis i am in heart convinced of it i replied and indeed my thoughts were now entirely bent on my lovely isabella and the contemplation of her perfections produced a careful musing which my uncle took notice of why how now william said my uncle what are those wise thoughts that have tied your tongue up i hope all affairs at home are accommodated come let me know the reason of your rumination sir said i my mind was fixed upon the company we left behind us in your neighborhood i hope replied my uncle the fair isabella is not stealing into your heart no sir i returned i have kept her image there from the first moment i saw her face never to be defaced by years or misfortune why how now youth cried my uncle is your heart susceptible of love so soon but i thought as much by your uneasiness to leave em at our last visit but come well make em another tomorrow for i must own i long to be at home too indeed sir said i i freely confess there lies my loadstone and turn which way i will my inclinations look that way  well said my uncle i must own i am not against your embarking on the sea of love if i was sure you could arrive at your desired port without meeting with storms in your voyage have you had any talk with your fair mistress sir said i i will never conceal any thing from you and therefore i shall declare all my proceedings i then told him the whole progress of my amorous affairs well returned my uncle i dont find you have any great reason to despair neither sir said i can i find any thing to beget a hope especially when i think of the implacable aversion rooted in the minds of the mother and the aunt against men and matrimony indeed said my uncle they have both sufficient reasons for that aversion the one from the complicated humors of an illnatured husband and the other from the illusage of a man unworthy the name which to beguile the time i will relate i mean the story of the aunt which i learnt from her own mouth but the last time we were there  when she had scarce seen seventeen she was courted by a person remarkable for his good make and address with the addition of a large fortune which in many people serve only as instrumental to evil actions this man of the world by the common wiles gained the heart of the young lady and by his subtle insinuations prevailed upon her to steal from her relations his pretense for it was his friends aversion to the match for indeed his estate might have commanded as the world goes a more ample dowry with a wife blinded by love and his hypocrisy she complied with his desire and stole away from her father when he had got her person in his custody he endeavored to gain his ends without giving the priest any trouble but the lady though much in love abhorred his base intentions and by her resentment showed the spark had nothing to hope for from that ungenerous way he then got into her good graces again by declaring his attempt was only to try her letting her know at the same time how happy he should be with a woman of such an impregnable virtue in a few days after this trial he married her and in a month after the wedding told her he would have her go home to her friends for he expected his wife out of the country who was of such a violent temper every thing was to be feared from her rage  the poor lady was dumb through astonishment and many times fancied he had a mind to try her temper and gave him to understand as much well madam said the base wretch i am resolved to make the matter as plain as i can to you here john calling to one of his servants this madam said he is the good man that gave us a commission to go to bed together and he is come to take his leave of you being to attend a gentleman of my acquaintance in his travels in the quality of his footman and i believe he is so far from being a churchman that he never was in a church in his life i hope said the fellow your honor will pardon my contradicting you in that for i have been many a day in twenty one after another the poor lady too soon found the truth of her misfortune and her rage and despair vented in the bitterest reproaches had no effeft on the inhumane brute but instead of giving her any comfort finding she made no haste in leaving him left her in sole possession of the lodging he had taken for that purpose where she was forced to part with every thing she had of value to support her in common necessaries of life and if her careful father had not found her out was resolved to part with life to put an end to her shame and misfortunes the old gentleman took her home and to comfort her gave her his word he would forget her unhappiness being well assured of her honest intentions and this is the cause of the aunts aversion to men and matrimony  i shall own sir said i i cannot well blame the resolution she has taken i must declare i wonder how such barbarous notions can enter the minds of men and if there were not instances of it every day i should think such relations fables how is it possible that the nature of men should be so very different every kind of the brute creation are much the same but man sympathizes with every degree of em and are full as various a man had better not be than to be born with such appetites and the dignity of his figure only makes him the greater monster i own replied my uncle your good sense at so early an age gives me the utmost contentment and though philosophy may be learnt without practicing yet i believe i have nothing to fear from your conduct  it was late in the evening before we came home and we were informed by my father that his wifes indisposition increaandd my father seemed so very much concerned that he was not very inquisitive about the journey we had made that day we sympathizd with him however my uncle informed him that we intended to be gone in the morning early and all his entreaties could not prevail upon him to stay longer well then said my father since you will go i would have you take leave of my wife tonight which was agreed to a message was sent to her to know if it was proper to see us and she sent word she should take it kindly when we came into the room my uncle and i sat on each side her bed and neither of us spoke for some moments at last my motherinlaw broke silence well sir said she to my uncle has your journey succeeded and am i to number this days work among the many other obligations i have to your virtue madam replied my uncle every thing has fell out i hope according to your desire for i am fully persuaded burleigh will never come more to interrupt your growing quiet he then related the transactions of the day to her well then said my mother my minds at rest and i hope heaven will pardon me as you have done it is all i have now to do to gain it for i find i am not long to continue in this world for the wounds my virtue though a conqueror has received in the sharp combat with overgrown vice i find will not be healed but by the hand of death therefore when you hear i am no more bury my failings with my body in my grave nor never think of me but as a sincere and humble penitent  the behavior of my motherinlaw brought tears into my eyes which she observed with a tenderness i had never perceived in her before dry thy tears my child said she thy soft disposition overwhelms me with confusion if i survive i beg you will look upon me as thy own mother for my actions shall ever declare me so and if death releases me from this troublesome world remember me as such in every thing but thy grief i could not return any answer my heart was so overburdend with sorrow which she perceiving flung her arms about my neck pressed me to her cheeks and we mingled our tears together we continued in this sorrowful employment till my father came in and interrupted us come said he no more grieving by the grace of god a few days will chase away this indisposition and then well come and make my brother a visit i must own i parted with her in the utmost sorrow for i found my tenderness increase every moment and if the thoughts of seeing my dear isabella had not stole into my memory i should have been inconsolable in this parting but every thing must give way to love we also took leave of my father overnight that ceremony might give us no hindrance in the morning when the veil of obscurity was drawn to let in the cheerful beams of the sun my uncle and i mounted and pursued our journey my uncle to make the way less tedious told me many pleasant stories which gave me so much satisfaction that we got home before i thought we were half way  after dinner my uncle asked me if i had stomach enough to pay a visit to the ladies i told him nothing could be more agreeable to me we were soon ready and soon on horseback when we arrived we found a great many female visitors and isabella presiding over the teatable as usual i observed a blush in her cheeks when she first saw me which i interpreted in my favor at first as loves a flatterer yet she took so little notice of me during the rest of the day that my uneasiness was very great the company staid supper and isabella to complete my discontent took all occasions to avoid me one lady i took particular notice of a woman about thirty she seemed to have a languishing sweetness in her countenance that discovered a temper without any gall she often took notice of my sadness without the heed of isabella or the rest of the company i have heard said she many commendations of this young gentlemans understanding which makes me imagine something extraordinary has put him out of humor this speech i must own put me into some confusion and i thought myself under the necessity of making a reply but my uncle gave me time to recover by answering for me a man said he must have a fine time on it to give proofs of his understanding among so many female tatlers begging this ladys pardon bowing to the stranger but yet i think billy has made his plain by holding his tongue women have not souls capable of edifying by his discourse and i am sure there is nothing learnt by their eternal clacks except it gives us an idea of a perpetual motion we are sure of your good word replied the aunt yet i am as much concerned as you are if the young gentleman has met with any thing to put him out of humor perhaps replied the stranger lady he had rather be in company more suitable to his years i think isabella should entertain him really madam returned isabella i am not of your opinion i have left off playthings for some time therefore i imagine i shall be as dull company for him as he will be for me you are a little too free with the young gentleman returned the mother and in general you are all too hard upon him i have done madam replied isabella i shall say no more and ask pardon if i have offended him their discourse was interrupted by the strange ladys husbands entrance who came to fetch her home when she was gone my uncle asked who she was for to the best of his remembrance he had never seen her before there is something very extraordinary in that ladys fortune said the aunt and if it were not so late isabella should read her story wrote by her husband which she has procured a copy of from the ladys original why then replied my uncle with isabellas leave well trespass upon the time it is moonlight and we shall find our way home without a candle i am ready to satisfy you returned isabella if i once receive my mothers commands my commands are at your service replied the mother upon that isabella went out and returned immediately with a paper in her hand this true story said she is called by the person that wrote it  eleanora or the willing cuckold eleanora was daughter to a wealthy citizen of london but having many children he could not give her a fortune equal to her merit she had all the advantage of education even for one of a higher station and there was nothing wanting but grandeur to make her the finest woman in the world a physician of good practice fell in love with her and declaring his passion to her father gained his consent to address his daughter but like an indulgent parent considering the bargain he was driving was to last for life frankly told him if he could not gain his daughters heart there was no advantage to be expected from his consent for he valued the repose of his children beyond every thing else in this world the doctor approved of his sentiments therefore endeavored to gain the affection of the young lady as he was a man of a tolerable person and handsome address he gained upon her to receive the proposals of marriage without any reluctance  the nuptials were solemnized and in all appearance they bid fair for a very happy couple some years passed with an uninterrupted series of contentment in the summerseason when business would permit he with his family would retire into the country in their rural neighborhood lived a gentleman of a great estate who seeing eleanora by accident in her garden fell desperately in love with her when the gifts of fortune are thrown upon an undeserver they only serve to encourage baseness  this gentleman was resolved to enjoy the virtuous lady on any hazard and his first step was to get acquainted with the husband which was no very difficult point to gain it was easy to feign an indisposition and the physician gains as much by the sound as the diseased imaginary distempers outnumber the real ones the gentleman was liberal in his fees to the doctor and the doctor had understanding enough in his profession to know that he received his money for nothing but that was his curse the curse of avarice  the lovesick gentleman took all occasions to visit the doctor at his own house where he had many opportunities of conversing with the lady and the charms of her understanding were as strong as those of her person but then to freeze his hopes he found her one of an impregnable virtue he had often declared his passion to her and she as often threatened to acquaint her husband but her threats were of no use for he was too powerful and too much in love to fear any thing but her scorn when the lady found no usage would make him forbear his visits or addresses resolved never to appear when ever he came but this only added fuel to the amorous fire and rendered him the more impatient  burning in this unlawful flame he was resolved by force to possess her since every other way failed he found means to corrupt her maid for few servants are proof against gold and being informed by her that the doctor was obliged to attend a nobleman his patient to the bath he determined that very night with the assistance of the treacherous maid to execute his villainous design in eleanoras bedchamber was a closet that opened on the inside with a springlock into which the gentleman was conveyed disguised by the servant who took the key in her pocket when the innocent lady came to go to bed which she did early in the absence of the husband she inquired for the key of her closet to go to her devotion as usual but the maid after hunting a great while told her she could not find it therefore must send for the smith in the morning the gentleman has ofttimes declared since that the fervency of her devotion had almost made him forgo his rash attempt but love proved too powerful for those pious thoughts as she was undressing herself to go to rest her husband returned she expressed a great deal of satisfaction for his sudden and unlookdfor coming back but it is easy to guess what the gentleman in the closet felt at so cruel a disappointment and he sometimes thought that heaven had heard her prayers and prevented his wicked intention the doctor told his wife that he had met his patient upon the road who came to town on purpose to be near him and his own apothecary for his advice after some trivial talk he called for supper but the maid who stood upon thorns desired that he might go and sup in the parlour that she might have an opportunity of conveying the baffled lover out of the house but the doctor proved obstinate and swore he would sup there and no persuasions could alter his resolution therefore supper was brought up and the lover and the maid wished him heartily choked among other discourse the doctor asked his wife why she appeared so strange to the squire meaning our closeted lover you should consider my dear added he he is one of my best patients and in all probability will continue so for he like my lord has no other disease than what is formed by fancy which is a companion certain for life the doctor said so much upon the subject that eleanora at last confessed his unlawful solicitations and she further added the way to be freed from his wicked addresses was never to come into his sight ay but my dear replied the husband if that be his motive of visiting us i shall lose my patient when he perceives the deprivation of your company  eleanora was something surpised at his manner of reasoning imagining he would resent it as a man of honor ought the husband perceiving her confusion at his unexpected answer cried no no my dear i am very well satisfied in your virtue and that no temptation will be strong enough to overcome it therefore i desire whenever the squire comes you would appear as you were wont and only make a jest of his passion i will warrant you nothing that he can say will hurt your features or deaden your complexion therefore prythee let him say what he will as long as i am satisfied you need not have any further regard eleanora was confounded with the sentiments of her husband plainly telling him that avarice had blinded him and the prattling world would soon declare her guilty if the squire continued his visits and if your own honor will not prompt you to put a period to this dangerous correspondence i hope said she my quiet will be of sufficient force with you the doctor still proved obstinate and insisted upon her receiving the squire with favorable looks he being of an obstinate passionate temper she seemed at last consenting to his will hoping time would some way or other put an end to such an affair  the gentleman in the closet though uneasy at his confinement yet received some consolation in the sentiments of the husband and conceived hope even of succeeding in his wishes through the doctors avarice and bad principles all his uneasiness was now how to get away undiscovered his being near the object of his wishes gave him no contentment when his ideas gave her to the arms of a dull insipid husband the closet where he was looked into the garden and being a groundfloor he got out with little difficulty but getting over the gardenwall a mastiffdog belonging to the house seized him by the leg and pulled him down again and having no arms about him but what were prepared for love it was with much difficulty and danger he escaped the mastiffs fury  when he came home he was obliged to send for a surgeon for the dog had bit him in several places and a reasonable person would imagine the smart of his wounds might have cured the pain in his heart but he was more in love than ever the cure of his hurts kept him at home much longer than his impatient soul would permit which retarded his cure the doctor visited him every day and never without a fee and no doubt in his heart he wished when he was cured of this hurt to meet with another such the first time he went abroad though the gentleman had formed a story far from the road of truth yet the doctor told him he did not doubt but he met with the accident in pursuing some love intrigue  one day when they were together in the squires garden pretty well warmed with the juice of the grape he spoke to him after this manner sir i stand in very great need of your advice without prescribing to the apothecary i am sick i own but my disease lies in the mind i have long languishd for a beautiful lady that if i do not enjoy i must seek for my contentment in the grave for there is nothing else in this world can give me ease this charmer is married and i believe strictly virtuous i shall conceal the name till i hear your advice and sentiments on this occasion but by the way before you speak i am willing to give  00 l to complete the business and  0 l every time i have the enjoyment of the lady the doctor did not take a long time to consider the proposal but made him this answer sir were it my own case i should not long demur upon it for i can assure you i should take the money and though it might seem strange in the eyes of the world yet in my own private opinion there is no crime in it what the worse is a woman for being enjoyed by more than her husband especially with his consent for i believe there are but few guiltless without it and commit the sin if it be one without any profit  the gentleman finding the doctor pretty willing in such an affair told him the whole truth and that it was his wife whose eyes had wounded him to deal as freely with you replied the doctor i imagined as much for my wife has been complaining to me of your criminal addresses as she calls em and i find not as i have put it directly to her that there is no hope in gaining her knowingly to consent or perhaps if she were willing i should not be easily brought to treat about the matter but i suppose if it were so i should never have heard of the affair well then said the squire since you are willing to assist me i will give you my word and honor every article i have mentioned to you shall be made good and let us begin as soon as you please hold sir replied the doctor we are now driving a bargain i am well assured you would not apply to me if you could get your business done without me therefore i am resolved you shall come to my terms or you shall never see my wife more  first you shall enter into bonds never to disclose the secret to any person next you must make the  00 l a  000 l for the first time for how do i know but you may repent your bargain after enjoyment for i am convinced expectation exceeds possession of our wishes and for the second time  00 l the third  0 l and the fourth  0 l and so to continue  the gentleman eager as he was to possess the lady was surprised at his proposal but as his passion exceeded his reason soon agreed to the mentioned articles but the difficulty was how to have em drawn with secrecy but the doctor soon solved that by telling him he would draw up the bond himself and the squires servants might sign it without knowing the contents the first  000 l should be brought in specie and so the rest as they should become due the gentleman was too much blinded with love to stop at any thing the next day the bond of secrecy was signed with the penalty of  000 l and the night after that was agreed on for the first time when he should take possession of all he desired in the interim the doctor had many discourses with his wife upon the levity of women and that the crime of adultery was only as people were pleased to form it to themselves the poor innocent lady little imagined the base design that was hatched against her and only begged her husband would cease such discourses that but ill agreed with her sentiments  the better to carry on the contrivance the squire had not made one visit at the doctors since the night he was confined in the closet and the poor lady far from ill nature was not displeased that he had any thing to hinder his troublesome visits when the fatal evening came the doctor took care in conveying the gentleman with his  000 l into the closet unperceived by any and that his wife should not have an occasion for any thing that was there had ordered all her female geers out two days before with this reason that he should want that place entirely to himself for some time  bedtime came and the poor victim was laid in sheets the emblem of her innocence ready for the sacrifice of unlawful love the basespirited husband took an occasion of putting out the candle and dismissed the maid upon the instant the expecting lover took his place and the doctor prudently and decently retired to his closet i cannot give the reader his thoughts of what was doing but it is reasonable to suppose even the possession of his mammon could not quite banish some scurvy ideas the gentleman after revelling several hours in guilty joys retired into the closet as was agreed on dressed himself and went home with the help of his cuckold who to favor his retreat pretended he heard some noise in the house every thing thus succeeded as the wretch desired who notwithstanding his guilt went to bed and slept as found as unpolluted innocence  the next day he made a visit to the squire where he applauded his own wit for his nice conduct in the affair but his chief reason of visiting the lover was to know if he designed another visit that night and was much rejoiced to find the gentleman as eager as he was willing in short the gentleman went much oftener than his fortune would permit and the cuckold wore his antlers all over gold but though the gentlemans love was not dead yet the edge was so far taken off that he began to reason with himself and therefore went not so often as the doctor desired he reproached him with his decay of passion for his wife and the gentleman wanted to be upon better terms in short there had like to have been a breach between em for the doctor would not bate an ace of his first price imagining it would be undervaluing the goods in trade the gentleman told him though he loved his wife as much as ever yet he should be obliged to make less frequent visits or his fortune would be much impaired the husband was much chagrind at it but made himself easy with this reflection that if his love continued as he had no reason to think the contrary his prudence would give way to it the lover imagined if he could disclose the intrigue to the lady she would out of a just resentment continue the correspondence more to his advantage he therefore laid a plot to get the husband out when he was expecting the happy moment in the closet accordingly at the time a servant came with a coach and six to bring the doctor to my lord  his patient formerly who was taken dangerously and suddenly ill he had just time to step into the closet and to inform the lover he should be back in two hours therefore desired him to have patience till that time as he went out he desired his wife not to go to bed till he came back  the gentleman had taken care he should not return so soon as he imagined for he had given directions to his servants to turn him out upon a common fifteen miles from his own house in the middle of a dark night so there we shall leave him to his disappointment and inward vexation and go home to the doctors house again his wife sat up beyond the expected time and would have sat up much longer if the maid to go to bed herself had not persuaded her that my lord might be in very great danger and consequently her master obliged to attend him the wife upon these persuasions went into her bedchamber and dismissed her female attendant but not being quite easy in her mind concerning her brute of a husband sat down to read which the gentleman perceiving imagined she would be less surprised while there was light than if he should make his discovery in the dark therefore opened the door softly and came out of the closet his first appearance had so much affrighted her that she had not power to speak or cry out madam said the gentleman dont be surpised at this unexpected and unseasonable visitation for on my honor i mean you no injury and to open your eyes and prepare you for what i shall say i was conducted hither by your husband he then proceeded and acquainted her with every circumstance of their agreement the grieved lady had not strength enough to hear it out but fell in a swoon upon the bed where she sat the gentleman was truly concerned for this accident and used all the means in his power to bring back her senses again but when her understanding was restored her lamentations sighs and tears were beyond expression moving she seemed resolved to receive no consolation but looked upon him as the hateful executioner of her honor madam said the gentleman if i could have imagined you would have felt this injury so sharply i never would have committed it and i shall ever repent to the last of my life the sorrow i have given to a woman of such impregnable virtue but it is all owing to the baseness of that wretch who is no longer worthy to be called your husband if you can bury the remembrance of what is past be assured for the future i shall be a friend to your virtue and never once attempt any thing injurious to your honor after death replied the lady in tears it is too late for physic i am for ever miserable and to aggravate my sorrows i am even tied up from resenting as i ought this irreparable injury for though the baseness of my husband might cancel every matrimonial tie yet i have a soul that tells me all my resentments will be to grieve in silence till death releases me from all my pain  all the gentlemans endeavors to sooth her sorrows proved vain and he took his leave of her with a solemn resolution never to have any correspondence with the hateful husband more sincerely repenting for his follies past and in the utmost grief it was no farther in his power to redress her injuries  the next day about noon the willing cuckold returned laden with curses for the trick put upon him and though his wife endeavored to conceal her sorrows yet it was impossible for her tears stole from her eyes pursuing one another and sighs heaved in her breast as if every one intended to be her last breath the husband soon found the meaning of em and set himself aukwardly to comfort her and by degrees came to understand the best part of their last nights melancholy conversation but when he learnt the gentleman had resolved to make no more visits in that criminal manner he was almost distracted at the loss of so good a customer as he termed him fell out with the poor innocent eleanora and was outrageous out of all bounds sdeath said he this is your doings pray what the worse are you for what is past have not i gained more by the squire in one month than i have got in three years by my practice but however i have one card more to play yet and since he has resolved to make no more of his visits i will make him pay well for the last he then declared he would have the penalty of the bond which he had broke by disclosing to her their terms of agreement and if he would not pay him willingly the law should force him  the poor wife was quite overwhelmed with this avaricious declaration and entreated her base husband as well as her sorrows would permit that he would desist in such a mean proceeding but to no purpose nay he farther told her she must be his chief evidence in the cause and though she declared she would put an end to her shame by death yet he still persisted and went to the gentleman the next day who at his unreasonable demand gave him no other answer but a sound bastinado and the cuckold was obliged to go home with more pains in his body than ever he felt in his conscience his head being broke and his face bruised he was obliged to stay at home some few days till his hurts were healed but the poor eleanora felt the effects of his illhumour yet notwithstanding this hard treatment she could never once think of hating him but bore all with the utmost patience she knew by his expressions that he had resolved to go to law upon a double score as well for the assault as breach of articles whenever he was able to go abroad therefore she prevailed upon herself to send him the following letter  sir you know i am already injured past redress and it is my greatest unhappiness that i must sue in one who has been the chiefest instrument in my undoing nothing in this world can make me forget my misfortunes yet they will in some part sit lighter on my mind if you will make up the quarrel between mr t  and yourself otherwise you will have a life to answer for having resolved on death if there is any farther proceeding whatever charge you are at you shall be repaid out of my yearly allowance your compliance with this will be the only way to gain forgiveness from heaven and the wretched  eleanora   the gentleman who had now conceived a disinterested friendship for her was resolved to comply with her just request without expecting any return according to her letter thereupon he sent a message to the sordid wretch that he was willing to come to an accommodation and in the end got clear of him for  00 l but the matter could not be finished without witnesses to general releases these having no other concern than to make an end for their friend the squire were not so choice of keeping the secret and as most secrets are whispered about to the enlargement of every thing this story lost nothing by the carriage  at last lady fame trumpeted it about the whole kingdom till the cornuted doctor could not peep abroad for the scoffs of the neighbors and his patients in general abhorring the fact sell from him which struck so to his heart being wounded in the tenderest part interest that in less than a year his wretched soul took its last farewell of his vile body  the poor eleanora who resided with her father when the story began to be public could not avoid grieving out of her sweetness of temper for a wretch that did not deserve her least regard and begged her father to seek out some retirement for her in the country where she might end the rest of her days in peaceful contemplation free from the censure of the world her father had just procured her such a place as she desired when the gentleman that had been the cause of her sorrows put an end to em for being as much in love with her virtue as her beauty made his addresses to her and as that was the only way to save her credit she consented to the match after her year of mourning was over and they have lived ever since a pattern of conjugal affection  when isabella had finished this short true story her manner of reading was approved by every one of the company but myself for i must own i had not recovered spirit enough even to open my mouth for i observed she cast her eyes by turns on all the company but still avoided me  they were sometimes descanting upon the story and every person gave their sentiments but i was in no humor to give mine immediately after we parted and as we rode home billy said my uncle you seemed very melancholy all the while you were at my ladys you hardly took any notice of those about you and your dumb civility when we parted spoke your mind full of some melancholy thoughts which i judge were concerning the young isabella to deal ingenuously uncle i replied the carriage of that amiable creature almost distracts me and i find love strengthens with every mornings sun and though i would give all the world for her esteem yet her behavior to me today raises in me a decent pride which pride will make me show my resentments in refraining my visits  prythee will returned my uncle dont appear more a man in this boyish passion than thou do in the rest of thy actions i intend to part you and your mistress next spring therefore prepare your mind accordingly for you and your tutor shall make the tour of europe for three years and by that time you may even forget the name of isabella nothing sir said i can make me forget her or her usage though her scorn will touch me nearer than any thing can fall upon me in this world after losing your affection prythee have done with this topic then said my uncle the remaining part of this summer i intend you and i shall make a journey over most of the celebrated places in our own country that you may not be as most of our young travelers are inquisitive after the knowledge of foreign climates when you are a stranger to your own sir the sooner you make this journey i replied the better and you could not propose any thing i like so well why then said my uncle tomorrow well be going after dinner i suppose you have nothing material to hinder you should we not acquaint my father and mother with your intention said i no no matter replied my uncle well take no leave of any one but the company we have just now left neither would i do that but as their house will stand in the way of our first days journey the thoughts of seeing isabella so soon gave me some satisfaction though mixed with a great deal of anxiety  the next morning we set out my uncle altering his resolution of dining at home intending to dine at my ladys when we came there we were informed the whole family were gone to dine with the husband of eleanora this news and disappointment of not seeing isabella according to my expectation almost overcame my spirits but i bore it outwardly well enough and my uncle seemed very well pleased with my calmness of temper though alas he little guessed the perturbation of my thoughts my uncle intended the first tour as far as edinburgh and accordingly pursued our journey with one servant only my uncle was such pleasant company that i had not leisure to think of isabella till i went to rest and even the fatigues of the day would hardly prevent my waking all night sometimes i imagined isabella might have some tender thoughts of me especially when i called to mind her former conversation with me and that my sudden absence might possibly create her some uneasiness but then her late behavior to me cancelled those pleasing hopes it is needless to describe the towns we passed but we arrived safe at edinburgh without any accident the once regal town of scotland  edinburgh ag neda or edenburgum was called in the earlier ages castrum alatum it stands on a high eminence and the plan of the city as it lies resembles the skeleton of a human figure the castle was reckoned before the use of cannon impregnable and is now of sufficient strength to withstand a powerful siege the buildings are very strong and large composed of freestone and mortar of a hard cement most of the houses eight stories high but as we have many descriptions of scotland i shall take no farther notice of this city only it is not very convenient to walk the streets by night without a person before you who cries as he passes along hand your haund haud your haund otherwise you may chance to have upon your heads something offensive to the nose as well as your clothes the streets in the morning are covered over with somewhat that every one who walks till ten of the clock may very well expect good luck according to our old english saying before noon so many people walk the streets there is not the least remaining of that illcustomd filth  in many parts of the streets stands a person with a great cloak to cover his customers with another convenience crying wha wants me  after visiting several places in scotland we returned viewing the noted places in england in our way home though i must own curiosity very often took up all my thoughts yet my love was not in the least lessened and the nearer i came to the place of the divine isabellas abode the more was the increase of my anxiety my uncle had not once mentioned that passion through our whole journey till the morning of the day that put an end to our first tour now said my uncle i imagine you have some thoughts of your young mistress i intend to dine there today but shall leave the conduct of that part of your life to yourself and say no more upon that head but when you stand in need of my advice or assistance ask it and you shall have it because i am assured you will not ask any thing contrary to the honor of a gentleman i returned suitable thanks for so kind a condescension and changed the subject because i thought my uncle seemed pleased to have it so  we came to my ladys about twelve of clock and were told they were dressing my uncle notwithstanding his freedom would not interrupt em but went to rest upon a couch in the parlour i not being so much fatigued went into the garden to indulge my thoughts but what was my surprise when i found the lovely isabella sitting by the fountain with a book in her hand on which she seemed very intent her back was toward me so that i came within six paces of her before she saw me at the noise i made in approaching her she turned about and upon seeing me gave a shriek and put the book hastily in her pocket madam said i if i had thought that my presence could have created in your mind any disturbance i would have sooner cut off these limbs that brought me hither than have occasioned it last time i saw you has made me think my sight distasteful to you but if you will inform me that i deserve to be thus punished i have courage enough to put an end to my life if it will be any satisfaction to you  no sir replied isabella i should grieve to be the death of any thing of the brute creation much more any thing that bears a human form and i am so far from thinking there is any bravery in putting an end to life that beside the unrepented crime i think it a poverty of spirit and want of fortitude to bear the ills of life both brutus and cato were in my opinion proud and pusillanimous and parted with life to rid em of their fears i could madam i returned bear all the ills of life but slighted love young gentlemen like you replied isabella talking of love is like fools talking divinity it will leave but little impression on the judicious and i have formerly told you this topic is not proper for you to talk of or me to hear well madam said i if by covering the flame of love i had any hope time would kindle that innocent fire in you that thought would give me ease and whatever climate this body should be in my soul would be with you i doubt not replied isabella but your body and soul were together in your short travels and this new passion love was laid by for curiosity i will not deny i returned but knowledge is what my mind is bent upon but even the acquiring that does but the more indear the thoughts of you and all of your sex that i see does but oblige me to make comparisons though there is none when i think of you  well sir replied the fair one well leave this discourse that i may not provoke any more compliments and desire to know the progress of your sudden journey sudden indeed i replied for my uncle did not take a night to consider on it but if you had felt one particle of the sorrow if we may so divide it that i felt when we were disappointed of seeing you in our first setting out you would have some motion of pity must every thing cried isabella smiling administer to this youthful folly in me i replied it is a whirlpool that swallows every thing that comes near it well no more similies nor no more love returned isabella but the account of your journey well madam said i you must be obeyed i then gave her a description of every thing curious we had observed in our short travels with which she seemed very much pleased i am convinced said isabella that all young gentlemen that travel do not make the same improvement or rather many do not improve at all but bring home greater fools than they carried with em i mean those that go into foreign countries for i take yours to be no more than a journey as we call it but i believe by this time my mother and aunt are dressed therefore it will be very proper for me to wait on em dear madam said i relieve my torments and say you do not despise me i shall say no more at this time replied isabella than that i must wait on my mother therefore come along and hold your tongue upon this i led her by the hand and had not an opportunity of speaking to her in return because there were several workmen in the garden would have heard our discourse as we were hurrying along the wind blew her petticoat upon my spur which stooping to untangle hastily i pricked my fingers with the rowel and they bled very much searching my pocket for a handkerchief to wrap my hand in i remembered that i had left it in my hat in the parlour when we first came in isabella upon that took hers out and gave it me and at the same time let fall a folded paper she drew out with the handkerchief unseen by her i took it up without observation by letting the handkerchief fall upon it and secretly conveyed it into my pocket when i came in to my uncle he was fast asleep upon which i stole out again not seeing the ladies in the parlour as soon as i came to a convenient place in the garden i took out the paper i had found and when i had opened it perceived it was the letter and song i had formerly sent her and by being much worn in the folds i imagined with a pleasing satisfaction she had often perused it for my sake at the bottom of the letter i found these lines of the poet in vain all arts the lovesick virgin tries affects to frown and seems severely wise in hopes to cheat the wary lovers eyes if the dear youth her pity seems to move and pleads with tenderness the cause of love nature asserts her empire in her heart and kindly takes the faithful lovers part by love her self and nature thus betrayed no more she trusts in prides fantastic aid but bids her eyes confess the yielding maid   those lines i remembered very well in the celebrated play of tamerlane but the following verses as i could not charge my memory with i fancied were of her own composition and seemed as an answer to the others too soon alas i have felt the tingling dart and lovetriumphant rides within my heart but spite of pleading love and natures cause that through the world dispenses rigid laws the flame shall be concealed within my breast though the sharp pangs disturb my balmy rest i will learn my eyes those telltales of the mind to look severe though my poor heart is kind my tongue no whisper of my griefs shall tell even love shall teach me to dissemble well   i had the vanity to imagine the last lines very much concerned me which certainly would have made me lose my senses with joy if a doubt had not arose that some other might be meant the thought of that kept the balance even with hope and sometimes seemed to weigh heavier  i was upon the rack of thought when a servant came to acquaint me the ladies were dressed and in the parlour after the ordinary salutations the mother and aunt began to rally my uncle for going his journey without taking leave of em why really replied my uncle i think it the best way to avoid impertinence for i hate your formal parting however you are such eternal gadders there is no finding you at home for we did you the honor to call upon you as we set out and that we may spare ourselves some trouble we shall now take our leaves for one month more for we shall set out upon another tour to morrow why this is doing business indeed replied the aunt you will fatigue the young gentleman too much fatigue returned my uncle sure if i am able to bear it he very well may but my chief reason of this sudden journeying is to show my nephew some of his own country before he begins his foreign travels that he may satisfy the curiosity of any person that wants to be informed when he is abroad pray when do you intend he should begin his foreign travels as you call em said the mother even as soon as he has finished his home ones returned my uncle at this i observed isabellas color to change and rising hastily to hide her concern threw up the sash and looked out of the window unobserved by any one but myself the joy i felt was almost without bounds and i stood in need of the utmost art to conceal it there were several discourses pro and con upon young gentlemens traveling but my mind was so full of the happy ecstasy i had conceived that i took but little notice of either well said my uncle what you women say upon these subjects is but whipped cream all froth and nothing substantial but how must we employ ourselves till dinner for i cannot walk what think you of ombre or quadrille said the aunt with all my heart a game at ombre replied my uncle but that will not employ us all said the mother isabella complained of a pain in her head and therefore was unfit to make one and for my part i declared i did not understand the game so the mother the aunt and my uncle sat to it isabella went up into her chamber and carried with her the object of my adoration when she was gone i went into the garden to feed upon contemplation and in my own imagination thought myself the happiest creature in the universe but my satisfaction did not last long for walking upon a terras that overlooked the country i saw a coach and six stop at the gate there came out of it an elderly gentleman followed by a young one about twenty as i guessed and before i could make any judgment of em two fellows that were at work under the terraswall who did not see me were observing the coach adso said one to the other there is young ladys suitor sir eustace and his father comd again i had not power to stir at this unexpected knowledge and remained a considerable time like one thunderstruck a thousand resolutions crowded into my mind and all to the destroying of my peace my rival was hated with an immortal hatred before i knew him and his or my death was fixed as irrevocable as fate the perturbation of my fancy worked so violently that my strength failed me and i fell almost senseless upon a grassplat where my feeble limbs had unknowingly carried me when the hurry of my confused thoughts was over they gave me absolute despair i was assured an hour before she loved and hope had flattered me that i was the happy he but now i as surely thought my rival was the object of her wishes why then thought i why should i endeavor to destroy one whom she would wish should live that will not be the way to gain her but rather make her loath me death seemed to me the only friend yet through a principle of my faith i could not put an end to life i only wished for death without the thought of separating soul and body  long i lay in my confusion of thought till at last i beheld the divine isabella in the garden looking about as for something she had lost which i imagined to be the paper i took up she was within two paces of me before she saw me she was so intent on what she was about and when her eyes encountered mine she started back as though she had beheld something baneful to her well madam said i must i ever be the object of horror to your eyes and must you always start at the sight of me as if you saw the form of one rise from the grave a little time will take this bugbear from your sight i hope for ever i know i can never deserve your love and yet i cannot bear to see you make another happy for heavens sake cried isabella surprised what is it moves you so why do you lie stretched on the ground and look as if some distraction had seized you come give me your hand and let us walk have a question to ask you which i expect to be truly resolved in have you found any paper of writing since you came into the garden there madam said i and would to heaven i had never seen it giving her the paper there take it i must own i cannot blame you love is not to be forced it is a freeborn child of the mind i only think the young gentleman is completely blessed i am sure i should be distracted with the mighty joy in such return of love  well sir said isabella this freedom i can forgive because i see something extraordinary has ruffled your temper i doubt not but you have read these lines pointing to the letter that were writ on the blank leaf it is the thought of a young gentlewoman a neighbor of mine i liking the lines transcrib d em i was under some concern i own for the loss of the paper because the ballad that you sent me was along with it and i promised her to copy it and send it back this evening  i soon perceived by some confusion in the utterance of these words that what she said was to disguise the truth and that thought stabbed me to the heart though her civility to me seemed tender enough yet i imagined that was only to blind me and prevent any farther enquiry while we both were in great confusion of thought we perceived sir eustace coming down out of the hall into the garden to let you see your suspicions are unjust said isabella for i had informed her what i heard one of the workmen say i will instantly avoid the person we see coming with that she went into a private walk and opening a door that led into another garden took me by the hand and pulled me in after her then shut to the door again i must confess this proceeding began to revive hope that till then seemed quite expired this condescension said i does indeed something ease my heart but yet will not cure my pain that young gentleman no doubt comes here to make his addresses to you and coming thus publicly attended by that elderly gentleman which i suppose to be his father tells me he has the approbation of your mother and aunt  i will not deny replied isabella but that sir eustace pretends to be my lover and my mother and aunt do not discountenance him but they have more tenderness for me than to force my inclination and you more duty i replied than to contradict em no sir returned isabella i am satisfied they never will impose any one upon me for a husband or should they endeavor it though duty is very prevalent with me yet in that one only thing i would dare to disobey  well madam my destiny i find has marked me for unhappy for title and riches must prevail i have told you before replied isabella that fortune i despise and title can no more make a man good and virtuous in my opinion than a good and virtuous man can make a title a king can give honor but not honesty yet like the sun it shines upon weeds that are often admired for their eminent worthlesness your sentiments of honor divine isabella i replied are so just that inspires me to ask you one question and hope an answer what is it returned isabella in some confusion am i to hope said i or despair i would not have made the important question so abruptly but the time of my departure is so short and my unhappiness of not seeing you so often as my impatient heart desires will i am assured from your goodness stand excused whatever your heart can say for or against me why will you press me replied isabella now i have i returned told you my reasons already think ere you answer me for my whole peace of mind depends upon it and if i am banished from your presence now with cold despair i am assured i cannot survive it no love was ever more pure than mine or stronger a distant hope of once possessing you would arm me for all dangers and i could wait patiently an age of torments if in the end i should be blessed with your consenting love do not surmise my passion youthful folly it is rooted in my soul so deep that no storm of fortune can ever shake its foundation if you cannot love freely declare it as you would your vows to heaven i shall only blame my stars not you and take for ever from your sight an object hateful to himself as well as you  hate replied isabella is not in my nature and since you press me to declare myself the person you saw me fly from never shall have my heart and be assured if you remain ever constant i shall no doubt in time be willing to reward that constancy this declaration continued isabella blushing is much more than i so soon intended to let you know and what constructions you put upon it keep it a secret from the whole world let not your uncle whom i know you can hide nothing from be acquainted with the least syllable this from a person of isabellas character was enough to raise me from the dead i said all an impatient loving heart could suggest and was so extravagant in my transporting joy that isabella checked me telling me i should certainly discover something extraordinary had happened to me if i had not a heed to my eyes and tongue before we parted she opened all her soul to me telling me her passion did not seem so violent as mine but more lasting  in short never was a man more happy than i thought myself however prudence obliged us to part though i could have lived for ever in her company she gave me the key to let me through the same way we came in while she went another way first commanding me not to show the least resentment to the young nobleman if we should meet i replied i knew so well the nature of his disease that if he truly loved her he had now a title to my pity we left each other with a promise to meet in the afternoon again in the same place if an opportunity offered  when i had parted with the divine isabella i went up the walk with the utmost contentment in my heart though i endeavored to conceal it in my countenance as much as possible upon the terras i met sir eustace whom i saluted and passed him he returned it indeed but with too much pride as i thought however i passed on and took no farther notice of him when i came into the parlour i found the old gentleman with the two ladies and my uncle playing at quadrille and isabella reading in the window immediately after sir eustace came in and finding isabella expressed abundance of of fulsome joy at the sight of her i must own i was obliged to make use of all my philosophy to keep my temper and should very hardly have done it if isabella had not rallied him with so much wit as in the end gave me a malicious satisfaction i observed all the company seemed as well pleased only the gentleman that came with him but he being something deaf could not understand every thing that was said  when dinner was served in sir eustace placed himself next isabella and was continually helping her to such quantities that would have served her a week i observe sir said isabella you would have me eat for the whole family or if you imagined every body in company had as good a stomach as you suppose me to have by your loading my plate they might rise ready for another dinner however i am obliged to you you mistake the gentleman replied my uncle he is a young cannibal he only fats you as we do chickens in hope of feeding upon you sir eustace took what my uncle said as a very good jest and laughed heartily saying if he should feed upon her she would go very much against his stomach at the end of his ridiculous jest he laughed so immoderately with his mouth full that he sputterd it in my face i would the gentleman said i had taken an opportunity of laughing when his mouth was empty i should have been the more obliged to him harkye young gentleman replied sir eustace you were told before i was a cannibal and i can assure you i often eat youngsters that are too forward really sir said i very calmly i cannot see that prodigious stomach in your countenance or any thing there would make me afraid to meet you any where fasting  the company laughed to see his uneasiness at my reply but he gave me no answer isabella i observed seemed much concerned at what i said and with a look with her eyes told me i should carry the jest no farther well sir said i without jesting i mean no harm if you make any farther constructions on my words but as a jest you go beyond my meaning this mollifying speech seemed to raise his anger more a jest has often cost the maker his life replied sir eustace and such young gentlemen as you should remember the smart of the rod and curb their tongues for fear of a whipping sir said i i presume your voracious cannibals stomach is not quite appeased therefore i will take a walk in the garden for fear you should fall foul on me in an improper place saying this i arose and taking my hat and sword out of the window went into the garden  the whole company arose to stop the baron who offered to follow me my uncle began to be very much disturbed upon my account and as he told me afterward did intend to follow me but thinking to oblige me he desired the mother to send isabella after me when she came up to me she began to reproach me with my conduct telling me if i had any hope or desire to gain her heart i must conceal my passion from all the world and this proceeding will betray the secret if not on your side said she tenderly i fear my concern will those words have force enough to restore me to my senses were i in the grave said i and after this confession that makes me the happiest of mortals even blows shall not make me draw my sword if you desire it no said isabella i know what men of honor should bear and i should despise the wretch for being a coward yet madam i replied cowardice can no more be helped than the tincture of a skin it is rooted in the nature and known cowards like fools should be pitied certainly no man would be a coward if he could help it replied isabella but when i say i should despise a coward i imagine to myself the man that has true courage has every other noble qualification that will make him deserving as on the contrary a coward soul inherits every weak failing and is as incapable of doing a worthy action as the man of spirit is of doing a mean one i shall ever submit my actions to you madam said i then said isabella immediately return and be reconciled to the hot spark within whom the more i know the more i despise and i fansy that declaration will not displease you but i will have no reply now nothing more but this said i you promised me a meeting in the afternoon which i fear will be a difficult thing to bring to pass do you start difficulties replied isabella never fear i warrant well bring it about the same river that runs through your garden runs through the bottom of ours therefore i will propose fishing well go first and the man shall take us two over to an island in the river and return my mother does not care to go into a boat and the rest of the company i suppose out of complainsance will stay with her but i fear madam the young spark will come to interrupt us said i why that is all we have to fear replied isabella but as soon as he comes well return and that i hope will give you some satisfaction do but consider my temper and you will find this is enough to make you easy this i can do without suspicion from any one for none of my family suspects either you or me to be in love there have so many accidents odly concurred today that i will no longer conceal it from you first your sudden departure then this rival and the disagreeable quarrel though your rival is the main motive joined with your foreign tour which i understand by your uncle is for three years but i will say no more now in the afternoon we shall have a better opportunity as soon as i came into the dining room sir eustace met me with a constrained smile and told me he was sorry any uneasiness had been created by words uttered without thought and should for the future be willing to have more acquaintance with me i should have considered indeed there is some difference in our years said he therefore i own myself the criminal and ask pardon for what is past years said my uncle do not always imply age or understanding for some at fifteen have the discretion of thirty and fiftyfive in a good constitution is an abler man than five and thirty i mean continued my uncle smiling some men are younger at sixty than others at thirty that is a compliment replied the aunt we may very reasonably suppose designed for yourself however let us have no more of em well make an end of our dinner and drink a cup of oblivion and then all will be well again meaning tea i suppose replied my uncle where every cup is broaching new scandal and we shall have so much noise and so little understood that it will put me in mind of the confusion of babel  i found the company were not rightly in humor yet i perceived with some satisfaction that i was not the occasion even the old gentleman that came with sir eustace appeared concerned for his behavior after we were risen from table the company divided into parties all but my uncle who went to take his usual afternoons nap the deaf old gentleman singled me out and led me into the garden said he i have the misfortune of having but an ill hearing yet i heard enough to know my son was much in fault youth fortune and title make him too presuming i have with the best advice i am capable of giving him endeavored to soften his too turbulent temper but i fear it is rooted too deeply in his nature ever to be erasd honor should be tacked to nobility yet i find mankind so depraved in their nature that the more power they have the greater propensity they have to do evil which shows to the judicious riches and titles ill placed but as nobility can be no more inherited than virtue so in my opinion he is noble that has noble inclinations i should not talk to one so little advanced in years in this manner as i do to you if i had not been informed by my lady of a ripe understanding in so early an age i expect no reply in the complimental way i only beg you would forgive my son and for the future know me for your friend i should desire your conversation but my infirmity will not admit of it therefore i shall take my leave of you upon this he went from me and left me full of regard for his right way of thinking  while i was musing upon what he said to me isabella came down the walks followed by a servant with fishingtackle come sir said she as she past me you are to teach me how to catch fish for as yet i am but a mere bungler with all my heart madam i replied when the servant had put us over to the island isabella said to him john i desire you would bring over no strangers no no madam john replied if you will be pleased to tell me when i shall wait on you to bring you back i will lock the boat on the other side and be out of the way till then do said isabella and fetch us about an hour hence when john was gone i fell at the fair ones feet and gave her thanks for this surprising condescension what words divine isabella said i shall i use to express my gratitude but there are none that will speak the least part of what my mind feels you have raised me from the bottom of despair to the summit of joy and when my heart forgets this goodness may i be for ever miserable your protestations i believe returned the divine isabella raising me from the earth and i will freely declare if you ever should prove false the knowledge will break my heart i was going once more to fall at her feet but was interrupted in my exalted bliss by a noise we heard at the boat  sir eustace missing us in the garden and being informed by the aunt where we were gone followed us but john had made the boat too fast for him to undo without his assistance but in the bustle he made to unloose it he tumbled into the water and by that time i came to the waterside he was sunk to the bottom all other passions flew immediately from my breast but pity and when i saw the danger he was in i threw myself into the water and by good fortune caught hold of a shoulderknot he wore and brought him to the island without any appearance of life when i had dragged him on shore with the assistance of isabella i held him up by the heels against a tree where he disgorgd the water he had swallowed and fetching two or three groans he came to himself though so faint he could not stand and for want of proper remedies we were in fear he might not survive the accident for we were too far from the house to make em hear us i therefore pulled off my coat and waistcoat and swam across the river to the garden and informed the family of the accident but john was no where to be found the difficulty we had to get the boat loose took up so much time that sir eustace was almost perished with cold ere we could bring him assistance and isabellas fear had almost put her in the same condition it was with much difficulty by pouring cordials into his mouth that we brought him once more to his senses he was put to bed but the fright and the water he drank threw him into a high fever the hurry of my spirits and being so long in my wet clothes gave me a great deal of disorder and having no other clothes to shift me for my uncles servants were gone home with our equipage i was obliged to go to bed too but had the satisfaction of being laid in isabellas bed and what heightened that satisfaction i was stripped of my wet shirt and by the mothers order had one of isabellas shifts put on me the joy took away all thoughts of my disorder but it could not hinder a strong fever seizing me to the utmost concern of all the family the father of the nobleman expressed more concern for me than his son giving me all the encomiums due to the most consummate virtue that maugre the distaste i might have justly conceived against his son i had hazarded my own life to preserve his i must own the action gave me a great deal of satisfaction and the praises though no addition to pride for that is a failing i hope i shall ever be a stranger to yet pleased me because i had done what many of my age would have neglected or refused  the following day my fever abated but sir eustace seemed worse and worse i was grieved i could not have an opportunity of seeing the divine isabella alone during my short illness but i had the happiness of receiving a letter from her which she put into my hand unobserved by any one but the joy i felt in reading the following lines had more force than any of the doctors prescriptions toward my cure  what shall i say to describe the anxiety of my mind for your illness my heart unguarded now from all the niceties of my sex freely declares itself yours but yet let us both be careful i would not have our passions whispered in a desert though perhaps through the knowledge of your virtues it might not meet with many obstacles my mother and aunt i am assured contemn the addresses of your rival even as much as i do however once more i beg you to be cautious conceal our loves even from your good uncle and be assured the two persons under our roof are the entire joy and contempt of ever yours  isabella p s at our next meeting i shall declare more     i wished my indisposition had continued longer that i might have had the satisfaction of being under the same roof with my dear isabella but my health returned and i was obliged to go home to my uncles without conversing in private with her however the contentment of my mind appeared in my face and my uncle several times took notice of it yet i concealed according to her desire even from him the reason of it  when we had been at home a week my uncle told me we should make another tour the next day and i gathered by his discourse that we should not make any more visits to isabellas mother till we came back which would not be in six weeks the heartbreaking i felt almost killed me i did not doubt but i could have gained leave to make a visit alone but i knew i must then have discovered more than isabella would like i cast about several hours how to send her a letter without suspicion but to my mortification could not pitch upon an expedient but while i was perplexing my brain to no purpose i had the unexpected joy of seeing her coach stop at the door and before i could recover myself from the pleasing confusion she entered with her mother and aunt but understanding my uncle was in the garden the mother and aunt went to him and left the divine isabella alone with me in the parlour the sudden surprise had tied my tongue fast and it was some time ere i could speak a word all i could do was to fall at her feet with the utmost transport of joy which was increased by her raising me and putting her lily hand round my neck pressing my head close to her bosom i spoke at last but such wild incoherent speeches that gave her more satisfaction she told me than if i had uttered volumes of regular nonsense vulgarly called love but when i told her of our intended journey the next day her amiable countenance was overclouded with sorrow and ere we could recover ourselves my uncle her mother and aunt came out of the garden but before they entered the room where we were isabella told me she had provided a place where we might send letters to each other without any suspicion she would seek for an opportunity after dinner to inform me and if that should not happen she would contrive to let me know by a line before tomorrow morning  after dinner isabella and i were engaged much against our inclination to make up a set at quadrille and to add to our mortification we were obliged to part without any further opportunity of converse however i was forced to keep up a cheerful countenance that my uncle might not suspect the chagrin i felt the night proved as disagreeable a one to me as the evening and i could not get any rest till it was almost time to rise as i was dressing myself my servant told me there was a boy at the door had brought me a present of a brace of partridges i ordered him to come in when i asked him from whence they came he told me he had a note in his pocket would inform me as soon as i received it i soon knew the dear character to be isabellas when i had dismissed the boy i opened the note and found the contents as follows sir when i left you yesterday i carried discontent home with me which never left me till sleep which was slow in coming to my aid drove it away whenever you have any time hangs heavy on your hands you may write an account of your hometravels and direct em to mrs jane stubbs at  the poor woman has the misfortune of wanting the use of letters and always brings em to me to read therefore whatever comes to her hands will be sure to come to mine i shall say no more my time being short but this i care not how much trouble the good woman gives me so that you may write to her as soon as you please who will bring it to one who is entirely  yours etc     the pleasure this little note gave me was partly taken from me in that i did not detain the boy to send an answer yet upon second thoughts i imagined it would be safer to carry one myself i was soon determined wrote one and went to the house and was there before the boy who i suppose might loiter by the way this woman was a tenant of the divine isabellas and had formerly been her nurse she could not be said to love her mistress but rather doated on her this creature was the picture of honesty and she was so well assured of her young ladys conduct she made no scruple to tell me the letters i would honor her with should faithfully be conveyed to the proper hands why then to begin said i there is one i dont care how soon it was where it should be i dont think it proper till after dinner replied the good woman for though i am ever welcome at my young landladys mothers yet as i have not been come long from thence i think it will not be quite so well to go so soon i agreed with her in that particular and took my leave first making her a handsome present for though those sort of people may continue uncorruptively honest yet it is as well when it is made their interest to be so  the next day my uncle resolved we should make a visit to my father and mother and i was of the opinion it would be highly proper as well as a desire i had to see how the family went on when we arrived there we found every thing according to our wishes there was such a harmony between my father and my mother that my father told my uncle smiling his wifes late illness had mended her temper prodigiously and he would not have her be indisposed in the same manner again for ever so much for if said he she should and be better in proportion she would be too good for him and only fit for heaven we found every thing so much to our liking that we took our leave of em with a great deal of satisfaction and my uncle told me as we were going home that miracles were not ceased for there was an ill woman mended  the next day we set out on our intended progress and met with nothing extraordinary in our course only one thing i thought was odd enough in a small village near the seacoast in sussex as we were at church on a sunday with a full congregation a man came to the churchdoor and cried out a wreck a wreck the congregation immediately unbuckled their devotions and were crouding out as fast as they could though the parson had not gone through half his sermon when the good man found they were going to leave him to finish his sermon by himself he called to em with an audible voice desiring his audience to hear one word before they went upon his earnest entreaty most of em turned about to hear the one word when the parson found they seemed willing to hear him he cried out pray good folks let us start fair and upon that pressed to the door with all the expedition he could and in a few minutes my uncle and i might have robbed the church for there was not a soul to hinder us the oddity of the thing very much surpised us though it often made us merry afterward well will said my uncle when the church was empty we may as well say our prayers at home as stay here by ourselves what sir said i have you no curiosity to see the proceeding of this wild congregation why i cannot say but i have replied my uncle let us get our horses and follow em when we came to the gentlemans where we lay a friend of my uncles we found the house as empty as the church for they were all gone upon the same design and my tutor with our servants along with em as we supposed so we were forced to be our own grooms and followed em we could not well miss our way for we saw people from all quarters running before us when we came within sight of the sea we could perceive several vessels laboring to keep from the shore with all their art and industry for the wind was very high and blew right ashore as the sailors term it but what horror had i in my mind to see in what anxiety the wretches on shore were for fear they should escape and save themselves at last one of em bulgd upon the rocks and split in pieces at which sight the barbarians for i can term em no less gave a shout and threw one another down for eagerness who should be foremost not the least regarding the poor unfortunate wretches plunged in the waves but my uncle and i with my tutor and our servants that were there before us gave em all the assistance we could and with much trouble and some hazard saved five out of eight that were in the vessel though with many a hearty curse for our pains for it seems they could not make the vessel a wreck if there were any of the crew alive however the inhuman brutes fell to securing every thing as fast as ever they could while we carried the poor shipwrecked wretches to the next village to give em some refreshment the vessel was a frenchman laden with wine which they brought to exchange for corn the common custom of all the seacoast contiguous to france which may prove a pernicious custom if the produce of grain should ever fail us in england  we took our leaves that evening of my uncles friend who in my opinion seemed very glad to be rid of us for he was as busy about the wreck as any of the rest a few miles farther a dutch vessel was cast away and all the unhappy sailors drowned our road lying through the same place three days afterward several people had sold part of a new fount of letter of the greek alphabet at a penny per pound as waste metal when perhaps the purchaser had paid fifty times more for it what brutes are these wretches had they been their own countrymen it had been the same what horror must it be to the poor sailors when having weathered many a storm and perhaps escaped from their enemies to come in sight of their native country and perish for want of timely assistance from their countrymen who wish for nothing more than their deaths what can the worst of the savage kind do more nay i have been informed that to make a vessel a wreck they have often murdered the poor sailors that have been struggling for life lifting their hands in vain for succor to those that have proved their murderers we ought not to condemn the heathenish indians that serve the europeans in the same manner who do it from the love of liberty who imagine and not unjustly that the europeans come to enslave em these reflections cast a melancholy upon our whole company for some time after and the diversity of new objects could hardly wipe away the thoughts of the other when my uncle asked a farmer in that neighborhood how he could be so inhuman to feed on the loss of his fellow creatures he answered if it were not now and then for such a lucky hit he should never be able to pay his landlord his rent besides custom had made it natural to him and he could not call that a crime so generally followed by all his neighbors all we could say could not make him think of leaving off so profitable a perquisite as he was pleased to term it which put me in mind of those excellent verses of wallers  bold were the men who on the ocean first spread their new sails when shipwreck was the worst more dangers now from man alone we find than from the rocks the billows or the wind some few days after my good tutor was attacked with a violent fever which we imagined he had got by endeavoring to save the poor shipwrecked people though we were all as much wet with the billows of the sea as he was this accident stopped us at st edmundsbury in suffolk several days and though my uncle spared no cost for his recovery yet the good man expired to the great grief of us all we buried him decently though privately not without wetting his grave with my tears for he was a person that deserved and had a great share in my friendship  after his funeral we set ourselves forward for home and for my own part with a heavy heart and my uncle seemed very much grieved because he ever expressed a great deal of satisfaction in trusting to him the conduct of my youth in my tour of europe yet the imagination of my travels being retarded for some time gave me some pleasure because i should have the happiness of seeing my dear isabella longer when we came home betty informed me my motherinlaw had made her a visit and expressed such a horror at my former treatment that they did nothing but weep all day she made her several presents and seemed very much pleased at her settlement in my uncles family but the idea of my charming isabella took up all my thoughts and fatigued as i was i sent her the following letter as soon as i dismounted  my fairest the thoughts of you took from me all the satisfaction i should have received from the variety of objects that opposed my view every thing i saw put me in mind of you the roses and lilies were remembrancers of your amiable face the down of swans of the whiteness and softness of your skin when i heard the warbling of the nightingale it put me in mind of your voice the dove of your soft disposition and the soaring lark of that complete beauty that surmounts all other womens as that surmounts the soaring of all other birds when i think of your perfections my mind is filled with a thousand inquietudes for such wondrous charms are far above the possession of any mortal what would i give to read the book of fate to see if my happy stars had allotted me the possession of so much beauty but if the eternal volume were disclosed to me and i had the liberty of reading my destiny and should find we were not paired above my woes would be of short duration for death would soon put an end to my hated life what shall i say to express my passion the sun the moon the day and night all put me in mind of you and the griefs i feel at our near separation almost rend my heart asunder the three years i am to be absent from my love to me will far exceed the age of nestor the very imagination disturbs me day and night for every hour is spent in thinking of the divine isabella  when gloomy night oerspreads the earth and all retire to downy rest my sorrows feel a second birth and dismal thoughts disturb my breast yet every thought is still on thee thou image of the queen of love even halting age would fly to see those charms that would a hermit move when i behold the silver light with dusky spots upon her face i know my fair one shines more bright and think the moon usurps thy place what dangers would i face for thee whose pointed eyes have pierced my heart thy captive never would be free but hug with joy the pleasing dart forgive me dear isabella in pretending to poetry but be assured the inspiration comes from you and though the numbers fall short of your allconquering charms receive em as a tribute from my love how many ages more will it be ere i behold thy face i am but a worthless flower that must perish if deprived of thy allchearing beams i hope my hated rival has not renewed his addresses it is the fears of love that make me dread even my isabella should be looked upon by other eyes than mine who wishes the end of life if i should view that day when i shall cease to subscribe myself eternally  yours etc   the next morning i received an answer to mine which gave me more joy than a mariner receives after escaping a dangerous tempest and no hope left for safety  it is in vain to hide my heart from one that has it in his possession use it with the tenderness it deserves for taking shelter in your breast be assured of my constancy for nothing shall ever make me change my love i am almost ashamed to commit my weakness to writing but almighty love will have it so i thank you for your poetry and be it good or bad i have sent you some trash of my own but find no fault with it for you are the apollo that has inspired me however destroy it when you have read it as i would have you destroy all thoughts of jealousy of him you call your rival  if i within the heavens should be instead of cynthias lucid rays i would borrow all my light from thee and rule the nights as thou the days should there a flower be placed for me to nourish as it blooming grew sweet william should that flower be for i would shine on none but you i almost repent of being so open as murderers do when the deed is done and punishment appears in view but it is done and past recall as is the heart of your ever constant  isabella p s i had closed this letter but unsealed it again to let you know that your uncle has just sent a footman to my mother to tell her he intends to dine with us tomorrow but if he comes alone i cannot for my soul say he will be heartily welcome     as we were going the next day to dine at isabellas mothers my uncle received a letter from a distant relation which he gave me to read sir understanding mr meredith my young cousins tutor is dead i take the liberty to recommend a young gentleman to you who i dare prowise will answer every thing you desire from such a person he shall wait on you tomorrow i choose to give you this early notice for fear you should provide yourself he understands the dead languages as well as the modish living mistake me not i mean all the european tongues but low dutch and muscovite which i presume you will have but little occasion for  your affectionate kinsman n l     after i had read the letter my uncle told me it was from a person he could very well confide in and his recommendation was sufficient to him however billy said my uncle you shall see the gentleman for this is your affair if you cannot like him i will not force him upon you no more than i would do a wife well sir said i tomorrow will decide that though i am apt to believe i shall like him as well as you do i am glad to find he is not a man in years for they are generally so illnatured the precepts they teach us favor too much of severity and very often replied my uncle youth borders too much upon levity however i have told you more than once that i shall leave you to your own discretion  when we came to the house we found the company together in the parlour and the cloth laid ready for dinner i am glad youre come said isabellas mother for we are obliged to dine very early because after dinner we are to make a formal visit to a neighbor lady but we shall leave isabella to entertain you you may imagine i felt no little joy when i understood isabella was to be left behind and the freedom of my humor had almost betrayed my contentment for i was rallied both by the mother and aunt nay my uncle could not help having a fling at me why good ladies said my uncle dont be too hard upon my nephew do you imagine a young lad past fifteen cares a fig for womens company looking hard toward forty no no it is very seldom youth and age can agree except youth is very sober indeed or age is not tinctured with its old distemper peevishness with a hatred of all mirth ay but i replied we find nothing of that in this good company there is none here forgets they were once young very true returned the mother your uncle i believe imagines he is as young now as he was thirty years ago pray speak for yourself madam returned my uncle you are as unwilling as i am to be reckoned in the catalogue of old why sure replied the aunt my sister has not quite so many years over her head as your worship no nor so much experience neither returned my uncle dinner coming in ended this dispute and after it was over the mother and aunt went to their several chambers to dress and my uncle went to sleep in the summer house so i was left alone with the divine isabella we said all our young hearts conceived and i thought myself the happiest of mortals but when i touched upon my absence for so long a time she begged we might do something to divert that terrible thought for if she gave herself leave to look into her breast she was assured such a torrent of tears would follow that her sorrow would be taken notice of by the company and perhaps the cause of grief surmisd if not in reality found out therefore said she to divert the thought let us play a party at picquet my uncle madam i replied will not forgo his afternoons nap for any thing therefore we must play by ourselves before we had played out one game the ladies came down and the coach being ready drove away to their visit  when they were gone i could not refrain opening my whole soul to isabella who felt the pangs of parting as sharp as myself and her lovely face was all bedewed with tears we were so long in this tender scene of parting that my uncle had finished his sleep and was coming toward us isabella at the sight of him was obliged to retire to hide her tears and i was forced to have recourse to otways orphan to have a pretense for the gloom that was settled upon my countenance why how now young man said my uncle when he entered what all alone and melancholy yes sir said i i never can read the last act of this play without being sensibly touched with the catastrophe prythee read comedies then said my uncle for i will not have you sad sir said i i cannot find many comedies fit to read for those that are good i have read so often i am as well acquainted with them as the authors or actors in them what is become of the young lady said my uncle have you not rhetoric enough to keep her here so it seems sir said i for she is retired well then said my uncle since we are alone and the time short we shall be together let me give you a little advice before we part for it is not an improbability when we part we may part for ever i find sir said i you intend to increase my melancholy for if i thought that by my consent we would never part never the nearer death for talking of it neither returned my uncle but what i am going to say to you i would have you often think on to strengthen your mind in virtue  when you have changed your climate dont change your nature but always think england your native country and not like some young gentlemen that i know who return with a contempt for their own country with their understandings like a fools coat patched all over and nothing of the ground seen never stay long at a place for even rome with the help of books which describe their antiquities may be seen in three months as well as so many years converse with elder people than your self for their knowledge will increase yours and do not as i know some of our countrymen do because they are brought up in the protestant religion avoid all conversation with the clergy abroad for when i traveled i found among all their holy bodies men of the profoundest learning and judgment who never attempted to make me a proselyte or gave me any uneasiness about my religion i would have you go into all companies but take care of being too particular make no intimates but as many friends as you can the french have too much levity the spaniards too much moroseness the italians too much jealousy and addicted to overmuch pleasure without mirth the germans though learned love the juice of the grape too well and the dutch are all men of business though there is no general rule without an exception always live soberly for as you will be frequently changing place a spare diet will best agree with your constitution and will learn you never to be disappointed if heaven should afflict you with sickness take my method send for the most eminent of the profession tell him your stay in that place is but short and agree with him for such a sum when you are thoroughly cured this management will make it his interest to set you upon your legs as fast as he can you must hire a native servant at every place you intend to make any stay at give him good wages but trust him not let him know as little of your affairs as possible and keep him ignorant of your next station and the time you intend to set forth for some of em i have proved are confederates with robbers and are as inquisitive after foreigners as some foreigners are after new fashions the variety of dress i mean fashions is what i abhor yet you must put yourself in the garb of every place you make any stay at it will not only prevent your being gazed at but will ingratiate you with the natives when you take their habit upon you hear much and speak little be not too intimate with the feminine gender for an intimacy there too often creates discontent and trouble be very cautious in making acquaintance with your own countrymen for most of em nowadays enter into society to enter into all the fashionable vices of the places they go through be like the industrious be suck honey from every flower and contemn the gaudy weeds that bloom and flourish to no use avoid all quarrels but if you should unhappily fall into one behave your self with courage and resolution and if you should succeed dont let your sword hang the looser in its scabbard a man of true spirit will be as cautious how he draws his sword as he would be of treading in the dark over heaps of ruins be cauious of every one you deal with for in many places they make it a common practice to overreach foreigners and the fairer their looks often the fouler their hearts whenever you come to have your equipage examined by officers of the customs make a handsome present beforehand which will either prevent their giving you any trouble or at least will prevent their tumbling your things which often proves of more damage than the present you make em comes to when you go by sea as you must to arrive at several places of italy bargain with the master of the vessel before you imbark but pay him not before you arrive at the end of your voyage nor then till all your things are brought to your lodgings to answer your bill of parcels and be sure you have two drawn at the same time one for the master and the other for yourself when you are to imbark if you can get a recommendation from the last place you leave or if you cannot enquire out some englishman for there is no fear of finding em at all the noted places and beg he would recommend you to some native of the place where you may reside for i have often made it my observation to have more respect shown me when i took up my quarters at one of the natives than when i did at one of my own countrymens though it is possible i may get you several recommendatory letters one i am sure of from the worthy person that we received a letter from this morning concerning your new tutor he was envoy at florence two years and has a good acquaintance in several courts of europe now said my uncle giving me a paper here is written the heads of what i have been speaking which i would have you read over once a week and i desire i may hear from you all opportunities with a succinct account of every thing worth notice you see abroad it will serve to kill some part of your time that may hang heavy on your hands besides it will be acceptable to me  we had several other discourses on the same subject but we were interrupted by the arrival of the mother and aunt they got into a chat no way agreeable to me of their visit which gave me an opportunity of looking after my dear isabella who i had observed some time before to go into the garden i found her in a by summer house bathing her lovely cheeks in tears when she saw me she strove to dry her eyes but freely confessed the thoughts of parting had raised that sorrow in her she told me various objects and climates might alter my young heart and wipe her out from thence it was with much persuasion i could settle her mind to talk of any thing else and though it gave me unconceivable transports to see the strength of her love yet it was necessary we should have some time to settle our future correspondence by letter when that was finished i took my solemn leave of her not without shedding tears at our tender separation but poor isabellas grief quite overcame her she fainted in my arms the tender proof of her heart however gave me some uneasiness left we should be discovered for it was some time before she came to herself when we had composed ourselves as well as we could we were troubled to find a means or pretense for isabellas tears for there was no concealing her grief from the company within at last she told me she would make em believe a be had stung her hand  we went with some confusion into the parlour where they were sitting isabella was soon discovered to have been weeping when she was asked the cause she told em as she went to pluck a rose a be concealed had stung her i thought you had more philosophy replied my uncle young lady than to shed tears for pain truly sir said she i shall never be so much a stoic to think pain is all fancy for i am sure i feel it still well replied my uncle you find young lady the sweetest thing sometimes conceals a sting however your pain will not hold you long there is a balm to cure it honey and a little time will soon ease you i warrant you a while after my uncle ordered me to take my last leave of the good company which i did with ten thousand pangs but as i pressed my lips to those of my dear isabellas i found em tremble so much that i feared a discovery yet she bore it outwardly very well but did not come out to see us to the coach though no one took notice of it but myself twas well the dusk of evening was approaching for the concern in my countenance was not to be concealed however i composed myself as well as i could before we came home  the next morning the gentleman that was to be my tutor arrived and i must confess i took an affection to him at first sight his countenance pleased me as well as his behavior and my uncle seemed as well pleased as myself he was not above five and twenty and though young enough for a tutor yet we found him old in experience and understanding and answered fully the character the letter gave my uncle of him my uncle was so well assured of his abilities that he resolved we should begin our journey in two days in the mean time i wrote several letters to my dear isabella and received answers so tender and passionate that my heart felt all the joy it could desire but that joy was lost in the dismal thoughts of being separated from all my soul held dear so long  at length the day came we were to set out my dear uncle would accompany me to dover where we arrived but the weather proving a little boisterous he would not let me imbark before it was settled though the vessels set sail as not regarding it however as it was his tenderness and goodnature i complied with his desire though there was no apparent danger  the sight of the cliffs of dover put me in mind of those lines in king lear of our inimitable shakespeare  how fearful and dizzy it is to cast ones eyes below the crows and choughs that wing the midway air show scarce so big as beetles half way down hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade the fishermen that walk upon the beech appear like mice and you tall anchoring bark seems lessened to her boat her boat a buoy almost too small for sight the murmuring surge that on the unnumberd idle pebbles bats cannot be heard so high i will look no more lest my brain turn and the disorder makes me fall headlong down   the next day the weather proved so calm that the sea looked like polished glass or as the sailors say so smooth you might throw dice upon it therefore my uncle after mingling our tears gave me leave to embark with my tutor and one servant and we left the british shore behind  end of the first
