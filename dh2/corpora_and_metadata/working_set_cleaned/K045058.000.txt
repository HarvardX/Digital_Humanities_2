the most inoffensive and agreeable may justly raise admiration and esteem in others as they distinguish you in so eminent a manner and constitute your personal happiness  but as it is that easy graceful manner in which you enjoy them that freedom from vanity affectation or pride which form your real character so the use you make of your fortune interest and good sense renders them a general blessing to all who have the happiness of being within the reach of their influence  madam  your generosity and condescension in permitting this address is an instance of both so much to my advantage that i find it impossible to suppress either my pride or gratitude on this occasion especially when i consider that it is an honor that many before have solicited in vain  that the conversation and friendship of a lady of your accomplishments should be highly esteemed by persons of the first rank both for dignity and virtue not to mention the noble lord to whom you are so happily allied is no more a wonder than that there should be among the nobility those who are as eminent for their good sense and fine taste as their high stations  that you may still continue the ornament of your own sex and the admiration of ours must be the sincere wish of all who are any ways acquainted with your merit but of none more than of  madam your grateful and obliged humble servant  november  0    0 on

 this happy marriage will restore my longlost peace of mind  after marriage should he prove false or unkind  what means are left  what power on earth can do her justice then  now my pains return thus joy and anguish alternately possess my breast as hope or fear prevails   air i since all the worlds in strife  the man by foes surrounded whilst with himself at peace dauntless and unconfounded beholds their rage increase but oh the torturing pain that racks his heart and brain who hourly with himself at war the foe does in his bosom bear  shall this tempest in my breast ever cease and i have rest ever cease and i have rest    scene ii welford and jonathan jonathan sir john tarries long   jon that is not to be wondered at when he is in such good company i know my master never thinks himself so happy as when he is with your fair daughter   welf jonathan i have observed of all sir johns servants that you who indeed seem best to deserve it have the greatest share in his confidence and favor now you are not ignorant of my friendship for your master nor of his pretensions of love to my silvia both which must interest me nearly in every thing that relates to him i have lately heard some reflections on his conduct that much alarm me you if you will can satisfy my doubts without prejudice to your own fidelity or your masters honor   jon ay dear sir i know that any discoveries which i might make to you would be as safe as in my own bosom and all the use you would make of em would be to improve em if possible to my masters advantage and not at all to my prejudice what a wicked censorious world do we live in my master is certainly the most virtuous sober modest gentleman in the country and to say truth we are a mighty regular family for my part i am daily edified by his good example   welf this fellow mocks me aside the business of my farm and the care of my flocks call me hence farewell my best respects and service to sir john   scene iii jonathan ha

etc exit singing   scene iv another room in welford s house sir john freeman and silvia sil urge me no farther  i have said too much how have you drawn from me the fond confession   sir john merely to say you would obey your father is that too much to pay whole years spent in adoration of your charms   sil what can you ask or what can i say more   sir john can ardent love be satisfied with duty you might have said as much to any other man who should have gained your fathers approbation you have not yet my charming fair confessed you love   sil why will you press me to pass the bounds of modesty and prudence you know my father does not force my will   sir john why then this needless caution and reserve your cruel coldness chills me to the heart you never felt loves animating fire some other motive in which love has no part must influence you to admit of my addresses   sil your suspicions are as groundless as unkind there may be men false designing cruel and unjust who court and flatter only to deceive would it be therefore just to charge the crimes of some on all and for your constant love truth and sincerity return you doubts suspicions and unjust reproaches there may be women too who for wealth or power would give their hands where they refuse their hearts if you think me such a one for my sake and your own desist at once for love that is not founded on esteem can never yield true satisfaction or continue long   sir john pardon my dearest silvia a fault caused only by excess of love  thou art so great a blessing twere presumption to be too secure long we suspect and hardly are convinced that the treasure on which our happiness depends shall ever be attained but now my fears are hushed and all my doubts are fled   air iii blithe jockey young and gay  sweet are the joys of love when doubts and fears are past  sil virtue does love improve truth makes it ever last  sir john all virtues in thee shine  sil whatever i am is thine  both hearts thus united prove earth has no joy like love    sir john when loves sincere and constant how does it bless and how improve mankind yet ambitious statesmen and foolish meddling priests would bind in fetters the noble freeborn passion vain attempt  marriage never yet kindled a mutual flame where it was not but often has extinguished it where it was love is its self its own security and needs no other bonds   sil this idle talk this commonplace raillery on marriage i think at any time is best omitted but sure sir john it is most improper now you cannot expect that a maid who is not weary of her condition will take upon her the defense of a cause in which she is not concerned yet to pleasure you who i presume delight to hear me talk though i thereby discover my own simplicity this i will say the world owes its order kingdoms their peaceful regular succession and private families their domestic happiness to marriage   sir john the prejudice of education only makes you reason thus i must instruct you better   sil sir john i understand you not    sir john you shall join with me by our example to convince the world that love can subsist without the marriage tie   sil sir john freeman i have known you long bred up under one roof from infancy together i dont remember when i knew you not the innocent friendship contracted in our childhood in you improved to love or you have been a thousand times forsworn if i have been deceived when may a virgin safely believe a man i would not wrong your honor by unjust suspicions  but if you have abused me    sir john if i love thee not or if i ever cease to love thee may i become the most wretched and most accursed of men  may i    sil imprecate no more wave this discourse and i am satisfied   sir john it is time my silvia to complete our joys takes her by the hand you must now quit your fathers humble roof and shine with me my wealth great as it is shall be exhausted to support thy pleasures love only love shall be the priest to join us enjoyment shall be our marriage she struggles each day i shall a happy bridegroom be and you a bride mahomets paradise shall be verified in us and all our long lives shall be but one continued transport   sil let go my hand   sir john and lest you should think i mean to deceive and to forsake you no proud heiress that brings a province for her portion shall be joynturd as you shall be half my estate shall be settled on thee   sil with brutal force to compel me to hear thy hated proposals is such insolence  thy breath is blasting and thy touch infectious oh that my strength was equal to my indignation i would give my hand a ransom for my body  breaks from him sir john stay my charming angry fair and hear me speak   sil would i had never heard you oh that twere possible to fly where i might never hear the voice of mankind more  what set a price on my immortal soul and spotless fame know thou ungenerous man i never was influenced by thy wealth to hearken to thy vows for notwithstanding my humble birth and fortune i ever scorned riches when compared to love as now i do love and thee compared to virtue she who capitulates on terms like these confesses an equivalent may be had for innocence and fame and there by forfeits both   air iv tweed side  by our weakness we help the deceit if our virtue we balance with gold when dishonours proposed if we treat we are to ruin and infamy sold the bird that

comply without it whatever is the meaning of it i find my self more ashamed than angry at the disappointment though it is certain that i never did nor ever can love any other woman half so well i feel a strange palpitation here sighing i am not sure that i dont like her the better for refusing me  i am sure of nothing  but that i will not marry  i must even have recourse to the general remedy in these cases a less scrupulous female for though that will not remove the cause yet it is an admirable opiate and relieves the symptoms to a miracle   air v charming is your face  wounded by the scornful fair since she dooms me to despair let me fly to seek for rest on some softer gentler breast whose free soul no forms enslave but kindly heals the wounds she gave    scene viii a country

this of being buried in her clothes if it were once a fashion a sexton might get as much as an overseer of the poor every man is for making the most of his place but then there is no comparison between starving the living and robbing the dead for what should dead folks do with clothes  but the truth of it is in these healthy countries the poor live so shamefully long that parishofficers get little now beside good eating and drinking  but i have heard that formerly such as were past their labor used to be provided for at the expense of the sheriff  for then if persons were likely to become chargeable to the parish the whole neighborhood would swear that they were witches or wizards and so they were decently hanged up to save charges  but in london and other your great towns an industrious man of my business may make a good penny of it still  for there they steal bodies and all but here we are forced to let them rot in their graves because we cannot tell what else to do with them   air vi there was a jovial beggarman  strange tales some lying travelers tell how men on men have fed of public shambles where they sell for food their friends when dead the moral of the fable

their wives company while they are alive   tim my resolution may seem stranger than it is i will therefore tell you the reason of it some time ago my wife was very sick that cursed geneva often made her so then i fell sick with grief but she soon recovering i recovered too on this occasion she told me if i died first that she should break her heart yet she is dead and i hardhearted and ungrateful wretch am here alive to speak it   g busy poor heart he weeps like any rainy day but good timothy go on with your tale   tim let me but dry my eyes and then i will she said that she had heard of people that had been buried alive and being troubled with fits thought perhaps that might be her case   g cost ay ay we all know what sort of fits she was troubled withal  but mum for that aside   tim and desired me if i outlived her to let her be buried in her best clothes and to watch the grave the first night all alone nor to let the body be covered till the morning i promised to grant her

and knows what is fit as well as any woman in the parish   g busy i say it is dangerous playing with edged tools  and we ought to do as we would be done by  and it is ill meddling between a man and his wife  and every honest man is as good as his word  and the will of the dead ought to be performed  therefore let us leave him to keep his promise to his wife   g cost ah dear heart there are not

i hoped had been only the warmth of youth to be principles with you you are justly accountable for their consequences   sir john notwithstanding your present circumstances i look upon you as a gentleman in your youth as a soldier of fortune you had opportunities of knowing the world beyond most men which joined to your good sense and just observation qualifies you to give advice the best of any man i know and i appeal to your own experience whether marriage be not a state of life attended with innumerable cares disappointments and inquietudes   well it is true i have found it so and you by your living so many years in my house in your youth was frequently an eyewitness witness of this sad truth and i farther confess that my secret troubles which were the greater for being so far exceeded all that ever were visible but those are not essential to a married state but might have been prevented by a more prudent choice but as it was one darling child not only made them easy but

start and frown and bite your lips if you please  i repeat it again your villainous attempt   sir john considering who i am and what you are supposing i had been to blame twoud have become you to have clothed your complaints in softer language   well no words are strong enough to express your baseness and my wrongs   sir john had the worst you seem to apprehend been accomplished    well confound thy profane tongue for such a supposition   sir john your insolence and outrage would tire the patience of an angel is not your daughter virtuous and chaste as ever   well the excellency of her virtue whom you would have ruined but aggravates thy guilt   sir john the mighty ruin you talk of was but to have devoted my life and fortune to her pleasure which sure was sufficient to have kept her from contempt and her beauty would still have been as much admired as ever   well after the loss of virtue beauty and fortune like a fair and sumptuous monument erected upon a bad mans grave serve only to perpetuate infamy and make it more extensive   sir john what is it that you would wish your daughter   well i wish her innocence peace fortune with fame on earth and everlasting happiness hereafter but you would make them all impossible to her   sir john she may still be happy   well and shall in spite of thee fond fool that i was i thought to have made you the happy instrument to have advanced

was sir johns  our daughter who died was buried as his and his this lady was reputed and educated as our own  the fraud was never so much as suspected by sir john nor any other person my self excepted  i indeed by observations which none else had opportunity to make soon found it out and charged my wife with it she confessed it and to my shame prevailed upon me to conceal what i could never approve

peace but what have been my tortures ever since i consented to conceal the guilty secret  stung hourly with remorse i attempted to do her justice and conceal my shame by effecting a marriage between her and my son but heaven that refused the imperfect satisfaction and condemned the fraud has you see made vain the fond attempt nor would suffer her to receive that as anothers gift which is her own
