royalty itself was mute sleep in his pleasing bands had all things tied all but the eyes of disappointed pride she lay revolving in her anxious mind how resignation had too much resigned that places were dispensed as others willed made vacant some and vacancies were filled new statesmen at the helm usurped her trade and glibly sailed the ship without her aid seeking repose from side to side she flings no change of posture pause of anguish brings each grinding thought alleviation scorns and sharpens all the goosedown into thorns forth from the loathed bed in haste she flew and round her wearied limbs her vestments threw enwrought with gold in lelac purple died the velvet cased her endless length of side two calveless bags of silk then stretched to see if they could reach from heel to distant knee next splayfoot shoes she to her insteps girt shoes which disdained yet still were doomed to dirt her thigh sustained a sword unknown to war and beamed upon her breast a silver star whose rays with magic influence could warm almost to consequence the languid form accoutred thus forth of her doors she went and her dark visit was to faction bent resolved like heavnrejected saul to try what counsel the other party might supply onward she strides impatient of delay floundring through every kennel in her way save that at charing cross she slackd her tread and thought she saw poor charles without his head rehastning on through the long strand she came then passed the temple and adored its name now reached st pauls and blessed the lord that there though he was praised twas with

so great a crime in monarchs it is to choose a hundred other equal deeds appear nay half the english history was here while over all the rest conspicuous shines old sarahs legacy in golden lines

success has crowned our arms bute quits nor shaken with our fierce alarms for who our roar and riot would regard that in his conscience seeks for his reward but that the honest fool had fixed before to make his favorite peace and throw up power when he like phineas in the gap had stood to save the people and had staunchd their blood he knew how incompatible must prove to serve them yet retain their fickle love while we played safe dupe of benevolence he stopped the plague and at his own expense for public quiet yielding up that rein we quitted only to resume again but what are we the

cannot soar where to full pitch of sturdy vigor grown it fairly gives the lie home to the t  e nothing remains which farther we can drive or fortyeight comes next to fortyfive then shall we idly sit handcuffd and dumb and let truth work and purge away the scum we have fermented let the dross deject till its clear bosom shall all heaven reflect forbid it fate forbid it every boast we have made to ruin or to rule the roast we must and will have all but how to seize to spill the cider or cut down the trees more suits at law commence more papers write to give more dinners and more guests invite

tyranny to stain to swallow any contradiction down in antonines mild look fear neros frown wrest his intention and distort each fact and lend them treason till they long to act  the prince against his counselors to move and while we only seem to beg reprove in terms of duty wrap each boisterous deed kneel while we stab and libel while we plead faction has power nay has already done and yet but little of our course we have run much still remains and we must tug and strive ere the great days of anarchy revive a watchful eye is over all our game and while it seems to wink but takes its aim oh had but fate to halifax decreed his seat of birth on the other side the tweed had some bleak shire of penury the reign more starved than famines prophecy can feign but given him title in the general ban we with the country had overwhelmed the man there like enceladus he would lain oppressed with half an island bearing on his breast but now upon so high a basis placed we are forced to leave his merit undefacd out of our reach and mocking of our aim the perfect statue rests without a maim but could we hope his virtues to decry and show them blighted to the peoples eye would not ierne all their bloom renew and call the blushing honors fresh in view recount how lenity to prudence joined shone the reflection of his senders mind how formed to win by every honest art blessed by each voice

every part whole flocks arose of rooks and ravens chronicles and crows fanned by innumerable pens the sky of printers ink assumed the sable dye now prone from his meridian when the sun had more than half his evening journey run and follys board loaded almost to break had well nigh cooled her savry steam to speak thrice pride essayed but from her elbow chair as often ambition nodded to forbear she stopped so wont to obey and now each guest perceived that nature wanted to digest just then a hundred servants crowd the space who never saw wages but in shape of place and up they pile the vast desert in air the plate of gold by rule of court was there where robinson had played his master part and in one job exhausted all the art high in the midst of the whole fabric raised a barleysugar

great and amiable the guest given to whose name the outward form appeared but the sly honors at another leerd the immense pile stood complete the whole to shape quite round the ruddy apple mourned in crape all praised the hand and the design admired warmed as they gazed but when they tasted fired now loyalty begins the sacred health on which sedition only creeps by stealth the toasts still as they wander from their source show more evanid its diluted force as when allgraceful marlborough your dress tell us that ranelagh you mean to bless while down your perfect form in rainbow rows the lutestring stripe with gay confusion flows the point insensible the difference seen where purple steals to yellow or to green we find deluded through the varying silks that what commenced with g

and fell revenge lurk to be quaffd in the foul bottom of the dangerous draught at follys board no mischief stalked behind for people out of place are of one mind jointly they hunt but difference and debate come when they share the bearsskin of the state and now in general discourse they join so tipsy with the healths not with the wine that custom reason fact are changed and choppd to all that modern patriots adopt all spoke and all advised a thousand things to buoy up citizens and weigh down kings and some direct the matter how to mince and mean by evil counselors the prince how turn militia to a counterguard and while disbanded valor they reward humanity can never be a crime they keep it ready till a proper time some mourn the injuries they groan beneath who owe to courts the very air they breathe who one small boon denied those courts resist and but for that that only are dismissed as to past favors  staunch stateatheists say duty the soul dies with its body pay some tell the ready way on mobs to impose whose sight extends no farther than their nose to whom conviction never found its way they still believe the p  y of the day others advance how squabbles make us great and cutting throats adds sinews to a state what profits burgeon from domestic jars and all the blessings showrd on civil wars the song was partial yet it took the ear of all who sought their thousand pounds a year when folly to give order to debate stood up a mighty driveller of state ridiculously grand her cap and bells important insignificance conceals a petticoated nestor she appears bending beneath unvenerable years a shrivelled evidence how very small a share of reason goes to rule this ball two reigns she would blunderd through still uppermost quitted the third nor gave the fourth for lost with manna still her tongue run over replete thick clammy mawkish purgatively sweet and fell her words like hail in summer day as hard as cold as apt to melt away the linguafranca sediment of

and kneel before the word inadequate or was my judgment formerly inclined to think addresses spoke the peoples mind instructed now i see their full import against they do but never for a court and yet it hurts me that it is addressed but when by cambridge more than all the rest  the oerwhelming thought she could no longer bear but sputtring still to speak sunk to her chair end of canto iii patriotism a mockheroic canto iv in studied dignity of action slow bespeaking favor with a winning bow ambition next arose her powerful lore credulity preventive stepped before for eloquence the cheat had brought her up to all the slighthand of the ball and cup taught her to twist and turn and show and hide and make the worse appear the better side showed her to clash how contradictions ceased while fact and reason took what shape she pleased as the bright stream which nature loves to pour irriguous through the vale had nursed each flower had charmed the ear and eye through opening glades with untaught murmurs from unforced cascades but when compressed through pipes as whim prevails squirts into fans and suns and peacocks tails the glittering baubles who with wonder spies receives the spout at last in his own eyes and thus she said o thou who do preside over britains isle and all her measures guide whose doctrine heavens own precept far outgoes bids us love better than ourselves our foes o janusparty now incline to hear thy double face and thy quadruple ear and ye now present to my nod devote lords and lords betters aldermen take note that folly to my bosom here i bend her my contempt till now but now my friend linked in the common cause she shall remain my firm confedrate till i rule again twere needless here to tell what yet you see draws its concealed dim origin from me  the rage of faction when each nerve it moves he who does not disclaim be sure approves behold the cloud i said would threat the land that cloud shall rise in likeness of this hand pour all its storms directed as i please and wash away the hateful works of peace works which myself i dared not bring about i knew them right but knew they would throw me out another ventured foolish or secure in his own soul and above lust of power sealed the great deed to which his wish aspired and unrewarded but by that retired and could he think of peace the foe professed title and pension had inclined to rest that on ambitions eye repose would creep lulled by those medicated sops to sleep she who twined unanimity and showed the wondering world how firm britannia stood can the reverted wheel as quick incite till all the splitting fibers disunite she who fell partys tortuous folds could break and set her foot upon that dragons neck the deadly teeth which from those jaws she drew can plant and they can pullulate anew those grains of discord given to fertile land sprout rank and faithful to the sowers hand yes in ripe harvest see them nod again a threatening crop of discontented men which way to wave they from my breath expect blame as i point and hate as i direct it grieves me folly nay it gives me fears  this foul defection of your black hussars whose wavering duty truant from its string transfers itself from c  r to k  g now by the laurels of belleisle my boast and the unnumberd millions which they cost should ever my b  h for addressing move and honest a  n dare the peace approve in such contempt the rebels i should hold i would toss them back their dirty box of gold but ere the infection spreads haste we to use the sprit we have been so happy to infuse the english oakboy as you bid him cries and to roar louder firmly shuts his eyes he is yours at pleasure closed while they remain all is over if he opens them again employ him while all enemies overcome he longs for new ones in his friends at home the proper catchwords party shall provide to range the fools on either foolish side no previous injury need rouse their force match but the broughtons and they hate of course oh if we seize with skill the coming hour and reinvest us with the robe of power rule while we live let future days transmute to every merit all we have charged on bute let late posterity receive his name and swell its sails with every breath of fame downward as far as time shall roll his tide with every pennant flying let it glide and truth emerging from the clouds we raise gild all their orient colors with her blaze let his loved arts attendant on his way their wanton trophies to the gale display while each dispassionate each honest pen deterred by clamor nor allured by gain bard or historian shall from either shore hail its approach and its great course explore faithful to probity and virtues cause pursue its progress and direct the applause glad gratulation shall with shouts approve and own him worthy of his sovreigns love she had proceeded but the mingled sound of arguing voices spread the table round some affirmed positive some asked perplexed and some launched out in notes upon the text till one more audible than all the rest with strong exertion thus himself expressed why sit we here projecting some new blow since fate determins all events below on that tribunal let our envoy wait and who so fit as folly upon fate the advice was grateful to the general ear all begged that great commission she would bear which bowing low she said should be achieved though trembling at the honor she received the point thus settled from the board they move dispersed as pleasure led or business drove but folly sought her library with speed for one she had for show but not to read there jumbling in her head what she thought thought how best to find the trackless road she sought she chose to essay the force of her own prate remembering to how many once twas fate and now the mystic gibberish she tried something that neither promised nor denied but drew one on to hope it wished so well  and though it doubted yet  it could not tell  o my dear whatsyourname of me be sure i would a member had not asked before  you will let me see you soon by then i will try  then seemed to squeeze a hand and said goodby strange force of charms by this the solid ground grew mortal sick with the unmeaning sound in strong convulsions rocked at length it cleft and a wide opening toward the center left to regions unexplord which dark and great are the domain of mysteryofstate pondring a while she stood and wished to know the calaispassage to these realms below till curiosity her fears expunged and she intrepid on her errand plunged now as she journeyd faded on her sight the feeble glimmerings of distant light faint and more faint the intercepted ray withdrew itself and died upon her way and now through darkness palpable abhorred her groping hands the doubtful path explored till nigh the confines where the lower sphere joins to our world but yet is never the near thin streaks of budding day salute her eye with the first dawnings of the nether sky for other suns they have and stars than we by which no mortal but themselves can see now the receding gloom her sight renewed and clothed with form each brightning object stood the opening scene with wonder she surveys not knowing that she traveled her own ways here for the upper surface she discerned how flattery lay to bubling lather churnd whose bottom formed a thicker sediment of coarse and clumsy clergy compliment this happy compost with its supple oil invigorates and opes the fertile soil calls forth each seed of dirt to bud and flower and trick itself in all the hues of power while from her urn partiality supplies the stream to blood and merit she denies hence blooms the unlearned divine in all the glow his doublepetalld mitre can bestow hence spreads the under clerk his ample shoot and strikes in the revenue deep his root hence high his flourished head the valet rears and hence attorneys blossom into peers still lower in their different strata spread as levity thought fit to range were laid close in their shells involved yet innocent the unhatchd vermin of a government here grubs and maggots favours sunshine wait to get new shapes and wing the world in state or more industrious snug and warm as milk spin their soft nests and wrap themselves in silk here snails of office through their slimy tracks crawl off at last with houses on their backs hence worms and earwigs in new figures sport and tinge themselves in every dye of court till pinched with cold another form they try and dip their varying films in liberty here yet unfangd wriggle the viper race which fond administration broods in place till fattend on herself and fit for strife they through her bowels gnaw their way to life here public zeal the alligator hides her selfish eggs and for their birth provides of incubation in no need they stand but hatch in popularitys hot sand to prey with open mouths away they scour yet seem to mourn the country they devour now lower as she went the hoary deep discovers where the seeds of metals sleep she saw and liked to see the plodding head do the worlds business yet be only lead that impudence its copper birth forgot grows brass and is important on the spot that talk and pertness still succeed by din and shine and tinkle in the shape of tin that ignorance and meanness raised to power their low materials quickly silver over that whig and tory principles unfold their like constituence and turn to gold but wit the quicksilver escaped her view or seeing what it was she little knew last saw where partygems their rays refine how patriotism inflames the blazing mine she now perceived from this instructive sight a kind of reminiscence all was right the soul is never taught but recollects the traces of its prior intellects acknowleges the state she held before and owns the beaming shield at troy she bore end of canto iv patriotism a mockheroic canto v of perfect diamond a solid rock far from the tempests beat and earthquakes shock its massive spurs down to the center shoots where endless permanency binds the roots upon its summit awefully elate immoveably is fixed the throne of fate the wondrous pile no mark of structure shows unhewn unbuilt the living quarry grows up the steep height an iron causeway tends and at the footstool of the monarch ends here folly passed and as she climbed the mound hollow and loud her shuffling steps resound raised on his seat the hoary sire appeared and spread profuse his ample flow of beard no condescension his firm looks avow inexorable sternness knits his brow around him bawl but clamorous to no end the fond addresses which we mortals send he to their purport turns a deafend ear or answers traversly the wasted prayer to spenthrift sons eternal fathers gives and health untaintable to modern wives the maidens pious vows are still repaid with husbands bad at board and worse abed to britain every plume of glory won sends newspapers and all the works undone or just as party thinks to crown her pains gives resolution and the prince still reigns before his feet was placed slave of his sway necessity whom men and gods obey her strong right hand a ponderous hammer held her left with adamantine nails was filled close to her side of steel an anvil rose the sounding anvil never feels repose with these on this as fast as fate assents she rivets actions down to their events millions of secondcauses claim in vain their seat usurped and urge their right to reign she holds possession still while they pursue for ever their rejected suit anew on every side and scattered every way her finished labors in wild parcels lay unrangd by their importance equal here the loss of battles or at whist appear a statesman changed or lodging newly let empires transferred or fashions out of date the joys the woes the extinction of mans race serve but to make the litter of the place here trebly clenchd the dire injunction lay for war to extend his yet too narrow sway hunger or lust the contest first began ambition soon improved upon the plan religion next inflamed the fell debate and steeled our hearts and edged our swords with hate last commerce for an endless quarrel stood and all before seemed penury of blood there was ordained law should untie her noose and slip the dogs of license and abuse to their own kennels stench familiar grown but poisning every nose except their own they with full cry the dubious scent explore and trail wherever scandal touched before still oh the shame still the loud yelp proceeds and the first head of all the forest bleeds here in like volume the decree of fate forbids that madmen should divide the state they with absurd illibral desperate push to shame even party and make faction blush strive but in vain to alienate the hearts of a whole people great in arms and arts to us by nature reason interest blood conjoined and uniond by the circling flood through these as folly passed with tottering gait from thinking hurry gave an air of state and

morning of this reign the breath of order shall disperse again broke they shall scud before the piercing ray and add new glories to its burst of day see the glad prospect shine a briton born whom virtues more than you could wish adorn gives luster to the throne whose deeds confess no thirst of power except the power to bless who from the scepter no exemption draws and is but the first subject of the laws even monarch reckons in his moral plan but second title to the honest man him did the world deserve heaven had designed the sovereign as the friend of all mankind placed as it is gentle
