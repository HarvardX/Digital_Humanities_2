anecdotes of philip late earl of chesterfield and dr johnson a comparative view of their lives characters and merit and extracts from their writings  by a student at cambridge  london printed for a cleugh    ratcliffhighway  by j skirven ratcliffhighway    00  three shillings and sixpence sewed  advertisement by the editor as all necessary information concerning the scene the persons and the scope of this literary dialogue may be found in the following introductory letter  i have only to detain the reader while i tell him that it was written by a young cambridge scholar on a visit at the house of a noble relation to one of his intimates at college  introductory letter my dear charles accept with your usual partiality and animating goodnature the first fruits of a petty but useful talent which your kind suggestion first tempted me to acquire  you may remember that in those attic evenings of our college when we happily escaped from less alluring society to devote ourselves together to demosthenes or cicero you have often said that an early facility in writing shorthand would be a desirable acquisition for a young student who confesses a very ambitious but i fear a very vain desire to emulate in due time those demigods of eloquence let me now inform you that when you see me again you will see a tolerable proficient in the art you commended whether my proficiency has been most quickened by my friendship for you or by my native ambition i shall leave my dear philosopher to decide in one of those contemplative minutes when a recent perusal of his favorite plato has augmented his characteristic propensity to scrutinize human nature  by the way as the greatest of philosophers are a little apt to forget their own private transgressions let me whisper to you that you are an absolute traitor for reading plato alone especially as we had agreed to read in concert the particular dialogues that our beloved gray has honored with his applause treachery however always includes its own punishment and i have the illnatured satisfaction of being convinced that you have but half enjoyed what you have read in my absence perhaps reading of every kind becomes more delightful and more improving when we share the amusement with a congenial mind as to dialogues we have you know determined the point when in reading those of cicero together we found that his animated and graceful composition received new spirit from the pleasing interchange of two friendly voices perhaps you are not yet aware that you are at this moment reading a sort of preface to some new dialogues such is the present that i have desired you to accept i see your surprise and the persuasion that follows it  but in truth my friend you are mistaken had they been compositions of mine i should not by reminding you of plato and of tully have imitated the simple dwarf so happily alluded to by the lively stern  in presenting my littleness to your view i should not have presented to you the standard by which you might measure it nor do i send you the production of any writer who being less dwarfish than myself and boldly endeavoring to emulate those literary giants has attained in some degree that mavelous union of grace and vigor to which they are indebted for their immortal reputation  what then do i send you  in truth a rarity and one i trust entirely to your taste  i send you a faithful copy of real and spirited dialogues that passed under the roof though not in the presence of a certain noble lord whose name is familiar to you and where conversation you know is frequently said to assume a truly attic vivacity  i do not tell you that the enclosed is perfectly in the style of your idol plato  it contains indeed no sublime enthusiasm nor logical subtlety on metaphysical subjects but you will find in it what most modern readers would think perhaps more alluring an ample and free discussion of all the merits and defects in two eminent and admirable but very different writers who having lately closed their career have left the surviving public at full liberty to scrutinize to estimate and enforce their respective claims to immortality  as these writers have been considered as rivals you will find that the cause of each is pleaded with the affectionate zeal of an enlightened admirer  as it generally happens in pleadings of every kind each advocate is tempted in praising his client to indulge himself in some severe animadversions upon the opposite party  yet for the credit of both sides i am persuaded you will agree with me that the whole debate is conducted with a liberal disdain of vulgar prejudice and that all the speakers advance no more than what the particular turn of their own mind had induced them to consider as the dictates of truth and justice  by the rambling style of their dialogue you will perceive tha it was real conversation and no formal composition of sequestered study  as you are so fond of close reasoning i mention this circumstance to obviate your objection to passages that i am confident you would otherwise consider as defects  as to myself being a less rigid votary to reason than my dear philosopher i am ever willing to sacrifice a few grains of logic for an equal portion of spirit and freedom  but it is high time for me to recollect that instead of hinting to you the value of my present which might indeed be prudent or at least very fashionable if i were making a present to the public i ought to tell you as briefly as i can the particular incidents that enabled me to send you this singular proof of my regard  it happened that in two days after my arrival here my lord was obliged to leave us and depart alone on some private business for ireland  my kind and accomplished relation assumed the privilege that she is used to take in the absence of her husband and became to use the title i give her in my idle raillery lord lieutenant of the library  no trifling dominion i can assure you but of considerable extent and admirably peopled with subjects of every class  you will recollect the description i have given you of the noble room my lord has allotted to his books and particularly the elegant and commodious little recesses in the apartment that are excellently contrived to admit a multiplicity of volumes our little party consisted for some time of lady caroline a fictitious christian name substituted here and in the dialogues for the real title of the speaker  note by the editor  an amiable and old female friend of hers with her brother the colonel and your humble servant for the young people of the house are still abroad on their travels  after breakfasting in a cheerful parlour that commands a view of the grove and the lake illuminated by the sun as he rises we have constantly moved together into the library here as my passion for books is known and indulged i have sometimes loitered in one of the recesses and peeping into various whimsical authors have utterly forgot to join in the conversation and sometimes after giving the company a due caution not to talk treason i have endeavored while i was screened from their sight to advance in my new crooked labor of writing short hand by catching the discourse of the moment one morning when i had thus employed myself i showed my manuscript to lady caroline not indeed from the motive that influenced a certain philosophical shorthand writer who having a very talkative wife took down without the good womans suspecting his employment all she said in a week and presented to her a legible transcript of the whole when as my story goes the honest dame was so shocked by the horrid figure which her peevish loquacity made on paper that she rewarded the philosopher for his elaborate tender and silent reproof by correcting her foible  i was equally fortunate though on a very different occasion my fair cousin whose conversation i must say has as little to fear from such an artifice as any persons can have was amused with my work and as we happened to be alone when i produced it she thus imparted to me the project it suggested  you know my dear edmund we expect our good neighbor the archdeacon to pass a few days here you know what an idolater he is of doctor johnson and you know the colonels equal devotion to lord chesterfield  we will contrive to engage these two literary enthusiasts in an amicable debate on their respective idols you shall invisibly catch their dialogue as you have done this and to show that we have acted with no insidious design we will afterward allow them the liberty of perusing and if either desires it of burning the paper  so said so done  i have only to detain you from the dialogue while i tell you that as they are both men of a social and benevolent disposition they were so far from being offended by this theft of their words that each has had the goodnature to comply with my request and not only revise but correct and improve his portion of the debate so that you receive their speeches like the authentic printed orations of our eloquent senators corrected in the closet and still faithfully breathing all the warm spirit with which they were spoken  i should add that lady caroline set a sort of little trap for the disputants which caught them to our wish  she had placed on her own little table in the library a quarto volume of lord chesterfield with two of johnsons octavos upon it and had left open one of the latter  the device was successful and very speedily gave birth to the dialogue which is now before you  two dialogues etc dialogue i lady caroline pray my good friend let me ask you what tempted you to smile in surveying the books on my table i hope it implied no censure on my choice   the archdeacon by no means to confess the truth madam i only smiled if i did smile because their position hit my fancy as an emblem of justice   lady caroline of justice  how so   the archdeacon it represented to my imagination the decisive triumph of the once indigent and neglected but truly great moralist over the highborn and fashionable wit whose vain talents were during his life the idol of his country   lady caroline have a care my good friend  believe me that idolatry is not extinguished remember my brother is close to you and such an enthusiast that if you begin an attack upon his favorite he will give no quarter to yours   the archdeacon i would not offend the colonel for the world but i am sure he has too sound a judgment both in literature and morals to consider these writers on a level  he may perhaps be partial to the memory of lord chesterfield from a personal acquaintance with that nobleman and if so i sincerely ask his pardon for having alluded to the public failings of his friend   the colonel your courtesy my dear sir is so engaging and i have in truth such esteem for your judgment that i could wish to think with you on all points i am convinced indeed that we agree perfectly in all essential articles though our coats are so different in their color  and you who have the happy art of uniting zeal and moderation in matters of highest moment will i am sure be candid enough not to think me either a fool or a libertine for admiring my lord chesterfield as to my personal knowledge of him i can only say it was just sufficient for me to perceive in a few accidental conversations that the world were perfectly right in pronouncing him the politest man of his time but it is not on any familiarity that i can boast of with this accomplished personage it is on a deliberate survey of his life and character and a long intimacy with his truly attic compositions that i have founded my increasing admiration of his talents and his merit   lady caroline i told you our enthusiast would catch fire   the colonel nay my dear temperate sister do not affect a prudish indifference toward an author you love severe as he sometimes is and very provokingly so on your sex how often have you had the justice to join in my estimate of his excellence how often have we lamented together and with equal indignation that hypocritical or senseless torrent of obloquy which has been poured upon his ashes   the archdeacon consider my dear colonel that the censure on your favorite which you represent as unjust has not proceeded only from a few individuals who might be eager to insult the memory of the eminent from the pride of ignorance or the malice of envy it may be regarded as the outcry of an offended nation a whole people can hardly be inclined to pronounce sentence on any writer with malignity and ingratitude especially on the dead but there are certain unexpected offenses in the moral world which burst upon us with an aspect of such enormity as seems to force from the lips of every unprejudiced spectator the most rapid and absolute condemnation there are some violations i will not say of religion and of virtue but of common sense and common decency which an honest attention to the good of mankind forbids us to tolerate or forgive i am afraid the sins of your favorite must be ranked in this unfortunate class for my own part i must confess i esteem it so dangerous a thing to pour the oil of licentious admonition on the blazing fire of youth that i wish his letters had been destroyed and surely you colonel who never exert the privilege often allowed to your profession of treating serious things with levity you i think can never wish to reconcile our minds to the horrid image of a father preaching adultery to his son   the colonel good heavens my dear sir is it possible that a man of your candor and discernment can join in the barbarous inference that has been drawn from the letter you allude to if we are to be condemned so cruelly on a few idle or wanton words that escape in some luckless or unguarded moment where is the mortal of sufficient purity to support this rigorous inquisition not your great moralist believe me if chesterfield must fall by such a scrutiny so indeed must johnson most of those who have heard the common anecdotes of this justlycelebrated writer have heard his reply to a person who once asked him what he reckoned the highest pleasures of human life it is well known that he named the two grossest of our sensual enjoyments and without cooling the hot idea by one of his sixfooted circumlocutions shall i therefore call your great moralist a preacher of gluttony and incontinence truth and justice forbid yet surely i might do so as fairly as you arraign my favorite in consequence of a few sportive words in a private letter  but let us not play the inquisitor with an austerity that converts into a crime every casual expression and is pregnant itself with more evil than it professes to correct let us judge of books and of men not from a few scattered failings in sentiment style or conduct but from the full and fair impression which a complete and deliberate survey of their blended merits and defects may leave upon our mind if on this plain and ample ground you are willing to enter into a friendly debate on the different portions of censure and of honor that may be due both to chesterfield and to johnson i shall by no means decline the contest for though i am most willing to allow that the latter will have much the more able advocate i shall not despair of proving that my favorite as you justly call him was in truth take him for all in all as good a man as sound a moralist and as eloquent a writer as the renowned philosopher whom you particularly admire   lady caroline i never heard a more tempting challenge and i trust the archdeacon has too much spirit to refuse it as you are two men whom we may safely lead into a warm debate without the slightest fear of its consequence i confess myself very desirous of seeing you engage though opposite in your opinion and zealous in your nature i am perfectly sure that your controversy can produce no painful or unfriendly sensations in the mind of either and to me it will afford both pleasure and instruction  it will enable me to settle my own confused thoughts concerning two authors whom i am fond of reading and who to tell you the truth both delight and disgust me to such a degree that i shall be particularly glad to hear the good and evil in both deliberately examined and heartily compared   the archdeacon they are beings my dear lady that will not admit of a comparison  would you not be angry with me if i compared my honest friend lion the noble mastiff who guards your magnificent mansion with the sly and mischievous fox that has lately invaded your poultry such a comparison only can be made between the generous instructor whose lessons defend our virtue and the pernicious wit whose writings only tend to circumvent and destroy it   the colonel i admire the spirit and ingenuity of your simile but like a ball thrown with too much force it rebounds so unluckily as to hurt yourself for i must inform you that your honest friend lion was almost condemned a few days ago to a violent death  and he might indeed have suffered with justice not only for arrogating to himself much more than his due but for mangling most ferociously an excellent little spaniel who dared to lap out of their common dish and whom he ought to have regarded as a fellow servants of equal value with himself in the sight of his bountiful and indulgent master  after telling you this anecdote i will not be so cruel as to add that i think you have pitched on a perfect emblem of your great philosopher yet allow me to say that he certainly did not resemble your old philosophical acquaintance the demonax of lucian whose name has been improperly applied to him in the want either of faculty or disposition to play the dog peregrinus used to reproach him for laughing too much and being too familiar with people demonax said he you do not act the dog well  see the demonax of lucian translated by franklin and inscribed to dr johnson who is called by the translator the demonax of the present age    the archdeacon i allow your raillery its full scope i am ready to confess there was a surly grandeur in the character of johnson he was used to spurn the effusions of vice and folly with a fervent and virtuous indignation that was frequently mistaken for brutal ferocity an incessant zeal for moral excellence was his ruling passion and he had an unexampled power of extracting morality from every incident of life from every appearance in nature no man ever exerted more intense or more constant thought to search into the essence of all goodness on his own account and to render his researches beneficial to mankind it is on this ground that he is generally regarded as a teacher of true wisdom inferior only to the sacred writers themselves and it is for the interest of human nature that we should guard the glory of such a man from the petty cavils of detraction or the unintended injury of misconception  for my own part i should say indeed that i am more intimate with him as a moralist than as a critic in the former light i revere him as a second socrates far superior to the first and surely you colonel who for a modern soldier are singularly disposed to moral contemplation you the attentive father of welleducated children you i say can hardly think of seriously comparing an author of this character to one whose compositions if i may venture to use the vehement censure of my indignant critic exhibit only the morals of a courtezan and the manners of a dancing master   lady caroline i thank you my dear disputant for blending politeness with your zeal i perceive that your tender respect to female ears has led you to soften one expression in the very bitter though concise invective you have quoted   the colonel we are perfectly acquainted you see with the sarcastic gall of your great moralist but let me observe that the keenest sarcasms in general rather prove the virulence or at least the pride of the accuser than the vices of the accused indeed your idol himself to do him justice instructs us how to value them when he says in this very volume observation daily shows that much stress is not to be laid on hyperbolical accusations and pointed sentences which even he that utters them desires to be applauded rather than credited but let me read to you the close of this paragraph it is admirable  few characters can bear the microscopic scrutiny of wit quickened by anger and perhaps the best advice to authors would be that they should keep out of the way of one another here you find that your great moralist thought it hardly possible for an author to regard his brethren but with an evil eye and justly perhaps we might exclaim on this occasion his own example strengthens all his laws he is himself the microscope he draws rarely indeed did he fail to magnify the defects of such as were placed before him though his own great qualities were blended with such imperfections that if the latter were shown to us through a glass whose magnifying power was equal to his own he would certainly appear as the most enormous monster that ever rose into philosophical reputation with bitterness of language and brutality of manners indeed you may recollect that in his lifetime his own virulence was often retorted upon him he has been called you know a respectable hottentot and the caliban of literature but alas what is proved by sarcasms of this kind on either side little more i believe than the lamentable prevalence of jealous and angry passions in the heated candidates for popular applause for my own part as i have though i am no writer a passionate regard for the real interest and glory of literature i am grieved whenever i see authors of great genius condescend to hack and mangle one another like servile gladiators to gratify the rabble instead of combating in a common cause like free and generous citizens against ignorance and envy the peculiar enemies of their republic   the archdeacon here my good friend we perfectly agree  believe me i lament as sincerely as you do the jealous infirmity of exalted spirits so very common among the professors of every art that many people consider it as necessarily inherent in that fine texture of the human faculties which we denominate genius  i am far from wishing to represent johnson as utterly exempt from a natural defect which he had the rare magnanimity to own and the virtue to suppress for what can redound more to the honor of any man and especially of a professed philosopher than to have it justly said of him that he assiduously regulated every improper movement of his heart by a powerful and majestic understanding   the colonel rigid truth and justice i believe could never say so of johnson but allowing you for a moment that they might i can easily tell you what would be more honorable or i should rather say what would render a philosopher a much more amiable being in my estimation and it is simply this  to possess a heart so kindly fashioned by nature that its own native benevolence should supply the place of your majestic regulator   the archdeacon that is you prefer a readymade philosopher to one who has had the merit of making himself in the quiet vale of private life where no sort of competition awakens the turbulent affections of the mind your undisciplined philosopher may be allsufficient but in a continual contest for popular applause where the faculties are ever on the stretch and where the passions frequently blaze in proportion to the activity of the intellectual powers in such a scene and such you know is the field of literature we must not i fear expect the gentle voice of benevolence to be attended to as it ought authors we know are irritable to a proverb and how rapidly they are hurried into wilful or blind injustice to each other we see but too clearly from every period in the history of letters but if such are the infirmities to which their condition exposes them ought we not to conceive a signal respect for that eminent writer who constantly exerted his philosophy and forgive me if i add his religion to preserve him from these excesses it is in this point of view that the character of johnson appears to me particularly noble where can we find an author who in running so long a career in the same thorny field has done so much for the honor of his profession and so little for the gratification of his private spleen insulted and reviled as he was perpetually when did he write a vindication of himself or a satire upon his enemies it does him i think infinite credit to reflect that with powers particularly formed to make him the first satirist that ever existed he chose to exert all the energy of his spirit in moral compositions of a very different nature in such as might invigorate the understanding without affording any food to the malignity of mankind at the time when we may suppose his resentment to have been most awakened when his character was acrimoniously delineated under the title of pomposo by a satirist of great celebrity you may remember that he disdained to take any kind of revenge and i do not indeed recollect that he has mentioned the name of churchill in any of his writings his great mind was aware that in some kinds of contention the very act of engaging is disgrace he perfectly understood an important truth which few indeed of his fraternity have had spirit enough to confide in or temper sufficient to attend to i mean a maxim which he expresses most happily himself in closing one of his admirable ramblers and if my memory deceives me not it runs thus whatever be the motive to insult it is always best to overlook it for folly scarcely can deserve resentment and malice is punished by neglect   the colonel an excellent maxim i grant you in many cases and it reflects as much honor on the preacher as a good sermon on humility would reflect on a certain prelate of our acquaintance whose general demeanor might lead us to suppose that he knew not even the name of that virtue the forbearance of johnson according to your own account of it was the offspring not of charity but of pride he did not throw indeed upon paper any deliberate invective against his opponents but we learn from the diligent retailers of his conversation that his common discourse was a continued stream of sarcasms against all who did not blindly acquiesce in his dogmatical decisions so that the commendation due to his pacific conduct if rigidly examined amounts only to this  he never drew out his heavy artillery against his enemies because he thought that he could demolish them with less trouble and more security to himself by the snap of a pocket pistol   lady caroline come come my dear champions this is but an idle and i think an unfair sort of skirmish i must be the arbiter of your contests not only as to the issue but the mode of conducting it like the president at one of our ancient tournaments i must see that the knights engage only in a generous and friendly conflict  let each be as zealous as he pleases to maintain the honor of his own idol but without reviling that of his antagonist i proscribe therefore all bitter sarcasms as poisoned weapons that ought to be banished from our lists to drop my metaphor which i confess i cannot very well support let me remind you that i expect a full and candid comparison of the two illustrious authors whom you respectively admire   the archdeacon my dear lady the very idea of such a comparison is enough to make our lately departed moralist feel a spasm of indignation in his grave   the colonel if we might literally interpret one of the many poets whom your moralist has vilified and exclaim with gray even in our ashes live their wonted fires then indeed i should apprehend that the dust of johnson might be disturbed by our comparing him to a writer whom he seems to have hated with theological bitterness and whose reputation he attempted to stab with the short but envenomed dagger of a vindictive monk but though i am far from thinking your favorite so virtuous and pure a character as you seem to do i can readily believe that his soul is now happily purified from that leaven of sour infirmity which debased i must confess in my estimation his singular and exalted powers i can believe that if his ashes were indeed insulted by any indecent outrage which heaven forbid his spirit now like that of pompey described by lucan would smile at the vain malice of his foe and pity impotent mankind below believe me i am so far from being an enemy to his memory that i think his writings and his life are both worthy of being studied in both we may find much to admire and emulate with much to censure and avoid with both i would only wish to take such liberty as he seems to allow where he tells us that if we owe regard to the memory of the dead there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledge to virtue and to truth rambler no  0    lady caroline very well my dear decent brother after your paying so serious and just a compliment to the grave of his revered moralist i think the archdeacon cannot in courtesy decline your challenge or imagine that the honor of his client may be wounded by a candid discussion of his cause   the archdeacon before i speak a word in reply to the colonel allow me to ask your ladyship one whimsical question  you know that we all love and revere you as a matronly model of female virtues conscious of such a character should you not blush with indignation at the thought of being compared to the celebrated ninon or to any more accomplished courtezan if any such can be found in the annals of gallantry   lady caroline your question is indeed rather whimsical and if i wished to evade it perhaps i might justly say in the language of our lawyers it is not a case in point  but as i am eager to promote the friendly debate to which my brother has invited you i will be very frank in my answer and tell you my genuine feelings on your fanciful supposition if the odd comparison you suggest was heartily made and chiefly to show what a different assemblage of virtues and failings may be found in different situations for all mortals you know have some failings and i am far from thinking those of ninon the only blemishes that may be found in our sex if i say your odd comparison was conducted with that extreme delicacy which it certainly requires i believe    the colonel believe indeed my dear prude  come if you are not confident enough to speak the true language of your heart let me be its interpreter and say you are convinced that such a comparison would rather please than offend you  there is a simple female secret which every man who has studied the fair sex with moderate assiduity and intelligence must have discovered and it is this  the women who are most faithful in the practice of virtue still delight in being told that they are equal in loveliness to the famously elegant daughters of frailty and i question if the cunning ulysses himself could have flattered penelope more agreeably than by telling her she was as graceful as helen   lady caroline i am not surprised at this sentiment from an idolater of chesterfield but i will answer your maxim by another which approaches i believe much nearer to truth  the men who fancy themselves most deeply skilled in the science of reading the female heart are generally the greatest strangers to its most delicate sensations   the archdeacon your ladyship is certainly right a true knowledge of the finest work in the creation is not comprehended in the gross or vain ideas of a libertine   the colonel i vehemently protest against your applying that title to my client as i have engaged to prove him as perfect in his morals as your celebrated sage   lady caroline be calm then my dear enthusiast for what i want to hear is a full candid and simple statement of the real merits and failings in the two celebrated persons we are canvassing i wish to have a fair comparative estimate of both according to your own plan of considering them first in their general character as men or citizens secondly as moralists or periodical lecturers on life and manners finally as writers regarding only their style   the archdeacon pray do not repress the colonels enthusiasm because he is one of the very few men who may grow warm in a bad cause without catching any infection from the depravity he defends indeed however paradoxical it may sound it is his own goodness that makes him the zealous advocate of vice for the truth is he has himself so generous and pure a heart with such a quick delightful perception of elegance and wit that he gives the possessor of these enchanting qualities unbounded credit for virtues which were foreign to his nature   the colonel i ask your pardon my dear flattering encomiast i must not allow you in thus holding out an unmerited and dazzling crown to your antagonist to trip up his heels without beginning to wrestle you mistake me entirely if you suppose that i consider my lord chesterfield as a perfect character a faultless monster which the world never saw or as even possessed of that true greatness and purity which some of our english worthies have attained i only say that with splendid and most engaging talents he had neither more nor worse vices than your exalted philosopher and that he is no less entitled to the kind remembrance of his country this i think an impartial discussion of their lives and compositions may render as evident as it is that they were both beings of the human species   lady caroline however strong and sincere you may be in this opinion i doubt a little your being able to persuade even our candid archdeacon to agree with you and i believe the good folks of the world in general who delight in that short and easy mode of proving their great love for goodness which they find in idolizing a name for imaginary perfection these good people would be shocked at your idea and perhaps exclaim against you as a horrid profligate endeavoring to confound all the principles of right and wrong but as we give you full credit for motives directly opposite to these i beg we may pursue this amusing disquisition some familiar words of johnson that i have just recollected suggest to me a plan for pursuing it in the fairest and most satisfactory manner you may remember in the journal of his fellowtraveller when he is displeased with lord hailes for publishing only such memorials and letters as were unfavourable for the stuart family he say if a man fairly warns you i am to give all the ill do you find the good he may  do not you recollect this passage my friend i am sure my brother does because though i cannot repeat the whole sentence regularly i know it ends with those remarkable words i would tell truth of the two georges or of that scoundrel king william words i believe that have had no little share in kindling the colonels animosity against your philosopher  but let us adopt the preceding maxim of one giving all the good and another finding the ill let the archdeacon begin by setting forth every thing that tends to exalt and throw a luster on his favorite moralist my brother may add the dark touches but without any sarcastic aggravation of the defects he may discover  then exchange your office let the divine freely display all the vices of chesterfield and the soldier appear i will not say his defender but his apologist   the colonel agreed   the archdeacon your ladyship is undoubtedly very good to assign me only that sort of task in which my duty and inclination may go hand in hand for according to your instructions i have only to show the genuine dignity of the genius and virtue i admire and to point out the real deformity of that dissolute elegance which has made i think too favorable an impression on the fancy of my friend yet honorable and pleasing as i must own the office you have allotted me i must also confess what happens i believe very frequently to men surprised by unexpected honors that i feel my mind dazzled and bewildered by the splendour of my charge and that i am distressed by no little fear of disappointing your expectation  but let me reflect how i may best show my obedience to the spirit though not the letter of your command to enumerate all particulars that do honor to johnson is what i am illprepared to do and what indeed could hardly be done in conversation for it would be to give an extensive review of a long laborious life continually ennobled by new acquisitions of knowledge or by new acts of goodness and magnanimity i must content myself with only stating to you as forcibly as i can a few of the most striking considerations that have conspired to impress me with peculiar veneration for this rare and exalted character let me remind you then that he was the son of a petty provincial necessitous bookseller that so far from having received any external advantages from nature his figure was hideous even in youth to such a degree that pope you know was afraid he could hardly be admitted as a preceptor into a noble family from the horrid convulsive distortions with which he was afflicted  good heaven when i consider from what humble and disadvantageous obscurity he started and what pure eminence he attained although penury deformity and disease were conspiring to impede his advancement i not only perceive the mavelous merits of the man but feel a sublime delight in contemplating the native powers of genius and the genuine dignity of science supported only by virtue   the colonel forgive me if i remark a little mistake in your estimate  what you consider as impediments in his way were springs that pushed him forward  from his own account of his feelings he must have had such a constitutional indolence that i question if any motive less cogent than poverty would have induced him to support the burden of literary labor  except perhaps his second spur of personal deformity which in a great wit to use the words of your old philosophical acquaintance my lord bacon is an advantage to rising bacons essay on deformity   but i ask your pardon for interrupting you so soon as i dare say you have many more observations to favor us with that may fall within the first division of our subject as my sister has chalked it out for us and illustrate the character of johnson as a man   the archdeacon recollect my dear colonel the beautiful verses that you repeated at breakfast with so much enthusiasm and with perfect sympathy in the sentiment they express  ah who can tell how hard it is to climb the steep where fames proud temple shines afar ah who can tell how many a soul sublime has felt the influence of malignant star and waged with fortune an eternal war checked by the scoff of pride by envys frown and povertys unconquerable bar beatties minstrel  thousands have had the aid of those springs which you consider as instrumental to the elevation of johnson but how few have risen i will not say to equal but even to similar distinction recollect that from an obscure necessitous and unsightly being he raised himself not into pomp and opulence for he had a noble contempt of both but into that more enviable eminence of character which enabled him to associate with the rich the powerful or the accomplished and made him universally revered as the great teacher of morality to the most enlightened nation of the globe  if we survey him in the period of his early difficulties and distresses in that state which has induced so many needy adventurers to act the part of a literary thersites and obtain a miserable stipend by ludicrous scurrility or declamatory malevolence how different how pure and i may say how magnanimous was his employment when his first prospect of supporting himself as a poet was blasted by the failure of his irene a performance i own that could not succeed for his genius was confessedly not dramatic his high spirit disdained to debase itself either by flattery or detraction the two ordinary resources of an indigent disappointed author he sought a refuge from the miseries of want in working on that useful that stupendous monument of literary labor his dictionary or in producing those periodical papers which are justly regarded as masterpieces of moral admonition  instead of finding him betrayed by penury into vicious or dishonorable occupation we find him not only laboring most laudably for the real good of mankind but leading a life as pure as those sublime lessons of morality which he bestowed upon the world  we find him though under the pressure of indigence yet contriving to exert that virtue of noblest luster which most dignifies the opulent and the great i allude to his charity which was so perfect so truly christian that he was ready to share the little pittance he had with any brother in distress more necessitous than himself  recollect i beseech you that mavelous effort of a great and a tender mind the composition of his admirable rasselas in a few days and nights for the purpose of relieving a sick and indigent mother  heavens my dear colonel if such an act of literary heroism had been displayed among your admired athenians they would have raised a statue to the author in some distinguished part of their city and have worshipped him as an amiable demigod whom filial piety had exalted to the stars   lady caroline well observed my good friend you will certainly make a convert of me for tears start into my eyes whenever i hear a great character celebrated for uncommon tenderness or generosity to a parent and i am wonderfully disposed to admit that single virtue as a sufficient proof of perfection   the colonel i have ever allowed that there are several glorious points in the character of johnson you have seized and displayed them very forcibly  i perfectly comprehend your pointed address to me concerning our old friends the athenians you allude to my having said last night that much as johnson had been celebrated for his intimate acquaintance with ancient literature there is not a particle of true atticism or of roman urbanity in all his compositions i really think so  but of that when we come to speak of his writings at present i am to confine myself to his character as a man and in that point of view you must forgive me for saying that however great his faculties and virtues may have been they were evidently balanced by imperfections of equal magnitude and weight as to your remark on the mavelous purity of your moralist in domestic life i will only make this short reply  if i thought it decent or fair to pursue such a scrutiny i am convinced by the report of his associates that we should find his early days as much disgraced by actual licentiousness as those of my noble client whom you have called a libertine  but woe to the man who from wanton or malevolent curiosity attempts to violate the sacred recesses of domestic privacy for the mischievous satisfaction of exposing the secret or forgotten sins of the illustrious dead far be it from us my friend to draw such frailties from their dread abode   i will not therefore allow myself to speak of any but his most open and selfevident imperfections these indeed were so great that whenever i review his character in my mind he is one moment an object of my idolatry and the next of my abhorrence for if i recollect what you have so justly commended his noble readiness to relieve the distressed i remember also that he was an absolute cain who could not bear to behold the accepted sacrifice of a brother indeed he assassinated not a single abel but continually levelled his murderous sarcasms against the literary life of all his numerous brethren the whole tribe of our contemporary authors i believe it would be impossible to name one of this tribe to whom he ever gave a full and fair portion of praise untainted by envy and if we review his poetical biography we shall find his detractive malevolence most conspicuous in the lives of those who lived and wrote in his own time   the archdeacon i will not attempt to extenuate the baseness of such envy by calling it universal  on the contrary i am persuaded it is by no means so common as we imagine and we may thus account for the frequent imputation of this hateful quality where it has not really existed  all human works must have some imperfections and in every art a professional judge will see and feel these with peculiar quickness and force he may fairly describe them according to his feelings yet his description being much stronger than the impression which the object has made on less qualified judges will to them perhaps appear as the suggestion of envy though in truth it is no more than the natural result of intelligent and keen perception   the colonel your reasoning is so ingeniously goodnatured that for the honor of literature and the arts i shall wish to find it generally true  in the case of johnson however i am so far from being able to admit it that i am convinced if we can on any occasions exculpate him from the charge of envious detraction it must be on very opposite principles  not from the warmth and acuteness but to speak in his own phrase the frigidity of his feelings we know indeed that he was not fashioned by education by habit or by the original texture of his frame to enjoy any nice discernment of real delicacy in life in manners or in composition in truth it is hardly possible that such discernment could exist in a man whose common behavior was as coarse as his passions were turbulent and who shows us in every point of view that detractive malignity and overbearing arrogance were his prevailing characteristics   the archdeacon surely i may retort upon you with more justice that it is not possible for these odious qualities to have prevailed in a character whose name is held up to public veneration by such a little host of recording friends  in a man whose talents and virtues afford such ample ground for panegyric that his death has almost converted the whole circle of his acquaintance into biographers or memorialists   the colonel well might the ghost of johnson exclaim with poor jaffier in the tragedy hide me from my friends for it is indisputably true that his moral character has sunk in the good opinion of the world in proportion as the memorials have appeared which were designed to do him honor indeed it frequently happens that an injudicious partizan does more mischief to his idol than the worst of enemies but as the little flock of his biographers though certainly not birds of the same feather are all amusing in their way i am far from wishing to strengthen my arguments in our debate by treating them with asperity i shall only say therefore what if the lady who leads the band were present to hear me she would not i trust consider as any breach of that courteous respect which is surely due both to her sex and to her talents  i shall only say that this little tribe of biographers strike my fancy as a group of busy children who having got a gilt shilling are very eager to exhibit it as a guinea each rubbing it with an air of confidence to increase its golden luster but showing alas at every rub still more of that baser metal which they are all so solicitous to represent as gold   the archdeacon not so my good friend  let us rather call them an honest philosophical set of people who in analyzing a magnificent mass of the richest metal tell us truly the real weight of the pure ore and fairly exhibit the little portion of natural dross which their experiments discovered  but to quit our metaphor and speak the plain language of truth and reason is not the incessant kindness the lasting veneration which johnson has received from his most intimate associates a full proof in itself that his excellencies as a man and a companion were infinitely superior to his failings what more touching test of merit can we desire for any character than to find that he was revered even to idolatry by his friends does not the high reputation of socrates rest solely on this foundation he has been the idol of succeeding ages because he was justly idolized by those faithful and accomplished recorders of his companionable perfections xenophon and plato   the colonel assuredly  and as often as we review their affectionate accounts of him particularly the very sweet and simple portrait exhibited by the first we sympathize in the tender enthusiasm of the friendly memorialist but what would the world have thought of the great pagan sage if his fair and elegant friend aspasia had left us a little book of philosophical anecdotes in which we might read that the great philosopher had rewarded her for allowing him a noble apartment and all the comforts of her magnificent house by teazing with argumentative and imperious petulance her good aged mother what would the world have thought of him if xenophon had given us the narrative of an excursion made to amuse his instructive master by showing him the bleak mountains of thrace and had told us that when he presented him to his venerable old father who dwelt in that country the sage instead of entertaining his respectable host with colloquial wisdom worried him so ferociously that the luckless disciple must have wished for a muzzle to secure his parent from the mouth of the outrageous brute whom he had ventured to lead from athens to a distant province for the sake of showing him as a consummate philosopher again i may say what would the world have thought of him if the sublime plato himself had represented his admirable instructor as the most selfish and disgusting glutton that ever appeared at a table  such are the points of view in which your favorite moralist has been exhibited to us by his various biographical associates your excellent memory my good friend will readily suggest the passages to which i have alluded i am far from suspecting all or any one of these writers of a treacherous intention to degrade their hero  yet what enemies could have contributed more to his degradation as a man in the eyes of every candid and impartial reader  i will not say it has happened by their fault let us call it rather a fatality for the accomplishment of literary justice  and it affords us an incentive to universal candor and benevolence to contemplate the man who had written the lives of many with a great portion of detractive malignity destined to have memorials of himself so written by a succession of his friends that his character must sink in the public esteem exactly as fast as their friendly records appear   the archdeacon i cannot agree with you for i cannot perceive in my own mind the effect that you suppose universal i cannot perceive that i ought to esteem him the less as a man of virtue because i am told it was his custom to eat in eager silence though i confess it does not appear very consistent with the delicacy of friendship to commemorate a peculiarity so disgusting   the colonel well my good friend we will not argue this point in favor of your great moralist i consent to strike the name of gluttony from the catalogue of vices but allow me to ask you if you could revere even the pagan socrates as a philosopher on finding him deficient in those primary constituents of a great moral character justice and fortitude   the archdeacon most certainly not and let me add that my veneration for johnson is partly founded on my idea of his having possessed those noble qualities in a superlative degree   the colonel to me he appears defective in both indeed we violate the name of justice when we suppose her to have dwelt in the spirit of a man who incessantly detracted from all eminent characters and who hardly allowed any mortals to differ from him in opinion without representing them as worthless or insignificant yet johnson for some time contrived to support a moral reputation as marvellously as mithridates supported his life your philosopher after fortifying his good name by many tumid sentences of morality ventured on such envious gratifications as would have been immediate death to the credit of any other man and the chemical king of pontus you know as historians inform us after breakfasting on antidotes ventured to dine safely on poison   the archdeacon take care my lively friend that you are not hurried yourself into the very injustice which you impute to my philosopher i allow you that his strong and gloomy imagination very frequently discolored his judgment i lament the prejudices which led him to insult the poetic genius of gray and the genuine philanthropic heroism of our political savior king william yet many allowances ought to be made for the prejudices of his early life and that terrific structure of his nerves which gave so dark a tinge to his mind as he courageously spoke his true sentiments on all occasions it is surely evident that he possessed the spirit of intentional justice at least and of unquestionable fortitude where he was mistaken let us rather pity his errors than emulate his acrimonious severity   the colonel with all my heart when i have once convinced you how very far he was from being that accomplished practical moralist which you seem to have supposed and how inferior at least in my estimation to that calumniated nobleman whom with a proud baseness peculiar to himself he first complimented and then insulted without any real provocation  such was the justice of your great moralist who has indeed as little claim to critical mercy as any man can have for he was himself a black hussar in the field of learning who never gave quarter or i should rather say he displayed his powers with a cold phlegmatic inquisitorial cruelty and as an ecclesiastical friend of ours said the other day with an extempore paraphrase of the famous old verse in ovid on their own rack it is righteously decreed bloody inquisitors themselves shall bleed    the archdeacon pray observe my honest but too warm avenger of injustice how your accusation by its own vehemence defeats at least a part of itself the force with which you describe the barbarity of johnson surely tends to clear him of your second charge the want of courage  indeed no charge can have less foundation i question if there ever existed a man who displayed more invariably in the character of an author a more absolute exemption from cowardice   the colonel so far from it that you shall find he represents himself as a most pitiful coward and that too on one of those occasions in which every man is allowed to assume the language of heroism every lover let him be as unlike a hero as he may is privileged by nature to tell his mistress in a song that he will banish her vexations and protect her from all the world but what says your brave author in singing to his dulcinea why truly this literary caesar of yours cries out like a poor splenetic pretended philosopher as he was  tired with vain joys and false alarms with mental and corporeal strife snatch me my stella to thy arms and screen me from the ills of life now put the stanza into prose and his amorous entreaty is this  i am too great a coward to bear pain either in mind or body pray protect me my good bolder girl and hide me with your petticoats from the horrors of my existence   lady caroline oh abominable  sir this wicked brother of mine is laughing at us simple folks for our serious attention to him i am confident he does not give us his genuine sentiments for three days ago i heard him praise the easy natural tenderness of the very lines which he has now travestied so unfairly   the colonel well if you will not take my present remarks for sound criticism you must at least allow that they equal in truth and candor those critical observations which the great moralist has made on prior hammond etc  but to be very sincere with you i perceive from this conversation how very apt the mind is to take a strong bias in every controversial career for since i began to compare johnson in my thoughts with one of my literary favorites whose memory i think greatly injured all the imperfections of the gloomy moralist have been so multiplied and magnified in my fancy that he strikes me in this moment not as one but an assemblage of unamiable characters  in religion a slave to superstitious horror in politics a servile bigot in familiar society an insufferable tyrant i give you my real opinion as it rises in my mind how far that opinion is the result of delusive prejudice or of a fair though rigid estimate you are certainly qualified to judge because i profess to have no knowledge of the character we are discussing except what i have derived from his printed works and such memorials of him as are generally known if i am wrong i entreat you to correct me for i wish not to injure any being alive or dead and without retorting upon him the vile abuse which he bestowed on king william i will copy his language so far as to say i would tell truth of a splenetic savage   the archdeacon you are certainly too severe and for this reason  the foibles of johnson lying if i may use such an expression in the superficies of his character disgust you to such a degree that you do not allow yourself to search fairly into his deeper and more noble qualities  but as it happens in his language when you have once digested his hard words you feel yourself invigorated by the strong reason they contain so with regard to the man if you are once reconciled to the roughness of his manners you will clearly perceive his many christian virtues for which indeed he might have obtained credit more readily had they not been so rudely covered yet we cannot deny the merchant to be rich who abounds in gold because he keeps it in a bag of the coarsest texture   the colonel your illustration is very ingenious but not perfectly just though i agree with you as to the coarseness of the purse i cannot allow your gold to be genuine  to speak more seriously on a serious subject i am aware that johnson is held up to our veneration for the sanctity and soundness of his religious character but surely my dear reverend friend it is an injury to the divine doctrine you profess to consider this man as the model of a christian i can admit with my whole heart that he was a sincere believer in christianity but to my apprehension no real believer ever succeeded worse in seizing the true spirit of our indulgent and animating religion his piety great as it is called was so far from being perfect that it neither taught him how to live nor how to die  it neither inspired him with benevolent gentleness toward his fellow creatures nor with a cheerful reliance on the beneficence of his god   the archdeacon without an ostentation of meekness toward men it taught him real humility toward his maker his piety appears to you debased by an excess of terror but surely it argues not any weakness or depravity of spirit to tremble before the throne of the almighty  if indeed the gloomy cast of his devotion could require any excuse is it not sufficiently excused by that morbid hereditary melancholy which preyed upon his mind and rendered him with all his rare faculties not less an object of pity than of admiration this idea instead of diminishing increases my respect for his character  assuredly it does him honor to reflect that by long and profound meditation he was himself the architect of his virtues and that his imperfections were woven into the texture of his frame his mavelous merits were all his own and his blemishes the work of nature   the colonel at length my good friend we meet on such ground as i have not the least inclination to dispute with you  believe me i am as willing as you can be to consider the failings of johnson as constitutional  all i contend for is this that with so peccant a constitution he may not be proposed to us as a model either of morality or religion  the ancient philosophers who maintain you know that virtue is not to be taught without the assistance of a proper natural disposition would have not only denied his actual possession of consummate virtue but the possibility of his acquiring it since instead of looking on the face of nature with true filial tenderness and gratitude his gloomy spirit made him regard her only as a malicious stepmother who exerted her ingenuity to embitter his existence an affectionate delight in the visible creation appears to me as necessary to perfect morals as the spring is to the perfection of the year how utterly destitute of that sentiment your great moralist must have been we may clearly perceive by his indignation against an humble and blameless woman for pretending to be happy in such a world  yet dark as this state of existence appeared to him he could not practice even the wise precept of his pagan friend juvenal and to quote his own spirited verse count death kind natures signal of retreat when i find him so inferior in real purity and strength of mind to the pagan moralists i should think myself absurd indeed if i revered him as a model of christian excellence especially when i recollect that with all his profound reverence to our blessed religion he seldom opened his lips without sinning against the spirit and the letter of the gospel in calling a brother fool  i am as ready as you are my good friend to ascribe both the gloominess and the asperity of his mind and manners to the vitiated organs of his very wonderful frame  indeed the more i contemplate his character the more i am convinced that the distemper which afflicted his body if i may use a scriptural expression entered into his soul i am willing therefore to consider his defects rather as misfortunes than as crimes although they appear to have operated against his happiness with the double force of calamity and of guilt for with uncommon powers to support either bodily or mental exercise  with all the advantages he derived from his successful labor and the liberal kindness of his more intimate admirers  he seems to have been through every period of life a very miserable being and no one i believe were it possible would consent to purchase his rare faculties by submitting to resemble him in every particular  but whatever the sum of his imperfections may be after that is subtracted there still remains such a portion of real merit as will probably secure immortality to his name and writings believe me i am so far from being an enemy to his fame that i heartily wish the public would discover a more liberal disposition to pay him sepulchral honors the subscription for his monument seems to languish in a manner that reflects disgrace on this opulent and polished country i wish my good friend that you and i knew how to quicken the munificence of the kingdom on this occasion  the nation that wishes to be ennobled by the production of future great characters ought to be splendid in her memorials to departed genius  i am amazed that the zealous admirers of johnson have not been more eager to render him this tribute since his title to such a distinction is admitted by those who had no personal attachment to the man and who even think him as i do a strange compound of the most attractive and most disgusting qualities that ever met in the formation of an author  but i have said full enough and perhaps too much of his failings soldier as i am i assure you it is more pleasant to me on this occasion to defend than to attack let me turn therefore from your respected moralist and hasten to the vindication of my injured favorite the elegant the witty the accomplished chesterfield   lady caroline not so fast my dear hasty advocate i cannot suffer either of my two disputants to evade any of the points that they have undertaken to debate pray recollect that you are still to discuss the merits of johnson as a writer   the archdeacon madam the colonel is a soldier of too much experience to be very eager in attacking a fortress of any kind that is secured by art and nature against every assailant let me be allowed to call the miscellaneous essays of johnson a heavendefended city whose palladium is pure and perfect morality as this can neither be overthrown nor pilfered by the boldness or ingenuity of any diomed or ulysses the fabric in which this eternal guardian is magnificently lodged must be impregnable and immortal   the colonel alas my good friend how many of such impregnable fortresses in which not only morality but religion herself in all her purity seemed to promise their preservation have mouldered into dust it is possible i fear that your favorite serious ramblers like many admirable sermons of past times may in a few centuries be utterly forgotten   the archdeacon surely not for although it is certain those excellent papers have all the serious purity of a sermon yet they have also very different attractions to me the ramblers exhibit a mental paradise in which fancy and reason alternately entertain me with a succession of new delights under the guidance and patronage of virtue and religion while i read them i feel to use the words of their incomparable author my heart rectified my appetites counteracted and my passions repressed   the colonel i most readily admit that the ramblers from the evident design of the writer and from their intrinsic merit in many points of view have very strong and i sincerely hope they may prove successful claims to immortality yet as lessons on life and manners there are many productions of the same class whose influence on my heart and mind is not only more pleasant but more beneficial to read the rambler is to my feelings to walk through a stupendous egyptian temple of black marble furnished with some colossal statues of ebony and with here and there a little grotesque image very lamely copied from ordinary life i perceive at every step a strength and grandeur of conception in the dark fancy of the melancholy architect i perceive also that in the course of his gloomy labor he had short fits of merriment and that in those sportive moments he was singularly awkward and ungraceful in the whole structure there is an air of awful majesty that always fixes my attention and frequently enchants me yet at the end of my circuit through its various apartments i feel rather depressed and amazed than animated and improved such is the effect which his most considerable work produces upon me and that many others have surveyed it with similar feelings we may conclude from what he tells us himself in the close of the last paper the book is in your hand give me leave to read the sentence  scarcely any man is so steadily serious as not to complain that the severity of dictatorial instruction has been too seldom relieved and that he is driven by the sternness of the ramblers philosophy to more cheerful and airy companions   the archdeacon i admire the magnanimity of this confession   the colonel you are very generous my good friend in allowing that quality to a poor discontented author who tells us in a fit of honest spleen that he thought himself too wise for his readers   the archdeacon it is surely true that the serious air and let me say the sublime beauties of that production were the chief obstacles to its immediate success its merit was of too elevated a nature to be instantly understood by the frivolous multitude  but it has at length been fairly appreciated by time and the great moralist is now universally read not only for the dignity of his sentiments but for the force and luster of his language for my own part i exult in the growing influence of his genius i am happy in seeing it tend to the full discharge of that glorious office for which every great mind should think itself fashioned by heaven i mean the office of diffusing the light of knowledge and of virtue over millions of spirits inferior to itself   the colonel i will not be so ungrateful as to say that i catch not any such rays from johnson but if i am frequently enlightened by his bursts of splendid sentiment i am still more frequently darkened and depressed by his thick vollies of spleen in all his writings and in the rambler particularly he seems to me to bear a great resemblance to his own suspirius the screechowl whom he represents you know as settled in an opinion that the whole business of life is to complain and whose every syllable was loaded with misfortune  he would indeed be the most meritorious of all moralists if the merit of a preceptor consisted in trying to teach mankind that their existence is misery i own myself devoted to more enlivening philosophy for i could never find that wisdom and virtue are acquired by catching the contagion of constitutional melancholy or that the heart is made better in proportion as the imagination is terrified   the archdeacon yet a man of your thoughtful turn my dear colonel must surely allow that in alluring men to pay a serious attention to their duty a writer takes the first and most necessary step toward making them better it is not the gloom of melancholy but the solemnity of religion that gives such a serious air to the compositions of johnson and instead of blaming the philosopher i think you ought rather to applaud the christian   the colonel i have already said that your moralist appears to me to have mistaken the true spirit of christianity in his manners and i think so no less in the tenor of his works which without mentioning those that are envious and unjust have a general tendency to inspire a dreary gloominess of spirit a soldier perhaps my dear reverend friend may have formed very erroneous notions of sacred things which he cannot have studied sufficiently but to my apprehension the true spirit of our religion is more cheerful than gloomy for in what does christianity surpass all the religions of the earth not in its austerity not in its terror but in its benignity in its comfort it is cheerful because it excites us to the most attentive discharge of those tender and social duties which cannot be duly discharged without gentleness and joy other religions may animate the frame by flattering some particular passion as the alcoran for instance undoubtedly flatters the two passions of desire and ambition but christianity in my idea of it accomplishes this end by the very opposite means it melts down all the passions and extracts from them the vivifying essence of universal charity  forgive me for thus throwing out the rough conceptions of a laical enthusiast on so interesting a topic i am sure you will forgive me because i know we think alike both on the importance and the benignity of our religion   the archdeacon and let me remind you my excellent friend that our ideas agree also with those of the great author whom you are too hastily condemning you seem to have utterly forgot that the rambler contains not only as sublime but as cheerful a picture of christianity as the human faculties can exhibit pray recollect the dream in which a lovely figure exclaims  my name is religion i am the offspring of truth and love and the parent of benevolence hope and joy it is remarkable that the speaker and his opponent seem equally unaware of a considerable mistake in this quotation the words indeed are in the rambler but in number    a paper supplied by a lady who in copying the energy of johnsons language has embellished his work with the purest religious sentiments  note by the editor    the colonel i perfectly recollect the allegory you mean for i happened to read it aloud the other day to my sister and i remember on our finishing the paper we both regretted that religion when she settled herself in the mind of johnson seemed to have excluded these her three children from her household to religious joy he appears to have been almost a stranger he was not favored with very long or very frequent visits from religious hope and that religious benevolence which we frequently admire as the immediate director of his pen was continually overpowered and struck dumb by the stronger voices of his more constant companions pride envy and spleen i allow you that few authors have written with a more religious cast of mind than your moralist yet surely he disgusts his reader not by being too much but too little of a christian religion has sometimes an effect similar to what is imputed to wine instead of giving new dispositions to the mind it strengthens and calls forth the humor it happens to meet whether good or bad thus the natural ferocity of johnson is seen to mount in a religious blaze when in his ramble among the sacred ruins of scotland his imagination delights itself in conceiving that a ruinous steeple may fall to crush the posterity of the scottish reformer surely said a friend of ours when he first saw that anecdote of johnson this man wanted only the lot of being born in spain when the inquisition was established to have been distinguished as the most blackminded and bloody supporter of that barbarous tribunal   lady caroline enough my dear disputants on this point pray allow me to give a new turn to your debate for i foresee that if you grow warm on this branch of your argument one of you will make him a saint and the other a fiend though it is very evident to our cool apprehension that he was neither but as most of you lordly creatures might be found perhaps in such mental dissection a very strange compound of both   the colonel very well my dear lady so you think the sons of eve like the male heirs who seize the whole estate in our modern families have taken from their sisters all the ample inheritance of imperfection give me your hand my poor sister for if any son of eve can be truly said to have done so i am the man   the archdeacon so you are my friend as far as the lady is concerned and let me add that you resemble the modern heir in another particular you have so contrived to get rid of this same ample inheritance that we cannot even guess the amount of it   lady caroline i thank you doubly my good friend for answering one compliment for me and at the same time favoring me with another  but come we are idly rambling from our subject you have still to consider johnson both as a poet and a critic   the colonel in the first character he may be soon dispatched we have only to say what i think unquestionable that he was inferior to the whole body of english poets whom he has so ferociously anatomized   the archdeacon i ask your pardon there is nothing finer in our language than his imitation of juvenal and his various prologues particularly the very fine prologue that delineates the progress of the drama   the colonel surely there is some degree of courtesy in allowing his name to stand on the list of poets for having written the most frigid and uninteresting tragedy that can be selected from all the languages of the earth and a forcible imitation of a declamatory satirist he thought himself indeed a great poet and tried to bully the public into the same opinion by the close of the arrogant prologue to his irene in reason nature truth he dares to trust ye fops be silent and ye wits be just   this would have been bold language for any writer to have used in speaking of his most fortunate production but what is it when applied to a performance which instead of being inspired by his boasted patrons reason nature and truth appeared to be rather the work of false unfeeling art and of pompous absurdity  his critical bitterness may be partly ascribed to his great dramatic disappointment having utterly failed in his prime ambition to distinguish himself and make his fortune as a poet he conceived an eternal hatred to the whole tribe of poets and unluckily for that tribe his powers of defaming poetical merit were as strong as his power to equal it was feeble and hence as i lately heard a censurer of his criticism altered a title page to his lives of the poets and called them the lives of the triumphant angels written by lucifer the fallen indeed he seems to have dipped his pen not only in gall but in everburning sulphur unconsumd   in all his compositions and even in his recorded conversation when he is most virulent and ferocious there is still such vigor of intellect in what he says that i must own he hardly ever appears less than archangel ruined    the archdeacon i am glad you allow him some dignity as a writer however diabolical  but my good friend are you not aware of the extreme inconsistency in your description you represent him as a most striking example both of feebleness and vigor in one point you must be mistaken for it is impossible that the same being can be both a giant and a dwarf   the colonel pardon me  that impossibility was realized in johnson he was a giant in some faculties and a dwarf in others   the archdeacon yet surely not a dwarf in that faculty which is said to constitute a poet  i mean imagination  one of his friends has told us you know and i think very truly his mind was so full of imagery that he might have been perpetually a poet   the colonel we find he made the experiment and could never be so completely  his latest biographer indeed seems aware of his poetical and his critical failure and appears to apologize for both by supposing that he is to be numbered among those poets in whom the powers of understanding more than those of the imagination are seen to exist  but such a supposition affords us no very favorable or just estimate of the talents that really belonged to this wonderful being for even the enemies of johnson must allow that a very vigorous and a very quick imagination was one of his most striking characteristics the truth i believe is however paradoxical it may sound that a writer may possess the faculty of imagination in a high degree and yet prove himself a miserable poet let any one try to read the irene of johnson and he will be perfectly convinced of this truth there are fine images elevated sentiments and splendid language yet the performance produces only languor and disgust because the author was utterly destitute of that sensibility which alone can enable a writer to awaken interest and pathos a poet who has not the smallest degree of dominion over the passions is as poor and impotent a being as a king without subjects   the archdeacon such an author may fail in the drama and yet excel in other branches of poetry   the colonel i do not believe there is an instance of any great poet upon record who was unable on every occasion to assume the easy air of nature and to speak the language of the heart such inability i think attended johnson both in verse and prose yet with all that deficiency i feel he had faculties which justly make him an object of admiration he had a depth an expansion a majesty of intellect  he had an imagination that could present either grand or grotesque images to the mind with infinite clearness and force  he could lead or bewilder the judgment by strength of argument or by logical subtlety he could amuse the fancy by such pageants as she is fond of surveying  but i question if any poet or essayist ever existed with less power of exciting either tears or laughter with a total inability to catch or support the proper tone of any assumed character he appears to me among writers very like what a deformed giant would be in a company of players who might indeed appear on the stage in the parts of hamlet or benedick but would certainly not charm you with any dramatic illusion while you discovered under his theatrical disguise the highshouldered goliath an effect of this defective kind to use the quibble of polonius strikes me perpetually in rasselas i hardly ever hear a sentence uttered by the princess or the lady pekuah but i see the enormous johnson in petticoats   the archdeacon had rasselas been the production of a frenchman his country would have called it a noble poem  and surely distinguished as it is by liveliness of description by dignity of sentiment by elevation and purity of language we ought to esteem it as the work of a poetical imagination   the colonel i have already declared my opinion that the imagination of johnson was of the highest class it was indeed a diamond but like the rarity that i lately read an account of in that excellent physician and philosopher dr lewis it was a black diamond and malevolent melancholy was the foulness of the jewel to use the expression of the naturalist on which its black hue depended see lewiss philosophical commerce of arts p      you may tell me that we ought to treat this melancholy with tenderness because it was an hereditary misfortune in that point of view every person of common humanity must be inclined to pardon and to pity its effects but let not the quality which was an infirmity in the man be esteemed as a perfection in his works his rasselas like the greater part of his other composition leaves a heavy and uncomfortable gloom upon the mind you will tell me perhaps that the author wished to produce a very serious effect and that it constitutes a part of his superlative moral merit to have converted that idle or mischievous thing called a romance into a salutary book  it may be so  i can indeed conceive that the old proverb concerning meat and poison may be as true concerning books our intellectual food as it certainly is in regard to our ordinary diet there may be minds to whom the pompous and dark fictions of your moralist are both salutary and pleasant to me they are neither for instead of quickening my virtues they only communicate their own gloominess to my spirits  his imagination appears to me to resemble the chinese bird celebrated in that literary curiosity the praise of monkden by his poetical majesty of china the bird is called yuen its melancholy cry for it has no song is said to awaken the whirlwind and it flies only in the darkness of a tempestuous night   the archdeacon severely as you have treated johnson both as a poet and a novelist there is yet one character in which you must allow him to stand superior to every antagonist he was not indeed the greatest poet or the most interesting novelist that ever wrote but as a critic he has no equal his lives of the poets though not free from little defects and inclining perhaps to an excess of severity in a few articles yet contain a mass of criticism superior perhaps to all the united critical labors of the ancient and modern world different objections may be made to different parts but all voices conspire in celebrating the whole as the rich production of the most profound and acute understanding that was ever employed in the illustration of any single art   the colonel if barbarity can entitle a judge to preside over his brethren you are undoubtedly right in considering johnson as the prince of critics his criticism has to my apprehension all the excellencies and all the failings of his other composition it has all the powers that the head can give it has none of the charms that the heart only can supply if you examine his decisions on all our poets you will find that he ingeniously mingles as much malignity with his justice as the nature of his office would allow him to exert   the archdeacon this surely is a mistake you are angry with him for his sarcastic severity to a few of your favorites and therefore too hastily accuse him of malevolence and injustice toward the whole fraternity of poets  but if his censure is now and then acrimonious his praise in general is candid generous and magnificent  the lives taken altogether strike me as the most radiant crown of glory that poetic genius ever received from critical admiration   the colonel i believe i can point out to you some very dark flaws in the brilliants you admire but first answer me one question shall you not think the malevolence and i might add the absurdity of the critic sufficiently proved if in his characters of many poets i show you passages where the censure is not only too vehement but infinitely more applicable to his own writings than to the poet whom he is censuring   the archdeacon this i confess would abate my reverence for his judgment but i am persuaded you would not find it possible to collect such evidence as you describe   the colonel as it happens i have it ready to produce for being curious to convince myself how far his malignity to our poets extended i amused myself the other day in selecting such passages as appeared to confirm my idea here they are  let me read them to you in order and i think you will agree with me that they exhibit rather a strong resemblance of johnson himself than a fair delineation of the unfavourable features in our great english bards  i begin with a passage from his character of shakespeare  in tragedy his performance seems constantly to be worse as his labor is more whenever he solicits his invention or strains his faculties the offspring of his throes is tumor meanness tediousness and obscurity  in narration he affects a disproportionate pomp of diction and a wearisome train of circumlocution and tells the incident imperfectly in many words which might have been more plainly delivered in few  not that always where the language is intricate the thought is subtle or the image always great where the line is bulky the equality of words to things is very often neglected and trivial sentiments and vulgar ideas disappoint the attention to which they are recommended by sonorous epithets and swelling figures  he no sooner begins to move than he counteracts himself and terror and pity as they are rising in the mind are checked and blasted by sudden frigidity preface to shakespeare  well my good friend is not all this a thousand times more applicable to johnson himself than to shakespeare   the archdeacon i must confess it appears so but in the lives of the poets you can hardly have found any words so treacherously fitted to your purpose or contrive to make them recoil so cruelly on their author   the colonel you shall hear  and that i may not tire you i will omit many of the sentences in my list  but what say you to the following  the compositions are such as might have been written for penance by a hermit or for hire by a philosophical rhymer who had only heard of another sex life of cowley   this indeed is partly true of cowleys amorous poetry yet it strikes me as more exactly descriptive of johnsons various attempts to delineate female characters  the malignity of your critic toward milton fell rather on the man than the poet  and for this you know he has been very justly chastised there is a sanctity in the poetical character of milton which secured it against any gross violation from a person who piqued himself on his piety yet in his account of this religious bard your moralist has contrived to insert a few malevolent remarks infinitely more applicable to himself as an author than to the sublime and tender poet whom he detested  let me read you my evidence  milton never learned the art of doing little things with grace he overlooked the milder excellence of suavity and softness he was a lion that had no skill in dandling the kid  we read milton for instruction retire harrassed and overburthened and look elsewhere for recreation how egregiously false are these words as said of the poet how completely true when applied to johnson himself  the milder half of miltons merit this great critic had no feelings to perceive he could justly estimate the vigor of his imagination but he could not discover the tenderness of his heart which is exquisitely displayed in the character of eve  how perfectly has our divine poet caught the true tone of female nature in those simple beautiful and pathetic lines with which our lovely parent closes a speech in the  th book  adam shall share with me in bliss or woe so dear i love him that with him all deaths i could endure without him live no life how unfeeling must be the critic who could represent the author of such verses as utterly deficient in suavity and softness   the archdeacon his hatred and injustice to milton which arose from his political sentiments has you know been confessed and lamented by his friends  as a counterpoise to this defect let me remind you of the noble justice which he has done to dryden  his account of this extraordinary poet to whom pope has so justly and so pathetically applied the epithet unhappy is executed as the painters say con amore and strikes me as the masterpiece of our critical biographer   the colonel it is easy to account for this preeminence for in his whole list of poets there is no individual to whom the biographer bore so great a resemblance in the general cast of his mind in his political and i believe in his religious notions  from some of drydens failings indeed the critic was happily free and to some of his talents he has no pretension but that they resembled each other not a little in their mental features you will clearly discover by observing how exactly the following passages from his forcible and just character of dryden are descriptive of himself  the power that predominated in his intellectual operations was rather strong reason than quick sensibility upon all occasions that were presented he studied rather than felt and produced sentiments not such as nature enforces but meditation supplies he had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural that he did not esteem them in others simplicity gave him no pleasure  he could more easily fill the ear with some splendid novelty than awaken those ideas that slumber in the heart life of dryden    the archdeacon these passages are indeed applicable to johnson and so doubtless are many sentences of praise that we might discover in his biography one honorable metaphor at least let us apply to him out of the life from which you are quoting and alluding to the close of his admirable eulogy on dryden let us say of him that he found the english language a confused heap of loose stones and that he left them raised by his single labor into a noble edifice which amazes us by its magnificence and delights us by its utility   lady caroline i thank you my good friend for throwing in a little just commendation to temper the colonels severity  he seems i think to be engaged in a cruel kind of a process it is like the forcing a poor soldier to stand before the mouth of his own great gun and reluctantly blow himself to pieces   the colonel by no means if an engineer in levelling a cannon against those whom he ought to have spared manages it so ill as to hurt only himself by its recoil the fault is doubly his own and however maimed he may be he cannot be much entitled to compassion  now i think johnson exactly in this predicament and when you hear the following extracts i trust you will agree with me for brevitys sake i will confine myself to the lives of prior hammond collins and gray omitting several sentences in my collection  to make you an immediate convert my dear lady to the justice of my procedure i shall begin with the character of your beloved henry and emma  a dull and tedious dialogue which excites neither esteem for the man nor tenderness for the woman  every heart murmurs at the injustice of these words thus pointed against prior  but observe with what propriety we might write them dropping only two particles on the title page of irene and call that tragical homily dull and tedious dialogue which excites neither esteem for man nor tenderness for woman  but hear the fuller estimate of priors talents  as laws operate in civil agency not to the excitement of virtue but the repression of wickedness so judgment in the operations of intellect can hinder faults but not produce excellence  whatever prior obtains above mediocrity seems the effort of struggle and of toil he has many vigorous but few happy lines he has every thing by purchase and nothing by gift he had no nightly visitations of the muse no infusions of sentiment or felicities of fancy  his expression has every mark of laborious study the line seldom seems to have been formed at once the words did not come till they were called and were then put by constraint into their places where they do their duty but do it sullenly  in his greater compositions there may be found more rigid stateliness than graceful dignity his numbers are such as mere diligence may attain they seldom offend the ear and seldom sooth it they commonly want airiness lightness and facility what is smooth is not soft his verses always roll but they seldom flow priors life  there is a curious portrait for you if we knew not the painter might we not suppose that it was rather drawn for the stiff and pompous johnson himself than for the easy elegant and sportive prior  as to hammond johnson seems to have criticized him with the utmost rancour because he had been justly praised by chesterfield whom the splenetic savage seizes this opportunity to calumniate by representing him as commending the elegies of his departed friend without having read them  a charge not only absurd in itself but inconsistent with the idea which this rancorous critic entertained of the noble editors vanity since the earl is elegantly and justly complimented in the very poems which he is supposed to have praised without knowing their contents  i shall hope to convince you in the course of our conference that chesterfield was as good a judge of nature in poetry as johnson and that he had the talent of representing it more faithfully as an essayist than your great moralist himself  but let me now read the censure on hammond  these elegies have neither passion nature nor manners  again hammond has few sentiments drawn from nature and few images from modern life he produces nothing but frigid pedantry life of hammond  do you not admire this charge of pedantry against a poet remarkable for the easy elegance of his language from another who talks himself of arthritic tyranny in an ode to the spring  but to show you the difference between hammond and johnson as poets let me read you these two short extracts from each  what joy to hear the tempest howl in vain and clasp a fearful mistress to my breast or lulled to slumber by the beating rain secure and happy sink at last to rest what joy to wind along the cool retreat to stop and gaze on delia as i go to mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet and teach my lovely scholar all i know every man who has loved must perceive that in these verses though i have injured them by placing them together the passion of love is expressed with delicacy spirit and truth now hear how johnson closes one of those curious compositions that he calls odes  haste press the clusters fill the bowl apollo shoot thy parting ray this gives the sunshine of the soul this god of health and verse and day still still the jocund strain shall flow the pulse with vigorous rapture beat my stella with new charms shall glow and every bliss in wine shall meet johnsons autumn an ode  to say press the clusters is an odd mode of calling for wine  but i quote the passage to show the tenderness of the poet to his stella put the sentiment into plain prose and it runs thus  come let us get half drunk my dear stella and i shall then think you beautiful and myself happy   lady caroline this is playing the barbarous critical tyrant indeed you outherod herod  but pray proceed to your extract from the life of collins which i do not perfectly recollect i only remember that the critic mentions his personal intimacy with the poet and i should therefore imagine he must speak of his interesting compositions with an affectionate enthusiasm sufficient to defeat your hostile purpose of turning the heavy fire of his critical battery against himself   the colonel oh your great critic had too elevated and too stately a mind to be touched by the partialities of friendship hear how he closes a character of the poet written when we might suppose his tenderness to be quickened by the recent death of his friend  this idea which he had formed of excellence led him to oriental fictions and allegorical imagery and perhaps while he was intent upon description he did not sufficiently cultivate sentiment his poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire nor unfurnished with knowledge either of books or life but somewhat obstructed in its progress by deviation in quest of mistaken beauties life of collins   no one i believe can think the critic spoke too kindly of collins in this early character  yet as if his judgment had been warped by affection in the subsequent life which was not written you know till an interval of many years had allowed time enough for his extreme tenderness to evaporate he added the following censure on the language of his poetical friend  his diction was often harsh unskilfully labored and injudiciously selected he affected the obsolete when it was not worthy of revival and he puts his words out of the common order seeming to think with some later candidates for fame that not to write prose is certainly to write poetry his lines commonly are of slow motion clogged and impeded with clusters of consonants as men are often esteemed who cannot be loved so the poetry of collins may sometimes extort praise when it gives little pleasure life of collins   now to my apprehension every syllable in both these extracts is infinitely more suited to johnson than to his injured friend the greater part of whose poetry as langhorne has justly said of his ode on the death of colonel ross is replete with harmony spirit and pathos  but i hasten to the last article on my list  the insulted gray you are both of you so well acquainted with the critics extreme iniquity toward this enchanting bard that i will only read a single short passage from those i have selected  the images are magnified by affectation the language is labored into harshness the mind of the writer seems to work with unnatural violence double double toil and trouble he has a kind of strutting dignity and is tall by walking on tiptoe his art and his struggle are too visible and there is too little appearance of ease or nature life of gray   tell me i beseech you to whose writings may we most properly apply this exaggerated description to those of gray or of johnson to me it appears to hit the tumid rambler himself so forcibly that if any man were to attempt a small but strong caricatura of johnson as an author i question if he could produce one with so striking a resemblance as this very paragraph exhibits  and now my good friend ingenuously say have i not convinced you that johnson in passing sentence on our great poets instead of fairly representing their petty failings has frequently delineated his own heavier defects and ascribed them to spirits of a higher class to whom they could not belong   the archdeacon you have i must own convinced me that he was frequently unjust but i am still inclined to impute that injustice rather to the keenness and strength than to the malignity of his mind i am persuaded he always spoke as he felt but he felt blemishes too forcibly from the rigid integrity of his acute understanding whenever he blames i believe you may discover some little foundation for his censure but he builds perhaps too large a structure on too trifling a basis i cannot better explain to you my idea on this point than by applying to him a lively couplet of dr young  his judgment just his sentence over strong because he is right he is ever in the wrong  the colonel very well  if you acknowledge him to be in the wrong i will allow you to estimate as you please the moral rectitude of his perceptions my own idea of him as a critic is this  his ill nature or if you wish for a softer expression his spleen had i think a microscopic eye which whenever it happened to glance on a freckle in the face of any luckless muse immediately made it a cancer   the archdeacon if as a critic he was too severe his severity may still produce a very useful effect on the trifling vagrants of parnassus by exciting them to think with more energy and let me add he has one critical merit which deserves the highest commendation i mean the merit of having rescued the dramatic muse from those oppressive and threefold fetters the unities  the demolition of a perplexing poetical superstition which had been sanctified by the reverence of ages was the work of a noble understanding very worthily employed and a work that ought to endear his name to every lover of the stage   the colonel i heartily join with you in this applause though in general i have little veneration for your philosopher in his critical capacity it is sir henry wotton i think who has called critics the brushers of noblemens clothes and if his metaphor is just we may say that johnson like a heavyhanded valet has executed this office with such vehemence as fretted to pieces the fine raiment of his masters   the archdeacon indeed you are too severe  but how great soever you may represent the mistakes of johnson in points that belong solely to taste and sentiment on which perhaps we could hardly find any two minds in perfect unison the great and solid portion of his merit must still remain entire he strikes me like a venerable oak which though it may discover a few blighted leaves and a little dead wood perhaps in the extremity of its branches has a noble sound trunk of the most valuable texture the world surely owes no little respect to a writer who not only labored for many years with great sincerity and fervor to improve their morals but exerted his rare faculties for that purpose with such constant rectitude of mind with such uncommon chastity of thought and expression that i question if his numerous works contain a single word or allusion which the most modest female would blush to read in the presence of a parent or a lover   the colonel then you must think our fair president here a very squeamish lady my good friend for she told us you know that she was often disgusted both by chesterfield and johnson   the archdeacon you are a very treacherous antagonist in attempting to injure me so barbarously in the opinion of our judge  but the equity of lady caroline is not to be corrupted or misled she will clearly perceive that you draw a very unwarrantable inference from what i advanced indelicacy is not the only offense in a writer by which a lady can be disgusted as far as lord chesterfield is concerned i can indeed believe that this offense was alluded to for your dainty refiner of our manners abounds i think in such indelicate images as are most likely to disgust a mind so pure as that in question but whenever lady caroline was disgusted by johnson it was i am convinced by a defect very different from indelicacy yet a defect of which she is equally qualified to judge  i mean his critical injustice   the colonel she is not sufficiently honest or i should rather say she is too delicate herself to confess and demonstrate to you the contrary but i will on this occasion be her interpreter  there is undoubtedly a great degree of such purity as you have justly praised in the writings of johnson yet immaculate as you think him i can show you a sentence in his biography which is perhaps both the most cruel and the most indecent sentence that ever fell from the pen of a serious writer and i am persuaded this very passage was in my sisters thoughts when she made use of the word disgusted   the archdeacon you have awakened my curiosity pray indulge me with an explanation of what you allude to for i cannot even guess at the passage   the colonel here it is in the volume that lies open before us  it relates to the unfortunate lady so pathetically lamented by pope  you remember her history i will only read the biographers observation upon it  from this account given with evident intention to raise the ladys character it does not appear that she had any claim to praise nor much to compassion she seems to have been impatient violent and ungovernable her uncles power could not have lasted long the hour of liberty and choice would have come in time but her desires were too hot for delay and she liked selfmurder better than suspense what say you my good friend to the close of this paragraph  i doubt it the pen of aretine himself ever delineated the rage of incontinence with grosser or more disgusting energy  there is a savage barbarity to my feelings in this passage that i want words to express it brings to my fancy the image of a cannibal who in finding the corse of an unhappy selfslaughtered girl instead of breathing over it a natural sigh of compassion tears the hapless body to pieces with a ferocious sarcastic insult on the poor unfortunate being who in a fit of distraction had made herself his prey your great moralist is the more inexcusable in this case because the unfortunate lady instead of being so outrageously eager to gratify her desires appears i think to have been a tender penitent not immured in a convent by the tyranny of a relation but a voluntary recluse who wished perhaps but found herself unable to atone for past frailties by a long perseverance in solitude and prayer   the archdeacon the late accounts that we have all read of this unfortunate lady are very far from agreeing with your description   the colonel i know it but i put no trust in the petty tales which are so confidently recorded by the chroniclers of every idle hearsay i cannot indeed perfectly vouch for the truth of my description but i can show you it has the coloring of probability you may recollect pope himself tells us in a note to his pathetic elegy that the lady was the same person to whom the duke of buckingham had addressed a copy of verses on her design of retiring into a monastery i will endeavor to repeat to you a few lines of the dukes poetry and luckily for his graces poetical credit and my recollection the lines i am trying to remember are the best in the poem  o i have just recovered enough for my argument  the duke describes a tender enchanting mistress on the point of tearing herself from the arms of her happy lover in a sudden gust of devotion and proceeds thus  and after all our vows our sighs our tears my banished sorrows and your conquered fears so many doubts so many dangers past visions of zeal must vanquish me at last such are the grounds on which i represented this hapless fair as a distracted penitent instead of an outrageous wanton and if you consider the force of the passionate verses i have quoted you will surely allow that my conjecture is more specious at least than the improbable story that she was in love with pope at all events the biographer has treated her barbarously  i have heard that he was entreated to cancel the passage while the proof sheets were before him on account of its indecency and its injustice but that he persisted in his savage resolve to stigmatize the unfortunate lady that he might not lose an opportunity of showing how truly he abhorred the crime of suicide to the verge of which his own melancholy i believe had often conducted him   the archdeacon i thank you heartily for this anecdote i never heard any thing in my life i never read any thing of this nervous this sublime author that impressed me with so forcible so grand an idea of his magnanimous morality i now see johnson in all his glory determined to exert his rare faculties for the real good of his fellow creatures with a noble a divine indifference to their applause and their abuse   the colonel what can you burst into a rapturous panegyric on his brutality   the archdeacon brutality my good friend let us give a juster name to qualities that do honor to mankind i grant you every thing you can wish as to the severe and gross appearance of the passage you condemn i will allow you it is a sentence at which the cheek of a truly virtuous woman may turn crimson not only from wounded modesty but from an honest womanly indignation in beholding so hideous a caricatura of female tenderness but all these tremendous objections against it tend only to increase my reverence for the writer and why because i clearly perceive all the generous ideas that led him to write and to persevere in maintaining the passage  let us only examine the thoughts that must have passed in his mind on that occasion he must have thought in this manner i have written a sentence that is said to violate the elaborate purity of my moral compositions a sentence over which envy and malevolence will exult and at which decency herself may be disgusted  but i know by what insidious steps the demon of melancholy may lead a poor idle girl whose affections perhaps are wisely thwarted to the precipice of suicide  if her piety will not save her yet her pride may be rendered the instrument of her preservation  i may resemble the ancient legislators who to stop the contagious passion for this crime among the women of their city exposed the naked body of the selfmurdered female the sentence objected to may check some unhappy woman on the verge of suicide by showing her how gross an interpretation the crime she meditates may receive  let the delicacy of millions be offended if i can save but the life of one  what are censure and applause to a writer when put in the scale against such a possibility  my heart tells me they are dust in the balance  so he reasoned so he acted and we ought to revere the heroical benevolence and dignity of his decision   the colonel nobly argued my good friend  i read in the countenance of the lady that in this article you have made converts of us both  but i am astonished to find by the progress of the sun how our morning has slipped away  it grieves me to break up the conference but i have some necessary letters to dispatch by the post of today   lady caroline what are you really going brother and do you mean to abandon the defense of your favorite chesterfield   the archdeacon madam the colonel is aware that on many occasions and i believe in the present a masterly retreat may be more honorable than a victory   the colonel do not say so  you shall not find it so lady caroline well then let me make one request to you both  that we may not say a syllable more either on chesterfield or johnson till we are quietly settled again in this room tomorrow   the colonel i am much obliged to you for the idea for in truth i should appear a miserable advocate for the accomplished earl whose memory i am to vindicate if i had not a little time allowed me to bring his cruelly mangled character to your compassionate contemplation  this i trust i shall be able to do tomorrow  then will i speak right on  i will tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet stanhopes wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of stanhope that should move the books around us here to rise and speak  dialogue ii lady caroline well my dear advocate for the noble delinquent whom we are bringing to the bar i may presume you are fully prepared to answer the heavy charges against him since you seem to have got a collection of memorandums as copious as a lawyers brief   the colonel pray do not discountenance by your cruel raillery a poor unpractised pleader whose apparatus is only in proportion to his want of talents and experience   lady caroline i am glad to find that you enter with so much modesty on an office so daring as the defense of licentiousness for the good archdeacon and i have been in some fear lest your quick imagination should inflame itself into a dangerous partiality to a character that your judgment cannot esteem  he justly observes that too warm an apology for vice may imperceptibly injure an honest mind by diminishing its due reverence for virtue and he has just pointed out to me an excellent paragraph in his favorite rambler which tells us how culpable they are who have used the light imparted from heaven only to embellish folly and shed luster upon crimes   the colonel you are good creatures to be so kindly solicitous for the preservation of that little rectitude of mind which has fallen to my lot but i trust your generous apprehension will subside when you recollect the nature of the points that i have undertaken to maintain  i have by no means engaged to exalt my lord chesterfield into a model of moral excellence but i ventured to say yesterday what i am now still more inclined and i flatter myself more able to support  that with splendid and engaing talents he had neither more nor worse vices than your pompous philosopher and that he is equally entitled to the kind remembrance of his country this i think is an innocent and just assertion that to every unprejudiced mind may be rendered as evident as it is that to govern an unquiet kingdom as a temporary viceroy with dignity and to be uncommonly clear in that great office requires as much ability and as much virtue as are requisite to write a tumid moral essay or to compile an elaborate treasury of words   the archdeacon i might reply to your sarcastic mode of entering on this comparison by an allusion to the compliment paid to titian by the emperor charles the vth i might tell you that the king can make many lord lieutenants but not a single johnson   the colonel i believe the creative influence of regal power could much sooner make a johnson than a chesterfield the command of a prince can indeed produce elaborate language and ambitious morality but genuine wit and sportive urbanity are so far from being creatible if i may create a word by the will of a monarch that they very rarely condescend to appear in his presence perhaps they never appeared at court to so much advantage as in the character of chesterfield i question if they were ever united to more political integrity and how happily they may sometimes accomplish the irksome business of graver argument we have a pleasant instance in the anecdote of the noble lords prevailing on the king to fill up a commission with a name which he had rejected with detestation it was in      when the earl was secretary of state i had rather have the devil said the angry sovereign when pressed to confirm the appointment in question with all my heart said the lively secretary who was waiting ready to fill up the instrument for the royal signature i only beg leave to remind your majesty that the commission is indicted to our right trusty and right wellbeloved cousin the king you know laughed and complied with the wishes of his minister   the archdeacon your story is a good example of pleasantry welltimed i will not say what i know many people think that a few lucky strokes of confident vivacity induced the world to deem much higher of his lordships wit than it really deserved but giving him full credit as a true proprietor of this graceful feather i must not allow you to consider it as equivalent to the more solid treasures of johnsons moral wisdom and virtue   the colonel nor can i permit you my dear and respected opponent to assume as incontestible an opinion which some honest people indeed have assumed too hastily  that johnson was a compound of every thing that is morally good and chesterfield of every thing that is morally evil  if i can show you that the accomplished earl had in truth as much wisdom and virtue as the arrogant philosopher with his own rich inheritance of native wit into the bargain you must certainly allow him to be the more admirable character of the two that he was indeed neither less wise nor less virtuous than johnson is sufficiently evident to me from a little survey that i have taken of what i may call the morning and the evening in the lives of each  let me set the two men before you for an instant in those striking periods of their existence at the age of thirty a season when the first whirlwind of the passions has subsided and the mind of man begins to assume a settled temperature how do we find johnson employed why truly in writing a rebellious pamphlet which his very biographer represents as mean in its execution and detestable in its design  now let me direct your eyes to chesterfield at the same age  what was the noble lord doing at thirty in this year of his life i find him giving an early example of that generous integrity which he maintained through every stage of his political career  and politely rejecting the advice of those who recommended it to him to increase the profits of a post that he had just accepted by selling the subordinate places in his disposal you may tell me perhaps that such an early comparison of the two men in a point of political purity considering the difference of their birth and station is neither candid nor just let us look then at the two veterans when each was turned of seventy when both were preparing to quit the stage of life the philosopher weary of having instructed the world and the wit of having enlivened it at such a season if the philosopher had indeed been a man of sound wisdom and virtue we might expect to find him calmly and cheerfully looking forward to an immortal reward for the benefits which his labor had bestowed upon mankind and if the gayer life of the wit had in truth been a mere tissue of vice and folly we might expect also to behold him at this important season sinking under the dread of a tremendous retribution now are these the respective conditions in which we may actually contemplate these two opposite but illustrious old men no it is just the reverse we see the imperious philosopher looking back with remorse looking forward with consternation and strangely converting a justice of peace into a confessor to tell him more secret transgressions than he was willing to hear  now take a view of the superannuated wit so unjustly suspected of a settled depravity in heart and spirit we find him and i beg you will observe the contrast soothing the ills of departing life and particularly that most depressive affliction his long and incurable deafness by pouring out all his manly and natural feelings in letters of the most tender friendship to a venerable prelate  a prelate who was long his bosomfriend whom he had raised in a generous manner that did himself singular honor to episcopal dignity and who to his own credit and to that of his noble patron was distinguished by the glorious appellation of the good bishop  it was thus that johnson and chesterfield first appeared on our clamorous theater of the world and it was thus they quitted it they are now gone to their great audit before the judge of every heart who alone perhaps can truly decide which was indeed the man of most wisdom and virtue as far as their own books and the printed accounts of both can enable my limited faculties to form a just estimate of the two characters i declare and i entreat you not to condemn me too hastily for my declaration that were i acting under heaven as a judge to decide the merits of the two i should rather give the palm of virtue to chesterfield than to johnson   lady caroline our good friend i perceive is amazed and shocked by the singularity and confidence of your opinion  and even i who know you better must confess myself a little surprised at your carrying your partiality so far  i thought you would have contented yourself with an as wise and as good a kind of handinhand comparison as shakespeare says but your bestowing the palm of goodness on a character universally condemned for immorality is a stroke of whimsical enthusiasm that i did not expect  let me remind you however that we are departing from the plan we proposed to ourselves in this amicable debate pray recollect that the archdeacon is first to state all the flagrant and numerous defects in your too engaging favorite and then you are to conclude not with his apology i find but his panegyric   the archdeacon as the colonel discovers so much zeal in the cause i beg that we may allow him to conduct the defense he has undertaken in any mode that he chooses you and i my dear lady are at a time of life to be amused instead of corrupted by the magic of delusive eloquence however subtle it may be and for my own part i am highly entertained in observing with what acute ingenuity a very upright and religious mind when under the influence of affectionate prejudice can decorate a favorite though faulty character our honest enthusiast has undoubtedly deceived himself and he has i am persuaded sufficient talents to communicate that deception to others during the moment when he is speaking yet were he speaking to the world at large on this topic i should be under no apprehension of his reversing the just decree of the public on the two characters in question and for this short and simple reason  the public however dazzled by my oratorical friend would soon recollect the infallible test it possesses to decide the real merits of both and wisely say to itself by their works we may know them  the philosopher however tainted by personal defects has bequeathed to us an invaluable legacy of the sublimest moral instruction and the wit however decorated by personal dignities has left us little more than an elegant manual of profligate advice so improperly addressed by a parent to his child that it has justly excited a general murmur of abhorrence   the colonel surely my good friend you are speaking only to try my temper you cannot i am confident you cannot have seriously adopted the cruel absurdity of the world concerning the letters you allude to o that i possessed indeed that divine talent of eloquence which your laughingly ascribe to me and for which i am so little fashioned by nature or education were i really master of that enchanting power i hardly know a subject on which i should more delight to employ it than in doing justice to a man who deserved so highly of this nation and whose character has been so basely degraded  we talk of the frequent cruelty and injustice of athens to the virtue that defended her walls and to the talents that immortalized her glory but i question if ever any meritorious athenian ever experienced such posthumous ingratitude if i may use such an expression from his capricious fellowcitizens as chesterfield has received from us let me remind you that he was justly esteemed for half a century as one of the most accomplished characters in this kingdom he served his country as an ambassador in holland and made the purest characters of that republic his friends he served his country as a governor of ireland at a period of great difficulty and danger and his virtues appeared to expand with his power he served his country as a minister at home and nobly quitted his place the moment he found it inconsistent with his integrity and honor he resigned not to indulge himself in factious turbulence but in literary retirement study and conversation were indeed among his favorite amusements at every season of life for the native cast of his character was rather gentle than vehement and he opposed his enemies rather with gaiety than rancour in the course of a busy and splendid life he found time to write a few periodical lessons on life and manners in which he equalled the first authors in that branch of literature and having sufficiently proved his taste by his own admirable productions he was universally regarded as the most accomplished patron of letters his manners and his wit were so engaging that he was long esteemed the chief ornament and delight of society and the eminent characters of every country in europe appeared ambitious of his acquaintance and regard his latter days were embittered with many bodily infirmities which he supported however with a cheerful and religious philosophy in considering this life as a fugitive dream that he did not wish to renew and in thinking of his creator as he tells his bosomfriend the good bishop of waterford with more hope than fear  so lived and so died the earl of chesterfield respected by the world and idolized by his friends  but a lady who had great reason to think well of the noble lord seized the opportunity of his decease to publish a collection of letters written for a very private and very particular purpose she knew that they had been dictated by the parental tenderness of a good heart and she did not foresee that the public could ingeniously misinterpret them so far as to call them the suggestions of an evil spirit but as there is a constant eagerness in mankind to seize even the slightest opportunity of degrading an exalted name as soon as these letters were published an outcry was raised against them by many hypocritical pretenders to goodness and by many truly good people who wanted either faculties or patience to form a fair estimate of their author malevolent ridicule scattered her gibes on the father so solicitously striving to improve the awkward person of his child and mistaken piety represented him as a prodigy of wickedness laboring to infuse all his own follies and vices into his offspring and to establish a corrupt system of education that would annihilate all the virtue of our country but after all what is this masterpiece of profligacy when examined by truth and candor it is a singular and in many points the most admirable monument of paternal tenderness and anxiety that the literature of any nation can exhibit it is a work that instead of corrupting our sons may rather stimulate their parents to a quicker sense of their duty by showing us that a man in all the tumultuous bustle of busy of gay and of splendid life could find time to labor with incessant attention in trying to counteract the peculiar personal imperfections of a dear though awkward son  o chesterfield i have read thee with the eyes of a father anxious not only for the temporal but the eternal interest of his children and my heart tells me that in the sight of our great allseeing parent the work for which thou art vilified on earth must have more of merit than of sin   the archdeacon though every thing may be hoped from the mercy of the supreme judge i cannot see how the common justice of mankind can absolve a parent who even instigates his son to indulge himself in crimes that are eminently pernicious to the peace and happiness of the world   the colonel is it candid is it just or i should rather say is it not the height of iniquitous cruelty to give so dark an interpretation to idle raillery in a familiar letter which like the jests of private conversation should be considered only as the idle pleasantry of the moment  to defend licentiousness by saying it was recommended only in a country whose customs appeared to give it a sanction is an argument which though it may extenuate the offense is far from being according to my ideas the best vindicacation that we may urge for the noble lord  all the immoral advice of chesterfield may be compared to a drug which though it is rank poison if swallowed indiscriminately by the multitude may operate as an innocent and useful medicine to a particular patient  the disease of young stanhope to pursue the metaphor was awkwardness in the extreme and gallantry was the prescription of chesterfield by giving his son credit in these private letters for more influence over the fair than he was formed to attain the father might mean no more than to lead him frequently into such female society as had the best chance of rendering him less an object of ridicule immorality of this kind we hear every day in the sportive sallies of conversation between parents and children where no real act of licentiousness is intended and where no censure falls on the jesting preacher of very similar doctrine  it is particularly cruel to give the darkest interpretation to the licentious levity of these motley letters when the same correspondence affords us many serious passages of the purest morality  there is a double injustice in the common censure on these admirable letters  they are condemned as a general system when they were expressly designed to correct the particular blemishes of an individual  they are condemned for not speaking more of morality and religion when the author informs us he had intentionally left those points to a worthy delegate yet that he touched upon them sometimes and did it with all the affecting energy of a father truly anxious for the moral excellence of his son i hope to convince you by reading the few following extracts  pray observe with what honest and serious warmth this supposed advocate for vice exhorts his young disciple to the most scrupulous integrity  your moral character must be not only pure but like caesars wife unsuspected the least speck or blemish upon it is fatal nothing degrades and vilifies more for it excites and unites detestation and contempt there are however wretches in the world profligate enough to explode all notions of moral good and evil to maintain that they are merely local and depend entirely upon the customs and fashions of different countries nay there are still if possible more unaccountable wretches i mean those who affect to preach and propagate such absurd and infamous notions without believing them themselves these are the devils hypocrites avoid as much as possible the company of such people who reflect a degree of discredit and infamy upon all who converse with them but as you may sometimes by accident fall into such company take great care that no complaisance no good humor no warmth of festal mirth ever make you seem even to acquiesce much less to approve or applaud such infamous doctrines chesterfields letters to his son letter   0  can the most rigid moralist that ever existed surpass the rectitude and the fervency of these admonitions  not delivered indeed with the bloated affectation of pompous and pointed sentences but breathing the tenderness and the warmth of a pure parental spirit  the ladies in their laudable zeal for the honor of their sex are angry with chesterfield for representing them as unable to keep a secret but they forget the great object he had in view it was to form a minister for foreign courts and his caution therefore on this article was only guarding his son against those insinuating enemies to which an ambassador is particularly exposed  the noble author is accused of preferring manners to morals i entreat you to hear how justly he maintains in the following passage the preeminence of the latter  good manners are to particular societies what good morals are to society in general their cement and their security  and as laws are enacted to enforce good morals or at least to prevent the ill effects of bad ones so there are certain rules of civility universally implied and received to enforce good manners and punish bad ones and indeed there seems to me to be less difference both between the crimes and the punishments than at first one would imagine the immoral man who invades another mans property is justly hanged for it and the illbred man who by his ill manners invades and disturbs the quiet and comforts of private life is by common consent as justly banished society mutual complaisances attentions and sacrifices of little conveniences are as natural an implied compact between civilized people as protection and obedience are between kings and subjects whoever in either case violates that compact justly forfeits all advantages arising from it for my own part i really think that next to the consciousness of doing a good action that of doing a civil one is the most pleasing and the epithet which i should covet the most next to that of aristides would be that of wellbred letter      again in the close of the same letter be convinced that goodbreeding is to all worldly qualifications what charity is to all christian virtues  can any preceptor my good friend exhibit sounder sentiments than these either as to exterior accomplishment or internal perfection   the archdeacon like a skilful advocate you have shown us the fair side of your client but had his book been entirely of this complexion its purity had never been impeached i believe we might oppose to your quotations innumerable passages of an opposite tendency but as i must confess i have not looked into this manual of politeness for several years i shall not attempt to enforce my general charge against it especially as you have answered that charge by a palliating argument which though it would hardly support any severe scrutiny is i am persuaded so sufficiently conclusive to your partial goodnature that i should despair of converting you   lady caroline you seem perfectly aware of my brothers foible which is a generous propensity to think every writer virtuous who displays the particular talents that afford him the highest pleasure you might have found him the other day as warmly engaged in defending the moral character of stern   the colonel pardon me i only said that if stern was in truth the sorry character which many austere people affect to call him i supposed he was prompted to write by his good genius that in the register of the recording angel the merits of the author might counterbalance all the sins of the man   the archdeacon yet you know that many human inquisitors have rather classed his writings in the catalogue of his transgressions   the colonel yes and i am perfectly aware that your splenetic moralist was one of those inquisitors but i can never subscribe to the severe sentence of a judge when every fiber in my head and heart assure me of his iniquity  there are glaring defects in the compositions of stern but the general effect of them is meritorious in the highest degree all the elaborate all the ostentatiously moral volumes of johnson can never impress on my mind such fervent sentiments of reverential gratitude to heaven or of good will to earth as i receive from a few pages of the incomparable stern  perhaps no author ever possessed in so high a degree the inestimable talent of putting the untuned spirit into harmony with itself and with all around it if i take him up in a restless or gloomy fit he not only chaces from my mind every vestige of spleen but leaves in its place a disposition to cheerful piety and active benevolence   lady caroline you have utterly forgot my dear rambling enthusiast the noble lord whose real or imaginary perfections you were to state to us though i fancy from the appearance of the paper in your hand you have many more remarks to communicate for the illustration of his character   the colonel thanks sweet remembrancer let me look at my references for a moment and i will proceed in due order we proposed to compare chesterfield and johnson in three different lights first as men or citizens secondly as periodical lecturers on life and manners and lastly as writers in point of style  since i find the archdeacon is too candid in his own sentiments or too indulgent to my opinion of the party i am defending to dwell with great vehemence on the charge against my client i shall conclude my desultory pleading by a few brief observations arranged under the three heads i have mentioned requesting my worthy friend to correct me where i am grossly mistaken and i shall then entreat your ladyship to favor us with your frank and genuine sentiments on the two characters in question  i shall begin with pointing out to you a very striking difference between chesterfield and johnson in an article which i consider as a great test of an amiable heart i mean friendship from the letters of the noble lord to the bishop of waterford and mr dayrolles it is evident that he took the most lively interest in all the concerns of those two valuable men  indebted as they both were to his patronage and inferior to him in talents he never speaks to them in a tone of superiority but upon every occasion as a sincere and sympathetic friend pray observe from the following passage in this correspondence how the supposed advocate for universal licentiousness in youth speaks to those he loved on the education of their children  a fathers care of his sons morals and manners is surely more useful than the critical knowledge of homer and virgil supposing that it were which it very seldom is acquired at schools i do not therefore hesitate to advise you to put your son to the best school that is the nearest to your usual place of residence that you may see and examine him often and strictly and watch his progress not only in learning but in morals and manners instead of trusting to interested accounts of distant schoolmasters twelfth letter to the bishop of waterford  but my esteem for chesterfield in this point of view is principally founded on his character of his bosom friend my lord scarborough one of the most beautiful and pathetic portraits of an amiable but unhappy mind that was ever delineated by truth and tenderness so very beautiful that i think no one can read the composition short as it is without saying of its author this man had indeed a heart for friendship and the talent of describing those he loved in the genuine language of nature  now turn to johnson  in all his elaborate volumes you discover no vestiges of his having enjoyed the inestimable blessing of true cordial friendship no marks of that fond and amiable gratitude which has induced so many great authors to delineate and immortalize the persons who contributed to their happiness or their glory  it has been observed that he never prefixed a dedication to any one of his various works a circumstance that argues to my apprehension not so much an independent as a proud unfeeling and surly spirit for though dedications have too often consisted of base flattery to opulence and grandeur they have frequently appeared as pleasing and graceful offerings to friendship and sometimes as a proper tribute to particular stations it is i think with equal malevolence and injustice that johnson accuses addison of servile absurdity in dedicating his opera of rosamond to the duchess of marlborough as the poet had exhibited in a prophetic scene of his drama the very mansion of which the just liberality of the kingdom had made this lady the mistress his inscribing the opera to her was surely an act of blameless and becoming civility this indeed is not the only instance of johnsons malignity to addison an author whose life whose writings and whose death exhibit such abundance of the purest merit that i can hardly think the man a true and perfect lover of genius or virtue who speaks of him in gross terms of sarcastic contempt  but to return to the article that i was speaking of  had johnson possessed a heart for friendship he must have enjoyed all the reciprocal delights and advantages of that blessing in his long connection with garrick  they had set out hand in hand to make their way together through the chances of a world to which they were equally strangers and had jointly borrowed five pounds in a moment of mutual distress on the credit of the future comedian such a circumstance was almost sufficient in itself to have made them sincere friends for ever had their souls been of the true friendly temper as there seem to be few bonds of union more lasting among men than that of having passed through early hardships together in my own profession i have seen the force of this cement among our soldiers very wonderfully exemplified but there were other considerations that might have made johnson a cordial friend to garrick their talents were of so different a nature that no rivalship could exist between them and accordingly we find garrick who was apt indeed to be alarmed at every shadow of a rival in his profession was ever ready to bestow the most hearty applause on the real merits of his old associate patient under his dogmatical asperity and indulgent to his humor he almost revered and obeyed him as a parent yet the splenetic savage unsoftened by this filial homage had the barbarity to mortify this bosomfriend of his early and indigent days by excluding him from a little club to which he sued for admission this single anecdote of johnson is sufficient in my opinion to mark him for a brute   the archdeacon you are running again my good friend into an excess of severity you forget that garrick had his failings as well as johnson perhaps greater failings without an equal counterpoise of perfection by talents of a class far inferior to those of the philosopher he had risen to the intoxicating joys of opulent splendour and is said you know to have insulted by an ostentatious display of his magnificence his less fortunate old friend who like many other laborious men of letters had been a drudge for years without raising a competence for the decline of life for my own part i never think of these two extraordinary men without lamenting in my heart that they so little exerted the great powers which they both possessed of contributing to the happiness and to the glory of each other you know my friend that although i am in some points as lady caroline calls me an idolater of johnson i am far from adopting his gloomy ideas of human life on the contrary i think our earth which is often a pleasant habitation as it is would be for some years a delightful residence indeed if every man seized the opportunity of doing the noble things within his faculties to accomplish without indulging any malevolent or narrowminded ideas  for instance had garrick possessed a great soul how happily might he have rescued his old friend from debasing himself in the eyes of many by the acceptance of that pension to which he had hastily annexed in his dictionary so odious a definition how well might garrick have spared from his ample revenue an annuity of equal value and how much would it have added to his reputation and delight if he had employed a part of that wealth which he derived from the partial liberality of the public in securing independence not only to the friend of his youth but to a mighty genius who from the peculiar infelicities that belong to authorship could hardly earn more than his daily bread by such exertions of intellect as do honor to his country   the colonel had garrick possessed the princely spirit to confer such a benefit which at times i believe he really did your splenetic philosopher had too much pride to accept it  though i perfectly agree with you in thinking it more pleasant and more honorable to receive the blessing of independence from the bounty of a friend than from the pension of a sovereign however gracious to whose family and title the heart of the pensioner was known to have been a rebel   lady caroline you amaze me my dear disputants by agreeing in a point where i differ so widely from you both that i cannot refrain from an immediate declaration of my dissent  surely to have accepted so large a gratuity from a subject however exalted must have been utterly inconsistent with the dignity of johnson in receiving a pension from a sovereign who has frequently shown a disposition to correct the injustice of fortune toward literary genius he had the sanction of custom and of propriety in his favor   the colonel as this is a point that depends chiefly on delicacy of feeling you are probably in the right though i confess i cannot agree with you  but allow me to resume my argument it is clear that johnson did not love garrick though he had many reasons to do so and it is equally clear that the incurable envy of your moral philosopher was the cause i want no additional proof that he was utterly unfit for true lasting friendship the friends of an envious man can have no security for the continuance of his regard but their own insignificance if they happen by any successful talents to improve their title to his affection they will inevitably lose it  an attempt to maintain a friendship with an envious character will probably produce a disappointment very similar to what was lately felt by a naturalist of my acquaintance who intending to preserve a favorite rarity in a bottle of pure spirits found it put by mistake into a vessel of aqua fortis which annihilated the treasure that it was expected to preserve   the archdeacon the force and aptitude of your simile is a full vindication of my philosopher for while i agree with you that envy is in truth a corrosive of power sufficient to annihilate friendship i must observe that the long intimacy which johnson enjoyed with many respectable and celebrated names is a proof that if he was not perfectly exempt from this defect its existence only added to the triumphs of his virtue   the colonel i cannot agree with you in your conclusion for i find no public traces of his having praised the names you allude to in the language of perfect affection and surely those who have exhibited his character to the world rather speak of him as a prodigy they admired than as a friend they loved he was in truth so great a prodigy both in his faculties and his failings that i hardly think it possible for any man to have contracted an intimacy with him much superior to the kind of friendship that subsists between a showman and the lion that he exhibits indeed it has been observed that the favorite and most adroit leader of the monster who ventured to sport with him most familiarly could not always withdraw himself from his paw without severe laceration   the archdeacon the preference that your fancy gives to chesterfield against johnson seems founded on your idea of your favourites companionable attractions yet surely if the merits of the men might be fairly estimated by their powers of amusing a companion the earl could not triumph on this ground for i apprehend his conversation if compared to that of johnson was like the soothing murmur of a rill compared to the majestic roar of a torrent  as to mirth no witty repartee of the noble lord could more happily excite surprise and laughter than the lively sallies of johnson both in prose and verse  but your imagination is so much haunted by ideas of his ferocity that you neither do justice to his wit nor to the acknowledged tenderness of his heart  which was so singularly humane that i believe no author of his eminence ever afforded so much literary assistance to those who implored it persons who have been distinguished by the public display of any talent are apt in general to entertain an important suspicious dread of debasing their dignity by condescending to employ themselves in any petty work for a benevolent purpose  from this frequent and ridiculous foible the great humanity of johnson completely exempted him whenever solicited by distress he was ready you know to contribute either a prologue or a petition   the colonel do not suppose me so blind or so unjust as not to perceive and revere his signal readiness to assist the wretched he had certainly sincere and active compassion for great calamities but this is a cast of mind very different from that which leads a man to perfect amity with the prosperous and the eminent a poet who is more kind than severe to the character of your philosopher very truly and happily tells us he proudly splenetic yet idly vain accepted flattery and dealt disdain poetical review of johnson by john courtenay esquire    this disposition is indeed discernible in every portrait of johnson and surely nothing can be more incompatible with the true spirit of friendship i conceive therefore that he entertained for the persons who were most beloved by him such a sort of regard as we may suppose the manmountain to have bestowed on those halfflattered and halffrightened lilliputians whom he deigned to elevate in the palm of his hand and for whom he sometimes condescended to soften the portentous sound of his voice  but let me hasten to my second article and compare your philosopher with chesterfield as a periodical moralist  as our religion informs us that it is very difficult for a rich man to find the way to heaven so may we conceive that it is hardly less difficult for a man of quality business and fashion to render himself equal to our accomplished authors he who was nursed by vanity and tutored by pomp deserves i think no little praise if he has delivered moral lectures not inferior to those of a philosopher who had adversity to teach and poverty to inspire him in naming poverty i cannot help reminding you of your philosophers very singular opinion in regarding it as the only efficacious inspirer an opinion which induces me to believe that had he been born in the rank of chesterfield he would have proved if not the most sensual at least the most indolent of our modern voluptuaries but in the midst of many temptations to be idle and voluptuous we find my noble favorite exerting his natural and acquired talents to improve the morals of his countrymen and i will venture to affirm that the moral papers contained in his miscellaneous works are full as well if not better calculated to answer their purpose than those pompous dissertations of your philosopher where the two authors afford the fairest ground for a comparison in the similarity of their subject as a strong case in point i beg you to compare at your leisure the admirable paper in chesterfield on the luxury of the table which forms the sixteenth number of a periodical work entitled common sense with the paper on gluttony in your favorite rambler  if you compare also the introductory number in each of these publications you will clearly perceive i think that the talents of chesterfield were more suited than those of johnson to the production of attractive and useful little lectures on life and manners if you want farther proofs of this assertion you may find them i am persuaded in the papers that he contributed to the world particularly those on drinking and civility which live in the memory of every reader  as moralists they seem to bear the same relation to each other that exists between the elegant the penetrating horace and the forcible declamatory juvenal the engaging ease of chesterfields style and the sportive graces of his wit were peculiarly adapted to render him excellent as the essayist of a day when they are compared together in this light johnson is to chesterfield what the piony is to the rose  of a grander form of more forcible and richer coloring yet not so pleasant to be surveyed with distant admiration but not eagerly received into the bosom   the archdeacon i will not be so barbarous to your flowery metaphor as to say that i presume you mean only the cankerrose   lady caroline very well my good friend  this is a fair and very gentle touch of retaliation for all the severity with which your admired philosopher has been treated i confess i have expected you to retaliate with much greater warmth on the weak side of your antagonist  i mean the irreligion of his favorite   the archdeacon to speak honestly i could not in my conscience attack my adversary on that ground for i perfectly recollect that lord chesterfield repeatedly inculcates not only the most decent respect to religion herself but to all her ministers i am afraid indeed that his religious sentiments were not such as i who am by no means one of his professed admirers most sincerely wish them to have been yet as this is a business between his own heart and heaven i do not conceive that any man has a right to suppose him an infidel and then to censure him on the supposition  this would be contrary to the fundamental principles of english liberty and justice not to speak of it as a violation of christian charity   the colonel i reverence you my worthy friend for this candor and wish it were universal  chesterfield is condemned as irreligious yet so far from finding any traces of this offense in his writings i find that in one of his french letters he expressly condemns the irreligion of voltaire partial as he was to that enchanting writer from a personal acquaintance  chesterfield is also condemned as a frenchified fop yet no man has written more forcibly against our copying the follies of france indeed no man seems to have better understood or more highly valued the liberties of his country and with what spirit he could support the manly frankness and undaunted truth of the english character in speaking to a frenchman we have a striking example in his letter to the abbe de la ville the french minister at the hague on several particulars relating to the battle of fontenoy he has indeed been cruelly depreciated your philosopher you know very mercifully considered him as a rotten post to use his own gentle phrase but if there were some unsound parts and who is perfect in the character of the noble lord there was i apprehend a still larger portion of touchwood in the philosopher himself  i have never seen the letter in which he renounced the patronage that he appeared to have contemplated with no little satisfaction but from all the accounts that i have met with of that incident i think we may rather blame the splenetic pride of johnson than the insolence or meanness of chesterfield  in the sarcasms which they levelled at each other the latter surely approaches nearest to the truth the critic was unquestionably more like a savage than the wit was like a dancing master  chesterfield had his foibles and his vices he was in his early life a slave to the tyrannous vice of gaming but how ingenuously and parentally does he confess and lament it in his letters  and give me leave to add that he once derived no little honor from a signal victory over this despotic passion i allude to his conduct as lord lieutenant of ireland  you know that he banished gaming entirely from the castle of dublin and surely the man is entitled to credit for some nobleness of mind who enters on the exercise of sovereign power by the sacrifice of his own darling defect  believe me i am not blind to his private failings and i heartily wish for his own happiness that they had never existed but i still assert that he had public merit sufficient to balance all his imperfections let hypocrisy and malevolence or if you please let virtue herself deride him to the uttermost as a vain and licentious puppet of quality  i shall never cease to think that he has many genuine claims to that lasting glory which he had the spirit to love and to pursue nor is he less entitled to the grateful remembrance of our country than the arrogant and splenetic dogmatist who has vilified the heroism of our kings and the genius of our bards a writer of verses not from the impulse of nature but the suggestions of interest or spleen a critic not from an enthusiastic delight in poetry but an envious hatred to poets   the archdeacon that is a point which time will settle with his usual unfailing justice  though mankind are not always happy enough to distinguish their real friends from their foes yet their judgment is generally just when the candidate for their applause has nothing to trust to but the posthumous influence of his works  whatever charity may hope concerning the supposed irreligion of chesterfield his immorality has too glaring an appearance to admit any doubt of its existence and the man who is vain and profligate enough to boast of his vices is i must confess in my opinion very far from deserving such an advocate as your favorite has found indeed the more rigid friends of virtue and religion may almost blush with indignation in seeing two characters so very different compared to each other  johnson the refuge and the friend of every being in distress compared to the ostentatious man of quality who affected to be the patron of talents which he wanted erudition to estimate and liberality to reward  johnson the eternal moralist who made every social amusement a step in the acquisition of knowledge or in the improvement of the heart compared to the licentious wit whose only ambition was to dazzle and amuse  johnson to hasten at once to that aweful scene where the comparison is not only most obvious but most important  johnson closing a life of virtue and religion with faith in his redeemer and with humility sufficient to tremble with aweful doubts of his own exemplary merit compared to chesterfield finishing a frivolous and dissolute existence with the affected severity of a pagan philosopher   the colonel if either party could have reason to blush indignantly at the comparison i maintain it must be chesterfield  chesterfield the enchanting companion whose conversation was a model of the most enlivening politeness compared to the surly dogmatist whose habitual discourse was a compound of arrogance and spleen  chesterfield the accomplished the diligent ambassador who never lost a morning hour compared to the lazy moralist who tells us he wasted half his life in resolving to rise early and in breaking that resolve  chesterfield the friendly editor the just and delicate panegyrist of one elegant and tender poet compared to the invidious biographer who has scattered his inexhaustible gall over the whole choir of british bards  chesterfield the patriotic senator pleading with elegance and energy for the freedom of the stage compared to the servile author induced by his political bigotry to write against the liberty of the press  chesterfield the beneficent viceroy who governed ireland in such a manner as to merit and receive the praise and benedictions of that lively people compared to the moody traveller who visited scotland to insult its nakedness and to pour his superstitious execrations on the innocent descendants of its too zealous reformer  chesterfield in short to finish with that important scene in which all men however different in character and condition must inevitably afford room for the most striking comparison  chesterfield i say the real sage ready and willing to die employing his latest breath in kind attention to his friend compared to your pretended philosopher who shuddered at the approaches of no early death with an excess of pusillanimous horror which has exposed him to a more apt comparison with the cowardly effeminate mecaenas   lady caroline a severe parallel indeed methodically drawn and delivered with an oratorical vehemence that i never saw you assume before  but as i have exalted myself into a judicial office lot me imitate my dear colonel the grand court of justice among your favorite athenians as those sapient judges always sat i think in the dark you may allow me to be a little like them and let me forbid all the delusive insinuations of impassioned eloquence  i have still to request from you both a few remarks on the style of your respective favorites  the archdeacon i believe esteems johnson the very sampson of language as we lately heard him called by one of his more affected admirers   the archdeacon indeed madam i think our language has infinite obligations to him and the colonel who is a lover of spirit in every shape can hardly prefer the loose and feeble phraseology of chesterfield or of addison to the compact vigor of our energetic philologist   the colonel though you may probably think me severely prejudiced against your favorite in some points i trust you will not think so in the article of diction for i allow that we find frequent passages in johnson where the amazing vigor of his expression is equalled by its beauty i recollect in his character of dryden a sentence that shows us the wonderful powers of his language he there describes a tendency to talk nonsense in such terms as render it an object of great sublimity do you remember the words i think they run thus he delighted to tread upon the brink of meaning where light and darkness begin to mingle to approach the precipice of absurdity and hover over the abyss of unideal vacancy  but there is an excellence which johnson has very justly remarked in drydens language and which he greatly wanted himself the excellence i mean he describes in a paragraph that i have transcribed in my memorandums under the article we are speaking of here it is  his style could not easily be imitated either seriously or ludicrously for being always equable and always varied it has no prominent or discriminative characters the beauty who is totally free from disproportion of parts and features cannot be ridiculed by an overcharged resemblance life of dryden  if the excellence of language may be estimated by this standard that of johnson is assuredly very defective for nothing is more easy than to execute a caricatura of his style in reading him we are frequently tempted to exclaim as la bruyere does on certain sermons o what a rich figure is the antithesis it produces a whole rambler with a great command of words he certainly wanted the noble and graceful simplicity which we admire in the capital writers of every country from homer plato and demosthenes down to that addison whom the partisans of your philosopher call a weak writer when compared to johnson as there were once people in rome who preferred the eloquence of seneca to that of cicero  the language of chesterfield strikes me like a damsel in a fashionable morning dress of the most simple and captivating elegance that of johnson is like a matron who has arrayed herself for some grand ceremonial and heightened the austere dignity of her form by all the rich stiffness of a flowery brocade  if i were to compare the style of your philosopher with that of addison i should say that johnson has the spirit the grandeur and the monotony of the kettledrum addison the rich variety of that sacred instrument which can equally delight us with airy sweetness and awful solemnity but as i am no connoisseur in the music of language perhaps my idea is not so just as the opinion of some goodnatured critics upon style who while they are rattling a saltbox themselves have the kindness to tell their auditors there is no strength or body in the tones of an organ  let me return to the diction of chesterfield  the best panegyric i can devise for it will be to read you the following paragraph addressed to him by your philologist  i may hope my lord that since you whose authority in our language is so generally acknowledged have commissioned me to declare my own opinion i shall be considered as exercising a kind of vicarious jurisdiction and that the power which might have been denied to my own claim will be readily allowed me as the delegate of your lordship johnsons plan of an english dictionary   you will readily allow my good friend that the man must have been no weak master in the science of words who could extort such a compliment from an author uncommonly sparing of literary courtesy to all living merit  but i will not launch out into new censures on your idol indeed as he has so frequently excited my spleen by his severity toward various favorites of mine both in politics and poetry i may possibly harbor prejudices against him almost as violent and cruel as his own  you i think have as strong a bias in his favor from your benevolent presumption that his real goodness was as great as his ostentatious display of morality but my sister is a sort of neutral power who may fairly settle the difference between us and i am sure you will join with me in requesting her to give us i will not say her judgment for the word would alarm and terrify her diffidence but her genuine feelings toward the two characters in question   the archdeacon i join indeed most heartily in your request and beg leave at the same time to remind lady caroline that she is the true perfect judge not only of moral but of literary merit according to an honest and candid sentiment of the mighty critic himself who says you know in speaking with liberal praise of grays elegy by the common sense of readers uncorrupted with literary prejudices after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learning must be finally decided all claim to poetical honors life of gray    lady caroline you are very good to encourage me by such a quotation but i really have not confidence enough to deliver any thing like a formal opinion upon characters of such eminence even to you with whom i am so familiar i do not mean however to shrink entirely from your request which would i think be very unfair after the entertainment that i have received from you both  and to pretend that i have formed to myself no notions concerning two authors whom you know i read very frequently would be a foolish sort of prudery indeed i shall tell you therefore very frankly how i have felt myself affected by your respective favorites  to speak of them as men i never felt in my life the slightest wish to have been personally acquainted with either though in reading many authors and addison in particular i have felt such a desire  johnson i think said to some young lady miss i am a tame monster you may stroke me if he said so for i do not recollect where i met with the anecdote i apprehend his expression was not perfectly true  he certainly was not more than halftamed  i do not believe that i could have been induced to give the fearless pat of friendly familiarity to either of these very opposite creatures i am persuaded that my hand would have shrunk from johnson as from a hedgehog and from chesterfield if not as an adder too venomous to be touched yet certainly as an eel too slippery to be held for notwithstanding my brothers panegyric on the friendly qualities of his idol i cannot think that either he or the philosopher had a heart truly formed for that tender connection they seem to me to have possessed an equal degree of selfishness though it showed itself under very different shapes  one was continually trying to bully and the other to inveigle the world into an exclusive admiration of his particular talents the men accuse our sex of being actuated by a spirit of rivalship and mutual injustice to each other yet surely this is not only as visible among themselves but more productive of general disadvantage what the archdeacon observed of johnson and garrick leads me to make a similar observation on johnson and chesterfield had these two men of rare and different talents instead of kindling into a contemptuous animosity contracted a solid friendship on the noble plan of honoring of enjoying the perfections and correcting the deficiencies of each other how infinitely might such conduct have contributed to the pleasure improvement happiness and lasting glory of both but the defects in each were too strong to let him derive all possible delight and advantage from the faculties of the other great as they both were in their separate lines i cannot think that either was truly entitled to the epithet of amiable or good for i am equally offended by truth that is delivered with brutality and by politeness that is utterly insincere i own myself as much an enemy to the splenetic malevolence of johnson as to the licentious vanity of chesterfield could they have blended their better qualities could the gaiety of the wit have cured the spleen of the philosopher and could the strong intellect of johnson have annihilated the libertinism of chesterfield each might have been what i think neither was a truly accomplished and happy man and each might have been rendered by such a process a more perfect and delightful writer for as it is though we admire the wonderful understanding and energy of mind displayed by johnson though we are charmed by the wit elegance and knowledge of the world that we find in chesterfield yet it is certain that each fails us in the very point where from his particular pursuits we might naturally suppose it most safe to take him as a guide the literary judgments of johnson and the worldly admonitions of chesterfield appear to me equally unsound the first are surely not consistent with truth and justice  and for the latter i am afraid no apologist can perfectly reconcile them to honesty and virtue yet there is such a mass of real though different excellence united to the gross failings of those two authors that as a parent anxious to collect every thing that may render me useful to my children i read them both with equal eagerness and i find much innocent instruction in chesterfield that a mothers heart is inclined to adopt let rigid moralists tell me if they please that all his parental merit is of the womanish kind and that he is at best fine by defect and delicately weak   as to johnson i have indeed many jarring ideas of his excellencies and defects yet i believe i may give you my notion of his character comprised in a line by which pope has described the whole species i shall conclude therefore by telling you that he was to my apprehension a being darkly wise and rudely great    the colonel admirably applied  you have expressed in a single verse what i labored to say ineffectually in a great deal of prose  so adieu for this morning   the archdeacon stay colonel  do not leave us so hastily   the colonel i must be gone  but i will not shut the door without remarking that if chesterfield had known our lady he would have thought better of women than he did and if johnson had possessed your true christian virtues my dear doctor he would have been a much happier being than he was  so farewell   finis
