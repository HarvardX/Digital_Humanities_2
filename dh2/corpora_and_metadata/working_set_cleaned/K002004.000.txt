the capricious lovers a comic opera as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  by mr robert lloyd  the music composed by mr rush london printed for r withy at the dunciad in cornhill w griffin in fetterlane mr becket in the strand and mr davies in russel street covent garden      price eighteenpence  this opera is entered at stationers hall and whoever presumes to print the songs or any part of it will be prosecuted by the proprietors  the following comic opera is inscribed to george colman esquire by his sincere friend and obliged humble servant  r lloyd  advertisement to the reader the caprices d amor ou ninette a la cour written by mr favart is the ground work of the following little piece but i believe whoever shall examine both operas will find that i have been perhaps too wanton in my imitation and departed too widely from the original they may probably wish that i had pilfered more and written less what i have added what i have omitted or what i have altered those who can compare one piece with the other will easily perceive and to those who cannot make the comparison any explanation on that head is altogether unnecessary  when mr favarts comedy was first put into my hands i could not but be much pleased with the life and simplicity he had thrown into his performance without descending to that species of humor which the english have very little relish of gross italian buffoonry this i have chiefly endeavored to preserve in the following opera with what success the public will determine  dramatis personae men astolpho mr packer hobbinol mr yates damon

look upon her she had such a delicate white and red for all the world like our kates doll yet a body would believe that they came together only to live asunder  for madam lies in one bed squire lies in another and they are now like the two buckets of our townwell when one comes up the other goes down and if they happen to meet each other you would think they had never seen one another before if

tummas was broke by roger who played at the wake and kate was alarmed at the stroke and wept for poor tummass sake when his worship gave noggins of ale and the liquor was charming and stout o those were the times to regale and we footed it rarely about then our partners were buxom as does and we all were as happy as kings each lad in his holyday clothes and the lasses in all their best things what merriment all the day long may the feast of our colin prove such odzooks but i will join in the song and i will hobble about with my crutch ay it was that very day his worship was made justice of the peace and coram  then cicely and i came together for the first time  she was a tight wench then her cheeks were as fresh as a rose and as red as a catherine pear  there was your dancing damon when she and i were partners and    flourish of horns col oh neighbors neighbors all our grounds are overrun with horses hounds and huntsmen  they force into the vineyard  plague on all sportsmen they are

and is this the object of your adoration   astolpho it is and what is still more extraordinary her wit charms me as much as her beauty   fabian a miracle   astolpho she is indeed a wonder and i have been told that an old lady whose circumstances obliged her to dwell in retirement has been the protectress of this sweet creature and formed and cultivated her mind by an excellent education leaving her possessed of the most amiable simplicity a native frankness of temper and an agreeable vivacity   fabian does not your highness fear some imputation   astolpho what signifies the blood she springs from a handsome woman is naturally born above her condition   fabian but the princess emily sir her rank and virtue    astolpho i confess them yet my heart spite of myself is on the point of proving faithless to her i dote on this little rural innocent and what is still more extraordinary with but little hopes of success   fabian is she so coy then   astolpho my answer here must be still more romantic i adore her and yet which perhaps is the best proof i have never dared to utter my passion   fabian but how can you hope to gain her heart without solicitation   astolpho for that purpose i have at length retained a female solicitor lisetta whom i have sent to exert all her artifice to win her to the court i have no reliance but upon her skill but here they come  let us retire and watch their conversation   scene vi phoebe air v when vapors over the meadow die and morning streaks the purple sky i wake to love with jocund glee to think on him who doats on me with secret pleasure i survey the frolic birds in amorous play while fondest cares my heart employ which flutters leaps and beats for joy  enter lisetta you must have a very merry heart pretty nymph to be so cheerful in such a low and obscure condition   phoebe the obscurity of my condition is the means of my happiness what have i to distrub my tranquillity   lisetta tranquillity oh melancholy tranquillity is the pleasure of a drone dull and stupid i love active pleasures to go on in a perfect round of delights that whirl one about till ones almost giddy with happiness and keep one as busy as a be indeed my dear creature you are most horribly mistaken your purling streams secret groves and dying swains are mighty pretty things to read of but there is nothing so absurd in nature as preferring the gloom of a country life amongst a parcel of cows sheep and men like brutes to the brilliancy of a court  and let me tell you young maiden that face was never made to be buried in a cottage come come i know something that would make your little heart go pitapat for an exchange you shall have nothing to do but to wish and be satisfied you shall have coaches and horses and jewels and servants   phoebe alas

civil gentleman who calls himself the princes friend he has promised to speak a word for us at court and to be sure he will do us real services for he professes great regard   lisetta regard  a fiddlestick for regard  such beauty as yours will command love wherever it appears what signifies moping in these deserts  only consider how you will shine in a court   phoebe ah madam i see you laugh at me i am not designed for such fine folks i should be ashamed to show my face at court   lisetta not you indeed there is no such thing as shame at court  you shall flaunt it about in a gilt equipage with tail handsome footmen behind it dressed in silks and sattins and gold and silver and fringes and laces and flounces with jewels on your fingers and diamonds in your ears and a watch by your side and then your toilette oh your toilette   phoebe toilette what is that   lisetta what a pretty nizi it is the ladies treasury from whence in all ages they draw their most lasting charms the throne of art the armory of cupid and the altar of the graces it is there that they triumph over nature and repair the ruins of age by the delicate touches of the pencil  air vi yes that is a magazine of arms to triumph over time whence beauty borrows half her charms and always keeps her prime at that the prude coquette and saint industrious sets her face while powder patch and wash and paint repair or give a grace to arch the brow there lies the brush the comb to tinge the hair the spanish wool to give the blush the pearl to die them fair hence rise the wrinkled old and gray in freshest beauty strong as venus fair as flora gay as hebe ever young  phoebe this is past my comprehension  i dont understand it  shall i grow handsomer at court   lisetta aye to be sure   phoebe i should like it vastly i wish i was there had i more charms colin perhaps might love me better   lisetta try   phoebe i have a good mind and yet i am afraid  but see yonder comes the gentleman who belongs to the prince   lisetta so so her vanity begins to work apace the fish nibbles i will leave him to hook it   exit lisetta scene v enter astolpho astolpho good morrow fair maiden what still at your rustic employments fie fie to bury such charms in the country is treason against beauty   phoebe indeed sir your language is past my simple understanding  a fine gentlewoman was here but now and she talked

are continually hunting here from morn to night if you have any interest good sir speak to the prince that we may be no more troubled with him for my part i cannot find out what has possessed them to run over our fields in such a manner for the pleasure of killing a little leveret they will destroy you forty acres of corn  only see   astolpho be satisfied  your request is already granted   phoebe i thank you sir with all my heart and above all i beg you will never come here for i dont like to see you   astolpho what how is that phoebe i hoped    phoebe hoped  pray what sir   astolpho you do

phoebe i was in hopes my tenderness might have won upon you the happy colin i perceive interests you more may he be the means of completing your happiness though i am rewarded with affliction but your will shall be my law adieu remember think upon my love and be assured of every service in my power  exit colin thank heaven the coast is clear and all is calm again   phoebe indeed colin you treated the gentleman much too roughly  he is a lord and he has promised to carry me to court   colin to court and will you go   phoebe to be sure why not they say it is a charming place  well go together love   colin hear me phoebe nothing that is handsome is safe at court his design is to betray you which you dont seem to suspect  he talked to you about love why did you listen to him phoebe   phoebe what if he did talk about love his love is hopeless and your courtiers are too well bred to offend against good manners   colin yes yes they are such sort of folks to be sure  you have found them so   phoebe why do you suspect me i only give ear to such discourse to laugh at it to laugh with you my dear colin remain secure in that assurance   colin o no doubt that is charming and fine but dont i see him at this very moment lurking about and staring upon you as if he would look you through and through as he is not yet gone about his business go home to your own cottage tomorrow you are to be

with the sovereign of the homage of all hearts   phoebe yes sir i will go with you to colin henceforth you shall learn to prize me better   colin was ever such perfidy   phoebe air ix go seek some nymph of humbler lot to share thy board and deck thy cot with joy i fly the simple youth who holds me light or doubts my truth thy breast for low too wanton grown shall mourn it is peace and pleasure flown nor shall my faith reward a swain who doubts my love or thinks me vain  colin a plague take the whole sex say i they are as light as chaff and fickle as the wind  air x thus laughed at jilted and betrayed i stamp i tear i rave capricious light injurious maid i will be no more thy slave i will rend thy image from my heart thy charms no more engage my soul shall take the juster part and love shall yield to rage  exeunt omnes end of the first act act ii scene i a toilette phoebe dressing lisetta and clara lisetta a little more rouge if your ladyship pleases   phoebe ladyship dont laugh at me   lisetta one slight touch more   phoebe more daubing have done i will no more on it  air xi thank you ladies for your care but i pray you both forbear sure i am all over scratches that your curious hands must place such odd spots upon my face with your pencils paint and patches how i totter in my gait from a dress of so much weight with my robe too dangling after could my colin now but see what a thing they have made of me oh he would split his sides with laughter you have made a strange figure of me indeed at last these things are wondrous awkward to me pray let us have done   clara your diamonds madam   phoebe o how they sparkle  but there are some flowers  poh they have no smell  every thing is unnatural here beauty is but a painted sign all is imposture even to the very flowers   clara these flowers maam are made to please the sight not the smell and in this instance they excel those of nature  air xii the flowers which grace their native beds awhile put forth their blushing heads but ever the close of parting day they wither shrink and die away but these which mimic skill has made nor scorched by suns nor killed by shade shall blush with less inconstant hue which art at pleasure can renew  lisetta a fan for your ladyship   phoebe dear me what use can i make of this   lisetta this is a wonderful instrument it is exercise is various and elegant you shall hear it maam  air xiii for various purpose serves the fan as thus  a decent blind between the sticks to peep at man nor yet betray your mind each action has a meaning plain resentments in the snap a flirt expresses strong disdain consent a gentle tap all passions will the fan disclose all modes of female art and to advantage sweetly shows the hand if not the heart it is follys scepter first designed by loves capricious boy who knows how lightly all mankind are governed by a toy ah maam you will soon understand the power of this art i am ravished with it already what an amiable figure   clara what a genteel air   lisetta how immensely elegant  horrid creature aside   phoebe overhearing what did you say   lisetta quite in nature  you will be the object of general adoration   clara all the world will feel the force of your charms   phoebe charms are these your charms i hardly know myself and yet after all a peacock a jay or a butterfly is dressed ten times finer here are gold and silver and jewels and ribbands of all the colors in the rainbow  a great hoop that hides my real figure washes that take away my natural complexion shoes that will cripple me and stays that make me crooked i wish i was in my own clothes again  air xiv when late a simple rustic lass i roved without constraint a stream was all my looking glass and health my only paint the charms i boast alas how few i gave to natures care as vice never spoilt their native hue they could not want repair  lisetta your ladyship will excuse me but upon my word your notions are quite antiquated and have not the least relish of the bon ton   phoebe bon ton what is that   lisetta every thing in the world maam in the polite world at least it is impossible to look or walk or talk without it maam   phoebe what will you persuade me out of my senses do you think to make me believe that i have not the use of my eyes my tongue or my feet dont i speak plainly dont you understand me dont you call this speaking   lisetta not quite according to the bon ton madam there is no occasion for your speaking plainly it is the worst thing you can do nor for my understanding you nay indeed that is still worse than the other you should never speak to be understood as to your manner drawl out your words in a faint weak voice as if you did not know how to get them off your tongue your ladyship enter nous speaks too much in the country tone you seem all health and spirits put a little sickly delicacy into your accents languish with your eyes and totter in your gait and then you will be quite in the bon ton maam   phoebe how strange and ridiculous surely this place is the region of absurdities  air xv how strange the mode which truth neglects and rests all beauty in defects but we by homely nature taught though rude in speech are plain in thought  lisetta why there again in your singing now your ladyship has a fine pipe but not a note according to the bon ton no italian expression which is the life and soul of all music the very essence of harmony your singers of taste will run up and down the ladder of sounds from the cellar up to the garret now rumbling along in the grand spirituoso till they make your ears crack again and then in the piano they expire like a swan to their own melody in our favorite compositions we are not contented with making the sound an echo to the sense but by a happy jumbling of both together create the most exquisite confusion of harmony in the universe please your ladyship i will give you a specimen and then if you please i will attend you to court  air xvi though thunder in thy accents roll no fear shall shake my daring soul o tyrant grumble rant and rave my spirit scorns to be thy slave but pity lends her soothing aid can i forsake my tender maid o tyrant vain is thy decree her mournful looks are death to me  scene ii another apartment in the palace fabian astolpho astolpho yes fabian i do observe nay pity her uneasiness the sensibility of the princess alarms me i know her virtues and am convinced of her affection for me though from her delicacy she has not hitherto upbraided me i perceive she entertains strong suspicions which you know are but too well grounded   fabian yet those my lord are easily removed   astolpho and how   fabian your highness orders have already done it for what you promised phoebe will be a proof which emily cannot suspect that this amor has nothing real in it when this same colin whom the young madam doats on comes to court his love will be a blind for yours   astolpho true i have sent for him but what then  pray explain   fabian the awkward simplicity of country lovers must make an agreeable contrast with the elegance of court manners an amusement only fit for laughter as such only you designed it for that purpose you brought them hither for entertainment and observation the princess cannot suspect your designs upon phoebe when her own colin is permitted to be with her and you will easily find means to compass your intentions when all suspicions are quieted   astolpho but see the princess comes  i would avoid her  exeunt   scene iii enter emily and clara emily he shuns me clara alas it is now beyond a doubt   clara do not torment yourself and create imaginary affliction  air xvii ourselves too often we deceive and wrong our judgment to believe when thinking harshly of the swain we cheat our hopes and brood on pain  emily with the generality of women i confess the heart is not so much affected as their vanity is hurt by the fickleness of their lovers self love is too often the link which unites their souls but the only interest which sways my bosom is the purest and tenderest affection   clara believe me madam the prince is no stranger to your tenderness  he will return it   emily you would comfort me i see  perhaps i am alarmed from too slight a cause however watch their steps if you regard your mistress   emily air xviii if tyrant love with cruel dart transfix the maidens tender heart of easy faith and fond belief she hugs the dart and aids the thief till left her helpless state to mourn neglected loving and forlorn she finds while grief her bosom stings as well as darts the god has wings  but who is this the prince brings with him  oh it is the village nymph he so much doats on i must observe them exeunt  scene iv enter phoebe astolpho astolpho well what think you of the court does it delight you phoebe   phoebe it is the seat of wonders every thing changes character here the men are quite different i met one who is the lord of the manor in our neigbourhood a very proud gentleman amongst us he carries his head so high and looks so fierce and threatens folks with his cane in the country if they do but look upon him here he was bowing and scraping and cringing why are they so complaisant here these great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country does the court make them so much better no i believe if they do any good here it is only to get a right to do something bad elsewhere   astolpho i hear you with pleasure did not the brilliancy and the politeness of court surprise    phoebe oh they were extravagantly polite indeed they paid their compliments with wonderful civility and ran over my person and features in a loud whisper with the most minute observation  upon my word she is a mighty pretty tight thing quite an angel for the country what a poor little innocent it is what an air she has what a walk what a voice    astolpho oh that is mere pleasantry  they will be more careful by and by and show you infinitely more respect they will be eager to invent new diversions for you they will read your wishes in your eyes and i my dear will serve them as a model   scene v enter emily clara emily to phoebe so madam you have made a noble conquest suffer me i beseech you to pay my homage where the prince pays his   astolpho nay but emily you misunderstand   emily to phoebe your superior charms   phoebe pray madam do not mock me   emily to astolpho dont disturb yourself my lord my presence interrupts i see i will retire   phoebe stay stay we have no secrets to talk of the prince and i    emily i understand you madam it were wonderful indeed if charms like yours had not most terrible effects  air xix i must approve your highness flame your passion for the fair and all the world must feel the same who marks her shape and air a mien so rich in every grace her manners so polite such beauty learning from her face was ever such a fright  phoebe so then the prince is her lover yes yes i plainly perceive it upon my word this place abounds with very odd customs to astolpho can you divide your heart to two at a time to emily the prince loves me too madam he has sworn it   emily ironically to astolpho mere pleasantry that is all   astolpho to emily nay but i assure you   phoebe to emily you need not be under any apprehensions on my account for my part i love colin   astolpho yes yes colin is her love and colin shall come i told you so  to emily dont give any credit   emily i believe nothing   astolpho twas but a whim that caused all this for i imagined the rustic simplicity of these peasants might make an agreeable contrast with the refined manners of our courtiers   emily forcing a laugh a very ridiculous project truly oh we shall be charmingly amused come let us hear some of her prattle  well my dear and how do you like the court   phoebe may i speak my lord   astolpho oh what you please   phoebe then if i must fairly confess the truth i am heartily tired of this horrid place where every object i perceive seems a contradiction to common sense their whole design is to reverse nature where people are for ever busy in doing nothing where they eat without appetite and lie down without rest where their mirth is all grimace and their pleasure nothing but perpetual noise   clara her observation madam to me seems perfectly just groves and retirement are your only places for innocence and simplicity  air xx along your verdant lowly vale calm zephyr breathes a gentle gale but rustling through the lofty trees it swells beyond the peaceful breeze thus free from envys poisoned dart you boast a pure unruffled heart while jarring thoughts our peace deform and swell our passions to a storm  emily and pray when is she to return to her village again is she to go tomorrow   phoebe no sir to night to night i beseech you the sooner the better   emily come come then let us leave her to prepare for her journey and indulge her meditation on her beloved colin your servant my dear   astolpho adieu phoebe dont be uneasy your colin will soon be here   astolpho and emily out phoebe your servant my dear a mighty pretty subject to laugh at truly even keep your prince to yourself i want none of him i am sure i did not come here to look for him weeping i have nothing to reproach myself with only let them suffer me to go and i shall be happy is it my fault what have i to do with it if colin was to treat me so instead of making myself so pleasant with other folks i should die for grief  but what is this i hear  ah it is colin how engaging he will find me let me see if he will recollect me in this dress   colin air xxi plague take such folks their whims their jokes with their nonsense rant and riot this calls me clown that shoves me down can a body never be quiet so pushed about thrust in thrust out in a tumult noise and hurry i am squeezed to death i have lost my breath and my wits run hurry scurry  here have they dragged me out of the country to make a fool and laughing stock of me a parcel of servants i think they called them though i took them for lords they were all so belacd and beruffled have put me into this dress forsooth in spite of my teeth and what have i to do with these taudry trappings i want nothing in this world but mine own sweetheart phoebe they came truly to fetch me hither and yet i cannot find her a plague upon em every thing distracts me i know not whether i stand on my head or my legs  phoebe i will even go and accost him  sir sir   colin lud lud what can this fine lady want with me   phoebe this is the luckiest accident in the world he can never find me out through this disguise   colin how she surveys me i believe she will look me through and through   phoebe i will even try his constancy  and pray sir what occasion can have brought you to court   colin me i only come to look for our phoebe   phoebe who sir phoebe   colin yes a tight lass of our parish who has promised to be my wife but she has left me in the lurch   phoebe you amaze me that is scarce possible   colin aye forsooth but it is true   phoebe but after all sir why should that give you any manner of uneasiness a person of your figure i am sure

life   phoebe upon my word sir i wish you well   colin what without knowing me   phoebe oh sir people of your sort are easily known you have a certain air in your countenance an appearance in your dress    colin oh madam upon my word    phoebe which sufficiently explain themselves to my eyes   colin o as to that your ladyship    phoebe and then what is still more distinguishing your excessive politeness   colin politeness i polite indeed madam i dont pretend to know any thing of that matter to be sure i was always counted a civil body and i know how to keep my distance and doff my hat for i know that is good manners for certain when one talks to a great lady   phoebe but you sir are a gentleman   colin a gentleman i a gentleman o lud o lud   phoebe i see it plainly but you are infinitely too modest you are indeed    colin yes yes forsooth i am a country gentleman   phoebe and that sir is all in all that is a sufficient recommendation and demands a peculiar protection   colin aside odsbud but i believe this lady has taken a fancy to me they had good reason indeed who told me one need but show ones face at court to make ones fortune   phoebe bless me what a charming figure what ease what elegance oh sir if you come hither to make your fortune you cannot fail of success come come you shall be my servant  o heavens what ails me i am so dizzy i can hardly stand lord

neighbor your fine folk for all their vapouring and bouncing are no honester than they should be who would have thought that our phoebe would have been sent for to court   hob sent for quoth a no damon trepanned drawn in by artifice  lord what a parcel of nonsense of teeth and lips and ivory and coral and diamonds did some of those scented puppets pour out before the wenches in our village till the maids grew so fantastic that they did not know their heads from their tails   damon fair words cover foul dealings give me plain speech and plain manners i say   hob by my troth gaffer i never could abide these legmaking gentry who bow and scrape and palaver with their hats stuck like gizards under their arms and all the while they mean no more by their civility than to cuckold the husband or debauch the daughter   damon thank heaven hobbinol we have none of those vices we are not so polite   hobbinol in good truth neighbor i envy none of those sort of folk  air xxii though my dress as my manners is simple and plain a rascal i hate and a knave i disdain my dealings are just and my conscience is clear and i am richer than those who have thousands a year though bent down with age and for sporting uncouth i feel no remorse from the follies of youth i still tell my tale and rejoice in my song and my boys think my life not a moment too long let the courtiers those dealers in grin and grimace creep under dance over for title or place above all the titles that flow from a throne that of honest i prize and that titles my own but sure they cannot mean mischief to our young couple since my boy colin has been sent for to court with all haste and to meet your phoebe they said  body o me how their eyes will sparkle when they meet each other i will warrant you now she is as melancholy as a turtle that has lost it is mate   damon but for my part hobbinol i cannot abide the thoughts of her being at court why the place is for all the world like a fair full of nonsense noise and show   hob aye neighbor they keep fair here all the year round and a plentiful market too only the goods now and then are a little stale   damon a plague take their town manners i say though i do my hat never so low and bespeak them never so civilly they do but laugh in my face adod i think we been as proper folks as the best of them in our time they mun keep their flaunts and fleers to themselves it is a wonderment to me neighbor how we found our way hither   hob or how we escaped whole from so many dangers i thought i should have had my body squeezed to death by one of those iggetting fellows with poles in his hand and a chair at his backside who thrust me into the kennel almost under the wheel of a coach and then surlily cried out by your leave  had i known that had been the way of asking a civil question ecod but i would have had my crutch ready to have given him an answer   damon well well these disasters are at an end now   hob true gaffer true we mun not bide here we must try what we can to recover our children and for my part i do think colin will be perfect mad if he misses his dear phoebe exeunt   scene ii a dressing room in the palace phoebe lisetta air

while she who pleases most to day tomorrow shall be slighted faithless faithless colin and pray madam does colin know the prince designs this visit to me   lisetta o yes he is informed of it  long since poor soul   phoebe the news of it has affected him no doubt    lisetta oh yes madam for a quarter of an hour or so now he would run up and down stamping and tearing and raving and rending like a madman then he would stop short of a sudden and folding his arms like a lover despairing beside a clear stream heave a desperate sigh with the most rueful length of face mortal ever beheld the knight of the woeful countenance was a cherub in comparison  air xxiv oh twould pierce a heart of stone to hear him roar and blubber so great a lover never was known  nor ever so great a lubber like little master left alone by gay mamma forsaken with hiccup sob and sigh and groan his heart is almost breaking but like the rest of his sex sorrow took no fast hold of him twas but an april shower and all was fair again   phoebe indeed lisetta were it not for his treachery i could almost find in my heart to pity him but dear lisetta i find myself strangely fatigued your pleasures here pall the mind without entertaining it my spirits are quite overpowered   lisetta i am glad of it now now you begin to have the bon ton  i was sure your ladyship could not be so long amongst the polite world without catching the manners of it it is nothing but nerves weak nerves and fashionable vapors things of course   phoebe vapors and weak nerves why can it be a fashion to be sick   lisetta o lord as i told you before it is downright ungenteel to be otherwise your ruddy complexions and active limbs may do very well for a dairy maid in the country but here they are perfectly unnecessary nay absolutely improper lard mam it is as unfashionable for a fine lady to be without a complaint as it is to be out of debt   phoebe the more i observe your manners here the more they surprise me  but were it not possible madam that colin might be concealed some where hereabouts that he may overhear our intercourse   lisetta undoubtedly madam but for what purpose does your ladyship intend    phoebe the dearest in the world revenge   lisetta that is indeed a most delicious morsel and the injustice he has done you by his suspicions deserves the worst of mortifications from your hands   phoebe well lisetta i leave that management to you the prince will be delighted with it adieu i shall attend his highnesss pleasure  exit lisetta if colin blames me now it is not without reason but i will still surprise him more alas why did i come hither is it the air i breathe which poisons all my peace at home my only thought was mirth for there all was tranquillity pleasure and happiness  air xxv when far from fashions gilded scene i breathed my native air my thoughts were calm my mind serene no doubtings harbored there but now no more myself i find distraction rends my breast while hopes and fears disturb my mind and murder all my rest  enter emily clara emily so clara i still find her here you see the so much boasted charms of the country will i fear lose all their relish after the splendor of a court   clara love madam is undoubtedly very intoxicating and it is no wonder if the addresses of a prince turn the brain of an ignorant village lass  air xxvi flattering hopes the mind deceiving easy faith too often cheat woman fond and all believing loves and hugs the dear deceit noisy show of pomp and riches cupids trick to catch the fair lowly maids too often bewitches flattery is the beautys snare  emily to phoebe so then you will not leave us yet the court has stronger attractions than you were aware of phoebe   phoebe alas madam did it depend upon my choice i would be far off the pleasures of this place are lost upon me they are too artificial for us simple folks who are the servants of nature   emily quit then as fast as you can a place so contrary to your manners i would not delay a moment alas why cannot i shake off this troublesome pomp and pageantry of courts  air xxvii what is all the pomp of gaudy courts but vain delights and tinsel toys while pleasure crowns your rural sports with calm content and tranquil joys  clara o lard madam how pretty must it be to wander along by the flowery banks of murmuring rivers and to breath the delightful fragrance of the meadows oh it is a paradise on earth  air xxviii return sweet lass to flocks and swains where simple nature mildly reigns where love is every shepherds care and every nymph is kind as fair the court has only tinsel toys insipid mirth and idle noise but rural joys are ever new while nymphs are kind and shepherds true  phoebe upon my word ladies you reason excellently well in your turn i perceive the advice of every body flows from selfinterested motives you would most obligingly inform me that my presence displeases you madam i heartily believe it  but now i think on it i cannot go yet it is absolutely impossible i have a particular engagement with the prince   emily with the prince   phoebe yes with the prince oh you will laugh exceedingly    emily laugh i laugh how   phoebe the prince you know is in love with you   emily sighs and what then   phoebe then  why he desires an interview with me   emily which you have granted i suppose   phoebe oh doubtless it is not for folks in such an humble situation as mine to refuse so great an honor and indeed after so many instances of friendship and protection it were a sin to deny so small a request but i see madam you are discomposed   emily who i

entire neglect of me well heaven be thanked i am not quite friendless yet the goodnatured gentlewoman who brought me hither has promised to place me where i may overhear all and if i find my suspicions true i know how to be revenged for the trick she has played me yes i will give vent to my anger yes thou cruel hardhearted phoebe i will tell you to your face that you are a false ungrateful hussy and then  i will go and hang myself and then  you shall never see me more  but yonder is the fine lady my friend and guide  lord lord how my heart beats how i dread the event   exit
