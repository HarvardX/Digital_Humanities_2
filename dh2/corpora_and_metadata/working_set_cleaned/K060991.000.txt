the experiment or the shortest way with the dissenters exemplified being the case of mr abraham gill a dissenting minister in the isle of ely and a full account of his being sent for a soldier by mr

bragg at the blueball in avemarylane mdccv  to the queen madam this dedication is not so much a compliment to your person as an appeal to your justice  your protestant dissenting subjects have your sacred promise of protection they behaving themselves dutifully and peaceably to your government and obedient to the laws and madam as they cannot be so ignorant of their own happiness under your gentle government or so blind to their own interest as to forfeit your favor by any breach of their duty so they cannot doubt of the full performance on your majestys part of all that your majesty has been graciously pleased to assure them of under the sanction of your royal word  the toleration of their religious liberty has been secured to them by law and your majesty has been pleased to add to the force of that law your royal word that it shall be inviolably preserved  your majestys protestant dissenting subjects lay at your feet the following relation with all humility appealing to your royal judgment whether both their toleration is not herein violently invaded and your majestys honor and sacred promise at least attempted to be violated in the illegal arbitrary methods made use of to oppress one of their ministers and suppress an assembly of several hundreds of your loyal and peaceable dissenting subjects  they remonstrate and in the humblest manner complain to your majesty of the violence and horrid practices made use of to defame persecute imprison and ruin a man whose principal visible crime is serving god according to his conscience and teaching the same to others they humbly present themselves at your royal feet as wounded through the sides of this injured person and are your majestys humble petitioners that you will be graciously pleased to testify your dislike of the oppressions and injustice of their enemies in such manner as to your great wisdom shall seem meet  in your majestys favor and justice they hope for exemplar animadversions on these unchristian practices and have a full confidence in your royal promise that they shall not be abridgd of nor ill treated for that liberty which being settled first by the laws of god and nature and since that by the laws of this land is their legal right and which your majestys just sense of its reasonableness has moved you to resolve to maintain  they humbly commit themselves and their cause to your majestys protection imploring your royal regard so far and no farther as every article advanced in their behalf in this book is positively and exactly conformable to truth and direct meaning being at all times ready to come forth and confront even in your royal presence all the allegations to the contrary  having thus publicly appealed to god and your majesty they can no longer doubt either of the blessing from above or the protection and assistance of your majesty below and as your throne has been a famous refuge to apprest innocence and virtue in all nations so they doubt not but your own subjects shall yet have the honor and happiness of your powerful protection as far as justice and law is on their side  nor are they the less confident of your majestys protection for their differing in judgment from some few points professed and practiced by the church of england of which your majesty is the glorious head since the evils they complain of are suffered not from the church of england as such whom they honor and with whom they covet to live in charity union and peace but by ill men who making the church religion and the honor of god their pretense have broken all the laws of god nature humanity and their native country in a most unheard of and unaccountable manner to the reproach of the protestant religion in general and to the scandal of the church they pretend themselves members of  neither your majesty nor the church of england will be offended at us for endeavoring to bring our actions to the test of the law and for seeking the protection of your royal justice  your majesty oppresses none of your subjects the doctrine of the church of england has been declared to be inconsistent with persecution the actions of these men therefore however sheltered under your authority and the wings of the church will appear to your majesty affrontive of your goodness and highly derogating from the christian spirit the church of england professes the truth of which we humbly submit to your majestys wisdom to discover and to your justice to resent as you shall find cause  and are etc  lately published the double welcome a poem to the duke of marlborough by the author of the trueborn englishman sold by b bragg at the blueball in avemarylane  introduction in the unhappy differences between the highchurch party and the dissenters it has happened as it generally does in all heats and animosities of parties that both sides pretend to be in the right and both pretend to be abused by the other  the warm men of the church have charged the dissenters with associating to destroy and undermine the church how they have made good their charge is not the business of this paper and has been examined elsewhere  the dissenters charge the other with insulting them persecuting them and invading their toleration  great endeavors have been used to defend the occasional bills from a charge of persecution and whether they have done that or no we need not dispute but refer to the conferences on that head between the houses and which are published in print  but to leave all doubtful cases to stand and fall by the force of their own truth i cannot think the world ought to be ignorant of the following story that all unbiased people may see by this specimen what these gentlemen would do with the dissenters if it lay in their power and how justly they have been charged with designs to hang banish and destroy the dissenters and reward their ministers with the gallows and the galleys  and because i am going to present the world with a new devil of loudon with a story so black in all its parts so much the picture of hell and so aggravated with inhumane and unchristian circumstances that all that read it must blush for their native country to think such unheard of villainies could be acted in it crimes so abhorred by mankind that though they call themselves of the church we shall find all the true members of the church whether judges justices bishops yea even jaylors themselves abhorring it while i say i have such a scene before me and knowing what sort of people i have to do with i shall take such an exact care to have every thing that is here advanced so attested with undeniable evidence that impudence it self not the hellish actors not the blindest advocates not the devil himself shall dare to reply to it  slander and lies fly befoe truth as mist before the sun and this hellish association formed against an innocent man though laid as deep as hell and prosecuted through all the barbarous extremes of forgery perjury violence subornation insults and revenge yet at last all dwindles away before truth innocence breaks out like the sun through a dark cloud the light of truth is so clear that devils shun it monsters fly from it and men of guilt and blood hide their heads at its appearance  and as i should not have attempted this relation had i not had good and undoubted testimony of the truth of every article so i write with the greater assurance since i can frankly defy the most hardened advocate of such a wretched cause to confront the least or minutest circumstance  such direct testimony such just authorities such authentic proofs of every article are before me that no man could ever desire to have his reputation vindicated with more clearness in the face of the sun  as for the treatment this poor injured man has met with i would be glad the worst enemy in the nation would give it a name and tell us wiht some little reason at the same time what to call it  i would have them rummage foxs history of the popish persecutions and tell us where they can match the usage this man has met with and let us know where ever bishop gardener or bloody bonner acted like these men  let them show us such an ecclesiastical magistrate as parson eern and where ever englishmen have been thus treated  well might the parliament pass a bill to qualify justices of the peace if this be the fruit of putting church parsons into commissions of the peace never let hudibras tell us of the cobbler of new england who served his country in a double capacity to preach and cobble   to let the reader gradually into this black story it is necessary to inform him that in several public printed books as well as in common discourse the town has been possessed with a story of a dissenting minister in the isle of ely who first forged episcopal orders and preached in the church but being detected in that pretended classical ordination and set up a conventicle but being prosecuted as a scandalous fellow having two or three wives four or five bastards having once broke out of derby jayl played a great many villainous pranks and being a common drunkard and swearer the justices took him up as a vagabond listed him for a soldier and sent him away to cambridge where having been arrested for debt and thereby got out of the officers hands some complaints being made by the dissenters at the injustice of this  the party greet them by way of answer with prodigious calumnies and insolent reproaches of the man himself to vindicate the most villainous unheard of proceedings that ever this nation knew  and as the abominable insolence of their actions happened to receive a due censure from the best lord chief justice and of the most unspotted character this age has known let us see how this person as well as the poor sufferer is treated on this account by that man of fury and satyr mr d in the preface to his lampoon called moderation displayed  inveighing against our men of moderation in the church he says nay so tender are they of their dissenting brethren that i am told it has lately been delivered as law by a great man in whall that a notorious perjured vagabond with two wives at once being possessed of a separate congregation though without any license or legal qualification to preach to them shall for that reason only be exempt from the late act for listing vagrants  now if upon reading these sheets it should so fall out that after all that has been done or said to or of this poor injured man it should appear too plain for the most hardened lampooner or most impudent churchjustice to deny that this is all malice forgery and injustice and as all the judges of the queensbench expressed it the deepest track of villainy that ever came before them what will these men say for themselves and how will they make satisfaction to god or man to the affronted dissenters to their own exposed party and to the poor injured man that has been inhumanely treated  if after all their clamor and barbarous orders i make it appear that this man never broke out of derby or any other jayl never forged any orders but was fairly ordained by a church of england bishop ws never perjured or a vagabond had never two wives at once nor any bastards was never seen to be drunk or known to swear but that on the contrary has been always a sober virtuous and peaceable liver a constant resident at his cure for eleven or twelve years together a man of charity and good conversation and in short not in the least guilty of one of the crimes charged on him but that it has been all forgery malice and conspiracy to ruin him merely for his quitting the church and turning to the dissenters  if this should happen to be made out as i fairly undertake it shall i crave leave to draw these two inferences    those dissenters who too hastily believed and too readily handed on the clamours and slanders against an innoceut man through whose sides they were all wounded and aimed it ought to acknowledge their want of consideration and caution it is true it may be said in their excuse they could not have imagined the earth had borne such monsters and that such a cloud of clamours could never be all forged and therefore in charity to the churchmen they were drawn in to censure an innocent man for which they ought to ask his pardon and restoring him to their just opinion more diligently guard for the future his injured reputation    as to the forgers of all this and the authors of a treatment too foul to relate and blacker than the ink i write it with i leave their character to season the palate of the reader after he has been filled with horror at some of the most villainous actions the world ever heard of the matter of fact is as follows  the case of mr abraham gill etc abraham gill the subject of the ensuing tragedy was a minister of the church of england he was born in rivington in the county of lancaster had his education partly among the dissenters but last of all in the university of oxford where he commenced bachelor of arts of brazennose college  from whence conforming to the church of england he entered into holy orders and was admitted by the present right reverend the bishop of chester  and because his enemies have had the face to charge him with forging the bishops orders we think it necessary that we may clear every thing as we go along having abundance of dark things to expose and hellish conduct to lay open to draw this scene before we proceed and to tell them that the very original orders signed by the bishop of chesters own hand and sealed with his seal is left with the rest of the vouchers of this horrid transaction at mr john skeys tobacconist at the blackboy and three tobaccopipes at queenhithe where all the world friends or enemies are promised a free and uninterrupted opportunity to see them and detect the forgeries if they are to be found  and that it may not be alleged this freedom of offering a sight of the originals is but a presumptive proof supposing no man will trouble himself to examine them  though the willingness of some gentlemen to expose the dissenters in this honest mans cause suggests otherwise yet eternally to stop the mouth of the most prepossessed malice a reverend clergyman of their own church is to be found honest enough to do justice to an injured man and give a sanction to the truth  this gentleman is one who entered into orders with mr gill and five ministers more at the same time and has honestly sworn it which affidavit is left also with the rest of the vouchers at the place aforesaid and now if these orders are counterfeit or forged it may fairly be seen and mr gill be exposed but if not let the world match the villainous usage this poor man has met with if they can  after this demonstration of the certainty and undoubted truth of his orders it is humbly desired of all those gentlemen that shall for the future charge him with forging episcopal orders that they would be pleased to show their faces that we may see if they do not blush and that they would tell us their names that after some few examples of this sort made for satisfaction to justice and the law out of the great number of those that are already detected they may be recorded as they deserve among those that bear false witness against their neighbors  to proceed to the history of mr gill after he had thus entered into orders he preached as curate at maney in the isle of ely about    miles from wisbich  while he officiated in this place he was well received and beloved of his congregation and we never find any complaint made of him save that he set an ill example to his neighbors of the clergy by invading the custom of the country and preaching twice a day to the people  having been two years in maney he received an invitation from the inhabitants of welney or welneth a hamlet in the parish of upwell in the same county to preach in a certain privileged independent chapel in this parish the right of the place empowering the inhabitants to choose their own minister  after long and earnest solicitations from the inhabitants of wilney and with the consent of his former hearers he agreed to go to wilney and accordingly went and settled with his family in the parsonagehouse or tenement belonging to the said chapel  the freedom with which the inhabitants of wilney invited mr gill to be their curate appeared in their cheerful assisting him in his removal thither and preparing a feast for his reception all the neighbors in general meeting him to bid him welcome  about a fortnight or threeweeks after his settlement at wilney the reverend dr gregg rector of upwell came to pay him a visit thanked him for coming to the said chapel and declared that he was glad his parishioners were like to be so well served  in this chapel mr gill continued about seven years viz from the year      to the year   0  preaching twice a day and conforming in all things to the usage of the church of england but in process of time being dissatisfied in his conscience at the use of the liturgy he began at several times to omit such part of the service as he disliked till at last his scruples increasing he wholly omitted the common prayer applying himself only to the pulpit and conceiving he was not under equal obligation as if preaching in a parish church the chapel he preached in being wholly independent a privileged place and in the power of the people  as this was the original of all the subsequent malice of the churchclergy and of the barbarous proceedings of which we are to give an account so they are hereby fairly challenged to produce one shadow of a crime in his behavior which humane frailty excepted appears wholly blameless and which we shall produce such testimonials to justify as few of the clergy of the church can produce more and such as indeed no honest man need desire better  if this offense were as great as they would suppose it to be it yet admits of much to be said in extenuation as i his scruples of conscience which would not permit him to continue the exercise of the common prayer and ceremonies at least not in all parts   his officiating in a private independent chapel in which as before he thought himself not obliged to an exact and complete conformity  but to oblige our adversary well suppose it as heinous a crime as they can pretend to yet they will have enough to do to make it out that their proceedings with him have been legal rational just or humane and for the truth of this suggestion we refer to the particulars and freely make all unprejudiced members of their own church the judges this independency of the chapel of wilney will in some measure appear as follows  dr gregg the rector of upwell understanding that mr gill omitted the common prayer came to him and told him he was sorry he mr gill did not hold to his principles etc and that he must therefore dispossess him and put in another curate  but mr gill replied he was not nor ever had been his curate and that it was not in his dr greggs power to dispossess him and therewith mr gill showed the doctor his authority for holding the place which satisfied dr gregg so that he never offered him the least disturbance afterward  after some time dr gregg died and the rectory of upwell was given to one mr hubbart but he being a weakly man and in a deep consumption he put in a curate to officiate viz one mr hugh james  this mr james finding his parishioners flocking after mr gill and but few caring to hear him he expressed his displeasure frequently in threatening and malicious speeches against mr gill but the incumbent mr hubbart being a pious and peaceable man would not permit him to molest mr gill during his life but this was not long for in about a year and a half the said mr hubbart the rector of upwell died and the living was then given to the said curate mr hugh james  as this mr james was a man both of a different temper and character from his two honest predecessors he resolved to strain his authority to the utmost in order to dispossess mr gill  the first step he took in this undertaking was that about the  he comes to wilney on a lords day and demands the pulpit for the morning mr gill quietly permitted him to preach which he did or rather rail at an uncommon rate against mr gill bending his whole discourse to set out the heinous sin of omitting the holy ceremonies and telling mr gill from the pulpit that he ought to lie at the chapeldoor for three or four months in sackcloth not daring to tread upon that consecrated ground begging the people to pray to god for him to forgive him that sin and to prove this quoted as we are told several popish writers but not one text of scripture as can be remembered running on in such a virulent style and unsuitable manner that many of the inhabitants could not bear to hear him but went out of the chapel  in the afternoon there was no sermon for the said mr james rector of upwell gave notice to the people to meet him after dinner at an alehouse where he treated them with liquor and as a place more proper for the subject preached the second part to his morning sermon and bestowed another plentiful storm of ill language on mr gill desiring the inhabitants to set their hands to a letter petition or paper written to the bishop in order to get mr gill turned out but they all unanimously refused him  being disappointed in his expectations and having spent his breath as well as ale to no purpose he went as is reported that very night to ely and the next week to london to complain against mr gill to the bishop of norwich  the inhabitants of wilney having discovered the design and being very loath to part with their minister importuned mr gill to draw up a petition to the lord bishop of norwich in order to prevent mr james from obtaining his malicious design  mr gill at the desire of his congregation did draw up the said petition which was signed by near  0 hands of the inhabitants of wilney and sent up to the lord bishop of norwich by the post who received it as is supposed before the said mr james got thither  soon after the arrival of the petition the rector mr james came up to the bishop and makes his complaint against mr gill desiring he might be dismissed but his lordship as mr james himself has reported answered that he had heard a very good report of the said mr gill from his neighborhood that by the right of the place the choice of a minister was in the inhabitants and they testifying to his behavior he could not dismiss him or credit the accusation of one man against the unanimous voice of the whole town or words to that effect but in short he rejected the request of mr james and refused to censure or dispossess mr gill  mr james finding himself disappointed here applies himself to the spiritual court at norwich and about may   0  procures a citation against mr gill to appear at norwich mr gill obeyed the citation very readily appeared at norwich and retained one mr batchelour as his proctor to manage his defense  mr james finding himself still defeated and not venturing to proceed in the bishops court at norwich let drop his citation and ceased his prosecution till about august   0  when he served mr gill with another citation  while this was depending mr gill going to cambridge to vote in the election of knights of the shire being possessed of a glebe to the chapel as a freehold came into the company of sir r jengs knight who pretending friendship to mr gill and his neighbors who were there present began to persuade them to part quietly and lovingly and to avoid continual fewds persuaded mr gill to quit the chapel of wilney as a place not worth so much fewd and contest and upon his doing so he promised he would engage on the behalf of mr james the suit in the spiritual court should go no farther  mr gill consented and though much against the minds of the inhabitants agreed to leave wilney and depending on the promise of sir r jengs omitted any regard of the suit at norwich where for want of his appearing and that worthy knight breaking his word with him they proceeded to excommunication against him  mr gill having thus quitted his charge had a call from lincolnshire to a dissenting congregation which call after some time he accepted and accordingly removed to go thither and here it is necessary to advertise the reader that mr gill was so far from a hasty flight or any precipitance in his remove that he was near ten weeks resolving removing and settling his family in lincolnshire  in this interval and when it is plain these gentlemen themselves knew every day where to find mr gill and that he was frequently in the town of wilney and never concealed himself or absconded from any body yet even then one of the most impudent forgeries that can be paralelled in this age was practiced upon him viz to publish in the gazette that the said mr gill was fled from justice having been detected of forgery etc  and because the barefaced piece of villainy shall admit no misconstruction we have here transmitted it to the world word for word as it stands in the gazette and as care will speedily be taken to make the proper persons account for it  as follows gazette thursday nov      0  advert

complexion bold and confident in conversation strong voice a northcountry pronunciation writing a clerklike hand as having been sometime employed under an attorney traveling the country with a woman and three or four children some time since forged letters of orders under the hand and episcopal seal of the lord bishop of chester and for some time officiated as curate at welney in the isle of ely belonging to the rectory of upwell in norfolk until the forgery was detected for which and other wicked and scandalous practices being prosecuted in the consistory court at norwich he fled from justice since which time he has forged other letters of orders under the bishop of elys hand and episcopal seal which were discovered to be counterfeit upon his producing them at bollingbrook in lincolnshire where he offered himself to be curate upon which being again taken into custody he has again made his escape all clergymen are therefore desired not to entertain the said gill as a curate or suffer him to perform any holy office and whoever gives notice of him so as he may be secured to mr hugh james rector of upwell or to mr robert clark proctor in norwich shall have a good reward for the same    mr gill has been informed this black piece of malice had its birth in jesus college in cambridge concerted there between dr cook dr james mr lateward and their confederates but as he is not positive in that he shall be glad of an occasion to ask their pardon for the suggestion when they shall have purged themselves honorably from the suspicion and till then thinks the grounds he has for his opinion are sufficient to clear him of any breach of charity in believing it  mr gill was with his family upon the road from wilney into lincolnshire when this publication was first made and coming to boston on a thanksgivingday he rested and went to the dissenting meeting to hear the sermon when after sermon mr keeling the minister took him home to his house and showed him the gazette with the aforesaid advertisement in it  mr gill surpised at the reading of this gazette as he well might immediately took horse leaving his family in boston and resolved to go to cambridge where he expected to find out the bottom of the matter  in this place it will be necessary to leave mr gill a while and the reader may suppose him traveling to cambridge with a heart full of trouble to see himself persecuted with so much malice and in hopes to find out his enemies and their design and while he is on the road let us enquire upon what sorry and sandy foundation all this fabric of malice and folly was erected which will at last tend to lessen the wonder at the authors being confounded in their own devices  there had been a man in derby jayl whose name was gill  but to avoid all possible cavil it is noted his name was not abraham gill but stephen clifford alias gill this man having been committed for forging holy orders and counterfeiting the coins and convicted of both had broke out of the county jayl at derby and was fled from justice  mr james the rector of upwell having been informed of this by his attorney immediately fixes it upon mr gill and he must be the man and to bring this plot to a head takes the pains about june   0  to send to derby and informing the jailer there that his prisoner was found procures two men to be sent from derby to seize him and so sure was he of his game that he openly gave it out that mr gill had broke out of jayl and he should be hanged  accordingly the two men sent by the jailer came over to wilney and pretending extraordinary business with mr gill sent for him to an alehouse in wilney mr gill went boldly as innocently to them and as they were strangers and had pretended business he wondered they discoursed with him of several things treated him courteously paid the reckoning but never spoke a a word of any business to him only frequently whispered together and left him  the truth of this after came out and mr brookhouse jailer of derby discovered the whole affair to mr gill how and on what pretense the two men were procured to be sent from derby whose business with him was to have apprehended him but the reason of their leaving him as they did was because they found he was not that man  by this discovery mr gill came to know that mr jamess assistant in this new plot was one thomas johnson an attorney of outwell a man of ill fame and foul practice who positively affirmed to the two men that came from derby that mr gill was the same man that broke out of derby jayl  this delusion might in some measure have pleaded in excuse of mr james if his next scene had not put him out of the reach of any rational shelter or defense for not content with this defeat he joined with this infamous attorney and one tho beart who since died in a most horrible manner rotting away above ground these three went to one john marriot of upwell and offered to give him  0 pounds or to guineas if he would swear that mr gill was the same man that had broke out of derby jayl for forgery and counterfeiting  but here they were defeated again and heaven the only protector of innocence so blinded their understanding that they always made an ill choice of their instruments honest john marriot told them plainly he knew mr gill was not the same man and asked them with what face they could desire him to burden his conscience with a false oath or fell his soul for  0 guineas  by this time the reader is to suppose mr gill arrived at cambridge where having been above    days and all that while walking publicly about the streets and openly enquiring about the notice in the gazette he received a message from the vice chancellor of cambridge to come to him to jesus college whither confirmed and assured of his own innocence he freely went  coming to the college dr cook demanded his name which mr gill readily told him and the place of his last residence and preaching viz at wilney dr cook told him that he was described in the gazette and upon the advertisement therein he must send him to jayl which he accordingly did on the   th of march to the tolhooth in cambridge by a mittimus in the following words or to that effect to the keeper of the tolbooth goal at cambridge these i send you herewith the body of abraham gill whom i charge you to keep till discharged by due course of law  signed will cook    thus without any proof that he was the man mentioned in the gazette without any oath or any crime alleged mr gill was committed to prison by the worthy dr cook of which it is presumed he may hear again in a different manner than this  nor was the sending him to prison the end of their malice but as soon as he came thither he had heavy irons laid upon him and was fettered like a fellon or a highwayman  at the general quarter sessions mr gill being called and dr cook sitting on the bench the dr told him mr gill they had nothing to charge him with he told them then they had done him a great deal of wrong to keep him in custody so long and treat him so hardly and loading him with irons and as they had now nothing against him he hoped they never would and therefore prayed they would discharge him  notwithstanding all this they remanded him to prison dr cook alleged he had a letter from mr james rector of upwell full of crimes against mr gill in which letter it seems he desired mr gill might be kept close prisoner till the next quarter sessions  in obedience to this command of mr james dr cook endeavored to keep mr gill in prison but the barbarity of this treatment appearing so exceeding great and the action so foul that the country began to talk of it some gentlemen of the country having spoken of it to dr cooks disadvantage which coming to his ears he was at last prevailed upon to accept of bail for mr gill two eminent freeholders of that conuty of  0 l per ann each offering to be his bail  the bail being such as could not be objected against the dr let him go binding his bail in  0 l each and himself in   0 l to appear at the quarter sessions  this usage of mr gill with the fury and barbarity of their curate and rector had so wrought upon the inhabitants of upwell together with the known innocence of their minister that it filled them with just prejudices and they unanimously invited mr gill to come and preach to them as a congregation dissenting from the church which he did duly licencing the place in the archdeacons court at norwich and duly qualifying himself according to law  from whence the author of these sheets humbly observes and recommends it to the consideration of the clergy of the church of england whether such unjust and cruel treatment of their fellow christians neighbors and brethren is the way to confirm the people in their adherence to the church of england or whether they do not rather wound the church drive their parishioners from her fill them with prejudices and increase the number of the dissenters in this nation  mr gill being thus settled among his old people and knowing that he was to appear at the quarter sessions where he had good reason to expect all the foul usage his enemies were capable of and where he saw their power was but too great was advised to remove it by certiorari to the queensbench which he did accordingly the certiorari being allowed in court and the fees of it paid by mr gill  but mr james and mr lateward the curate hearing of this certiorari they or one of them went to cambridge at the assize and applying themselves to my lord chief justice holt by the means of dr cook and dr james they procured a habeas corpus to remove mr gill to norwich jayl pretending they could prove matter of fact against him there  accordingly he was committed to norwich jayl for felony forgery trespass contempt and other high crimes and misdemeanors  here the said mr gill lay till the assizes and still his enemies being able to bring nothing against him he moved by his conncil to be discharged and was discharged accordingly by order of the court which order is there to be seen upon record  here he was credibly informed mr james and mr lateward striving by some other machinations and conspiracies to have continued mr gill in jayl to the next assizes received a severe reprimand from the lord bishop of norwich for their unjust and inhumane treatment of mr gill and that his lordship threatened them with suspension upon that account  also that mr clark the register of the spiritual court at norwich being inquired of concerning his name being put into the advertisement in the gazette as that he would give a reward for the apprehending mr gill declared it was done without his privity or consent and that it was a mere genuine forgery that he knew nothing of it but that it was as strange and surprising to find his name there as it could be to mr gill to see his there  thus being returned to his people mr james and mr lateward whom henceforward in charity to them i shall conceal under the title of the conspirators theratned him that if he presumed yet to preach there he should be sent to prison again but he continuing to do his duty it remains to examine how punctual they were to their words with him  about the   th of april   0  one thomas pitchford constable of wilney served a warrant on mr gill under the hand of tho edwards esquire a justice of the peace for the isle of ely the warrant requiring the said constable to bring mr gill before him etc the  0th of the same month at wisbich  the constable having served his warrant took mr gills word for his appearing but mr lateward one of the conspirators came in a great passion and railing at the constable told him he must keep mr gill close prisoner till his appearnce for that then he should certainly go to jayl and if he went away from him he the constable should go to jayl in his room and more ill language to the like effect however the constable still took mr gills word for his appearance  on the  0th of april being a sessions the said mr gill appeared according to his promise at wisbich where was present   or   justices several gentlemen some clergy men and the conspirators  mr l one of the conspirators called the constable to bring up gill his prisoner upon which mr gill readily appeared the conspirators immediately told their tale and giving mr gill base and scurrilous language according to their particular talent which abounds that way they informed the justices that mr gill bred great disturbances in the parish by a conventicle as conventicles did all england over which by the way might be the only truth they spoke for it seems by these very words he bred no more disturbance with his conventicle than other ministers did with theirs ergo they should be all served so shortest way for that  mr edwards one of the justices taking up the cause told mr gill he was informed he kept an unlawful assembly or conventicle at upwell and gave him a great deal of rough and threatening language  mr gill with calmness and respect replied he owned he kept a meeting for religious worship at upwell in the county of norfolk but that it was no unlawful assembly for the place was licensed according to law and he had qualified himself as the law directs and therefore hoped he did not deserve to receive such abuse in that place  the justice then demanded to see the license by which the said mr gill held the meeting which he producing both the conspirators said in open court it was forged and whether the court believed them or no is uncertain or what other reason they had for it will be inquired in another place but they immediately made a mittimus and committed mr gill to the jayl in wisbich  for forging a license and preaching in a conventicle and taking the license from him they refused to restore it him  they demanded indeed bail but gave him no leave to find it refusing to let him stir out of the place but mr gill may without detriment to his cause allow all their pretensions of bail for his behavior since the treatment he had received from them was such as he might be sure whoever he had brought to be his bail should be brought into equal trouble and for that reason he resolved to embroil none of his friends  and being sensible of no crime for which he ought by the law to be bound to his behavior he was advised not to offer any bail and refer it to the law still to decide whether  it could be justly demanded  the wisdom as well as justice of these magistrates is very remarkable also here that they should know no better than to commit a man in the isle of ely for a fact pretended to be committed in the county of norfolk all which will help to their consolation when they shall come to answer for it before a court and judges that understand the law  and as i undertook at first to prove every thing as i went along the following affidavit is an undoubted testimony of the truth of this last part of the tragedy viz of the conspirators charging him with forgery which they could not pretend to prove and their treating him with base scurrilous language though all of them are pleased to deny it upon oath mr coles affidavit joseph cole of upwell in the county of norfolk gent makes oath that abraham gill of welney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge is a preacher to a congregation of her majestys protestant dissenting subjects in upwell aforesaid having been a preacher in the said parish of welney for several years last past and that he is now and has all the time been well approved of his congregation and this deponent farther says that on or about the  0th day of april last past he saw the said mr gill brought before her majestys justices of the peace at wisbich in the said isle of ely by virtue of a warrant to answer the complaint of mr hugh james rector of upwell aforesaid and that at that time there was one mr lateward curate to the said mr james and mr james in presence and that the said mr lateward commanded the constable who then had the said mr gill in custody to bring up gill his prisoner which the constable did when and where mr james and mr lateward alleged that the said mr gill kept an unlawful conventicle and mr gill to justify the keeping of a lawful meeting for worship of god produced his license whereupon the said mr james and mr lateward affirmed that the said mr gill had forged the license and they gave the said mr gill very base unbecoming and scurrilous language which mr gill to my knowledge did not deserve nor did it become them to utter and afterward upon this way of complaint mr gill was committed to the jayt in wisbich aforesaid and this deponent verily believes that the said mr james and mr lateward have maliciously designed to ruin and undo the said mr gill and his family consisting of a wife and four small children for they have by several barbarous ways of prosecution utterly reduced the said mr gill and his family to poverty and this deponent verily believes that the said mr gill never gave either mr james or mr lateward any cause of offense nor did they or ever could they prove any cause of their malicious prosecution but this deponent verily believes that the cause of this malice of mr james and mr lateward against mr gill was because mr gill preached twice every lords day and they but once and mr gill was more diligent in his ministry and more charitable to the poor and better approved of in his place than they the said mr james and mr lateward are and this deponent farther says that mr gill has been a freeholder in the said parish for several years till about the   th of september   0  and that james holms of welney since deceased held in farm under mr gill for several years a parcel of land of mr gills freehold of the yearly rent of   l  0 s or thereabouts and that mr gill had other lands besides and lived in good fame and plenty amongst his neighbors and he the said mr gill is greatly beloved in the whole parish by all but a few that dare not displease the said mr james and mr lateward  joseph cole    in this condition mr gill remained a close prisoner without bail till the general quarter sessions which was about five days when he expected to be called and lawfully charged with some matter of misdemeanour or else to be discharged  but now the plot was ripe for execution and at the quarter sessions he was omitted and never called at all  the assizes followed in two days more viz april      0  when he designed to move for his discharge not doubting but he should find justice there as he had before at norwich  but the design was calculated to disappoint him here too and now the black scene opened for on the said   th of april being the first day of the assizes the conspirators had procured two justices in concert with themselves to come to wisbich though above  0 miles out of their own division  the names of these worthy gentlemen are  for they deserve to be recorded david rowland esquire and francis fern esquire and clerk for this gentleman is both clergyman and magistrate of whom we shall say no more till justice thinks fit to take cognizance of them and treat them as they deserve  these gentlemen who now made up the number of the conspirators to be four brought with them one captain marshal an officer in colonel lutterils regiment of marines in order to impress list and carry away this innocent man as a soldier by virtue of the law for listing vagabonds  there were several officers in the town who would have been very willing to have raised men and who stayed there for that purpose but the country had rung too loud of the injury done this poor man so that no officer that knew the circumstance could be imagined villain enough to confederate but this gentleman having the word of a justice of peace and a man of god made a magistrate might the more easily be imposed upon  upon the arrival of these gentlemen mr gill was sent for out of prison to the sign of the bell in wisbich all the conspirators being present the church justice began with him in base and villainous language as unbecoming his commission as his gown calling him disturber of the country and saucy fellow for answering for himself told him he was a drunkard a swearer and a great deal to the same purpose that he raised a conventicle in mr jamess parish impaired the congregation at the church which was a thing of bad consequence and ought to be suppressed and that he was not fit to live in the country but to serve her majesty and that therefore he should go for a soldier  this justice fern being justly ashamed of this treatment is pleased upon his oath to deny giving any ill language and therefore to make out that particular as we go take the following affidavit of an honest inhabitant of upwell who heard it cornelius neales affidavit cornelius neale of upwell in the isle of ely and county of cambridge carpenter makes oath that he at the time of abraham gills being impressed for a soldier to wit on or about the   th day of april a d   0  did see the said abraham gill in custody in a room at the sign of the bell at wisbich where was john bellamy esquire and francis fern clerk justice of peace for the said isle and another gentleman who as this deponent was informed was david rowland esquire another justice of peace for the said isle who after some base scurrilous and hasty words by them given to the said abraham gill then right or wrong ordered that he should go into her majestys service for a soldier and then caused the officer to tender him listingmoney after which they ordered the said officer to read the articles of war to him and this deponent did see the said abraham gill some time after with the rest of the impressed men  cornelius neale    there was present another justice of the peace one john bellamy esquire who at first vigorously opposed these gentlemen told them he found mr gill had a license and he verily believed it was a good one that if he mr gill was guilty of any crimes he ought to be tried for them and that now was a good time to do it in the judges being in town and the assizes begun and advised them to consider if their authority extended to pressing him for a soldier  this wholesome advice  which they may have leisure to repent they did not accept of they overruled they flew into some heat at mr bellamys arguing for him and told him though they were not in their own division yet they were justices there as well as he and expected that they had a power to act all over the isle and if they had any power they would try it for the said gill should be impressed and sent for a soldier and they would answer it  at which mr bellamy was overruled and joined with them  mr gill told them that besides his profession which he supposed exempted him from such an insult as that he had two qualifications expressly excepted in the act and which legally forbid them what they now purposed to do  first that he was a freeholder of england and secondly that he was a freeman of a corporation both which were expressly named in the act of parliament as qualifications excepted  justice bellamy urged again that these were material objections and asked him where he was a freeholder and for how much he told them he was a freeholder to the value of  0 l per ann land of inheritance in the county of lancaster where he was born and a freeman of the corporation of wigan  mr bellamy urged again that he should be remanded to prison till they could send to the place to be informed  but the plot was otherwise laid and they resolved he should go so they called captain marshal and ordered him to give him  0 s which mr gill refused then they ordered his name to be entered in a certificate for impressed men and the justices signed it and delivered him over to the capt and mr fern in particular called to the soldiers and bid them tear his band off and take him along with them and use him severely  in so many words which command the soldiers took care to execute for they carried him into a large room crowded with pressed men where he had nothing but straw to lie on and in this posture and place he remained sitting up in his clothes and boots for six or seven days and then was obliged to march on foot in his boots ridingcoat andc to downham    miles and from thence to ely    and thence to cambridge  0 or     for the proof of this matter and how cunningly and industriously these men acted some to get out of the room and avoid signing the certificate of his impressing and others to sink and conceal the certificate it self in order to smother an action they were justly ashamed of the following affidavits are necessary to be examined  capt henry marshal of col alexander lutterels regiment of marines makes oath that in pursuance of a late act of parliament john brown thomas gibson and abraham gill on the twenty sixth day of april last past were brought before mr rowland mr pearson mr bellamy and mr fern four of her majestys justices of the peace for the isle of ely in the county of cambridge who thought them the said brown gibson and gill to be proper persons to serve as soldiers under her majesty queen ann thereupon as the said act directs a tender was made by this deponent to them the said brown gibson and gill of twenty shillings each in the presence of the aforesaid justices which the former accepted and the last refused and this deponent farther says that the certificate for the said three soldiers was lodged in the hands of one of the clerks belonging to one of the aforesaid justices in order to be registered but is since lost or mislaid and the said clerk in whose hands it was so lodged alleges that he left it with the said mr bellamy who owned to this deponent that he had a copy of the said certificate but denied that he had the original  h marshal  this affidavit charging some of the clerks the certificate we shall trace it thither and first justice bellamy owns he had a copy but denies that he had the original  in the next place the clerk to justice colvill swears that in his presence all the justices agreed mr gill should be listed and that he should be delivered to capt marshal and ordered him to draw up the certificate which he did but did not see it signed the copy of which is as below  john rawlett of thorney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge clerk to ralph peirson esquire one of her majestys justices of the peace for the said isle makes oath that at a meeting of several justices of the peace for the said isle and in particular of this deponents master josiah colvill david rowland esquires francis fern clerk and john bellamy esquires on or about the seven and twentieth day of april last it was agreed by the said justices that abraham gill of welneth in the said isle of ely who was then examined before the said justices should be lifted for a soldier as being a person according to their opinion liable thereto according to the late act of parliament for raising recruits for the land forces and marines and that the said gill should be delivered accordingly to capt henry marshal of the honorable col lutterels regiment of marines who was then present and tendred the said abraham gill twenty shillings for listing money in this deponents presence and this deponent says that the said justices ordered this deponent to draw up a certificate of the same according to the directions of the said act of parliament the articles of war against mutiny and desertion being also then read by the said capt marshal to the said abraham gill and this deponent did accordingly draw up a certificate as also of the listing of thomas gibson and john brown both of well in the same isle which at the desire of the said capt marshal was not sealed that night because he expected more soldiers and designed to put them all into one and the same certificate the day following and this deponent says that the paper hereunto annexed is the draught of the said certificate but this deponent going away in the morning following is not acquainted with what was farther done on the premises only that he left a copy of the said certificate behind him with the said mr bellamy  john rawlet  in pursuance of an act of parliament made in the second and third year of the reign of our sovereign lady anne by the grace of god of england scotland france and ireland queen defender of the faith etc for raising recruits of the land forces marines etc  we whose hands and seals are hereto set three of her majestys justices of the peace for the said isle do hereby certify that the following persons we listed according to the said act by captain henry marshal in the honorable colonel lutterels regiment of marines who did make tender of twenty shillings to the persons hereafter mentioned which they accepted of and that the said captain did read the articles of war against mutiny and dissertion to them in our presence  tho gibson of well in the said isle john brown de eadem abraham gill late de eadem  these three men above written were listed before us to return to mr gill the fateagne of this violent march reduced him to a very miserable condition his feet and legs galled and swelled with his boots and his blood as may be supposed surfeited and heated with unusual force beyond his strength  thus you have the history of his delivery over to the soldiers with whom and in the condition as above he came to cambridge where he was arrested for debt and so by one misfortune delivered from another  they used some attempts to clear him from this arrest but the debt appearing to be real and too much for them to discharge being    l   s   d they were forced to leave him in the tollbooth prison at cambridge  the conspirators who concluded their work was done and mr gill carried clear off were under no small disappointment when they heard he was gotten out of their hands and though they could not but know where he was yet in pursuit of their old design they issued hue and cry to apprehend him as a deserter from the queens service and mr fern the churchjustice signed the hue and cry this failing they issued a special private warrant to constables at upwell wilney and maney to make search for him and still the reverend mr fern s hand was to this also as by the warrant now secured and remaining with the constables of wilney will appear  it was now high time for mr gill to take sanctuary in the law and going to counsel in the case he was advised to move in the queens bench for a habeas corpus to discharge him from enrolling or listing in the army which he did and obtained it accordingly and also a rule of court for all the conspirators to show cause etc  and now these gentlemen having run their length the tables were turned and the time began to come when they must render an acount to her majesty and the law for all this oppression of her subjects contempt of her authority and abuse of the power put into their hands by the laws  the conspirators appeared at the queens bench court in westminster and moved for time and several motions being made alternately in order to bring in affidavits at last they found themselves so pressed by the course of the law that they were obliged to have recourse to their old stock of villainy they had worked upon before and formed a second conspiracy to bring mr gill into contempt of the court the detecting whereof will conclude this part of our history and the future rewards justice will bestow upon them for these things are reserved to their proper season and may serve for a second part of this account  after seven weeks imprisonment at cambridge mr gill having made up matters with his creditor was released and went home to his family at welney showing himself publicly and preaching every week to his congregation as usual for now the conspirators saw he was out of their power and whatever they did they must expect to account for  at last they moved the court that mr gill might appear in person to accuse them which was granted and appointed to be on the  th of july last  mr gills attorney sent him notice of this order and he immediately went for london and setting out on the  d of july in order to his appearing in the court with one mr tokelove in his company he was arrested on the road about   miles from his own house by one betts a bailiff in an island warrant at the suit of one john smith of downham  betts the bailiff holding him to bail carried mr gill to maypole a little village  0 miles from his own house mr gill being exceedingly surpised at this arrest knowing the consequence of his disappointment persuaded the bailiff to go back with him   miles to maney where he got some friends to be his bail  this ended the trifle of the arrest but the conspirators end was answered by it for by that time bail was given it was afternoon and there was no possibility of mr gills being in court at the time appointed which was the next morning being not able to ride all night nor to ride so hard as to reach to london time enough sending mr tokelove who was then with him forward to cambridge to make oath of what had passed which he did accordingly as will appear by his affidavit being above  0 miles so he went back to his own house  the court resented his default and the conspirators took care to have it improved to his disadvantage but before we come to relate the consequences of the contempt in court it is proper to examine the contrivances of this arrest and some subsequent management of the conspirators  when betts the bailiff first arrested mr gill he told him that this was a choke pare for him and was procured by mr lateward one of the conspirators to prevent his appearing at london  this was spoken in the hearing of mr tokelove who was then with mr gill as appears by the following affidavit richard tokelove of upwell in the county of norfolk yeoman makes oath that he this deponent came to mr abraham gills house at wellney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge on the third day of july ann dom one thousand seven hundred and four very early that morning and found him at home and that the said mr gill nor this deponent did not that day morning see nor speak with john betts the bailiff till he overtook and arrested the said mr gill on the bank road six miles from home or thereabonts he this deponent and the said mr gill being going for london and this deponent does farther say that the said john betts did then declare that the said mr gill was arrested by the procurement of one mr lateward intending for to stay his journey from attending the court  richard tokelove    betts the officer a man capable of being molded for the purpose of the conspirators not remembering what he had said at the time of the arrest changed his note quickly after  for the conspirators finding the plot had taken effect and that they had effectually prevented mr gill from appearing at the court the next step was to make the world believe this was a contrivance of his own and so throw their own villainy upon mr gill  accordingly they report that mr gill had caused himself to be arrested in order to get an excuse for his not going to london not daring to appear at the queens bench bar  and now that their engine may appear as black as themselves this mr betts the bailiff is made to swear   that he betts had a letter from mr smith the plaintiff at downham to him with orders to arrest mr gill and that this letter was of mr gills own writing but signed by mr smith   he swears that he received two several letters from mr gill directed to himself desiring him to arrest him that monday morning that he was to go to london in order to stop his journey   he swears mr gill called him up that morning in order to be arrested by him and that he brought him a blank warrant etc   though this comitragedy will be best related after this wretch has been brought to justice with his procurers the conspirators yet to finish this relation it is necessary to acquaint the world how this hardmouthed swearer is confronted  mr tokelove swears as before that he betts voluntarily declared at the time of the arrest that it was procured by mr lateward but this it is supposed was before he was made privy to the conspiracy and being afterward let into the secret forgetting what he had said confirmed the world in his own known character and verified the truth of that old saying opportet mendacem esse memoriam    mr smith of downham the plaintiff owns he gave leave to mr lateward to order mr gill to be arrested but swears he was desired so to do by an importunate letter from mr lateward as per his affidavit appears and being threatened in case of refusal john smith of downham in the county of norfolk yeoman makes oath that he this deponent received a letter by a messenger from mr lateward curateat welney to the best of this deponents remembrance the letter bares date about the latter end of june last the purport and meaning of the letter was to desire and indeed strongly to urge him this deponent to give the said mr lateward orders to arrest mr abraham gill minister to a dissenting congregation at upwell and the letter urged that mr gill must be arrested monday morning next after the date thereof by one or two a clock in the morning to prevent mr gills attending at london at a hearing between mr hugh james rector of upwell and mr gill and then mr james could have an advantage against mr gill the letter promised that his this deponents kindness should be well gratified if this deponent answered the request else mr lateward and his interest would take it unkindly and this deponent should loose their respect upon which this deponent gave order in writing by mr latewards messenger to arrest mr gill and use their pleasure according to law and this deponent is well satisfied they did order mr gill to be arrested and kept in custody about ten miles from home in his journey toward london and this deponent is credibly informed that the bailiff one betts has been often feasted and well fed by mr lateward and has constantly kept mr lateward company and rode about with him ever since and this deponent farther says that he saw mr gill upon the six and twentieth of this instant october who is very sick and has been so for a long time and is very weak unfit for going abroad and liker for death than life  john smith      mr tokelove swears he was with mr gill early in the morning the same day he was arrested and found him at home and never parted with him till he was arrested and that therefore it was impossible he should call at betts house as betts swears he did to have him arrest him and because mr tokeloves affidavit is very full and a confirmation of several things already advanced here we refer to the copy of it duly attested as follows richard tokelove of upwell in the county of norfolk yeoman makes oath that mr abraham gill of welney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge did never serve at welney chapel as curate to dr gragge or to any one else to his this deponents knowledge but was a preacher elected and chose by the congregation and feoffees in a time when the chapel was vacant and this deponents opinion is that it was in the said feoffees and congregations power to elect their minister and this deponent farther says that the said mr gill was a freeholder for several years in welney and lived in good fame and plenty all the time of two pious and sober rectors of the said parish and was well approved of both for doctrine charity and behavior and this deponent farther says that since mr james and mr lateward have been so malicious against mr gill he is elected and chosen a preacher to a dissenting congregation of protestants in upwell aforesaid and is able in doctrine religious and of sober life and conversation and highly approved of with his congregation and most of his neighbors and with most his acquaintance but mr james our present rector at upwell and mr lateward his curate as this deponent very believes envying the said mr gill and maliciously designing to ruin him and his family has scandalously maliciously and without cause spread abroad evil unjust and undeserving characters of the said mr gill which by strangers and persons remote and illwishers to the dissenting party may perhaps be believed as coming from such authors and this deponent farther says that it is his opinion that by insinuating speeches and threatenings the said mr james and mr lateward have caused the clerk one thomas fewlis who is a loose idle and wicked person to swear contrary to his knowledge and to the truth and that only for fear of losing his clerks place and their favor and this deponent the rather believes this because he has heard the said fewlis commend the said mr gill and set forth a quite contrarycharacter of him and this deponent farther says that the said mr james and mr lateward have given mr gill very unjust prosecution which has reduced him to poverty mr gill having been imprisoned at their complaint in several goals  viz at cambridge in march   0  and april may june and july   0  and removed to norwich goal and kept prisoner all the assize week till discharged the last day according to law and believes that he was entered in the goalers calender july   0  and after their threatening to imprison him again if he presumed to serve and preach to our congregation any more they have this last april persecuted and imprisoned the said mr gill and without showing cause of the imprisonment or giving any prosecution at sessions or assizes which was at the same time of his imprisonment at wisbech they caused him to be impressed out of goal for a soldier without liberty to make any defense when at the same time he was our minister and well approved of and highly beloved having as he may have still a very plentiful allowance for his maintenance that way of preaching as this deponent does apprehend being a lawful employment for a maintenance and his congregation is large consisting of gentlemen and very substantial freeholders as well as farmers so that by the way of prosecution not only mr gill but also this deponent and all the said congregntion are sufferers and in truth mr james did not only threaten and prosecute mr gill and procured him sent to goal and impressed for a soldier as aforesaid but positively sent to the meeting place though qualified according to law and threatened some of the congregation and especicially him this deponent and apprehended five several men by a warrant from mr upwood a justice of the peace and carried them like felons before the said mr upwood which persons although mr james is pleased to swear they were idle persons yet some were very substantial freeholders and the rest substantial farmers and very honest men and although mr james and mr lateward pretend no malice in their prosecution yet it is a real truth they have highly abused both mr gill and his congregation and constantly preach railing sermons as this deponent has heard and believes and they are reputed very malicious and troublesome men in the parish having excommunicated several men and totally ruined one mr whitworth our schoolmaster and in carrying on that malicious design against him both mr james and his curate did swear falsely against him at swaffam sessions as one of the grand jury has declared and affirmed and prosecuted the said mr whitworth till they banished him the town causing him to be impressed for a soldier as they did mr gill and this deponent says that it is credibly affirmed by one john marriot that they would have had him to have sworn that our minister mr gill was one mr gill a minister who escaped out of darby goal about six years since being convict for forging of holy orders and counterfeiting the kings coin although mr gill had been in this country about us nine or ten years but the said john marriot refused to go contrary to his conscience and this deponent farther says that mr gill was never reported to be a swearer or drunkard as is alleged in their affidavits and he verily believes he was never once seen to be drunk nor heard to swear one oath since he came into our country and this deponent is very positive that neither mr james nor any that made affidavits at present against mr gill have any intimate acquaintance or personal knowledge of the said mr gill excepting nicholas scott tho beart and tho fewlis which said thomas fewlis is overawed to swear to carry on and vindicate their unjust prosecution as this deponent believes and this deponent verily believes he would for a reward swear twice as much on mr gills behalf if requested and this deponent farther says that mr gill was coming the morning toward london being the third day of july about three a clock in the morning and was arrested upon the road in an action of debt at the suit of one john smith and is now in custody and held to bail and that the bailiff says the plaintiff was urged to arrest mr gill to prevent his attending the court that so mr james and mr lateward might obtain an advantage against him he is in custody at maypole ten miles from home  richard tokelove      mrs gill mr gills wife swears that her husband came home from the meeting on the evening before and did not stir out of his house till about two a clock monday morning when mr tokelove and he took horse together to go to london the same day he was arrested elizabeth gills affidavit elizabeth gill the wife of abraham gill of welney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge makes oath that upon sunday the second day of july a d   0  last past this deponents husband came home at evening from his congregation at upwell and after his coming home was never out of his house all that night till about one or two of the clock the next morning at which time richard tokelove of upwell came to call him in order to go on a journey with him toward london and this deponent says that her said husband did not see nor speak with john betts a bailiff at that time nor with any other and that this deponents husband and the said richard tokelove took horse together and went on their journey intending for london  elizabeth gill      mr gill himself who in this case is evidence for the queen swears that he neither wrote any letters to betts or called him up or ordered him to arrest him or procured any one else to order him or knew any thing directly or indirectly of this arrest till he was surprised by him on the road mr gills two affidavits abraham gill of welney in the isle of ely in the county of cambridge makes oath that he this deponent has seen two letters one dated the first and the other the second day of july   0  signed abra gill and also a letter dated july the  d   0  signed john smith as also a writing purporting to be a warrant for arresting this defendant and which said letters and warrant when this deponent saw the same were annexed to the affidavit of one john betts a bailiff produced in this honorable court and this deponent says that the said letters or warrant or any or either of them or any part of any or either of them or the name abra gill so signed to the two first of the said letters is not nor are of this deponents own handwriting nor were the said letters or warrant or either of them or any part of them or either of them writ by or with the order knowledge privity or procurement of this deponent and this deponent says that he was not in company with or did see or speak to or with the said john betts upon the said second day of july nor did this deponent call upon the said john betts next morning or see him till he overtook and arrested this deponent as this deponent was upon his journey toward london to attend this court and farther this depenent says that the said betts upon such arrest held this deponent to bail and this deponent and one thomas harrison as this deponents bail did seal and execute a bail bond accordingly in the presence of the said betts about one of the clock that day  abra gill  abraham gill of welney within the isle of ely in the county of cambridge makes oath that he was no way directly nor indirectly privy to nor concerned in procuring john betts to arrest him this deponent neither did he this deponent write any letter or letters to order it to be done as the said betts in his affidavit does falsely depose but this deponent was upon the road coming to london in obedience to a rule made in this honorable court to appear in the said court and was arrested by the said john betts who then affirmed to this deponent and one richard tokelove who then was with this deponent that the said arrest was by the procurement of mr john lateward on purpose to prevent this deponents journey or words to the like effect and this deponent farther makes oath that he has freehold lands in rivington in lancashire of the yearly value of eight or ten pounds and has had the same ever since the time of this deponents marriage being about fifteen or sixteen years last past  abra gill    now these four persons must all be forsworn or else this fellow has both perjured himself forged the letters and mr lateward one of the conspirators was the procurer and contriver of this arrest and mr gill is very willing to wait the conclusion the law will give to this affair when the world shall not fail of an impartial account of the particulars and indictment of perjury being ordered to be brought against the said betts for this matter  to confront this indeed mr lateward swears to the following affidavit full of negatives neithers and dont knows and all for himself too but that they may not complain of partiality his affidavit must not be omitted as follows john lateward of welney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge clerk aged twenty five years and upward makes oath that he this deponent never saw knew or had acquaintance with any such person as john smith of downham in norfolk yeoman nor did at any time ever write any letter or send any messenger to any such person as the said john smith concerning mr abraham gill either about arresting him or any wise else however nor did this deponent ever consent order or procure any person so to do in his this deponents name neither did this deponent ever hear of any such person as the said smith until after the said gill was arrested or pretended to be arrested and at liberty again nor did this deponent ever order the said gill to be arrested nor knew that he was arrested nor knew betts the bailiff which arrested the said gill till after such arrest if any was made and the said gill was again at liberty nor can this deponent any wise imagine how any letter should be wrote to the said smith or any messenger sent to him in this deponents name about arresting the said gill unless the same was done by the said gill or by some other in his behalf or by his procurement which he this deponent has good reason to believe and suspect has been done because as the said betts the bailiff who arrested the said gill has informed this deponent and also this deponent does believe has deposed that the said gill sent him a note to arrest him the said gill  john lateward    to corroborate this affidavit and being we suppose ashamed of what he had done mr l d took some pains to make mr smith of downham to say back again what he had sworn for proof of this matter upon lateward which attempt appears by the oaths of three credible persons of downham as follows george holt late of downham gent william pincher of the same town and county tailor and mary smith the wife of john smith of the same town and county do severally make oath that one who called himself hugh james rector of upwell in the county of norfolk but as we are informed was mr lateward came to the said john smiths house in downham aforesaid upon the   th day of november now last past and brought along with him one johnson an attorney of her majestys court of queensbench a man of tricks and an unjust practitioner who together did entreat john smith the husband of mary smith one of these deponents to own and swear that the affidavit he had made in the queensbench this term was unjust and untrue but he affirmed what he had done was just and that he would stand by it upon which they urged him to unsay it and then said it would prove his ruin if the said john smith did not revoke the former affidavit  geo holt william pincher mary smith     and against that part of mr latewards oath and bettss oath that it was wrote by mr gill besides the affidavit of mr gill already mentioned we conclude this black story with the following affidavit thomas wilson now of downham market in the county of norfolk gent makes oath that he being at the house of john smith in downham aforesaid saw and read a letter there that was sent from mr john lateward to urge him to give orders to arrest mr gill and having seen and well knowing the handwriting of mr gill does verily believe and affirm that the said letter was not mr gills handwriting  tho wilson    only as the conspirators have taken a great deal of pains to blacken mr gill and load him with crimes of all which we shall fairly and honorably clear him we cannot but present the world with two evidences to the character of this knight of the post mr betts and it is humbly recommended to the reverend mr james and mr lateward to clear their worthy agent of the charge lest the world should blame their understanding for hugging such a wretch and caressing a man of whom they ought to have been ashiamd to have been seen in his company    mr martin postmaster of epping where this betts it seems lived till he could stay there no longer swears that he  betts having given mr martin possession of some goods for a just debt he broke open the door in the night and carried them away and that being carried before a justice he saved himself from being sent to jayl by restoring the goods again thomas martin of epping in the county of essex innholder makes oath that he this deponent know john betts late of epping aforesaid innkeeper but now of chatteris in the isle of ely and county of cambridge as this deponent is informed and believes and says that the said john betts being indebted to this deponent this deponent about six years since caused him to be arrested and thereupon the said betts to procure his liberty delivered certain goods into custody of anoter person in trust for this deponent but the said betts caused the door of the room where such goods were to be broke open in the night time and conveyed the same away and would not let this deponent have the same again till this deponent took him before a justice of the peace who forced the said betts to redeliver the said goods or else said he would send the said betts to jayl  thomas martin      mr earl of epping swears betts is a person of a scandalous character esteemed a highwayman so that few of his neighbors care to be seen in his company believing him a man that cares not what he says or swears richard earl of epping in the county of essex yeoman aged sixty years or thereabouts makes oath that he knows john betts late of epping aforesaid but now of chatteris in the isle of ely and county of cambridge a bailiff and says that the said betts is a person of a very bad and scandalous life and reputation and is esteemed no better than a highwayman insomuch that few of his neighbors care to keep him company and this deponent verily believes he cares not what he either says or swears and this deponent farther says that the said betts when he lived at epping caused a room wherein he had put certain goods in trust for one mr martin a creditor of the said betts to be broke open in the nightime and was taken before justice wroth on that account who forced the said betts to deliver back the said goods or said he would send him to jayl or used words to that or the like effect  richard earl    all these affidavits were in behalf of mr gill produced in court and mr gill being examined on several interrogatories upon oath and under recognizance and having given the court full satisfaction was dishargd of the contempt and the rest of this black story lies now before the judges of her majestys court of queensbench where mr gill doubts not to have justice  the conclusion it is enough and the matter of fact as here truly related is mr gills satisfaction he covets no victories and scorns to insult them on the conquest his innocence and the power of truth made upon their procured perjuries he recommends it to them to consider of what they have done and at least show so much penitence as becomes them to make their appearance in their cloth tolerable  it remains only to finish the vindication of mr gill to reckon up a little the numerous slanders and reproaches which they have raised upon his reputation and by undoubted testimony and positive evidence confront their calumnies and clear up his character to the satisfaction of his friends who have been too much imposed upon  and the author asks their pardon if he says have been something too apt to believe and to the conviction of his enemies who have triumphed in a bad cause and cried victoria before they put their armor off  in order to this it is necessary to set down in their own language and the blackest terms they could invent all the calumnies and abuses they have raised upon this poor man in order to justify their ill practices and make their designs tolerable to the world  and first the publication in the gazette speaks for it self and needs no comment   and here it is very observable that it yet remains a mystery who conveyed this advertisement to the printer of the gazette no body having yet thought fit to own it and the  at norwich disowning it and this we presume must be referred to the second part of this history by which time mr jones no doubt in his own vindication will produce his voucher and the courts of justice so come at the author  when the justices clergymen and the rest of the conspirators came to be called upon to show cause of all this usage after frequent motions for time they bring up numerous affidavits partly in their own justification and partly defaming the man  of these affidavits some of them being too long to insert in the compass of this book we have taken a faithful abstract and to show our impartiality in this account and that the world may see whether we have done them justice or no the affidavits are all left at the place aforesaid for any person that desires satisfaction to peruse  first thurgood upton esquire and justice of peace swears that mr hugh james and thomas beart both frequently mentioned in this book made complaint of mr gill that he was a person of a scandalous and debauched life a frequenter of alehouses and houses of ill fame and did for several months cohabit with a certain woman as his wife whom he called elizabeth and by whom he had two children and that some time after the birth of the first child by the said elizabeth another woman followed the said gill and pretended to be his wife that he did for several weeks cohabit with both the said women and had also a child by the second woman who some short time after dying he continued to cohabit with the first woman as his wife  but this gentleman being a justice for the county of norfolk and the said gill living in the isle of ely he refused to grant his warrant having no authority to act there  mr upton also swears that there was a farther complaint against mr gill by the said mr hugh james for keeping a meeting in the barn of one richard tokelove and several others that were present at the said meeting who appearing and affirming that the said gill had qualified himself and the place was duly licensed according to law he dismissed them mr upon adds his belief that there is no malice in mr jamess prosecution giving him the character of a sober man and of good reputation but mr gill of a notorious ill life and conversation and a disgrace to religion thurgood upwood of terrington in the county of norfolk esquire one of her majestys justices of the peace for the said county makes oath that in or about the month of january   0  complaint was made to this deponent by hugh james clerk rector of upwell in the said county and also by thomas beart of the said parish of upwell that one abraham gill who had for some time past resided within the said parish of upwell and had officiated at welney a hamlet of the said parish of upwell as curate to dr grigg since deceased and afterward to talbot hibart likewise deceased who were respectively rectors of the said parish that the said gill was a person of a very scandalous and debauched life being a great frequenter of alehouses and other houses of evil fame and did also for several months cohabit with a certain woman as his wife whom he called elizabeth by whom he had two children during his abode there and that some short time after the birth of the first child by the said elizabeth another woman followed the said gill to the said parish of upwell who likewise pretended to be his wife and that he did for several weeks cohabit with both the said women and had also a child by the second woman who some short time afterward dying he did continue with the first woman called elizabeth who has ever since cohabited with him as they informed this deponent but it appearing to this deponent that the said gill was then an inhabitant in that part of the said parish that lies within the isle of ely and county of cambridge did refuse to grant a warrant against him he having no authority to act there and this deponent says that there being farther complaint made by the said hugh james against the said gill and several others in or about the month of march last past for that the said gill had kept a meeting in the barn of one richard tooklove at upwell in the said county of norfolk not having qualified himself or given notice of the said house according to law this deponent did grant a warrant against the said tooklove and several others that were present at the said meeting whose names this deponent does not remember and the said tooklove and the rest of them affirming that the said gill had a license to teach in the said barn and that the same was duly licensed thereupon this deponent forbore any farther prosecution until he should receive farther information of the matter charged against them and farther deposes that he does not know or believe that there was any malice in the prosecution made by the said hugh james against the said gill the said james being a person of sober life and good reputation and on the contrary that the said gill is very notorious in his ill life and bad conversation and a great disgrace to the christian religion  th upwood    mr james himself makes oath at large hugh james rector of upwell in the county of norfolk clerk makes oath that at the time of his institution and induction to the rectory of upwell he found abraham gill officiating as curate in the chapel of welney according to the rites of the church of england and this deponent being informed that the said abraham gill was a person of notorious ill life and conversation this deponent went to the hamlet of welney to reprove the said abraham gill for his scandalous practices and to examine by what authority and license he there officiated as minister and curate but the said abraham gill denying to show this deponent his orders and license upon this and for several other reasons this deponent made complaint of the said gill and his wicked practices to the lord bishop of norwich his diocesan and delivered in to his lordship an information against him made by thomas beart before thurgood upton esquire one of his majestys justices of the peace for the county of norfolk upon which and several other informations he was prosecuted in the consistory court of norwich where he was detected of forging holy orders under the hand and seal of the present lord bishop of chester for which and several other enormous crimes he had excommunication read against him in welney from which he is not yet absolved but some time after as this deponent is credibly informed endeavored to impose upon one mr cooper minister of bollingbrook in lincolnshire by forged orders under the hand and seal of the present lord bishop of ely desiring to be his curate but being detected there of this forgery the said gill returned to welney aforesaid whither his family had been sent from bollingbrook aforesaid by order of the justices of lincolnshire and the said gill still continuing in his scandalous life set up a set up a separate conventicle in the parish of upwell in the barn of richard tokelove of the same parish and did in that barn on the sabbath day preach to some persons of no great credit upon which this deponent thinking it his duty to take notice of such disorders and unlawful practices especially by such an infamous person procured a warrant from the said mr upton to bring before him richard tokelove and four other idle persons who absented themselves from the church to follow and encourage this gill that they might show legal authority for his conventicle having no malicious intent in the prosecution and these persons affirming that their teacher abraham gill had the license for their conventicle the said mr upton returned the warrant by the constable to bring them back if they did not produce or send the license to him and they not obeying this order he granted another warrant for the said gill and tokelove but abraham gill withdrawing himself into the isle of ely this deponent made complaint to tho edwards sen esquire one of her majestys justices of the peace for the isle of ely in the county of cambridge which said thomas edwards granted a warrant to apprehend the said gill for his disorderly living and preaching in a conventicle not being qualified for the same by virtue of which warrant he was brought before several of her majestys justices of the peace in wisbich who for several reasons committed him to jayl and this deponent farther says that he did not speak to the said abraham gill before he came into the room where the said justices were and that there he gave him no scurrilous language but only spoke what was necessary to inform the justices concerning his ill life and illegal practices and this deponent farther says that he did not move to have him sent to goal nor did he affirm that his license was forged but only that there was great suspicion of the same it being only a blank certificate of a license without date and that it was not mr browns hand as other gentlemen there likewise affirmed who knew mr browns hand and this deponent farther makes oath that he believes that the certificate under the name of john arrowsmith to be his proper hand and that other certificate under the name of nich brown not to be his proper hand having seen both their hands upon other occasions neither mr nich brown nor john jeffery clerk having any jurisdiction in that part of norfolk where richard tokeloves barn stands  hugh james    thomas edwards of wisbech in the isle of ely and county of cambridge esquire one of her majestys justices of the peace for the said isle of ely makes oath that upon the complaint of mr hugh james rector of upwell against abraham gill of welney for diverse ill crimes and misdemeanors he this deponent on or about the latter end of march last to the best of this deponents remembrance granted a warrant to bring the said abraham gill before this deponent or some other of her majestys justices of the peace for the said isle to answer the said complaint with directions to bring sureties for his good behavior along with him and that on or about the  0th day of april following the said abraham gill was brought before this deponent and josiah colvile esquire and several other justices of the peace of the said isle where were also present the said mr james and mr lateward his curate and several others and the said mr james amongst other crimes accused the said gill of living very lewdly and wickedly with a woman whom he kept when his former wife was living and had children by the said woman when his former wife was living and that it was highly probable he was not then married to her as also of his setting up a conventicle at welney without any lawful authority that the said mr james could find out or hear of with his being accustomed to swearing and other immoralities and the said abraham gill offering little or nothing in his own defense as to his bad life and conversation and being a person obscure and unknown from whence he came and of a very infamous character and reputation on diverse accounts this deponent with the other justices then present required him the said abraham gill to give sureties for his good behavior as the least thing they would demand of him which he not being able to do although most of his substantial neighbors were present the said mr colvile and this deponent sealed his mittimus and sent him to god till he should find sureties accordingly and this deponent farther says that he did not hear of any scurrilous or ill language which was given to the said abraham gill by any person then present but says that he the said abraham gill did then produce the paper hereunto annexed purporting a license from the archdeacon of the archdeaconry of norwich for holding meetings in the house or barn of one richard tokelove in upwell aforesaid which being without date and this deponent and the other justices present being well informed that upwell was not within the jurisdiction of the archdeacon therein named and although it had been so yet that the said abraham gill was not duly qualified to preach or teach in the said meeting house as being an excommunicate person as was then credibly affirmed nor could he make it appear in the least that he had qualified himself by law to be a teacher in such a meeting at any sessions of the peace either in norfolk or the isle of ely and several persons then present affirming also that the name nicho brown thereunto subscribed was not the proper handwriting of mr nicholas brown this deponent and the other justices did not look upon the same to be authentic and had reason to suspect it to be forged and therefore detained it till farther enquiry might be made concerning it  tho edwards  the following oath is most remarkable because the person has been frequently heard to acknowledge his ignorance of what he swore and it being made upon public faith thomas fewlis of the hamlct of welney clerk to the chapel of welney aforesaid being in the parish of upwell in the county of norfolk makes oath that he officiated as clerk of the said chapel during some part of the time that abraham gill served as curate thereof and has received the sacrament of the lords supper at his hands as a priest of the church of england who several times administered the same to other persons in the said chapel in this deponents presence and says also that the said abraham gill for some part of the time he officiated in the said cure did in a scandalous manner cohabit with two women at one and the same time one whereof whom he more particularly owned as his wife when alive is now dead and the other is still alive and lives with him now as his wife and says that his said former wife has not been dead above four years to the best of this deponents remembrance and that by this present wife the said abraham gill has three children which he owns and one by the other wife now at welneth aforesaid and that the eldest of the said three children by this present wife is about eight years old and older than the other child at welney aforesaid which he had by his said deceased wife  thomas fewlis    mr lateward the other conspirators oath is at large as follows john lateward clerk and curate of welney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge makes oath that one abraham gill who some time past resided within the parish of upwell in the county of cambridge and had officiated at welney aforesaid a hamlet of the said parish of upwell as curate to doctor grigg since deceased and afterward to talbot hobart likewise deceased who were respectively rectors of the said parish that the said gill is a person of a notorious ill character and that this deponent upon the lords day being the   d day of november   0  did read in the chapel of welney aforesaid an excommunication against the said gill wherein he was charged with several heinous crimes as forgery and the like and this deponent farther says that the said gill has and does own a child which he had by the woman he now cohabiteth with called abraham gill which is older than a child that he had by another woman whom he pretended to be his first wife and whereas the said gill by his affidavit in writing made by him the  0th day of may last before richard penson gent one of her majestys commissioners to take affidavits in the court of queensbench at westminster amongst other matters and things in the same affidavit mentioned charged this deponent of speaking these words following  viz wishing his body might rot in goal and his soul perish eternally this deponent says he did not speak the words before recited nor any words to the same effect nor ever made any prosecution in his own name or upon his own account against the said gill and had no other end or design than in the due performance of his duty to bring the said gill to condign punishment he having highly dishonored god and the christian religion by his vicious life and conversation and this deponent farther deposes that for the space of one year last past or thereabouts the said gill and his family have been and are still a charge to the inhabitants living within the said hamlet of welney they being frequently relieved by the overseers of the poor there  john lateward    the following affidavits are of the justices who listed this mr gill though it appears both of them are glad to put in that they did not set their hands to the order or certificate david rowlands of haddenham in the isle of ely and county of cambridge esquire one of her majestys justices of the peace for the said isle makes oath that he this deponent being at wisbech in the said isle at the last assize one abraham gill and some other persons were there brought before this deponent and four other justices of the peace for the said isle as persons fit to be listed to serve her majesty as soldiers according to a late act of parliament for raising recruits for the land forces and marines and this deponent assisted the said justices in the examination of the said persons and by all that was said on both sides this deponent does upon his oath declare that he adjudged it agreeable to the said act of parliament that the said abraham gill should be listed as a soldier which also was the opinion of the other justices then present and farther this deponent does declare that he this deponent going into another room after the aforesaid examination of the said abraham gill did not sign or seal any order or certificate for the listing the said abraham gill as a soldier and this deponent farther says that neither he nor any other justices of peace then present to the best of the deponents remembrance and belief did say or so much as mention that a conventicle was of bad consequence or the fanatics ought not to be countenanced or that the generality of the parish of upwell flocked after the said gill or that the conventicle which the said gill had in upwell ought to be suppressed or any words to that or the like effect and this deponent farther says that the said gill did not then pretend as this deponent verily believes to be a freeman of any corporation that sent burgesses to parliament but this deponent does remember that the said gill did pretend to be a freeholder in lancashire which neither this deponent nor the rest of the justices then present did believe for that they had been credibly informed of several forgeries and ill practices of the said gill and this deponent farther says that a warrant of hue and cry some days after coming to the parish where this deponent lived against the said gill and others this deponent according to his duty caused the same to be sent forward  david rowlands  francis fern prebendary of ely and one of her majestys justices of the peace for the isle of ely makes oath that abraham gill of welney was brought before him and four other justices of the peace for the said isle and upon the hearing of what was said concerning the said abraham gill and what the said abraham gill said for himself this deponent was of opinion as also the four other justices of the peace that the said abraham gill might and ought according to the late act of parliament for raising recruits for her majestys forces be listed in her majestys service but notwithstanding this his opinion this deponent says that being called into another room in the inn about other business he this deponent did not sign or seal any certificate order or warrant to adjudge the said abraham gill to be a soldier listed according to the said act and whereas the said abraham gill in his affidavit affirms that he is a preacher to a congregation of protestant dissenters licensed according to law this deponent says that the said abraham gill did not in the hearing of this deponent make any proof or so much as offer to make any proof that he had qualified himself as the law directs to be a preacher or teacher in any congregation of protestants dissenting from the church of england and whereas the said abraham gill did allege in his affidavit that this deponent did say that a conventicle was of bad consequence and that they ought not to be countenanced and that the generality of the parish flocked after abraham gill which would breed great disturbances in upwell as it did all over england this deponent says that he this deponent did never speak those words or any words to that effect  fran fern  john bellamy of wisbech in the isle of ely and county of cambridge esquire one of her majestys justices of the peace for the said isle makes oath that abraham gill of welney in the said isle of ely is and has been all along a person of a very infamous reputation by the accounts this deponent has received of him being under the character of cohabiting with two wives or women at the same time and having children by them both and of being a drunken and debauched man and says that he the said gill amongst others was brought before this deponent as a person fit to be impressed into her majestys service according to the late act of parliament made for that purpose where were present at the same time josia colvile ralph peirson and david rowlands esquires and francis fern clerk all of them justices of the peace for the said isle of ely when this deponent made no objection to the said gills being inlisted according to the said act any more than the said other justices saving that the said gill alleged that he had a freehold at wigan in lincolnshire of    l per ann to the best of this deponents remembrance he this deponent believes he might desire some time might be given him to make that appear if it could be done but this deponent does deny that he ever had any account from norwich that the said gills license was good or that he knew any thing certain of that matter and says that to the best of his remembrance the said gill was at the said meeting ordered to be impressed by all the said justices excepting the said mr colvile who as this deponent remembers went home before the matter was ended and that the articles of war were read and the listing money tendered to him as he does believe but withal the said gill was told that if he could make it appear he had a freehold of forty shillings a year or a right of voting in the election of members of parliament or to that effect he should be forthwith discharged and this deponent says that he knows of no freehold the said gill has at welney aforesaid or any where else or had at that time  j bellamy    these are the principal affidavits and indeed all that pretend either to excuse their crimes or to prove his  in which the reader is deird to observe that here is abundance of recourse to  evilfame being credibly informed complaint having been made and the like referring to the morals and conversation of this man and who that has enemies of like qualifications may not come under all that but it is humbly recommended to all impartial enquirers that are willing to be truly informed of this matter and who would rather hear the truth of a case than be imposed upon to consider here is not one positive oath no not among all his enemies to any of these facts no man makes oath that he ever saw him drunk or that he ever heard him swear  it is strange they should not if it was so common or that he broke out of jayl or that he forged his orders or that his license was forged   nay the very particulars in the gazette are not so much as attempted to be proved in any of these affidavits that he was ever employed under an attorney forging a second time orders under the hand and seal of the bishop of ely this forgery being detected at bullingbrook in lincolnshire his being taken into custody upon the same his making his escape and flying from justice   and it is fairly offered to mr jones who we believe has been unwarily drawn into this snare that if but any one of the abovesaid articles can be proved by him mr gill will cease giving him any trouble on account of all the rest  it is very hard mr jones on the bare recommendation of any man though never so great should allege such black things as these upon an innocent man and neither he nor his authors be able to make out one clause of it from which we wish him a good deliverance and leave that part to the issue of the law  indeed we have two hardmouthed fellows that swear heartily but these discover so little wit with their good will that the easiness of proving them perjured will be as much a scandal upon their senses as their honesty we mean mr lateward and mr fowlis mr gills clark  wherefore we shall begin with this swearing curate whose oath is that mr gill owns a child by the name of abraham gill which is elder than a child he had by his first wife  no man but mr lateward would have been caught in such a fooltrap and have sworn what is so exceeding easy to be detected the children being to be produced and their ages proved  now it is plain and known to all the neighborhood and a thing in which it is impossible the truth can be concealed that mr gills first wife has been dead upwards of seven years and the eldest child he has by his present wife is but five years and half old or thereabout  the necessary proof of this is omitted here not that it is not the most easy of all this affair to make out but because it being to come before a court of justice as matter of evidence it is referred to the genuine proof of fact and the issue on a trial when mr lateward will do well to produce this little abraham in nubibus and prove his age and the time of the death of the first wife and marriage of the second and see how he can make these things out  as to the clerks affidavit he has frequently owned in mr gills hearing since that he was drunk when he made it and that he knew not what was in it and that if he had known there had been any such thing in it he would not have offered to have sworn it  it is a most unaccountable thing that mr lateward should so far expose himself in his affidavit when the children are all alive born in the same place their age registered in the parishbook and so many living witnesses of the time of their birth and we blush for him to think if he is not hardened beyond the very father of lies himself what confusion he must be in when he shall be asked to produce this child of mr gill that must be above nine years old or to name where it was born when registered or any circumstances of the matter  so much is malice frequently forsaken of its sense that the just regard providence always shows to injured innocence is the safety of all honest men causing the subtilty of wicked false accusers to abandon them and their folly as well as wickedness to go hand in hand that sin and shame might come together and their false accusation carry its detection in it self  if these gentlemen have any farther defense to make any more affidavits to bring into court the editor of this promises them to give them their full and free place in the second part of this history but humbly desires them whether clergymen or magistrates that for the honor and dignity of their offices and character and the justification of their understandings that they would either more nicely adhere to the matter of fact or more politickly conceal the vicious part that they may not expose themselves and force their humble servants to detect them to avoid the scandal of blindness and stupidity that they would leave trifling circling and going roundabout mr gills character with supposes we have heard and we are informed and says that he is informed and the like but that they would rather tell us plainly and make it out when he was drunk or swore or broke jayl or forged orders or lived scandalously for certainly gentlemen these things ought to be made out or else to suggest them is a most barbarous treatment and a slander that redounds to the infamy of the contrivers  and now we come to present the world with the account mr gill gives of himself not from his own mouth but from the mouth of numerous throngs of neighbors inhabitants and persons both knowing his character and willing to do justice  and first to obviate the scandal of his having forged the hand and seal of the bishop of chester and only pretended to have entered into holy orders besides the original orders left as aforesaid take the testimony of a minister of the church of england who was ordained at the same time as follows richard tod of bonwick in the isle of ely and county of cambridge clerk makes oath that abraham gill of welney in the said isle and county clerk now a preacher to a dissenting congregation at upwell in norfolk was ordained by nicholas lord bishop of chester upon the same day that this deponent and five other young men was ordained that is to say at trinity in the year of our lord      and received his letters of orders as we all did under the episcopal seal of the lord bishop of chester aforesaid  rich tod    this honest gentleman is unhappily dead since the making this affidavit or else we had received a larger account of the particulars of mr gills ordination and the names of the five other young ministers ordained at the same time but the authentic affidavit together with the original orders under the episcopal seal left as before with mr skey is testimony sufficient to clear mr gill and all that cavil at it are challenged to do their utmost to detect any forgery collusion or crime whatsoever  from clearing up this point we come to his character as well in lancashire from whence he came where he was born and lived several years as in norfolk where all this tragedy has been acted and first from rivington where he was born and where his father yet lives the following certificate has been sent up signed by the reverend mr bradly and the principal inhabitants the original whereof is left as before with the rest of the papers relating to this story this is to certify all persons whom it may concern that abraham gill son of robert gill of rivington in the county of lancaster lived many years in our neighborhood both before and after he was married and that in all that time he lived soberly free from any aspersion of drunkenness or profane swearing that ever we knew or heard of and that he married a woman of good reputation for modesty sobriety and chastity as far as ever we know by whom he had a daughter in these parts yet living and some other children departed this life some years ago we never knew nor credibly heard that he had any other wife either in lancashire or any other place during all the time of her life who as we have heard and do believe lived with him at the time of her death this we

while mr gill was in lancashire and before he was entered into orders he served my lord willby of parham as his chaplain steward or attendant  the enemies of mr gill have been as he is informed so diligent to attack this noble lord in order to obtain a complaint against mr gill there having been some difference as they said between them at parting but being not able to obtain any certificate from his lordship against mr gill they became petitioners to his lordship that as he would give them nothing under his hand against mr gill so he would refuse to grant mr gill any thing under his hand in his justification we shall not examine into the justice of this proceeding his lordship no doubt had his reasons for it but the attempt either way is a manifest proof the enemies of mr gill have rummaged the nation for his character and left no stone unturned in order to fix the scandals they have endeavored to raise on his reputation  but though this noble lord declined meddling on one hand or other mr gill has obtained more justice from his brotherinlaw who at second hand from my lords own mouth has given an honorable testimony of mr gill to mr gills own father and sent up under his hand as follows  mr gills fathers letter is thus rivington nov  0   0  loving son i am sorry to hear that you are in trouble i sent to my lord willoughby for his certificate but i heard that your adversaries had prevented him but i did not hear it from my lord but i thought that mr grenehalghs certificate would not be much inferior because he married my lord willoughbys sister and that you were both boarded at his house and if you will have any certificate from the neighborhood i question not but they will all certify for you so hoping you are in good health as we are all at present praised be god i remain  your ever loving father whilst robert gill    the certificate thus adlington nov  0   0  these may certify whom it may concern that my lord willoughby and mr abraham gill were boarded at my house together for two years and upwards and since mr gill left my lords service i have heard my lord commend mr gill saying he was the best servant he ever had and i have known mr gill from a child and he being in my family as aforesaid was faithful and just all the time and was a man of sober life and conversation as witness my hand  sa grenehalgh    next to this and besides mr gills affidavit already mentioned of his being a freeholder in lancashire which the justices will find they ought to have considered here follows an affidavit of the same and of his being a freeman or burgess of a corporation and by both these he had a right of voting in the election of members of parliament and consequently was exempted by the very act of parliament by which they pretended to send him for a soldier oliver greenhalgh of horwich in the county of lancaster makes oath that he this deponent very well knows abraham gill the son of robert gill of rivington in this county and this deponent farther says that the said abraham gill is now legally entitled for the term of his natural life of and in several closes or parcels of land lying in rivington aforesaid of the clear yearly value of forty shillings per ann and upwards and moreover this deponent says that mr ralph banks town clerk for the borough of wigan in this county showed him this deponent his record or roll kept for the said borough wherein was mentioned that on the   th day of september      to this deponents best remembrance the said abraham gill was sworn a burgess within the said borough of wigan  oliver greenhalgh    from lancashire we are to trace him into the isle of ely whither he came with his family and settled as has been already noted in the parish of maney where he preached two years of which and his behavior there take the following certificate sworn to by ten of the inhabitants of that little town thomas harrison of maney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge yeoman richard bellamy william cross thomas benn william curtis william hales william page and thomas neale all of maney aforesaid richard finch and edward newborn of the same makes oath that they have known mr abraham gill now minister of a dissenting congregation at upwell this ten or twelve years or thereabouts he was our minister for about two years and well settled in our parish with his wife who lived together very conformable and peaceably he was able and diligent in his teaching he was no drunkard nor swearer but lived a pious life and conversation amongst us and these deponents do farther say that to their knowledge the said mr gill never had two wives living at one time but that he married his now wife after his former wifes decease  tho harrison rich bellamy will cross tho benn will corties will hales will page tho neale rich finch edw newborn     for his behavior in upwell where he has since resided and which has been the scene of this tragedy take the two following affidavits edward birch of wimblington in the isle of ely and county of cambridge gent makes oath that abraham gill of welney in the isle and county aforesaid is a preacher to a congregation of protestant dissenting subjects in upwell in the county of norfolk and that the said mr gill has been a preacher in and about welney aforesaid for several years last past and that he is now and all the time has been well approved of for a teacher and very charitable to the poor and has lived well in fame and plenty amongst his neighbors but this deponent farther says that he believes mr james rector of upwell and mr lateward curate at welney have maliciously designed to ruin the said mr gill and his family consisting of a wife and four small children for they have been very troublesome to the said mr gill for near two years having caused him to spend very much money in defending himself from their unjust and malicious prosecution so that they have now reduced him to poverty and at last would force him away for a soldier from his congregation where he is beloved and may have very good maintenance and this deponent farther says he was with mr gill at cambridge in the months of march april and may in   0  where mr gill was a long time kept prisoner at the complaint of mr james without any cause showed at all and at the request of mr gill and several of his good friends he this deponent and one mr thomas neale bailed mr gill out of jayl mr gill being bound in   0l and this deponent and mr neale in  0l each of them and mr gill appeared the next sessions then after and as there had been no cause of his imprisonment before so nothing appeared against him still as the court declared but they removed him to norwich assizes from thence where this deponent has heard and believes that upon mr gills staying all the time of assizes july last and nothing could be brought against him he was discharged by my lord chief justice holt and my lord baron smith or one of them and this deponent believes that mr gill never gave any cause of offense to mr james and mr lateward except it was by being more charitable to the poor and more diligent and better beloved and approved in his place than they are  edward birch  john johnson of upwell in the county of norfolk yeoman makes oath that abraham gill of welney in the isle of ely in the county of cambridge is a preacher to a congregation of her majestys protestant dissenting subjects in upwell aforesaid and that the said abraham gill has been a preacher in the said parish of welney for several years last past and that he is now and all the time has been well approved of by his congregation and this deponent farther says that about the latter end of april last past it was reported at upwell aforesaid that mr gill was impressed and sent away for a soldier to the great sorrow and grief of the greatest part of the parish and that he this deponent about that time going to wisbech aforesaid to see mr gill found him an impressed man and guarded amongst others that were impressed men and kept as prisoners in a room in an inn in wisbech aforesaid and this deponent verily believes that mr hugh james rector of upwell and mr lateward curate at welney have maliciously designed to ruin and undo mr gill and his family consisting of a wife and four small children for they have by several barbarous ways of prosecution brought the said mr gill and his family to poverty notwithstanding mr gill has been a freeholder in the said parish and lived in plenty amongst his neighbors and is now generally beloved except with a few that dare not displease mr james and mr lateward and this deponent verily believes all the cause of mr james and mr latewards malice against mr gill is because mr gill preached oftener and better was more diligent in his ministry and more charitable to the poor and better approved of in the parish than they are john johnson    from hence let us follow him in his afflictions and in the very prison we find the jailer  who was a woman testifying to his sobriety his piety and his charity elizabeth heylock keeper of the tolbooth in the town of cambridge widow makes oath that abraham gill of welney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge gent has been in her custody as a prisoner for some time and during all the time of his imprisonment he lived soberly honestly and religiously insomuch that by his christianlike behavior and conversation from his coming into prison till the time he was released he so prevailed upon the other prisoners that there was a reformation amongst them and this deponent farther says that when any money was given to the prisoners to drink he the said mr gill shunned drinking to excess and constantly advised others against drinking more than was necessary to refresh nature and carried himself soberly and honestly toward all the people in custody and others also  elizabeth heylock    we next bring you a tradesman of cambridge one of his creditors and a person that has reason to know him both while he was a prisoner there and before who testifies both from personal knowledge and public enquiry and by him you have even the voice of common fame so that this affidavit seems to contradict those gentlemen who say he was a man of ill fame amongst his neighbors turbulent and disorderly or bred a disturbance in the parish as in mr justice upwoods and other affidavits richard jardine of cambridge in the county of cambridge linnendraper makes oath that for this six years last past he has been intimately acquainted with abraham gill of welney in the isle of ely and county of cambridge gent and that during all this deponents acquaintance with him he has had the character of an honest sober peaceable man and farther says that he this deponent has had frequent occasion by means of his trade and other business to be in the country where the said abraham gill did formerly live and does now live and has been oftentimes in the said mr gills company and never at any time found him disorderly irreligious or any ways vicious in his conversation and this deponent has heard among the neighborhood where the said mr gill lived that if any controversies quarrels or suits of law did happen in his neighborhood among the neighbors he always offered his mediation and recommended peace amongst them and has by that means ended several differences and disputes between his neighbors and farther says that the said mr gill is very well beloved by the parishioners of welney and the neighboring parishes and gives good content and satisfaction amongst them and has been charitable to the poor and obedient to the late as well as this present government and says that within this twenty days his this deponents business called him to welney where he made a visit to the said mr gill and found him in a very weak and poor condition having been afflicted with sickness for a considerable time as he and the neighborhood told this deponent  richard jardine    and yet more effectually to settle this matter of character and reputation among neighbors we conclude it with the affidavit of fourteen more of the inhabitants of his parish and neighbors and when all is done let any of his antagonists produce better vouchers for their reputation if they can william gibson of upwell in the county of norfolk yeoman james seaman of the same town and county  robert macum robert gill richard tokelove george slacksbe joseph sampson thomas watson peter sumers john marriott benjamin silk valentine smith william mann robert macum jun do severally make oath that mr abraham gill a preacher to a congregation in upwell has for seven or eight years last past been a preacher in the said parish and was never to our knowledge a common drunkard nor swearer nor had two wives at once but had one wife and after her decease married another and that the said mr gill has been and is a man of very sober pious life and conversation and such a one as we desire may still be our minister  william gibson james seaman robert macum sen robert gill richard tokelove george slacksbe joseph sampson thomas watson peter sumers john marriott benjamin silk valentine smith william mann robert macum     and to finish these vouchers here is the license for the meeting affixed which they have never attempted to prove forged any more than they have mr gills orders by virtue and in pursuance of a certain clause or proviso in this behalf mentioned and contained in an act of parliament or statute made in the first year of the reign of king william and queen mary entitled an act for exempting their majestys protestant subjects dissenting from the church of england from the penalty of certain laws these are humbly to certify and it is hereby certified unto the worshipful john jeffery clerk master of arts archdeacon of the archdeaconry of norwich that the dwelling house or barn of upwell in the county of norfolk is a place used and to be used for holding and keeping meetings and assemblies of diverse persons of her majestys protestant dissenting subjects dissenting from the church of england for the exercise of religious worship in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand this   th day of march ann dom   0   richard tokelove    and  gentlemen to go farther with our adversaries than they can expect we should  what if we should suppose for once that this abraham gill was this immoral man they speak of if he was such a refined cheat as to have deluded all the many many honest people who have sworn to his character for who knows how far the wit and subtilty of man under the agency of a hardened mind may furnish a man and what mists the devil may have laid before the eyes of mankind that this man should be a common drunkard and swearer and cohabiter with two women at once and a congregation of several hundreds of his hearers where he lived all the time know nothing of it nor his enemies be able to produce one affidavit of any man that ever saw him drunk or heard him swear  but suppose these strange things come to pass for the world is full of strange things what can be inferred from hence to justify the treatment he has received and all the dissenters through his interest  but on this premised supposition i crave leave to draw a few inferences which shall serve to the close of this work    all the forgeries all the swearings drunkennesses and lewdness they pretend to charge upon him are antecedent to his being a dissenter and we do not find he received the least disturbance in the execution of his function on account of these known immoralities and might to this day have kept his two women and his cure of souls both together as too many of his brethren have done before him and are like to do after him for any great care we see taken to prevent it had he but continued to read the common prayer  i forbear to discant upon this unhappy truth and of the many known instances of an immoral clergy shall repeat none but rather cover the infirmities of our guides that the obligation if possible may move them both to reform and to hide those of their neighbors    were all the immoralities he is charged with true they are not comparable to those committed in his prosecution the perjuries subornations cruelties injustice and illegal proceedings are intolerable this is casting out devils by beelzebub the prince of devils this is the devil turned reformer    what is all this to going for a soldier if every clergyman must be listed that will be drunk if swearing an oath will pull a mans band off and send him to the army if every clergyman that keeps a woman more than he should do must go into the army lord have mercy and a cross ought to be set upon the doors of a great many churchtenements and perhaps we need not have so many severe acts of parliament for raising recruits  wherefore upon the whole matter we are not so concerned to vindicate mr gills character since were he all they could allege it does not in the least palliate or excuse their dealings with him nor will it be any extenuation of their illegal practices when it comes to be examined before a court of justice  it is therefore enough let them rummage mr gills character to the bottom let them confute the many affidavits we have produced persuade the world to believe him an ill man a drunkard a swearer a whoremaster or any thing we humbly conceive it is all against them still for they do not persecute him as an immoral man if they had why did they not do it long before for it must have been known then but they persecute him as a dissenter a disturber of the neighbors with a conventicle preaching in welney chapel without reading the common prayer these were the crimes all his vices if they were true  which nevertheless we do not grant were committed while he was mr gill the curate not since he was mr gill the dissenter he was their mr gill when they say he kept an ill woman he is unaccusd of the least immorality since he was our mr gill what will they say to this part of it this makes it a peculiar pique at a party a push made at the dissenters a sally of the method called the shortest way sending our ministers a colonelling voting them a sort of people that do not live by a lawful calling and can give no good account of themselves and therefore in the eye of the law are vagabonds and may all be listed for soldiers etc  we have therefore nothing more to say for mr gill we need not undertake the vindication of his morals we have the inhabitants where he was born and married his first wife we have the inhabitants of maney and of upwell all these sign to his morals and the people swear that he is such a man as they desire to be their minister if his morals are bad the morals of the people should be questioned that desire a common drunkard and swearer to be their minister we leave the rest of the case therefore upon them if he is an ill man they will no doubt make the discovery and dismiss him in vindication of their own character if not but he continues to be their minister and they desire he should be so it is a better testimony of his character than some hundreds of the vicious clergy of the church of england can produce whose hearers and parishioners would turn them out for their debaucheries if they knew how and of this i do not desire to be forced to enter into the particulars  finis
