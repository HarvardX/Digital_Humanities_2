the deplorable state of the sick from the impious treacheries of many physicians and surgeons to the patients and their professions represented with the obvious remedies to the lords spiritual and temporal and the commons of great britain  vt medicus chirurgus fecit quod monitus fuit sed spes fefellit impudentem audaciam comprehensus namque poea persolvit cruce phaedr l   fab   london printed for john morphew near stationers hall mdccvii price   d  a letter of an eminent divine to the dispensary physicians i had in my sermon discoursed that the creator of the world had given reason to mankind to adapt the governments and laws to their various circumstances as the foods and medicines which are bestowed on us in the greatest abundance have been prepared from observation and experience in the different climates for the preservation of life all the governments have been and must be prosperous when as all the parts of our body are designed for the common life of the whole the people shall with courage defend the prince and cheerfully observe the laws and when the supreme and inferior magistrates shall vigilantly preserve the properties of the subjects the first and the greatest property is life which demands the preservation by the laws of the plenty of all things necessary to maintain it as all the parts of our body assist the other every subject is obliged to defend one the other must repel all assaults must demand of the inferior magistrates their care of the public welfare the happiness of mankind is insurd to us on these conditions only and are not lost and betrayed but by our own follies as our health by luxury and excess and our life in diseases by the neglect or unhappy application or medicines it is impious to expect miracles to supply our negligence of our own preservation the clergy are appointed to act as the deputies of the supreme power to admonish the prince and the people to exact the great mutual duties of justice obedience and the care of the public prosperity  you will be surpised gentlemen how much this discourse inflamed my parishioners to debate and discover if any care is taken of the people in sickness it has from them recoyld on me and saved me as those that heard it i could not viit any one family but i was most sensibly affected we are the most neglected though most oppressed people in the world the poor the servants the meaner tradesmen are undone in every sickness we are cheated for one dram and for one spoonful of the remedies in a greater degree of expense than the government formerly did and now can and must secure to us a pound and a gallon of the best medicines in the universe and then to multiply these frauds we must in every disease take the oppressive pernicious multitude of the little shamming doses in other houses lord have mercy on us what do the magistrates think to suffer every boy setting up the trade of an apothecary whose skill has never been examined and every vagabond from foreign countries to impose on our weakness by a thousand lies to undertake all the dangerous diseases do they see and hear that many near them are daily killed by their ignorance of the disease by the numbers of medicines by which only they pay themselves for their deadly care and advice are they insensible of all humanity of the guilt they contract as accomplices the eternal union of the inhabitants of the island is gloriously accomplisd shall we be wretchedly heedless of securing the union of the soul and body of every inhabitant we must imitate the excellent discipline of the britains of the northern part encourage virtue and the public spirit and repel the raging libertinage and contempt of all order and the laws destructive to all societies are the furious inroads and devastations and butcheries of the borders abolished and all the professions of religion the law and physic without defense laid open to the invasions of every impudent pretender with the arts only and abilities to cheat and delude the people destitute of the advice and defense of the magistrates the wicked physicians and surgeons are the first and principal cause of our miseries they basely justify to us their wretched quackery when called in at the extremity they vainly labor to mend the mistakes by contrary methods and they improve the robbery by appointing the same endless quantities of the little doses many superfluous and neglected many more than they use in their own houses these two enormous crimes the physicians and surgeons have almost engrossed to themselves deserve death the college and the company supported by the government can only save us but there are physicians and surgeons more honest and learned than our enemies who would secure us from this robbery and destruction and preserve the college and company to improve all the members in the respective arts and sincerity to the patients they are both assaulted by the perjured perfidiousness of many of both the societies dr r swears every day he will damn and destroy it that there is and shall be no other physician in the nation but himself the largest part of the physicians delude us fatally commending the vile work the apothecary has made design nothing more in the prescription than his profit ruin their own profession to gain the prevalent recommendation the preference in the apothecaries favor there is a surgeon of the same principles and morals with the bravo doctor who breaks his company and the improvements and subsistence of his prentices that he may be noised as the only judge and operator the others by a deadly piece of work they are now and then preferred to what will be the fate of the miserable english when the apothecaries are increased by two or three prentices in all the shops when the college and company shall be deserted and our life and the two professions shall be destitute of the care of the magistrate  you know gentlemen i came lately to my preferment here from the university we have the same usage in oxford and cambridge the professors are insensible that the faculty is invaded almost ruined do they instruct the students in the faithful and learned practice to preserve the patients and the profession together i observe the outlyers affront the college refuse to unite with it betray it and themselves and the sick to the apothecaries encroachments alarmed with these outrages i demanded of many of the apothecaries physicians how long they intended to cultivate and increase the fraudulent and pernicious practice they replied with great impudence as long as the people cannot discover it as long as we must live by it we own that the gentry and people are used by us in the most filthy manners we shall be called scavengers and reformers if we use them otherwise we have no other ways to come into business but yielding all the diseases to the apothecaries till danger or death appear we must complement the choice of us to mend the matter by extolling their great skill and care and by writing two or three guineas a day of the small doses let the case be what it will we will not risque those our only fees and reputation to save the kingdom many surgeons assured me their case was the same and obliged me with the information of the remonstrances of your college which they said assert surgery as well as physic sold at the crane in st pauls churchyard to which no physician or surgeon had dared to reply which will amply instruct you how great how many are the calamities of the sick from our treacheries to them the most infamous of both heartily wish the government would chastise and reform us but who will call on the magistrate who do not know their own losses and pains and danger and are stupefied by the numberless forgeries of the apostate physicians and surgeons united with the innumerable apothecaries their masters and the governors of the families  your college discourses have no other design but the preservation of the royal family the nobility gentry and people by the sincere and learned practice the dispensary poem writ at the request and by the instructions of the president and the majority of the society avows the detestable knavery and the most certain greatest ignorance of the physicians as well of the medicines as diseases the surgeons must be in the same circumstances with you  on saturday morning a great part of my parish of the church and dissenters filled my parlour i observed a paleness but a resolved air in all their faces as in the allies pushing the french at ramillies their onset on the english who neglect the laws their property and life and the perfidious physicians and surgeons more cruel enemies than the most raging tyrant was as brave and will gain the victory their language i perceive was taken from your treatises which they had read and often seriously debated the proofs of every article are published in them  we cry out to you for justice and our natural and legal right the punishment and reformation of the most impious practisers who betray the only possible improvement of the young physicians and surgeons who combine with the apothecaries to have us forced to take their illegal unexamind unlicensd advice by the insufferable payments for the medicines we are compelled to hazard and lose our life employing them from the intolerable expense and kill the growth of the knowledge of the two professions you informed us from the pulpit that providence is not and cannot be deficient in the provision of the greatest plenty of all the necessaries to preserve mankind the magistrate is the steward and must keep open those magazines of bread the foods and all the other necessary supports and invite us to enjoy our shares of the vast abundance our government has formerly appointed the general medicines of common and most frequent use to be fold for our relief which are all of the cheapest values in the last age every family knew all those medicines how to divide or mix them what were the low prices of each this privilege is now sacredly preserved in the other parts of europe we now are undone we are plundered by the scandalous exactions of one hundred parts more than the just common rates we have together warily examined all the particulars we avow the remedies are in the small portions of their doses cheaper than bread and the common nourishments our vile physicians and surgeons are the contrivers or abettors of the cheats of the little doses instead of the larger quantities which they formerly ordered the houses to buy and to divide and mix and use in the more easy cases we are now pillaged by them in the proportions of  0  0  00 to one we are forced to explain it to you by a vulgar but most instructive example if my physician or surgeon advise me to take old malaga wine shall they permit me to send for it to the vintners at   s and   d the quart or shall they add a fulsome syrup to deceive me to alter the color to make it more nauseous and unwholesome contrive with the vintner to send it in by his boys in diminutive parcels that the one quart shall draw five pounds out of me do not the fools engage me to stick close to the vintner and his boys and to command them to advise us since we must pay five guineas for every quart of malaga we will make them save us all their fees  they saw me trembling i was assured of their affection but they rushed on me with a rage not to be expressed to you i paid six guineas for the vulgar bitter decoction sent in the small glasses and the ingredients were heretofore and may now be had for one shilling the   d i paid  0 l for perle juleps in    days when one of them is worth but   d then the   d venice treacle diascordium mithridate are very cheap in the pound i paid two gneas every day in a long sickness for the dram boles of them and the small draught to wash them down then a  th the common cordial powders are not worth a farthing a piece i knew a poor woman reduced to beggary by a crown for every one of many of them every day she was sick till a charitable physician made the cure in a week with the charge of one of them they all joined in one voice and shout we are merchants we are distillers druggists we have in our long services for our masters abroad in all the parts of europe seen the more honest and the vastly greater successes of the physicians and surgeons and we know the low rates of many domestic remedies lately communicated to us by our faithful physicians of the dispensary as god is the preserver of men the most soverign medicines must be most plentiful growing in our own climates or imported in large quantities our reason as well as the college supported by all antiquity and all the most eminent physicians of the two last centuries assure us that the preparations must be most facil and ready rational and simple not confounded and debased by confusions of ingredients or corrupted by long pretended artifices only to delude and rob us but our physicians and surgeons during the contrivance to take away our money hazard or take away our life they are not able to plead and defend themselves bezoar the vilely cheap precious stones as they call them the leaf gold are good for nothing but being indissolvable in us they do all they can to destroy us they lie unaltered in us in the room of the most useful medicines we should have in their stead beside the demonstrations of the college we know they are not medicines they are not used abroad how many millions recover without them we import into england but a small parcel of bezoar you shall hear the greatest imposture ever wounded your ears they pretend it must be in all the boles and juleps all the remedies are in the bills styled bezoarti our imagination must be tickled by the bill to inguish the assault on our money and life  i could not support my abhorrence of a crime in all its circumstances more abominable than the plunders on the road a remedy must and shall be found out   they stopped me with the acclamations of victory when the enemy runs we have the wicked physicians and surgeons under our feet our impeachment of them will require and deserve your attention and patience our government as in all parts of europe commanded the college to appoint medicines for the general use by this book the apothecaries must prepare all the remedies of their shops they are as they must be perfect medicines every one fully designed to answer the several purposes without the delay and trouble of mixture as far as it is possible to contrive them the compound are and must be every one complete in the kind as the compound waters elixirs confections powders pills oils ointments plasters the physicians and surgeons have their reward for their advice and fidelity to us as in the instance of the old malaga and are obliged to preserve to us our right not to impose or suffer any fraud to be imposed on us they must report to us the quantities of each of these public and our remedies to be used we can mix as well as in old england and all other nations the simple and the compound waters the spirits and tinctures we can divide their doses and of the confections pills and powders etc with the surest exactness how many remedies are every day and hour now divided in our houses the volatile spirits the laudanums the elixirs the rhubarb manna and the purging salts our abilities are equal to the boys in the shop and our cautions to prevent any possible error more powerful than of the playful lads they are now prescribed by the knavish physicians and surgeons in mixtures of very many of them together only to disguise them from our knowledge and the price of the whole they are parceld by their order into many little shamming doses to extort   or   guineas a day when often we have all of them ready in the closet and the greatest expense of them cannot be   or   shillings the government demands that we shall know the mixtures of the   or   cordial juleps now only used and the uses and doses of the public spirits tinctures confections pills etc for the common incidental disorders of our children and servants all the mystery was invented only to cheat us we are basely told that the excellent public remedies are good for nothing unless they play the changes on them by mixing them every hour at all hazards to blind us that a grain or two more or less of disacordiun crabseyes and coral would certainly kill or delay the recovery you must not now the most godlike and ravishing charity and of the least expense bestow a julep a confection or a pill or powder on our servants or poor neighbors they must be left for the apothecaries to devour by the rapine of one hundred to one more than we could purchase the quantities our poor have by tradition secured a small part of their property they run to the shop for a penyworth of safron of cordialwater of a powder of mithridate but their hearts are broken they are told they are little worth if they are not shuffled with bezoar and the other impostures i was then permitted to declare my resentment that we must abjure our religion and throw up our commission if we do not command that the divine benefactions of the necessaries of life shall be equally distributed by denouncing from the pulpits and by our admonitions of the magistrates of their guilt the ravages of the people by the violation of the trust we repose in our physicians and surgeons and their neglect in supporting the legal powers of the college and company to expose and punish these criminals they shall be compelled to order the excellent medicines without mixture or division and to note the prices all the families will gratefully receive and soon be masters of the most gainful instructions we are obliged by the laws to make good all the robberies in our countries unless we can apprehend the robber and convict him i and you are guilty of all these devastations if we do not inform our neighbors rouse them to join with the magistrate to seize the thieves while i was speaking my friends i perceived had their breast full it is nothing they said that we are cheated and the poor reduced to misery we are hazarded or destroyed in every sickness these collusive knavish mixtures are oppressive to our stomachs and blood often have no operation for our relief because the   or  0 perfect medicines which are themselves compositions do violate and obstruct the just and necessary operations of every ingredient you will with difficulty support your self when you hear the injuries we receive from the perfidious physicians and surgeons a sower fermenting roapy stinking or at best sugary and loathsome syrup is cast into the juleps made by it most ungrateful to the stomach most corruptive of the blood the temperate powders are heated by the acrid these are debased in their turns by the absorbing the gentle and hot and active pills are mixed to make a dose when one of the sorts was intended for the occasion of the disease or constitution all the admirable confections powders extracts are jumbled with the corrupted stinking sticky conserves and the abhorred syrups to make a fulsom nauseated bole which requires the other condemned mixture to wash it down two collusive medicines forced at once to oppress the miserable patient our nature feels and judges and in most cases abhors the base medicines they are rejected with abhorrence and thrown away and in a million of instances nature then soon triumphs over the disease assisted by the excellent natural cordials and other remedies of the family or those preserved from the corruptions of the mixture our eminent physicians and surgeons who dare not write any one thing but for the apothecarys profit are by custom trained in directing only these they cannot appoint any other they do not know the virtues and uses of the excellent medicines to be taken by themselves as the government from the college appoints  i imagined the discourse was drawing to its conclusion but will you they went on receive and believe the greatest truth in the world that the ignorance of these physicians and surgeons must certainly expose to destruction the life of the royal family the nobility gentry and people when they were faithful to us and directed us to mix and divide the perfect public medicines or to infuse or decoct many admirable simples as the disease or constitution required one or two of them together they knew with the greatest exactness if the water the spirit the tinctures the powder pill or confection were good or the worst in the world they would extol this and flg away the other and make us send to such an apothecary for the best of his they had lately tasted in another house but our vain presuming ignorant physicians and surgeons when they now s or taste their foolish mixtures which they therefore never do cannot make any judgment if any one of the ingredients is good as in the tumults of the rabble their numbers secure them from execution they do not know one simple cannot inform us that the rhubarb is rotten and the child will die if he has not better that these flowers and seeds and roots are not fit for use all my house was filled with the exclamations they know nothing of any one medicine dr r has been caught a thousand times in his blunders has lost the vvagers he wanted sense to avoid the other apostate physicians and surgeons are upon the level with him they are not made to learn them at the universities we know they are here now engaged in worse company and entertainments the merchants druggists distillers many other traders cried aloud we will maintain it before the parliament before all mankind that without frequently applying each singly to their senses by carefully comparing and detecting the differences they shall never know a medicine we cannot arrive to any skill in our goods but by many and continual examinations and trials  when the managers of this part drew to the conclusion many merchanes advanced to me with a confusion and trouble not to be described it is from this ignorance of our physicians and surgeons that the apothecaries dare make the most abhorred sophisticated medicines can you conceive that it is commonly said mine has good things and i pity the rest of the city this i believe makes very good and not one besides they sell several sorts of the higher and lowest prices the vvholesale to a retaler the sweepings of the druggists shop furnish the materials can you conceive that six of our chief apothecaries were accused before the college for making and vending the most frequently used medicines in the fest manners the principal ingredients of many of them inhumanly detained from the sick the officers of the company had injured an apothecary in the city he ordered his friends to buy the remedies most usually administered they were condemned at the hall by the unanimous voice of the venders of many of them the names of the men and the medicines are printed by the college the apothecary was the evidence against them the physicians which is the intolerable grievance we now deplore were not able to say any thing to the matter they would they must have past on any one of their patients of the best quality are they not rare cures of dr rs working with such tools on diseases which are not able to destroy the sick when his apothecary in covent garden is one of them and his apothecary in the city has been discovered and there was a large collection of their poisonous vvares which were not brought to that trial are not these superexcellent physicians and surgeons who know not who care not what they order unto us as the trade and its poverty increases as the emulation and necessity of gaining the most they can from the badness of the medicines who shall ensure us when the advisers cannot that they are not current in the royal chamber and the nobility as well as ours the rhubarb apothecary and his partners were by the druggist accused before the commissioners of the public accounts for robbing the late king by the excessive prices for the medicines sold to him for nothing and good for nothing and for the murders of many thou sands of the army in the first descent in ireland it is printed that they took the oaths of the criminals themselves were just neither to the king nor the vast numbers barbarously destroyed  i had not the power on my mind my passion made the reply the government shall not take care of such monstrous fools as you you contrive your own destruction and are angry if any one endeavors to save you you will have the apothecary come to your house enter the chamber of the sick when you should command him to the still the mortar the scales and the measures to deliver carefully all the quantities you want to prevent your being often exposed often killed as the college proves in many particulars by the obvious errors of the wanton idle boys was ever madness thus violent and fatal as yours how long a list of the squires can you make who send for the vintner to the parlour make him fill and measure each glass order the numbers they shall take off and make the reckoning of so many draughts at his own pleasure and occasions are you acquainted with the changelings who desire the baker and the poulterer to carve and send in the parcels they have designed for every member of the house there are nurses not blind and decrepit who can give the glysters and dress the blisters and apply the melilote your friends and servants to attend you have a physician not far from you examined and allowed by the government as the judge on the circuit or your minister who makes all the necessary observations attends in all the necessary cases and appoints the divisions and mixtures and the just seasons of administering the medicines will the apothecary discourse more copiously of the most abstruse causes and differences of diseases of the reasons and progress of all the symptoms on all the energies of every remedy and if he is busy in another place send his journeyman or any one of his prentices to discourse on the affairs nor you nor they can understand a notable writer on their side asserts his own great skill and not of many more but protests that the master and wardens of the company are not able and are not to be trusted with the examination of such abilities as these the man and his lads furnish the prattle do all the drudgeries for the nurses and footmen bring the doses and run on the errands and present them with cordials and gratuities when in health and abundance of them when they complain the governor of the house must be thrust from the chamber and the concerns of the life and expense is allowed no freedom of speech or vote in the choice of the physician or consultation when the rout is begun and the ship is sinking we will have the best general and pilot of his appointment though that life is best he shall inform the apothecary the methods and medicines to save the next in course i assert that he must not will not is not able to instruct the invader of his profession do you know any art or trade which is felo de se and the general employed only in rallying the runaway troops can never project or make a glorious campaign your physician is a stranger to the great design of repelling the diseases at the beginning and of assisting nature then in its greatest vigor does he know the remedies then necessary no he rarely or never uses them but he will communicate what he knows no he must raise so much out of the disease for the ruler of the affair who will not prepare with the extraordinary trouble the appropriate remedy when the waters etc lie always ready in the shop to be mixed up and divided in an instant and if our specific medicine demonstrates the just application and its efficacy the disease shall vanish before the tenth part of the sum is raised this is the duty and employment of the physician and surgeon preferred as now in all your houses to the service and when the apothecaries shall by their two or three prentices have eight or ten habitations only from one shop to another they must then as usually at this time finish as well as begin and to advance their reputation and the peoples surest confidence in them bring in to commend extol and set them off the most prepared knaves and blockheads of them both what will you think of that sort of physicians and surgeons the men of no religion or manners who ply the gentlemen of perpetual surfeits and their other usual disorders who by their banter and atheistical impudence extinguish in them all sense of honor and concern for the public welfare use them as their engines of noise and violence to destroy the college and the company which can only as merchants in consort as councils of courts and armies raise the improvements and fidelity of the two professions and prompt the madmen to cry them up the only great and allsufficient physicians and surgeons against the strongest evidences of their reason and sense  i saw floods of tears gush from the eyes of many of my friends which obliged me to relieve their trouble and mollify their pain you may be happy as soon as you please i will present you with the greatest wisdom mortal man can aspire to the most profitable invention its produce is equal to the silver mines all our forefathers were masters of it we have lost it by the foolish pursuits of luxury and pleasure and suffered our inheritance of understanding to lie neglecte and wast entertain your physicians and surgeons as the kings do in your respective proportions you will then engage and subdue them by the irresistible powers of their own interest to render you ten thousand services more than i can enumerate suppose your only son is seized with a fever your physician then must by all the visits to apprehend all the most minute and most important observations by his vigilance to lay hold on all the occasions by his incessant perusal of his authors and his practice by his judgment more elaborated from the private councils of the most eminent physicians he will address to conclude the cure if possible in     or   days which millions of events attest and not permit the disease to escape him and run off to     0 days and acquire daily more violence and danger will not your surgeons interest oblige him to the same faithful treatment of all the tumors and wounds they will both instruct you in the rates and divisions of all the juleps powders confections and in every case save you a sum more bulky and affrighting than the salary but i crave your sharpest attention they will by their interest be necessitated to teach and inform you in the uses and applications of all the medicines that you may wisely and safely tamper with all the vulgar disorders of the family and the most divine charity the relief of your poor neighbors with your council and the medicines at no cost which now destroy and undo them when the case is more difficult it is your interest to recommend your physician and surgeon to all the opportunities which shall increase their knowledge and experience how secure will you make your selves fortify your minds with the strongest confidence of success when you know he has cured  00 of the disease which has surpised you you must not object that you must have a burnisht physician as dr r or an impudent allassuming surgeon as c b your physicians learning shall not be glistring tinsel as dr r but have all the weight and richness of the metal if all our knowledge is seeing the differences of diseases of their symptoms and the event after the use of the remedies the vain pretenders may have more wit and artful negligence but yours will have more art and success in proportion to the numbers of his patients near him and the careful journals he has entered of the course of their voyage this copious and assiduous practice will make your physician warranted to you from the strictest education and examination at the college an hippocrates galen and sydenham furnished with the two necessary parts of the mixture integrity and science as the princes and people fearfully depend in a dubious war on the art and courage of the generals and admirals all the crowned heads and the knees of the subjects prostrate themselves do and must bow down and bend to the two professions when under the terror of insulting diseases the greatest honors and regards engage the proportioned zeal and affection they are assaulted and worried in no part of the universe as by the deluded unthinking english the rabble only judge the merits of the victory the aged the wise and observing gentry are lost or dare not appear and humbly offer their judgment the apothecary as the midwife is called to all the innumerable safe and natural labors of the distempers he only ses all the mothers and children but the artist sent for in the insuperable difficulties is condemned they ply their engines and waters at all the outcries of fires breaking forth the other has nothing left to attempt but blowing up and laying the houses in an heap of ruins the rabble are accustomed to the numbers of doses and irrational casting them into and against the disease the physician is accused of the death of the patient if he pretends by reason and the cautions of ruffling the natural motions by the numberless remedies to seize the just informations and prevent the fatal effect of any one violently opposing the natural designs of the recovery but as the mob are for sighting instantly and are well contented though they are beaten if a great many are killed our wretched people judge only by the boisterous management with the vast excess of the random shots of the medicines if one presumes to give the first and the richest cordial the prospect of certain recoveries will you dare go on as you begin let nature recover it self dr r and the blustering surgeon take away all the hope of recovery at first sight they swear and damn they shall die and some do so but when one does well we magnisie the cure and are infinitely pleased with the most hazardous escape thus every fever and small pox though the kind reigning then may be safe must have every two hours such a quantity of boles and draughts  as the apothecaries will have made the fashion though we see in a thousand instances many have their healths restored by ten times fewer the people will not see the dangers they were preserved from when an equal proportion remains on the table you shall hear them lament that though seven of the house got over the smallpox by the honest treatment they lost one dear child they fear had not all the remedies could be taken the judicious physician must grievously suffer and the poor patients with him when profuse and frequent bleedings the rudest vomits cupping and scarifying and much blistering and bloody water and pain shall give the grand reputation as the vulgar cry up surgeons from cutting off a limb gashing and letting out of a deal of matter and trepanning the skull i have lately been assured by several physicians that no credit can be acquired by saving the life of a patient by preventing the deadly symptoms by conducting and supporting the natural powers the healthy entertainment and feast is rejected and the luxury and debauchery are the demonstration of much respect and affection though the stomach and the head terribly suffer and a dreadful fever follows the surfeit the physicians have compelled me to believe them that their fame was usually advanced after the patients had fallen by the load of ungrateful oppressive doses the world never knew before that they lamented from their souls the calamities of the sick when the dr is every day driven on by the apothecary and vehemently dragged forward by the attendants to oppose the life by the half sheet of prescriptions in every visit or many doses and to be pleased when the next day they remain from the sleep intervening or the fortunate aversion of the patient when we do not comply with the importunities for the superfluous remedies we must trick the foolish people with the odd silly advices of an issue on the top of the head or a seton or going to bath or turnbridge what ever the disease is when there are very many may be used to better purpose than two waters only should you at any time discover one of the many deaths that you lost your son by the excessive dosing or a little impertinent whimsey of distinguishing advice and cry out for justice on the murderers you must be reprimanded that you do not consult the ancient gentlemen of the oldest and wisest observations that you cannot see with your own eyes that millions of children have saved themselves by the fierce cries and beating off and spattering out the boles that thousands of old men and women had protected their life to the longest periods by the chamber and abstinence and the dread of too many medicines but you must with all your power maintain the honor and discipline of the college which can only by the mutual improvements of the learned and faithful practice give you the great standards to judge by you must use your reason the methods the government has given you and not cry out to be helped like the careless child who will be taken up when he might have kept his legs if he pleased if the mirmils querpoes bards and the vpstarts have carried the patrons daily earnings of two or three guineas a day too far in most of the diseases and you can prove the sick were grievously injured or died by the modern and growing practice you must appeal to the censors of the college who have published them as homicides and villans  all the company called aloud we will oppose the apothecaries the origin of all our sufferings and not pay the bill of two or three guineas a day which we can have in the quantities for two or three shillings  i answered them you will expose your folly and the apothecary shall come off victorious in the trial he shall have his bill justified though he sets down many powders daily not worth two farthings at   s and   d and shall have the cost of the suit the court and the jury shall denounce your sentence we will never examine the merit the value of any dose you shall be cheated and undone is the bill  0 l in one fever it shall pass were it  00 l is it  00 l for a clap you should pay it were it  000 l if most of the boles and draughts after them we know are all worth but   d rated now to you at   s were set down at   l at  0 l you should be forced to pay it which as their numbers and their wants improve they will swear is the common reckoning for them do you trouble the court in a revengeful prosecution that all the money you can spare for your health and life is wrested and taken from you by the apothecary the government has appointed that all these medicines prepared in the shop shall be bought in quantities at the smallest values to be easily mixed and divided by you why do you use any physicians that are not honest and just to you do not inform you of the provision of all the necessaries of life your property and the obvious skill of adapting them to the frequent occasions are you fools to be governed by the apothecary are you fools to suffer him to defraud your physician you shall be whip with the rods you prepare begone from the court and report to all you know the decree we make that we will not be the college beadles the law has empowered them to restrain the apothecaries from quacking out of their shops and can if you please to support it deter and punish their members and prevent the exactions and destruction of a wanton nation proud of their laws and liberties they are always breaking i suppose they had the dismal remembrance of the vast yearly payments of the death of their children of the defeats in the trials with the apothecaries i heard die shrieks and groans and gnashing of teeth as in the old baily when the sentence is pronounced to the bar full of criminals  i must confess to you i sympathizd with them but all was calm and serene in a moment after i had assured them that the miserable english should not fall as in the sacred history into the hands of thieves be stripped and wounded to death by them the priest and the magistrate shall not pass by on the other side regardless of their calamities you shall be restored to your property the knowledge of the prices and uses of all the public remedies the government has presented to you the physicians and surgeons shall not be ignorant as now if they are honestly or treacherously prepared and pass as it may happen the vilest medicine on the sick when the life depends in the juncture of many circumstances on the dose they shall be compeld to learn the great variety of the simples and not as now delude and destroy with  0 or  0 of the general remedies only they shall not dare to confound these together in an useless mass then to be broken into little doses to blind our knowledge of the values and expose our life they shall not with the most abhorred perjury assault their own societies and deliver to the apothecarys ignorance all the cases which can only nourish and increase their knowledge and by the communications the stock of sience of the two professions the sick formerly were exposed in the temples and the porches of their houses to the views and advice of all the spectators we are encompassed only with the impostures of the apothecaries the most wicked physicians and surgeons without the knowledge of the goodness and virtues of the medicines or the different circumstances of our diseases we will implore the lords spiritual and temporal to address to the fountain of justice for the visitation of them and the most severe inspection into the state of the nation the health and life of the subjects  i was almost detered from the pursuit of my design fearing the nobility and gentry would not receive the information and the common people boysterously rage when assured that their eminent physicians and surgeons are only the setters and sweetners for the apothecaries to pilfer them that they have not the learning and abilities which will preserve them in any one very dangerous disease but then the college asserts both in many parts of their remonstrances and our most religious and most learned k charles i and the lords of this council and all the judges of england did most solemnly avow that without the one soverein remedy the profession must be more and more corrupted to the consumption of all its virtue and knowledge you have tried many medicines without success your college and the surgeons company must humbly address to her majesty who derives all the royal virtues from your great patron k charles i you will excuse me when i urge the necessity of saving your societies and the life of the public by the address to her majesty in council from the most weighty and irrefragable reasons the college discourses have abundantly furnished me with all the english gentlemen will excuse my confidence my presumption when i assert that you cannot be refused that the college and company shall be restored to their dignity and power of relieving the most oppressed people that the decree must be the same which was made by that most religious and most learned prince i scorn and defy all the objections the deluded english gentlemen can invent are they more wise than the king have they more honor than the lords of the council in that reign is not the most profound learning of the judges at that time admired in this to come close to my adversaries your college demonstrated that the profession of physic must be destroyed when the apothecaries are suffered to intrude into the chambers of the sick leaving their station and duties of preparing and carefully delivering the medicines in the shop having no reward but what they contrive out of the multitude and dearness of the doses their numbers force them to suggest all the forgeries imaginable to cry up that sort of physicians who shall fatally deceive the people support their most absurd and pernicious advices and justify and improve the profit from the many and dear medicines they must cry down the other sort who shall caution them for the future against the unexamind illiterate pretenders and maintain the property of the use of the public remedies and preserve their knowledge of the small prices of the most generous medicines  his majesty and the council allowed the clearest and the greatest truth  you then proceed to avow that it is the greatest folly that god has not afflicted mankind with the permission of any more deadly infatuation than to take an apothecaries judgment in the tender or furious beginning of diseases whose capacity was never examined to force him to pay himself what he pleases       l a day by the number of the doses and the fraudulent prices when all the parts of the universe have observed that many severe diseases pass off by the strength of nature assisted or not disordered and that the largest part of the medicines of our own growth are and must be of the lowest rates but that the unhappy people will easily be imposed on by the impostures of no efficacies in the most plentiful of the few pretended to be dear being mixed in every thing they shall take especially when the perjured physicians are ready to vouch all the articles of the forgery  your college then with a generosity never to be paralleled confessed that the physicians knowledge of diseases was almost lost that by treacherously commending every practice of the apothecaries they were by degrees more and more neglected that the disease is broken from the natural types every day by the improper and hourly intruded remedies that prescribing in that confusion of the genuine and unnatural symptoms they can never judge of the disease that their violations of the laws of physic must destroy all the patients unless the natural vigor is able to oppose them and perform the cure  the physicians must lose all the knowledge of medicines not able to discern the best from the most sophisticate not commend or reject the use of them in the most hazardous cases and not distinguish the true qualites and virtues or judge of the operations when they conspire with the apothecaries to blend together with the most fatal inhumanity to the sick the perfect complete remedies designed to be used in their full power unmixed the confusion of them confounds and breaks the efficacy to be relied on this must be the great art and mystery of the practice to kill and obliterate the peoples discernment of their prices and their application of them in the more easy and frequent distempers the apothecaries will insult the physicians ignorance will affront them if they pry into the secrets of the shop and observe the single unmixed medicines there will reject the prescription which shall give the unusual trouble of preparation in the place of the vulgar always ready to be clapped together will command the physicians fearing their displeasure never to examine any qualities or virtues of any simple or contrive any more rational preparation or bring to the test any formerly or lately published they will demand in all the houses they govern their faithful assurance that they will decry all the improvements of the learning in medicines in the public laboratory of the college or their own and report it scandalous to reflect what medicines their patients shall take  when the physicians of more cultivated learning and experience shall with reluctance betray their patients the apothecaries will select the poor and necessitous and daring impudence of the novices who have not had the observations of diseases or remedies to compare and form a just judgment of these must unite and blast the physicians of long practice and discernment of the successes of the various methods of cure whose instructions and cautions can only educate and raise to perfection the crude attempts of the practice lately begun they shall never or after the destruction of many of the sick begin to correct their errors and fear there may be more rational ways of treating the diseases and better medicines to be employed  his majesty and the lords of the council and the judges were pleased to allow the most necessary consequences in the art of physic and in all other professions and therefore determined to dissolve the apothecaries company to appoint the competent number in the city the application was prevented by the rebellion breaking forth soon after  your college generously imitates your learned and public spirited predecessors you have presented to the nobility and gentry the boldest discovery of the ignorance of the physicians in all the diseases and medicines you assert that the great enquiries are no more and by a large variety in the first and last pages you endeavor to convince them that the profession and the surgeons cannot be secluded has no honor or conscience no design or industry or ability to procure health and life it will be unpresidented to admit dr r etc to enter their protestation when the majority of the society has included them and they can plead no cause of exception  i know our gentlemen are proud of their wit and improvements from conversation and fancy that divinity law and physic are learned by rote and by the ear and in good company because some useful many very ridiculous inventions have entertained the age they imagine that it excells all the preceding times all before us were nothing to us the french they say conquered the island in the reign of our king henry v the spaniards subdued us in    that the reformers of our relion had no learning that the judges and the lawyers were not regarded that they had then no physic that we are wiser than all the world beside and have more courage and bravery that they would conquer the french sooner without any allies though our present physicians are not instructed by the professors in the university nor by any one ever after at all wiser than themselves though they pretend to little study and diligence value themselves on the general learning preliminary only to and necessary to enter all the professions or are very elaborate in trifles nothing to their purpose they assume a character they have no pretense to a grandeur and luster to cover the crimes of which you accuse them i am therefore obliged to deduce the history of physic from its original out of your books and the comments on them to the almost total corruption and death of it in our age the records are authentic your observations most just that the noisy admirers of the modern accomplishments shall be forced to confess their folly and repair the weakness of their understanding  the first labors and industry of mankind were exercised in discovering the fruits and grains and fountains the grateful and present remedies of hunger and thirst then in discovering the caverns of rocks and building in imitation of them their securities and defenses from the cold and the ravages of the beasts of prey till they had learnt from them to assault and destroy their own kind the first surfeits and pains and fevers bruises and wounds raised their most eager affections to relieve and the most unwearied solicitudes to find the medicines which should be able in the parallel dangers to preserve themselves the plants they had tasted in their searches after food and had rejected from their qualities and virtues more powerfully affecting the palate and the stomach were instantly demanded and applied the natural cravings and instincts of the patients were heard and regarded the aversions and antipathies were most warily observed and recorded the observations of the various successes were made in the view and inquest of all the little communities and preserved for the use of posterity when the small governments increast and multiplied to kingdoms and empires the medical knowledge of preventing and curing diseases was proportionably extended the first most populous countries were therefore most famous from the improvements of physic before all the other arts apollo therefore and aesculapius were immortalized as the greatest benefactors from the great improvements of the science which preserves life they were adored in their temples where all the healthy and diseased made their daily sacrifices for their protection and preservation many of the other deities were neglected there was no city where aesculapius was not addressed to for his inspirations and communications of the most sovereign medicines this alone was the profession which engaged the most indefatigable industry of all the princes of both sexes of all the nobility of the most sagacious populacy till after many ages a great magazine of observations of all diseases and their most prevalent remedies had been collected and the application committed to the assiduous practisers of the science can it be doubted that it was in many centuries advaned to the greatest height and honors when the patients and observations innumerable had made infinite records of all things injurious to health of the unhappy and most prosperous events of millions of attempts in all the different diseases and their symptoms they then had from the dictates of nature the good sense the english have now lost and cannot recover to desire in the first invasions of the most deadly enemies the most celebrated and most prepared adviser navigation and commerce communicated from the east and from egypt to the greeks the knowledge of the differences of diseases the various methods to attempt the recoveries hippocrates is not the first writer of antiquity he records many before him there were many thousand of discourses of diseases and medicines to furnish his admirable collection and the most sublime philosophy of the motions of our nature to relieve it self from the violences of diseases and in the progress of them and of the most powerful succors of its allies the operations of the medicines as many thousand poets flourished before homer who inflamed his emulation to surpass them in his poems which have never been imitated or equaled the most necessary art was pursued with the greatest ardour through many ages till galen in the most eloquent and learned volumes collected the histories of all the diseases which can afflict us and almost all the remedies which are able to repel them our gentlemen will rave at my assertion but i assert that the genius of antiquity when human nature was raised to its greatest elevation when the governments were secured by the most equal and wisest laws when the courage and arts of invasion and defense when the buildings of magnificence and use the histories poetry oratory painting statuary and music and all the other entertainments of life surpass our just comprehension as they explode our pretenses to imitation could not be wanting or defective in advancing the profession of conquering the most deadly and stubborn diseases to its greatest perfection the gentlemen who do not understand me will pelt me with most terrible objections i must in the first place request them to consider most sedately and maturely the most important affair they have ever examined and refer them to the most instructive comments on your college publications there are not many distempers which are not largely treated of in the writings of the ancients but they give the most necessary the infallible rudiments the only firm and solid foundations on which alone the superstructure can be raised all the different symptoms of diseases our nature can be afflicted with all their necessary consequences and events which will pass off by the natural efforts alone and which of them require the most tender treatments or the most vigorous oppositions as the general does not learn to conquer one enemy and one army to besiege one fortification only nor the master to conduct the ship into one port and govern it in the storms of one season of the year had they great plenty of the medicines they were masters of the knowledge of the qualities and preparations of all the plants the universe produces is a small pittance pretended to be lately discovered how vast a number of theirs are known only by their names their properties and uses are now neglected banished from the english enquiries and practice our people foolishly fond of the sufficiency of the moderns will be angry our physicians shall be commanded to consult hippocrates diascorides galen they have possessed engrost all the immense wealth of knowledge in their treasury they are the originals and masterpieces which we must copy after and labor to imitate we must obey the immutable laws of nature they have published and every deviation from the most perfect is erroneous and absurd and in the present case fatal to life they were examined approved authorized by all the nations in many succeeding ages the diseased must dye if they cannot be protected and preserved by them shall any one conceit that the preparations of their medicines were not then the most exquisite did they take care of their bread and wine only did they exceed us in all the incentives of luxury and debauchery and neglect the most potent preservers and restorers of life their medicines were prepared in the greatest degrees of perfection not enervated or debast by the impudent fallacy to amuse and defraud the sick not the collusive prescripts void of all virtue and efficacy to delude not the raging and violent wasting and consuming the blood and spirits they pretend to support the patients had all the natural mixture of their powers and operations in the substance or in the extracts or the admired innumerable infusions in their wines or other liquors but the art as the life it defends after maturity declines from its beauty and vigor the ambition emulation and rapacious avarice of physicians corrupted it the diseases the most terrible had been frequently cured and life extended to the longest periods but in pain in the dreaded dangers the solicitude for a greater for a new medicine more vigorous they fancy in the first invention gave the honors to all the innovations the giddy desertions from and the impudent affronts to all the established and constant successes of the general use the grecians and romans were assaulted by barbarous nations they were prevented by their calamities from debasing their physic by the importunate demands and therefore indefatigable pursuits of their physicians after the endless novelties of preparations the prosperity of the arabians unhappily destroyed the natural sincere practice the contagion from them spread into europe our age suspects because the loadstone was lately applied to direct our navigation that the ancients had no ships or commerce because printing was not long since invented that they knew not the art of writing that they made war with clubs and stones for want of our powder and artillery it must be repeated as the first and greatest point in the controversy that the eastern nations the grecians and the romans who excelled the moderns in all things of necessity and grandeur has all the most rational preparations of the infusions and decoctions all the extracts the artifices of all the balsams and ointments especially the externals for all the various purposes that they were able to comprehend the two first and greatest laws of medicine that the remedy whose qualities and virtues have been examined and confimd by the experience of repeated success must be given to the patient without the load and encumbrance of many ingredients of uncertain of suspected of contrary qualities but only to convey the great specific more pleasantly to the palate and stomach to bribe the one and fortify the other to receive the remedies for the whole body the other instance of their wisdom and fidelity demands our gratitude and imitation as the fruits must be eaten before they are dead and rotten bread before it is dry and moldy flesh without salt and dried in the smoke when the newly prepared is most agreeable to the taste and appetite and digestion in this manner were the remedies then administered the great specific which governs the cure by altering and reducing the observed vicious intemperatures of the blood and spirits or instantly powdered lately extracted infused or decocted the entire unevaporated powers were presented to the sick but the hot and restless arabians with the parallel folly of rejecting the noble models of the grecian architecture till they know the elements of marble the nature of the cement all the qualities of the iron tools with the madness of refusing to sail to acquire the wisdom and wealth of remote nations till they have disputed on and resolved the causes of the winds and of the ebbing and flowing of the sea lost the substance for the shadow heated one another with the neverceasing disputes concerning the causes and modes of all the operations of and on the humors of the body when the first are felt and discovered by a thousand signs and the other are obvious to all our senses the churchmen were more early corrupting in the same manner religion and morality by their endless controversies to adjust the plainest truths to the notions of plato and aristotle but to return to the medicines the arabians insulted and affronted all the most faithful observations of the great effects of the most natural and rational preparations and imposed on their princes nobility and people the most absurd and sophisticated desired for their novelty by the imagination debauched by the assumed grater industry and penetration of the impostors these could not be stopped in their career of riches and glory to be acquired by the new fashions of medicines they strove to outdo one another vitiating and destroying the genuine preparations and mixtures of the sovereign simples by their newly discovered simple and compound waters and conserves and syrups the obvious frauds of the craft prompted and incited their dillgence to invent many thousand new waters and conserves and syrups to prepare these there must be a legion of apothecaries they and the physicians unite in confederacy all their forces to damn and decry all the applauded remedies the new though infinite will not subsist them without deceit and the artifices of mending the trade an arabian prince and physician had his army pestered with another army of apothecaries as numerous he resolved to lessen their numbers by separating the honest from the knaves he appointed an unintelligible jargon of insignificant words to be published as a receipt of a general remedy many thousands undertook to prepare it were detected busy in the compounding it and were discarded it is now time to return to europe and england to observe how we have been and how we are treated at this time  france spain germany great britain had from the phenicians first then the greeks and romans beyond their own discoveries in common with all the other parts of the world the observations of the various diseases the use of the most natural and rational medicines established by prescription of constant use when the mahometans conquered constantinople and greece the distressed nobility and gentry and the learned fled for refuge into italy then barbarous after its subjection to the wild northern invaders the princes who received them with the greatest humanity had the ample reward the communication of the grecian learing printing was at that time invented who is able to express with what ardour and indefatigable industry all the parts of learning were in that century cultivated by them the britains the french the germans traveled to italy as the old philosophers into the east and egypt to collect the inestimable riches of all literature from the professors these merchants returned with the cargoes of the wealth of knowledge of philosophy physic surgery the anatomy almost finished by the ancients their pharmacy of medicines which scorns and despises all the modern pretensions to alter or improve it france first then germany reapt the great harvest and plenty from the seed received from the italians but the germans confined during the long and frozen winters to their stoves outdid the arabians worrying all the minerals animals and plants into ten thousand preparations of spirits oils tinctures and salts their chemists heated into phrenzies by their fires swore every one of their medicines would cure many hundred of diseases at the first taking in few drops or   or   grains the italians and french invade them in their turns with fierce and numerous armies of hard and unintelligible notions then with the atomical solutions of every thing though above the sense and reason of mankind to comprehend the mechanics have since come into the farce the people they imagine will have the surest confidence in their advice and medicines when one sort of the operators show the minute indivisible corpuscles of their sick humors and of the remedies and the other undertake every thing by the laws of motion by measure and weight great britain in its order had as its manufacture and trade the ancient and modern learning imported from abroad our famous universities had their professors from italy the court and nobility their physicians from italy and france our most learned and magnanimous king henry viii established by act of parliament the college of physicians your royal college composed of physicians from the two universities prepared by their professors in a city which furnishes innumerable cases of all diseases and the surest methods of cure and most just observations of the effects of the medicines could not fail to emulate the glory of the universities of paris montpelier and of italy and germany the frequent lectures and consultations and conversations of so many learned physicians improved the stock of learning and the honors of the society who can want to be informed how much our great britain has raised its fame equal to its rivals by dr linacre caius goulston the immortal harvey hamey glisson wharton scarborough miclethwayte prujean bates willis lower sydenham these physicians were capable to assist and instruct one the other the writer often enriched with the most valued materials with which he raises the structure of his treatises and fame the most difficult profession in the world cannot be created by the vain ridiculous presumptions of any one impostor they were then as grave as the judges and as learned as the bishops their modesty equal to the vast extent of their kowledge of all the languages and authors nothing could escape their early and indefatigable pursuits after the general learning of the languages and philosophy necessary to all the professions the professors exacted from them the task of perusing carefully hippocrates diascorides galen the sacred oracles of the art and compare with them the comments of the late celebrated authors but our physician is a novice knows not one disease nor medicine from the books alone as a thousand books cannot describe a face to be certainly known nor make the color taste and strength of any one wine judged of without error they were therefore introduced into practice by the professors and other physicians of experience prudently observing the present state the symptoms the progress and the crises of every disease they were commanded to make all the usual preparations to examine in their laboratories the qualities and virtues of all the remedies common sense and the experience and usage of mankind inform us that all the arts of difficulty and the highest importance must be taught by the master and instructor can there be any general admiral merchant any excellent artist without this necessary education and the master is greatly improved while he is offering his best prepared instructions but how forcible is the necessity to revive the neglected methods of ripening the knowledge of the physicians who are as the surgeons the supreme general and judge the patient must forfeit his life from his error and want of conduct  how many patients must they destroy before they begin to suspect they have erred in the judgment of the course of the disease or the just fitness of the remedy for the case and constitution but your college solemnly declares that the present physicians who never had professors nor read the authors nor learnt the languages nor ever had any guide or director in the first or latest practice know not one disease or medicine a great number of the most elevated station of quality are of the same mind and you have all most solemnly declared it a surgeon in print publishes that his art has had no improvements has lost the knowledge and use of many the most excellent methods and operations practiced by the ancients all the modest surgeons avow with the physicians the ignorance of their present society and the public as for you are not wanting in confirming the certainty but our impudent physicians and surgeons pretend to great sense to great cures and they alone demand to be excepted from the common and general suspicions or accusations they dread they are undone if our people shall be willing to learn which the comments on your discourses demonstrate that the strength of the life designed for old age cannot be overcome by every gentlemans surfeits and debauchery and every one above the discretion of a fool would remark how many fevers and smallpox and the usual incidental disorders are healed by nature alone by rest abstinence and the use only of the general cordials these are dr r and the other physicians cures whose great fidelity and dexterity are confined to the crafty magnifying of those high performances when the patient had the good fortune to escape the many neglects and the many errors and the foolish or vile medicines they employ our most assuming surgeons are now detected by the more modest and qualified most erroneous in their judgments unfortunate in their operations though there are many they dare not undertake foreigners are sent for our bold untakers every day call out for the cures they de t venture to engage many of their mighty cases as well as the physicians diseases are every day conquered by the care and good sense and old tried remedies of the charitable women  the son broke the palsy of his tongue to cry aloud and save the life of his royal father shall i or you be silent and conceal the assassins of the royal family the nobility gentry and people and share with them the guilt of the horrid crimes our eminent physicians and surgeons are notoriously engaged in the conspiracy to destroy them by their own and the future ignorance of all the physicians and surgeons when they betray the college and their company the lectures the most instructive communications and the great advances from the mutual knowledge of all the members the professors of the universities are engaged in the same designs not exacting the study of the best authors not exposing in their lectures and private instructions to their contempt and neglect the vain and whimsical presumptions and falsities of many of the modern scriblers of hypotheses and new systemes of theory and practice from the failure of their duty there are many past and licensed without the first language of the science which gives all the terms and maxims and laws which govern the practice of all diseases many are suffered without advice or reproof to assault life in the most secure cases with opiates mercurials alone the college glories in its success having abrogated the pernicious trade of selling degrees for money paid in the place of the learned purchase by the exchange of the solemn exercises for the diploma a fraud pernicious to the hope and expectation of the young students they are obligd to protect your college has been lately obliged to reject from both when the candidates had not the least pretense to any degree of merit your examinations have necessarily abated the rigor of your statutes to comply with the deficiencies of the new physicians if the professors are excusable they will plead that the english are mad and will employ a young physician of inexpressible impudence who swears he is above and scorns the professors assistance or any other councils and helps of any physician of long experience in the world and that all the practicers of great learning and observation are fools to him that he can never kill a patient following the new projects of diseases and the lately fashionable medicines that he pretends every day new projects of diseases and will give the remedies in a way peculiar to himself never thought of before him dr r claims the precedence of this new way of treating the patients when he had past his time many years merrily and had the first initiating smatterings of learning in common with every one beside t a an apothecary who never knew nor had one good medicine the professor and leader of the youngsters advised him to drink with the tutors and over the bottle with them cry down and banter all the physicians of judgment and experience will they call you to their pupils or the gentlemen of the country use you if you allow the professor and the other learned physicians to be better than your self t a at the same time played his part and assured the tutors easy to be imposed on and the gentlemens grooms and that all the other doctors were rid out and they could now have him only in the present difficulty when he was mounted the stage it was a pleasant part to persuade that he was the only good physician of the age and had then all the knowledge he would ever pretend to that he was then above all others and even then equal to himself this i avow to all the english gentlemen carries its own evidence in all the employments and professions of hazard and moment another of the more pale and sullen impudence shows his skeleton is the greatest dr on the earth the first year blasphemes the professor in all his companies bespatters all the other physicians is forced to run away deludes the greatest quality to imagine the little sonnets in latin bespeak a man able to allay the most furious vehemence of diseases but can the physicians that drink hard and these poets take all the understanding from all the nation there is a more potent and latent cause which the college in its remonstrance has discovered to us fully explained in its commentaries when king james i made the apothecaries a company the greatest part of the physicians were gentlemen of integrity possessed of all the acquisitions of learning of diseases and medicines by the most unwearied industry and study and their modesty applying in all cases of difficulty to the physicians the experienced officers of the art to lead and conduct them increased their skill and their courage flushed them with frequent victories but theodore mayern leaving france in the unsuccessful war of the chemists with the prudent and cautions physicians relying on the remedies the most safe and efficacious of the ancient and new preparations comes to our court and attacks all the diseases with the royal eagles and dragons of an hundred colors and with medicines the quintessence of gold when the gentlemen and ladies were terribly afraid of the violent efforts of the eagles and dragons but could not be easy without cheats and impostures could expect no success from their medicines their ancestors and they had taken and given to the servants and neighbors with the greatest success they had magistrale waters ordered for them of   0 ingredients in every one and magistrale syrups of each  00 every glyster had some  00 others  00 all the electuaries and juleps and pills were prescribed of  0 or  0 parts which were each made of the   0 can a prescription of   or   or   chosen simples affect you like ours which have the virtues of   00 or  000 in them when the physicians of the new project to raise themselves had made the nobility and gentry despise and throw away the public remedies which by order of the government lay ready for use in the shop sent for in quantities and mixed into juleps and divided into their doses most easily in all the houses and the grocers or druggists for every magistrale water and syrup glyster or electuary were forced to take more servants to collect all the simples to pick and wk and beat them in the mortar the grocers or druggists fly to sir theodore what shall we do must we neglect our spices and fruits and drugs to make only these new compositions we beg we may leave the spices and drugs and attend to their compositions only as the soldiers often desert they know not why     request to be put into the charter when    would have served the city as apothecaries at that time to vend the known general remedies appointed by the government and the college they saw with horror after one colony of   or   prentices from every shop they could not live if they sold the magistrale water and syrups and electuaries in quantities as all the medicines at that time though they had great rates for their new compositions your college does not inform us who made the first proposal that the dr and apothecary suld go snipps in the profit of every disase   or  0 shillings in he pound to reward the labor of the thoughts and the hand in writing ten times more of the remedies then the diseased wanted thse the old adend physicians strike up another bargain with the athecaries we will have you when we are sleepy in the afternoon and will drink and be merry with our friend in the evening at the tavern or in the night visit our patients for us and decry and keep out all the young physicians they and their prentices attend the sick with great diligence and forward the taking and consumption of the remedies but when more and more shops are daily opened they are again at their wits end and cry aloud to the doctor we are undone they will not give us a farthing for all our judgment and attendance we are ruined if you do not help us by subdividing all the larger quantities into little doses pretend to new dear ingredients in them all that we may take great rates for each small parcel and make  0 l of a disease though the physic used to be had for one now the apothecaries are in the houses they tell all in the chamber we can run more nimbly to you than the old doctor we have all his medicines these  00 years past and know all he has studied for or observed  0 years together believe me as able as he is and pay me  0 l for every distemper i will attend you without a fee and make visits to you every day your history gives a famous instance of a nobleman entreating your college to spare his apothecary who was under your examination for killing many of his customers for his civil carriage honesty and sufficiency and attending daily and hourly in his house does not every inhabitant of great britain see the unavoidable consequences i will fly from the horrid apparition and represent it in one breath the apothecaries denounce to the physicians and surgeons in an angry tone now we can harangue the masters mistresses and servants as often as we please we are your masters you must depend on us you shall betray the people and your professions and societies to us you shall always justify our practices and take the blame of the death to your selves when we call you in the extremity you shall give to us in the price and numbers of the remedies all they can spare in sickness even when they have cast off their prentices and all the servants to be dvourd by us you shall order only the shopwares we always have ready the general remedies disguised by mixture that the people shall not know them and you shall never be able to detect and blame the worst of them nor be able to examine publicly our shps you shall not pretend to be wiser than us to know any remedy but those we have we will never pardon your examining and trying the preparations you read of in your private laboratories and pretend to apply a sovereign remedy in the ice circumstances of any disease or constitution when the time shall come that we must have both the professions the eminent of you who have no honor and conscience shall break in pieces your college and company and unite your strength to raise ours on both but twenty yars were scarce expired when your college addressed to king carles  in council who commanded the dangerous company to be dissolved and as many only to be setled in the city who could provide the necessary public medicines after the restration many admirable discourses were published by dr goddard dr merett dr book etc to alarm the nobility and gentry to see the terrible condition they were fallen into there was then no addressing to the favorite duke or the wanton luxurious wits the declared enemies to all learning and virtue your vicious members many of them your presidents have frustated all your generous attempts to relieve the nation the lewd atheists of the surgeons have broken all the great designs of that company but the thinking and the suffering gentlemen cry out if the physicians would unite if the surgeons would unite they can save us and their professions but all the villainous physicians and surgeons are united they are the major part of both societies determined to sacrifice the public for their present glory and advantages since therefore the weigthty cause of the properties and life of all the subjects will be brought before her majesty in council and visitors appointed to repel the violences of the apothecaries and their physicians and surgeons and their allowance of and exacting the observance of   or   necessary statutes will preserve us i design to move all my brethren to solicit the lords spiritual to introduce it to her majesty i am obliged to collect the irresistible proofs you produce that the physicians and surgeons know no more than the common general medicines that they destroy the sick by the numbers of the doses of the worst of them now almost only advised that they have not the knowledge of the qualities and virtues of any of the specific medicines necessary in the great cases of danger that the people therefore are destroyed by them in the diseases their nature alone would expel and cannot be preserved wanting the great assistance or controulers of the natural motions in diseases you support me professing that the art is turned into a scandalous craft that the physicians are homicides how shall i be able in the narrow space i have confined my self to that the gentlemen may see without much trouble that dr r and the eminent physicians and surgeons can only pretend to the title of witty and crafty homicides  i will therefore recollect and fortify the articles of impeachment and conclude with the necessary methods you must pursue that the enemies to the college and the nation may on the promise and prospect of their reformation be pardoned or receive the punishments they deserve in the first collection of laws the prohibition of killing precedes that of stealing i am obliged to invert that order because the apothecaries and their physicians and surgeons design only to pilfer from and strip the patients it was in the beginning consequential that the sick were destroyed but its now inevitable the artists having been trained up and educated to the customary practice and have not the knowledge of the diseases and the true medicines to save the life though they most ardently desired it i will promise for my flock and will engage for my brethren the clergy that they shall call out thieves in all the families and put them on their guard and direct them to defend themselves how adsurd and impious is it to imagine that providence has not given us all the necessary medicines to preserve us that the wealthy and prodigal are alone provided for the fields and gardens and the large cargoes of the imported simples oppose and confute the heedless objectors the frauds of physic and all your publications demonstrate the great plenty and cheapness in all the particulars  the government will command the apothecaries to make their defense and clearly prove which they dare not undertake that more than five or six only do exceed the value of one penny in the portion of their use and that they are richer in their virtues every family in england was able to support the great truth by their testimony when their closets were stored with the remedies for themselves and their generous charity to all their neighbors the same remedies which are now shamed on them under the cover and disguise of the more unwholesome mixture when a malignant fever or pestilential threatened the common safety the munificent nobility and gentry provided for the people the most powerful alexipharmicks to arm them against and expel the enemy the large quantities of them did not rise to any higher rate than that of the now frequent doses in every disease do not the empiricks now draw the people from the apothecarses receive them into their protection by the large elixirs and electuaries juleps sufficient for many days equal to the prices of the knavish divisions of the modish couzenage in the fits of their anger and vapors they cry out the physicians shall not lessen the apothecaries arbitrary profit but they embrace the advice and use many of the domestic cordials the mixtures and infusions in the most cordial wines the patients call freely for them and detest the collusion of the perle juleps they have   or   of the simple and compound waters the best of the shop they join them in all the varieties of the juleps they know and keep all the most esteemed spirits the vinous the volatile and acid they have the stomachick and solutive tinctures the elixir proprietatis their elixir salutis they make  0 composing draughts from the bottle of laudanums and of the syrup of poppies they infuse their own rbubar and sa they doe the purging syrups manna cream of tartar and the purging salt the best of the pills are understood by them venice treacle diascordium mithridate the goastone the best of the oils and ointments and plasters are applied to the incidental disorders when they shall be convinced by us from the college discoveries that bezoar perle the leafgold are injurious or of no use we must prepare them to oppose the only artifice imaginable which can be put upon them the physicians and surgeons to merit the patronage and preferment of the apothecaries will pretend they must direct a large quantity of the best watered diamonds of the brighest rubies of a chinese flower lately imported in the smallest parcel the magistrates at this time have no concern whether the poor are starved or undone in every disease let us have the great medicines to save our life cost what they will but their condition is equally pitiable and must be releivd you have demonstrated that our eminent physicians and surgeons have not the knowledge of the truly efficacious medidicines and they dare not make any defense they have unhappily begun and proceeded in the english practice which instead of the one appropriate remedy to correct the vicious humor and repel that disease frequently taken demands varieties of several sorts of doses pleasant and which shall not raise too much of the patients aversion what excellent medicines are these which are not to offend tho they pretend to no activity and qualities which shall oppose the distemper the distilled waters of almost no taste made comfortable to the stomach with a small addition of a cordial water the powders are not to molest the stomach or blood by any kind of virtues or operations the bezoar is excellent for this purpose which has been often solemnly tried and detected to have no sort of operation it has been examined by the most careful trials and lately before our royal society and avowed to be indissolvable by any liquor in the body of any animal perle and the other gritty powders of that kind will take away the sowreness of an humor in the stomach but cannot operate further this and all the tribe from animals common sense will inform us as the jaw bone of a pike the stones in the head of the perch and many other projects of foolish and knavish physicians may nourish may afford a poor nutritive jelly but cannot rival the famous powders of the earths adored by antiquity and now with great success advised in malignant fevers and pestilences from the admirable natural mixtures of the salts and sulphurs i am obliged therefore to challenge dr r and the physicians and surgeons who sham their patients with such despicable wares to answer the learned discourses of the most famous physicians of this age whose arguments you report on this subject but they wound and destroy life when the ignorant practisers have almost nothing to deal in hut the distilled waters and know none of the great remedies which are most necessary to the respective diseases many ages after the distillation of waters was invented the judicious and sincere physicians with the other valued remedies gave them in faintings in the coldness and deadness of the stomach cautiously and with reserve as our old english presented a glass of wine after a journey before dinner our silly or impious advisers now gives no other entertainment or food to all the sick but these only the small simple waters pals away are liquid and moist and perform nothing but wetting and quenching the thirst dare not rival the many excellent infusions but the compound and hot waters burn the stomach enter their blood with all their flame and are the most deadly medicine in the world frequently taken as now in all the inflammatory diseases in all the young and tender constitutions and in the rise and state as well as declinations there are no surer poisons to destroy the appetite make and harden the obstructions of all the viscera evaporate the blood to water and coldness or dryness and the fatal empyreum has dr r and the other english doctors the learning and courage to encounter the arguments you produce of the most famous physicians of europe the judicious galenists the acute and most candid chemists and justisie   or   punches they prescribe all the winter as the bath or tunbridge waters in the summer to all the complainers not only the distillers but all the women who ply their alembicks shall assert that all the simple cold waters have only the distinguishing tang of the virtues of the simple almost the  00 of them in the public receitbook are dispisd and out of use   or   only are reserved as the vehicles and deluters of the strong compound which are nothing but the brandy spirit with the burning oils of the herbs which can rise and come over you infer most clearly and cogently that the spirits which rise from all fermented liquors are the oil broken by the fermentation that they do not cannot differ from the brandy drawn from wine you proceed to demonstrate to the confusion of dr r and the numerous pretenders who never thought of or learned this most useful philosophy that only one sort of plants can impart any oil to the distilled water that all the other specific operative qualities remain behind and the deluded patient must languish and die when his relief is designed from those virtues the most judicious common sense of our porters and carrmen as well as gentlemen prompts them to call for true brandy or the infusions of the vsquebaugh and the ratafies they abhor the distilled waters which raise a storm of wind and eructations annoy the palate with the unconquerable oils many hours without respite we may rescue our selves from the infatuations these physicians and custom have seized us with by experimenting what nourishment we shall receive from flesh or milk distilled if we make the trials by distilling imperial or bohea tea or coffee prepared by the fire the water from each of them shall be clear sweet and pleasant without one particle of their qualities does not our natural reason prompt us to desire for our support the cooked chicken or the jelly or broth and by the same reason implore the remedy in substance and extract or the various differences of infusions and decoctions  if therefore the simple waters have not greater virtues then their scarcely discernable qualities and their fiery waters from their brandy and oils are to be used only in the pressing exigences of the weakness and coldness and deadness of the spirits and blood as the surgeons apply the burning irons to mortifications and the cold death of the limbs if the vile arabian cookery of the medicines in conserves and syrups the most abhorred by the stomach distended and oppressed by their flatulencies and after three or four months corrupted and fermented and their virtues consumed by the sugar as flesh by the salts and pickles if dr r and our selfadmiring physicians and surgeons never knew or used the most rational and efficacious preparations they are by their negligence and ignorance our most cruel homicides as your college remonstrates the comments pass over ill few lines the vomitters purgers sweaters which are not many to be adapted only to the strength of the constitution and are only to eject the humors from the stomach bowels and pores if they happen to be duly prepared and ready for the expulsion but with the most commanding arguments you engage us to regard and admire the six classes of the alterative medicines which each comprehend a large number which are to repair the blood to remain in it to become the constituent parts of it to realter it from the diseased to the healthy state to make it watery if burnt into dryness and incapable to circulate to make it more acid if dull and vappid to restore the natural oil and balsam to unite and fortify the crasis of the parts separating from one the other by the cementing earthy mixture after the demonstration of the new and certain discovery of the four principles of all mixed bodies you enumerate the   classes of the wonderful medicines providence has prepared to restore all the disorders of every disease dr lock has enacted the law which can never be abrogated that our knowledge is seeing tasting smelling that he is an impudent fool who presumes he knows tea or coffee or wine who never saw the infusions nor had considered the color taste and scent and examined the qualities and operations by his palate and stomach you inform us that the apothecaries have prevailed on the nobility and gentry to permit that the eyes of the physicians and surgeons to plucked forth their tongues pulled out and their hands cut off by long usage dr r and the others have been gelt made eunuchs after the manners of the eastern empires that they shall not propagate and preserve the race of the medicines which will too soon and effectually cure the patients to the great trouble and detriment of the apothecaries gaining the   or   guineas a day by the instantaneous mixture of the waters into draughts and the conserves and syrups into boles what sort of gentlemen will hastily object that they may write them out of the books and when the patient have taken them twenty four hours come and consider what has been the effects and qualities if they transcribe the huddles and jargons of the compositions they shall never know the smell and taste and powers of any one but they dare not prescribe more than   or   decoctions the sweating the bitter the pectoral the emulsions by roat and memory and almost the same in every disease and constitution if they vary it is only from a wild imagination not the judgment from the knowledge of the ingredients they have been often chid severely and whipped for their wantonness in variations and alterations from the lessons the apothecaries have given them who have loudly and truly proclaimed in the most public assemblies and every hour in the chambers that dr r etc are guilty of the foolishest mistakes and blunders when they spell before they know the letters when they rashly throw   or   together and are not able to conjure or foresee what consistence what colors what tastes what confusion will be made we they say are content to know no more than the hackney doses or vulgar use and you shall not assume to be wiser than we are how much the health and life of the poor patients suffer from the idleness and ignorance of the modish advisers exacted with so much cruelty by their masters the apothecaries will appear to all mankind who shall distinctly consider the energies and properties of the six classes of the remedies they are the watery sweet acid bitter astringent acrid under these are a vast diversity at energies and properties comprised there are many of the watery which have a mixture of the qualities of the other and there is not one which is not allayed or improved by one of the other the acrids are in the greatest degree or tempered by the union of the sweet or acid or astringent the first are able and will quench the thirst and the flames of fevers not fallaciously as the distilled more waters which instantly pass off without any impression on the humors by altering and correcting the burning fermentation the other will powerfully deterge the slime of the stomach and revive the appetite and corroborate the digestion the astringent can unite the parts of the blood in malignant diseases and with the acrid enable it to separate and reject by the known evacuations the morbid humors the dyscrasies of the blood which specify and distinguish every disease must be remedied by the antagonist quality of the medicines united with it these therefore are the only medicines which by the first intention bleeding vomitting purging sweating are to be used only on the just occasions of changing the vicious disorders must be used often to supply gradually that principle and quality which the blood wants to reduce it to the temperature it has lost and must recover before the disease is cured these only can redress the diseases of the head and nerves and spirits of the breast and bowels and limbs of the blood and viscera and those peculiar to the sex they have never wanted success in all the preceding ages and at this time in the parts of europe where they are used and in england by the fortunate application of the select simples prepared or infused to name only the great and sudden cure of the kings evil in the treatise of exercise when the shop doses had lead the patient to the atrophy and almost death from the records of the ancient practice in the memorials or tradition of the nobility and gentry our writers have in many ages swelled their books to the admired bulk and conceit of the reader of their extraordinary industry with varied and shuffled receipts a thousand cordials and electuaries and pills etc of which dr willis is a late instance which they had never used whose contrary qualities make an intestine war and break the powers of one the other and are detected by frequent observation to have no operation many physicians wanting the reason and philosophy and experiments and a just judgment and to distinguish themselves by a pretended rigorous exactness have appointed the services and stations of the medicines to one part to the head the eyes the heart and the liver and womb etc these are commanded by them to attend the men only these the women in their respective complaints and disorders when the parts of the body and both the sexes are preserved by the blood and spirits maintained or reduced to the natural state besides the decrees of the most eminent physicians in all ages our natural reason will instruct us that the less compounded preparations are most agreeable and will have the surest efficacies as by the most simple diet the appetite and concoction are preserved and health and life supported if then the admired natural composition of each plant makes many of the watery acrid and hot many astringent laxative the bitters are some acid others inflaming what havoc shall be made on life in the nice and various constitutions when the quality not understood by the physician shall confine the humors in a pleurisy and purge in a consumption when the malignant humors in a fever flying off by the bowels shall be detained and driven back into the blood again and it is impossible it is absurd to imagine that our physicians shall ever acquire the knowledge of the conditions of the peccant humors in the stomach in the blood when they know nothing of the qualities of the medicines which correct them these alone are and can be the only essays and discoveries of them the sedulous examination of the qualities and virtues of the drugs will banish the idleness of the mode entertain them with the observations and improvements of the most pleasant and unbounded philosophy which examines the preparations of the old and new pharmacy the most learned and candid chemists have lately confessed that their chemistry is very poor with the presumption of the largest abundance all the acid spirits are almost the same the volatile have almost no differences all the oils are equally burning in a thousand fixed salts there is hardly any variety all the magisteries and calcinations are a dead earth and good for nothing all the alkali powders are matched by the bones calcined  i will maintain before all the learned and unlearned of the nation and prove beyond contradiction that if the physicians and surgeons have had by the apothecaries expelled out of them the enquiry after and the knowledge of the only saving medicines and use in their place only the fallacious shamming juleps and the offensive destructive sweetmeat of the conserves and syrups or have lost their learning by their idleness and sottishness and plying the gentlemens and the apothecaries over the bottle the setters and finders of their business that the differences of diseases their symptoms and the natural attempts of recovery are equally unknown to them i shall calm all the noisie oppositions and eradicate all the filly prepossessions and prejudices of the deluded people when i produce the confession of your society that all the patients are and must be now destroyed by you they will cover their face and bow down the head adore and reward your discovery and importuned prevention of your assassination of all the diseased beyond your attestation there are concurrent circumstantial evidences too strong to be resisted dr r and the impudent monopolizers of all the skill swear that all the patients but only their own are murdered the more modest and learned physicians retort that he was never taught or studied any part of the profession that he never saw a dissection that he knows not the places or uses of any part of the body that he never sees but broken pieces of disease and never consults but with the apothecaries who manage the   or   days of his absence never read the authors who deliver the laws and report the history of the victories or defeats prescribes only the trifling waters and powders and mineral waters to all the cases the surgeon who has abused his study corrupting and destroying all the principles of religion and virtue makes his reputation from the most easy and obvious cures but denounces them insuperable and fatal to cover and conceal the perpetual blunders of his head and hand but is outdone in the hospital by the surgeons he tramples on plies the patients with the same internals as the dr he now copies after and will not pretend to the recovery of more powerful which have always been communicated to them by the physicians when their learning and the knowledge of the necessary internal alteratives to reduce all the chirurgical cases made their assistance thought of the greatest use how shall we be able to pronounce the sentence in the most puzling and the greatest cause in the world the people cry out they were saved they had been in the grave if the doctor surgeon or apothecary had not preserved them that we are blessed with the best in europe it is infallible that nature as it recovers the herbs and plants of the fields and gardens by the sun by the change of the seasons by dews and rain by its own force with rest and labor abstinence and the regular use of the foods in a short or longer time does pass off many the most terrible diseases the frightful convulsions are subdued by the periods of age and the ripening of the sexes when all the remedies had been baffled the plague and malignant fevers shall be attacked by one with the acids by others with the burning alixipharmicks with and without blisters by many by few or rejected medicines by physicians and surgeons of the present smatterings of skill or of none at all many of both shall escape and survive then it is as infallible that a knavish or silly artist shall spoil the best work overset the natural motions of strength by the imposture and consumption of a large number of the vile medicines a physician was permitted by a prince in a italy to lay the wager if there were  00 advisers in the city he exposed himself muffled for the toothache and had  00 cures offered to him but i have known many who have had from their physicians the pain asswagd by death dr sydenham calls aloud to the people that our tampering in the fevers smallpox etc destroys more than the rage of war what must we fear when not many years past only   medicines undertook all the diseases dr o has in print exposed the many pairs of blisters the sweating boles and silly powders and juleps of dr r as most absurd and fatal if the mighty assurances of his single abilities do not support the natural vigor as true and presumptuous as the blank paper sent to him from court to fill with his own panegyric and demands all the wary observers and the best judges the families who have retained the old or acquired the lately revived more sincere and judicious practice do avow that millions yearly are killed by the apothecaries and their doctors raising the   or   guineas a day or the    or  0 guineas out of the medicines in every fever smallpox and measles when in the favorable seasons every one recovers from the prudent use of the sovereign appropriate infusions the now famous foreign physicians are proud of their kings who feeble from the cradle and oppressed with age are preserved by them when the loss of many our royal family are lamented the dark mystery must then be exposed to view as bright as the rays of the sun in the parallel of my ld r  r turning quack on tower hill with the name of dr bendo when the king had commanded him to leave the court in his printed invitation he rails bitterly at the college despises and pities the ignorance of all the doctors his brethren had his share of the common polite learning had an apothecary to prompt him behind the scenes and used all dr rs remedies the gentlemen and ladies were much better by time more regular living by the strong hope of the cure as they lately sensibly mended by sweating after the german had given hi dose to their waters how many malignant fevers and the dangerous putrid how many consumptions convulsions etc would have escaped if he had carelessly visited the sick to belt them and improve himself past away his time always merrily and had never learnt from his apothecary the best preparation or use of any one or the divine alteratives all the disease which afflict mankind are varied with the innumerable circumstances are secure or fatal the secure denounced morta by him and to be manageable by himself alone would have made amends for the losses the dead do not complain and the living would have raised his fame shall i add to the black list of the dead which daily increase more and more the english who resent the pride and impudence and designed neglects and the high fees for one equal in value to many visits the firm belief of the ignorance of every other physician living and on the other side detest and abhor or suspect and dread the villainies of the physicians you publish who invade every life for the use of the apothecary who prefers them and therefore submit to the chance and event are destroyed in the acute and chronical diseases without relief but from the giddy accidental judgment on the cases or the impudence of the infinite empiricks  what sovereign remedy can prevent and extinguish all these our calamities of the sick we must call for that provided by our most learned magnanimous king henry viii and of the lords and commons in parliament who established from the most pressing inducements your college and the company of surgeons to avert the high displeasure of god when the sick shall be exposed to the robbery and destruction of the traders in the remedies of the apothecaries who are to save the life and at the same time thrust into the patient all the numbers and exactions of the doses necessary for their own preservation i am not able to represent the vehemence of the zeal the sacred rage of that great prince and his parliament against the execrable inhumanity and the impious temerity of the quacks and apothecaries intruding their illiterate unexamind dealings on the life of the people in the most difficult and dangerous diseases this the most religious the most wise and necessary law was revived and restored to its health and force by our most learned and pious k charles i after the most mature deliberations of his privy council with the advice of all the judges our most terrible enemies frequently present us with the most important wisdom and vigilance we will appeal to the french king the grand patron of learning and of all the arts and most useful knowledge not to insist on the royal academy of sciences that of painters will to the life represent the vast design of the royal establishment of your college and the company of surgeons the painters meet often in their academy compare their pieces with the most accomplished performances there the fundamental laws of the strictest imitation of nature in the lines and colors the qualities and mixtures of the colors are demonstrated and promulgated the appointed inspectors and visitors and judges of the excellencies of the drawings the royal reward of the most finished pieces raise the emulations and sufficiency of all the society your college as that of the surgeons was erected by the acts of parliament as the supreme and only university of physic the two famous universities can only instruct the students in the previous and preparatory learning of the languages and philosophy there is only one professor and not many practicers the cases of diseases are rare and the hasty and less frequent visits of the patients in the several distances cannot afford the accurate observations all or the greatest part of your society must be equal or superior to their professors because the most populous city in the world supplies innumerable varieties of all diseases the furious and impetuous shiftings of the symptoms may be hourly visited the mutual consultations of the most experienced physicians will determine the state of the disease and the method of cure authorized by infinite successes the solemn lectures in the college and in all the sciences the great advancements have almost only been made from these public discourses will reduce to the most possible certainty the methods of treating all diseases and the most assured qualities and virtues and preparations of all the medicines and will most awfully as the voice of a king command the silence and modesty and future industry of dr r and the other impudent pretenders to the monopoly of all knowledge your treasury of the most useful philosophy for the preservation of life will be equal to the rich importations from all parts by the royal society of the natural history the most ravishing entertainment the mind is capable of but you inform the nation that your college is approaching to its death destroyed by the animosities refractoriness and the most infamous desertion to its enemies shall not there be a coroners inquest to examine if it is felo de se or if it falls by any external violence shall not vvitnesses be interrogated on both if dr r has often sworn he would sink it if your men of no honor or conscience your exposed mirmils querpoes and bards and their new numerous associates have not with the most abhorred perjury betrayed and exposed all your generous attempts of the society to preserve the public and its own life your publications of their villainy and of dr badger and dr bernard will convict them as well as the surgeons of no religion or conscience who have with the same perjury deserted from the defense of their profession and the protection of their prentices to the apothecaries the confusion of dr r and the perfidious members will condemn them when the evidences shall be collected by the judge that they know not one simple nor its qualities and virtues and preparations that they cannot discover or warrant the goodness or virtues of any one of the common general medicines cannot therefore insure the success that they have sillily squandered away their time in sweetning and deluding their companions never observed the true motions of any one disease advising only from the heedless reports of the apothecary they are scandalously delivering their profession to  when her majesty in council shall graciously receive your humble address and tenderly commiserate the calamities of the most injured people in the universe the decree of the royal martyr shall be put in force the learned and honorable visitors appointed will instantly redress all the deplored grievances of the nation the observance of   or   statutes confirmed by them will be rigorously exacted that the physicians and surgeons shall not dare to rob and destroy the sick by blending the complete and perfect now public remedies to blind the families from their knowledge of the small prices and great uses in the vulgar incidental disorders and contrive the most abject and knavish fallacies of the minute high prisd doses that no physician or surgeon shall ever discourse of the disease and resolve the method of cure and perform the operations in the impertinent intrusions of the apothecaries from their necessary duties in the shops to infatuate the people into the imagination that they are able on the next occasions to supply their places that the mutual affection and emulation shall be more religiously observed that dr r shall never presume to magnify himself to an immense bigness without the clearest reasons assigned of his indefatigable study and industry and of his great proficiency from the most frequent consultations with the most learned and experienced physicicians and that the detestable mirmils shall not give their licenses to practice to every quack and apothecary by extolling their skill and judgment and success when run for at the last gasp before their own as our kings have almost the divine complacence and honors when they see the magistrates diligent in exciting the observance of the laws the visitors will observe the college enforcing the industry and sincerity of all the members after the election of the president  not by and out of the   elects only and of the censors and committee by the society yearly by the names written and delivered as in the bank and east india company because all the public calamities and the dissolution of the royal college prognosticated and dreaded by you are imputed by you to the treachery and debauchery and the passiveness of the president and censors and committees who have been bribed to the neglect of all their statutes by the apothecaries presents of the patients to them or the terrors of poverty and disgrace from their resentment  i and my brethren the clergy must not look on as indifferent spectators offer up the prayers of the congregation for the divine influence on the illegal and pernicious quackeries of the empiricks and apothecaries we are obliged to visit every house every one of our flock in sickness we must with the sharpest severity scourge away all the exchangers of the fallacious doses with the health and life of the patients we must inform them it is their duty to apply to the physicians the divine laws and our own have appointed that their obligations to the justest care of the families will cure the present indiffence idleness and debauchery and neglect of the necessary knowledge of diseases from the industrious perusal of the authors and the enquiry into the improvements of all medicines we shall then instruct them how great how many will be their rewards and advantages from the most diligent and rational adjustment of the few cheap necessary remedies that the constant physician is compelled by his own interest to communicate to them the knowledge of the more easy diseases the values and the divisions and mixtures of all the preparations directed by the government to the public for their use then we and they shall as formerly with the greatest pleasure distribute the divine bounty of the excellent public medicines to the poor or more indigent of the people who will not then greedily entertain the empiricks from all countries when they can receive our charity of our own more sovereign preparations  the clergy the lords spiritual and temporal and the gentry are under the sacred obligations with you to preserve the honor and dignity of our two famous nurseries of all learning we may recover the zeal of the officers by reviving the rewards which their inestimable services claim from the cognizance and beneficence of the court the nobility and gentry the universities may be moved by us to correct and reform their physicians their perfidious enemies who deliver them up to the illiterate impostors by the combinations you have so often detected that they will not suffer our outlying physicians from them to increase their numbers and power and hasten the ruin of this university of physic our laws command them to support our vigilance and courage will be animated by the imminent dangers and destruction of all learning in the nation from the impetuous libertinage which in the late rebellion insulted on all the orders and professions religion now suffers from the same causes which affect you from the preferments bestowed on us by the atheists the lewd and ignorant with the same conditions annexed of their unmolested ravages on all learning and virtue their assumed sufficiency to determine in religion as in physic from the trifling pamphlets they read in their mother tongue  the rights of the christian church give us power to admonish the magistrates from the pulpit to avoid the guilt which is adjudged unpardonable by all the divines exposing knowingly the life of the people to the endless increase and necessities of the apothecaries and other unlicensd undertakers the company will confess as an apothecary in print has the invincible reasons for their speedy reduction the perpetual swarms of their numbers from   or   prentices in every shop and their filling all the streets must from the numerous proofs you assign threaten or take away the life of the royal family the nobility gentry and people  before old laws and establishments are pulled down and the rubbish removed we should council them to frame a new and better model to make the draught of the fabric and expose it to the judgments of the wisest in the nation the plan of the new structure is that the people shall have the liberty to do and suffer what they please to gratify the present rage for anarchy and confusion they shall be cheated and killed by any one who shall fall into that trade and employment the government has made a triple contract with your college and the company and imposed an oath on all the members to defend the professions necessary to preserve the life of the subjects you are obliged to return your commssion and request to be declared absolved from the sacred obligation that the societies shall be dissolved when they have publicly been declared useless to be abandoned and demolished as a fortress of no importance you may move that the committees may examine your conduct and discharge of your trust when they consider what laws are obsolete or necessary to be revived you may both humbly offer to them the greatest part of whose laws as of the government and all the arts are infallible that the rash bold attemps may be allowed in cases desperate never seen before but are condemned and exploded when the known methods received and justly applied never failed of success the merchants and other traders may venture as volunteers of an army their own or the stocks of their creditors in the most hazardous projects new discoveries and settlements but the general will not betray his assured victory and forfeit the honors of his wisdom and conduct the two societies are a part of the government their establishment is in force the consultation will not resolve their extirpation if the mortification is capable of cure if they can be restored to their health and vigor and the support or defense of the whole  in the mean time it is your duty to reserve to the people their property of all the remedies assigned them by the government and college to make the frequent additions to amend the defective from the many discoveries of the modern experimental philosophy and the late excellent receitbooks of almost all the cities of europe but it is impossible for you to attempt or perform it without the constant use of your public laboratory and the more necessary and productive diligence of your private and retired in imitation of all the most famous physicians and of our most excellent mr boil you must open the stores of your three dispensaries to furnish the general remedies to all the families you must revive the practice of all ages by advising only the patients in charity not too remote from you that the sick may hope the surest recovery from the same adviser observing the progress of the diseases and collecting all the observations they shall present to him you must apply to the ld mayor court of aldermen and common council who by their committee with yours resolved that the prices should be subscribed in every prescription that the bills should be sent to the apothecaries promising to deliver them at the rates assigned they were assured that  0 or  0 shops are sufficient to prepare and sell all the medicines in the large quantities demanded the infinite most facil divisions being made in the chambers religion and common honesty exact your care of the sick to direct your patients to those shops only till the government and you shall be assured that the medicines lately condemned in the eminent shops are not sophisticated and wanting all the chiefest ingredients the law has carefully preserved to you the right of preparing and disposing of the medicines and the defense of your profession requires you to invade the apothecaries to deter them from the most unjust and absurd invasion of your practice besides the patient cannot be safe without it if you advise the most proper medicine the incroaching apothecary breaks the heart of all the sick it is well enough a pretty tolerable prescript he could have sent in a better but if he has a
