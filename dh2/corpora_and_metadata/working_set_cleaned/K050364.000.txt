the validity of the renunciations of former powers enquired into and the present renunciation of the duke of anjou impartially considered with a preface relating to the guarantee for the protestant succession  london printed and sold by j marphew near stationers hall       the preface as the following sheets are written to undeceive and quiet the minds of the people of this nation in the case of the renunciation mentioned in her majestys speech to the parliament so i could not let them come abroad into the world without taking some notice of a case which has happened since the finishing the other and which some people take hold off to the disadvantage of the government making use of it to increase our unhappy distractions in this nation  it was observed by some that when the house of commons made their late address to her majesty no mention was made therein of the protestant succession and the house of hannover this the party whose peculiar zeal seems to have no other way left to show itself than in their continued repeating the danger of the protestant succession took hold of as a mighty advantage as if the house of hannover the succession etc had been purposely affronted on that occasion  but if they made some noise on that account the alarm they pretend to is doubled now when on a motion made in the house the  th of june to address her majesty for the making all the confederates guarantees of the protestant succession it passed in the negative  this fills our zealous hannoverians as they would be thought to be with astonishment and with a feigned sadness upon their countenances they look at one another with disorder and amazement  the gloss they put upon this is indeed very popular as if they did foresee the pretender coming in at the breach this has made and that because the house would not put her majesty upon the most incongruous and inconsistent step in the world needless to us and irrational in itsself but pretended to be for the propagation of the interest of the succession that therefore the house of commons should be enemies to the protestant interest and to the house of hannover  the house indeed have acted in this with their wonted prudence and the vote they have passed is certainly a much stronger testimony of their firm adherence to the hannover succescession than that address could have been viz that they have an entire confidence in her majesty and cannot doubt but that she will take all needful cautions for the security of the protestant succession in the house of hannover etc as may be seen in the votes june the   th  the ancient lawmakers lycurgus being asked why be made no law against paricide gave this wise answer that he would not have such a crime named among his citizens nor would he suggest that any of his citizens were capable of so much degeneracy of nature as to be guilty of it and therefore he made no punishment for it by this the wise legislator put a greater brand of infamy upon the crime than he could possibly have done by making the severeest law against it imaginable  the like is the conduct of the house of commons who having put this as a matter they think lies so near and is so much her majestys concern as that it is impossible she should forget to secure it they have thereby more effectually obliged her majesty to take that part upon herself than they could have done by leading her to the ways and means these people have prescribed them  the expression they have now used to her majesty by their said vote implies most strongly two things   that the protestant succession is a thing of the highest concern to the nation so great that it would be undutiful and unnatural in them to suppose her majesty could so far neglect such an essential and fundamental part of her peoples safety as to want that they should remind her of it and therefore they say they cannot doubt it   that the entire confidence the commons place in her majestys zeal for her peoples good is the greatest obligation that a faithful people can put upon their sovereign to do all that can possibly be done in the thing itself and much stronger in all respects than such an address could have been   so that upon the whole it seems that the settlement of the protestant succession is so far from having received any shock by the negative of the aforesaid vote that in every impartial eye it must rather have weight added to it and her majesty is farther loaded with obligations to secure it if that be possible than she was before  the validity of the renunciations of former powers enquired into and the present renunciation of the duke of anjou impartially considered it has been the received maxim of the present age that no peace can be safe or honorable while any part of the spanish monarchy remains in the possession of the house of bourbon the votes and unanimous addresses of both houses of parliament here the frequent declarations of our allies abroad and the speeches of our sovereign from the throne together with infinite other circumstances in treaties in conferences missives memorials etc have both at home and abroad concurred to print this notion so indelibly in the minds of the common people that it appears very difficult to remove their thoughts or bring them to understand or conceive of any other measures or the reasons which may have been given or pretended for differing measures but time has taught us to see that neither the opinion of princes or parliaments are so infallible as not to be subject to the mutations and alterations which the accidents of government and the revolutions of nations bring upon them and that which may to day be esteemed dangerous and impracticable to morrow becomes not only safe but necessary so that it ceases to be an argument against a thing to say that such was the opinion of such or such at such or such a time for as circumstances alter the judgments of men will and ought to be altered  this seems the case in the affair of peace now on the stage and which i am here to enquire into in the examination whereof i shall with the utmost impartiality search into the thing itself its nature and circumstances without taking any advantages from the measures now in hand or the quality of the persons whose sanction is added to give authority to the opinion it shall be of no weight in this case that her majestys speech says so or so it shall not be brought as an argument that the government are satisfied with these measures or that the present ministry have carried this thing on upon such and such a foundation the true merits of this cause shall according to the title of this tract be impartially considered and every thing therein be weighed with the utmost calmness and coolness of reasoning that nothing may bias the reader either for or against one way or other but matters of fact placed in the clearest light possible  the terms of the peace which is now to be made with france are at large set down in her majestys speech the quoting them from thence serves not to give them any sanction in the present discourse more than the certainty that those are the real terms now in debate which certainty has never till now been determined by any undisputed authority  by these terms it is allowed that contrary to all which has hitherto been voted declared or concluded among us here the kingdoms of old spain and the indies are given or allotted to philip of bourbon duke of anjou now philip v king of spain which is the first and main point in dispute  the contradiction this step taken now bears to the former resolutions declarations and determinations of this government and of the confederates and how it is brought to be consistent with the words safe and honorable so long and so often insisted on before depends upon the novelty of the following circumstances the king of france a subtle and politic prince had boldly adventured to break off the treaty at geertruydenbergh although his affairs were then in but a very low and threatening posture he had found it more difficult to manage the confederates at a treaty than it had formerly been and the councils of france began to apprehend evil consequences from the ensuing campaign all they had for it was that their troops in spain were in a pretty good condition and the duke de vendosme a commander of reputation having joined the spanish army with   brigades of french infantry and about   00 french horse they had some hopes of putting a stop to the troops of king charles who after the battle of of saragossa had found the castilians not so much in his interest as he expected and began to be in want of all things having his troops dispersed many towns of importance to keep possession of and the rivers passes and open country possessed by the french so that they began to think of drawing together in a body and retreating toward the frontiers of arragon in flanders and everywhere else the utmost the french could propose to do was to act upon the defensive and if possible to keep the confederates from besieging arras or st omer  they succeeded however in these things beyond expectation the campaign in flanders ended with the single loss of bouchain and in spain the duke de vendosme had the satisfaction of surrounding the english troops in briheugha beating count starembergs left wing at villa vicosa and pushing the whole german army back to catalonia taking from them all the castles and passes they had seized besieging gironne taking balaguer cervera and in brief pushing the germans into the very city of barcelona where the duke threatened to besiege them in the spring campaign  these things buoyed up the king of frances affairs to such a height as made the war seem more fixed and peace more remote than ever when on a sudden an accident fell in which gave a new turn to all the affairs of europe for heaven who seemed before to have left the cause to the arm of flesh and who suffered the several nations to depend wholly upon their swords yet now all on a sudden took the cause into his own hand and taught both sides that the views they had either way were not agreeable to him but that other measures were to be taken to settle the peace of europe than those of war conquest and destruction of mankind in pursuance of these measures death was sent with his black express to summon out of the world the several persons whose being in the world prevented either side from seeing their own interest and from knowing wherein the peace of europe really consisted on the confederate side the stroke began with the emperor whose death without male issue made way on one hand for the advancement of king charles to the imperial dignity but at the same time gave new prospects and new schemes to the politics of europe cooled several of the powers and princes of the confederacy in their pursuit of the war from the just apprehension of lodging a dangerous superiority of power in the hands of the house of austria a family who had been so justly dreaded by a great part of the christian world in the fifteenth century and whose power as the french has done now had employed all the powers and engaged almost all the princes of europe in a long war for above forty years  at the same time that this blow gave france some hopes of new measures and that a peace might be made on a differing poot than before death falls furiously on the royal family of france takes away three dauphines the immediate successors to the crown and the dauphiness wife of the duke of burgundy and daughter of the duke of savoy and all these within the compass of one year there now remained but one of the children of the family between the crown of france and philip king of spain and this an infant of about one year and half old the fortune of france weak like the state and not in the judgment even of physicians themselves likely to live long this blow though it very sensibly affected the old monarch yet it immediately put him upon new measures with the confederates two schemes lay in his view one in case the little dauphine should die before the other could be brought to perfection was the tendering the crown and monarchy of spain to the duke of savoy which as it might be acceptable enough to some of the confederates yet was much the interest of france to manage it so as that the duke should owe his advancement to the court of france and not to the confederates by which means if the emperor and his allies should oppose it as no doubt some of them would be persuaded he was sure on one hand to bring the duke of savoy off from the confederacy and on the other hand should be able to carry the war again into italy and by attempting to put the duke in possession of spain might keep such a share in the dominions and commerce of spain as should be for his purpose the second scheme founded upon the supposition of the life of the little dauphine for a while was to oblige king philip of spain to a formal renunciation of his claim to the crown of france though the same should fall by the death of the present dauphine and that the duke of berry should be declared dauphine in case of the death of the said present dauphine and the crown to descend to him and his heirs  this scheme had several views but principally to obviate the great objection which was made on all occasions by the confederates and which seemed to be the foundation of the war viz the danger of uniting the kingdoms of france and spain in one and the same person  it seems needless to repeat here the difficulty france had found to bring the confederates to enter upon any such a thing as a treaty after her rejecting the preliminaries and breaking off the subsequent treaties at geertruydenbergh it seemed as if the confederates were resolved to have no peace at all but to push at the ruin of the french monarchy or that they were so confident of their strength as that they resolved to oblige france to offer charte blanc and beg peace as we use to say on their knees but france found out a way to convince some of the confederates that their affairs were not brought so very low and the british court as well moved with the disorder of their own people as tired with the unequal burden of the war which had lain on them so heavy and so long began to show an inclination to renew a treaty the court of france failed not to lay hold of the occasion and obtaining leave at the british court to make new proposals a minister was accordingly sent over thither who having on the part of france made proposals for treating of a general peace in the usual manner and promising largely to give reasonable satisfaction to all the allies her majesty was prevailed with to interpose her interest and authority to obtain an appointment and a place was accordingly named  viz vtrecht the particular history of which is not to the present purpose and therefore is omitted here the difficulties which many of the confederates started and the opposition they made to the proposal of a treaty are too publicly known to need that i repeat them here but their management at the treaty when they came there will take up some room in the future history of that affair and may be briefly hinted at here the imperial court was long ere they resolved to send any plenipotentiaries at all the states general appointed four ministers though as some reported they were rather commissioners than plenipotentiaries or ambassadors and at length with great difficulty the treaty began papers of specific demands were given in on either hand when according to the usual method of treaties it was expected the conferences among the plenipotentiaries should have begun and each party should have debated their own pretensions when on a sudden the imperial and dutch plenipotentiaries or ministers refused absolutely to treat by conference but demanded answers in writing of the french the french were surpised at this demand alleging that they had given in their proposals to the confederates at first and received the demands of the confederates and they were ready to enter upon the particulars by conference according to the usual methods of treaties that answers in writing tended only to prolong time and to set the whole world making their popular use of them that some of the confederate ministers had made use of the former proposal to exasperate the rest of their allies and to irrithe people against the french without entering into the particular explications which they were ready to make of every head and had discovered that they came not with a design to carry on a treaty but to find an occasion to break off the treaty that there was no manner of pretense for demanding more answers in writing but to have them printed in every country with such representations however false as their enemies thought fit to make of them and thereby to animate their people for carrying on their particular designs that as to a peace if it was sincerely intended there could be no occasion for further writing of papers or proposals since they were all upon the spot ready to enter into conference with every minister upon the particular demands of their principals in order to give satisfaction to every one now indeed the other ministers had some debates and the british plenipotentiaries according to the queens real intention thought it was most reasonable to avoid delays and to bring things to a head that they should enter on the treaty by conference but they were overruled and the majority insisting upon the aforesaid demand  viz that the french should give in their answer in writing to the demands of the allies the british ministers submitted and the french ministers insisting on it and in particular that they had no instructions on that head all the conferences broke off and the treaty seemed to be at a full stop here it was that the ministers of some of the allies discovered that their business at vtrecht was not to treat but to put a stop to the treaty and that they laid hold of every occasion to interrupt and prevent the proceedings much more the conclusion of any such thing as a treaty of peace for the said ministers thinking they had effectually gained their point did not stick to be very open upon this head but they have been disappointed in this design as they have been in many more by the vigilance and conduct of the british ministers for her majesty finding this secret management of the said ministers pushed plainly at destroying all the hopes of a peace by interrupting the conferences took occasion to let them know she would not be bound apprentice to the war at the will and pleasure of the allies but that since all which she was engaged to fight for and on which as a foundation the war was begun being to be obtained by a peace the obligation to carry on the war ceased neither could any christian prince justify the carrying on a destructive war and the shedding so much blood if the reasonable satisfaction for which the war was begun might be obtained without it  upon these just and rational principles the queen of great britain proceeded to adjust with the french the conditions of peace which her majesty thought fit to demand for her own subjects with most of which the french having complied there only remains the satisfaction which her majesty demands for the rest of her allies and here it is to be remarked for the conviction of such as have reproached the queen with forsaking her engagements and alliances that albeit her majesty might with good reason have left the allies to make the best terms they could with france after her own terms were adjusted as above they having offered to impose the war upon her in a manner altogether unjustifiable yet her majesty far from suffering herself to be guided by her resentments however just has nevertheless made the interest of the allies her own in every particular and has forgotten no material demand which she thought fit for them to ask or france to grant to them but has insisted upon the same demands which the said confederates had made before so far as her majesty saw a reason sufficient to demand the same  this is the scheme then of the treaty of peace which is contained in her majestys speech to the parliament wherein as there are several surprising concessions made by france which it was never thought he would be brought to comply with on the part of great britain and for which the people of britain have a great reason not only to bless her majestys concern for the good and prosperity of her own subjects and kingdoms but also to be very glad that the said peace was not concluded in former treaties where it was observable that no provision was made for the commerce or interest of the people of great britain but all the interest of britain employed in obtaining powers and advantages for the confederates and for promoting the interests and greatness and securities of the emperor and the states general upon supposition that all our security and greatness was contained in the special and particular interests of those powers without any other provisions for our own  these particular advantages to britain now obtained by this treaty appears by a scheme of a peace laid by her majesty before her parliament june        in her late speech and are as follows   a treaty of commerce entered upon and brought to this perfection between great britain and france viz that the rest being referred to a farther regulation in the mean time the same privileges and advantages as shall be granted to any other nation by france shall be granted in like manner to us this is more than either was proposed at the treaty of the preliminaries or was obtained by the treaty of reswick all being left there to a future treaty of commerce without putting that treaty into any method or making any previous conditions as above for the maintaining the advantages of britain equal with other nations in france   the putting the whole island of sr christophers into the hands of the queen of great britain this is altogether new nor is the advantage so inconsiderable as not to be very well worth her majestys concern to demand and our satisfaction in obtaining the partition of that island between us and the french having not only occasioned much damage and blood but at last the utter ruin of the english settlement on that island and of the poor planters there by the cruel devastation of the french   the security and ease of our colonies in north america have likewise in former treaties been too much forgotten the english colonies in hudsons bay entirely ruined and possessed by the french even in time of peace the newfoundland trade has been invaded and almost lost the french possessing the fort of placentia and the chief of the fishing and the said fort of placentia not being at all restored in any former treaty we shall now be absolute masters of the beaver trade to hudsons bay and the newfoundland fishing and the colony of new england etc will be more particularly be secured and made safe by removing the french from accadia nova scotia etc where they became very troublesome neighbors   the island of minorca in the mediterranean is a thing so considerable to us as it cannot easily be judged of till future occasions make it better understood not so much for the advantage of dominion on the island itself though that is not inconsiderable as for the possession of the greatest and best harbor in the mediterranean in which not only the merchants of britain will always have shelter and protection but where her majestys fleet may on all occasions have a station a retreat a safe and commodious harbor in case of war especially in case of war with the algerines tripolins tuniseens and other rovers of barbary whose coast is directly opposite to the said island of minorca   the town and fortifications of gibraltar are so good an equivalent for the loss of tangier in former times that it is hoped the remembrance of the last may be forgotten in the much greater advantages of the former without either the expense or the blood that always attended the possession of tangier and the usefulness of possessing a road and a town in the very entrance of the straights is too well understood to need any farther enquiry about it   the securing to the british merchants all the advantages rights and privileges of trade in spain that shall be granted to any other nation this takes away that general notion which was that a difference should be made between the subjects of france and those of other nations in spain with respect to trade to the advantage of the french   the last advantage of trade we are to observe in this new treaty is the assiento or contract with the spaniards for furnishing the spanish west indies with negroes for thirty years this speaks itself and needs not that i should add any thing but what is natural  viz that it is an increase of trade to the britsh merchants and traders to africa of such a consequence that we shall no question improve to a very great degree   these seven are particulars wholly left out or very much neglected in all the former articles of whatever kind which we have yet seen transacted with the french and which at least may afford us this deduction viz that her majesty has been just so much more concerned for the good of her own subjects than she was allowed to be in the late administration  as to the general articles relating to the pretender the protestant succession and the house of hannover they stand as before  come we now to enquire into the general security and the public peace and interest of europe the balance of power has been always laid down as the first and most essential thing to be provided for as that on which the safety of europe depended and as the only method which could be found out to prevent the exorbitant greatness of france and keep him from overrunning the rest of christendom and to keep up the general harmony among the rest of the powers of europe this balance of power was thought to be effectually destroyed by the seizing of the spanish monarchy into the hands of a branch of the house of bourbon by which was most justly apprehended that in consequence of the usual methods of the french government the great and powerful monarchies of spain and france should immediately be united in the same person which would be the apparent ruin of the peace of europe to prevent this melancholy view of the public affairs of europe the other powers of that part of europe principally concerned took arms and joined with the imperial armies which were then entered upon action against france the emperor having begun the war the year before this was called the grand alliance in which the abovesaid manifest breach of the said balance of power was made the most essential foundation and the obtaining a safe and lasting peace was made the ultimate end as is more particularly expressed in the preamble to and article of the said grand alliance of which haec sunt verba  whereas charles ii king of spain of most glorious memory being not long since dead without issue his sacred imperial majesty has claimed the succession in the kingdoms and provinces of the deceased king as lawfully belonging to his august family but the most christian king aiming at the same succession for his grandson duke of anjou and pretending a right did accrue to him by a certain will of the deceased king has usurped the possession of the entire inheritance for the aforesaid duke of anjou and invaded by his arms the provinces of the spanish low countries and the duchy of milan has a fleet ready fitted in the port of cadiz has sent several ships of war to the spanish west indies and by this and many other ways the kingdoms of spain and france are so closely united and cemented that they may seem henceforward not to be otherwise considered than as one and the same kingdom so that it sufficiently appears unless timely care be taken that his imperial majesty will be destitute of all hopes of ever receiving satisfaction in his pretention the sacred roman empire will lose its rights in the fiefs belonging to it in italy and the spanish netherlands the free intercourse of navigation and commerce which the english and dutch have in the mediterranean the indies and other places will be utterly destroyed and the united provinces will be deprived of the security which they enjoyed by the provinces of the spanishnetherlands lying between them and the french which is commonly called a barrier lastly that the french and spaniards being thus united will in a short time become so formidable to all that they may easily assume to them the dominion over all europe and therefore by this way of proceeding of the most christian king his imperial majesty was brought under a necessity of sending an army for the preservation as well of his own interest as the fiefs of the empire the king of great britain has thought it requisite to send his forces to the assistance of the states general whose affairs are in the same condition as if they were actually invaded and the states whose frontiers lie as it were in a manner exposed on all sides by the breaking and taking away of that since commonly called a barrier which screened them from the neighborhood of the french are forced to do all these things for the safety of the commonwealth which they should and could do if they were in a war and whereas so dubious a posture of their affairs is more dangerous than a war itself and that france and spain take advantage of this state of their affairs to make a stronger and firmer union among themselves for oppressing the liberty of europe and taking away the freedom of commerce these reasons induced his sacred imperial majesty his sacred royal majesty of great britain and the high and mighty lords the states general of the united provinces to obviate so great evils as might rise from thence and desiring as much as lies in their power to apply remedies thereto have thought a strict conjunction and alliance between themselves necessary for repelling the greatness of the common danger  this balance of power being then the foundation of the war it follows to enquire what were the steps taken by each party to preserve the same in the prosecution of the war and for this we shall find the method taken in the beginning was to allot to each power such shares as the whole thought fit and proper for them to enjoy and to cause them to enjoy and to cause them to acknowledge themselves satisfied with the same and solemnly to renounce any claim to the other parts which they may have other rights unto this will appear in the two several treaties of partition the first made by the late king william and the states general with the king of france in favor of the electoral prince of bavaria deceased and the latter in favor of the then archduke charles since become king of spain and now emperor from whence it appears that however some complaints may have been made of the french kings little regard to the renunciation of the pyrenees that yet not king william only but the states general and other princes of europe did find it convenient and think it sufficicient to depend upon such solemn renunciations as sufficient securities together with the other provisions of those treaties against the future attempts as well of france as of other powers concerned in those treaties this is expressed more plainly in the said treaties of partition thus  on the account of which said kingdoms islands provinces places the said most christian king as well in his own as in the name of monseigneur the dauphin his male children or etc who has also given his full power to the count de tallard and to the count de briord promising and engaging themselves to renounce at the opening of the said succession of spain as in this case they have at this time renounced by these presents all their rights and pretensions to the said crown of spain and to all the other kingdoms islands states lands and places which at this time depend thereupon except what is above excepted for his part all which they shall confirm by solemn acts in the most authentic and best form  and again on the contrary part of the same treaty where you have the following words  and the said emperor as well in his own names as in that of the king of the romans the most serene archduke charles his second son the archdutchess his daughters his children male etc or their issue as also the said king of the romans in his own name shall renounce when they shall enter into and ratify the present treaty and the most serene archduke charles as soon as he shall be of age all other rights and pretensions to the said kingdoms islands states lands and places which compose the share or portion assigned to monseigneur the dauphin and of him who shall have the duchy of milan in exchange of what shall be given to monseigneur the dauphin of all which they shall cause the most solemn and authentic acts to be made that may be that is to say the emperor and the king of the romans when they shall ratify this present treaty of the most serene archduke as soon as he shall come of age which shall be delivered to his britannick majesty and the said states general  by these articles it appears that notwithstanding all the pretensions made against the king of france for the breaches made by him of such former treaties and the pretended insufficiency of such acts of renunciation to bind the king of france where his interest interferes therewith yet that the said late king william the states general as well as the other protestant powers of europe either did think such renunciations sufficient or found no other way practicable to bind the said princes and powers than such renunciations and that therefore they were not the less to be made use of or had recourse to on such occasions however the king of france might have disregarded the former renunciations of the pyrenees  the queen of great britain having then found it necessary in the prosecution of this war to hearken to such proposals of peace as have been made on the part of france in order to put an end to this bloody and tedious war it cannot seem so strange a thing as some people would imagine or persuade us that her majesty should lay some stress on the validity of a formal renunciation on the part of the duke of anjou as it respects the claim the said duke of anjou has or may have in case of the demise of the present dauphin of france to the dominions of his grandfather the present king of france  having then proved the reasonableness of continuing the said form in treaties of peace i shall now examine what difference there appears between the said former renunciations of the king of france and the present renunciation proposed and wherein the security of this present renunciation consists in order to this it seems necessary to look back into the nature and reason of the proposals of peace it is known as above that the breach of the said balance of power in europe consisted in the conjunction of the interests and powers of the respective monarchies of france and spain it is confessed it were to have been wished on this account that it had pleased god that either the electoral prince of bavaria to whom spain was allotted by the first treaty of partition mentioned above or the late emperor joseph had not died without heirs so as that the possession of the imperal dignity or the dominions of the house of austria had not descended to the person of the present emperor but these events having fallen in and it being impossible to prevent the consequences attending the case must therefore be considered as it is not as it were wished to have been the king of france and the emperor of germany are the only competitors for the spanish monarchy there is no room to doubt but the balance of power is entirely broken whichsoever of these two we to possess the whole of this new prize so that it seems necessary to the peace of europe that some medium be found out to adjust this matter  it is not the present work to offer mediums but to consider the validity of those already offered her majesty has in her speech to the parliament given in a scheme on which this great work is to be or may be founded and has added under her own royal authority that by this scheme the three greatest things in the present disputes about peace are provided for viz   that france and spain are more effectually divided than ever   that a real balance of power will be fixed in europe liable to as few accidents as human affairs can be exempted from   that the nature of the proposal is such that it executes itself   these articles seem to be thus explained    that france and spain are more effectually divided than ever that is that the duke of berry being declared next heir in case of the death of the dauphin without heirs france will be embarked by him  he being in immediate possession against spain which may be supposed to assist king philip and that the duke of berry will not fail to defend his own pretensions this seems to be founded upon so good authority that if he should be supposed to give it up he must act against reason and nature   that a real balance of power will be fixed in europe liable to as few accidents as human affairs can be exempted from this is built on the supposition of the respective parties being divided as above the consequence of which may be that they will be ever fortifying their interest with friends and confederates leagues and treaties one against the other  viz the house of austria will not fail to be strictly allied to and in the interest of the king of spain as ever in so far as the alliance respects france because of the view that house will have to their own claim of the crown which is for ever to be excluded from the house of bourbon after the failure of the heirs of king philip   that the nature of the proposal is such that it executes itself this is the just inference from the other two signifying that as before the successors of the king of france in failure of the dauphin will naturally stand up against philip and insist upon the renunciation made at this treaty and will therefore exclude him from any pretensions with all their power the confederates will naturally and for the same reasons which induced them to commence and carry on this war fall in and join themselves to the said sons of france to keep out the king of spain and prevent his succeeding from that one received maxim which i mentioned at the first of this work viz that it is inconsistent with the safety and peace of europe that the monarchies of france and spain should be possessed by the same person and on the other hand spain itself will unwillingly succor or further the pretensions of their kings as what is several ways against their interest and would reduce their country to be but a dependent on and as a province to the kingdom of france to come a little into the sense of these things it seems necessary to observe here   that the effectually establishing a balance of power in europe is the real end and design of this war all the declarations all the public papers all the arguments on both sides are full of this both the treaties of partition the renunciation at the pyrencan treaty the setting up king charles the opposing the possession of king philip all these are founded on this notion that the safety of europe consists in maintaining an equal balance of power among the several princes and states concerned in this war   that the effectual dividing of the interests of spain and france is the only effectual method for preserving this balance of power and then it will come to be enquired   whether the present scheme of philips renunciation be an effectual dividing the interests of spain and france yea or no    that the effectual establishing a balance of power in europe is the real end and design of the war her majestys declaration of war and the declarations of the princes and powers now engaged in this war together with the grand alliance among the confederates will all testify in defense of this proposition and to them i refer my reader wherein the liberty of europe the public tranquillity the balance of europe are terms used to signify the same thing and are all along made use of as the reasons of the war as in her majestys declaration of war may     0  and likewise in the declaration or manifesto of the states general may     0   many the like might be produced to prove if it were needful that these were the true grounds of the war but this being sufficient i pass to the next head viz   that effectual dividing the interest of france and spain is the only way to preserve or restore the balance of power in europe this also is as evident from the course of the whole war the setting up king charles as king of spain had no other foundation for he had at that time no pretense to claim the crown of spain his elder brother being alive and having children to succeed but the crown of spain was allotted to him on this very foundation that the monarchy of france might have nothing to do with the dominions of spain in all the treaties that have been set on foot on every hand for the putting an end to the war this has been the foundation of all the rest  viz that the kingdoms of france and spain might not come into the possession of the same prince nay the king of france himself has acknowledged it to be a just foundation and has made it the foot upon which he has always made his proposals of peace as is apparent from the late proposals called the six preliminaries wherein he owns in express terms that it is not safe for europe that france and spain should come to be governed by the same person at the same time and therefore proposes to give sufficient security to the allies that such a thing should never happen this maxim is deduced from the former  viz the preserving the balance of power in europe and is the main point for which this bloody war has been so long carried on  but all the schemes for bringing this to pass have hitherto proved ineffectual the war has proved tedious and tiresome and the nations have been exhausted to such a degree by it that the subjects on every side call for peace the french though pushed with great success and with infinite losses every year yet lose their ground by inches twice they have beaten the confederates out of spain although they had possessed even the capital city and the principal provinces and they still appear in a formidable posture on the frontiers so that it seems to be still the work of many years to reduce them on the other hand the several offers france has made of evacuating spain has been looked upon as unsafe or insincere but providence having removed the princes of the house of bourbon on the one hand and brought king charles to the imperial dignity on the other by which it appears that the same reasons for settling the crown of spain on his head does not exist as before and that it might be equally dangerous to europe to make one and the same person emperor and king of spain as king of france and spain the said balance of europe being thereby destroyed as much the one way as the other this being the case a new expedient offers  viz to make a new establishment or entail of the several crowns of france and spain so that the interests of several princes might be rendered incompatible and that it might appear divided in those interests so that it being naturally impossible for them to agree as to soveraignity the peace of europe might be secured as the consequence  to bring this to pass mutual renunciations have been also needful but as these things called renunciations have suffered some scandal in the eyes of the confederates it might be expected the opposers of peace would immediately object against the very word itself as unsatisfactory but considering men always distinguish of matters in order to judge rightly and in doing this it will appear that as in her majestys speech it is observed this treaty executes itself so that the validity of this article does not so much consist in the validity of the renunciation as the validity of the renunciation depends upon the nature of the thing for example supposing the crown of france falls as may be said by descent to the present philip the duke of berry being declared dauphin by virtue of this treaty and being immediately in possession of the crown of france no man can think so absurdly as to suppose he will demit to his brother philip who also has given up his right nor can any man suggest that philip can force him to it after he is in possession for it will always be allowed that there will be a great difference between a king of spain renouncing france and a king of france renouncing spain as to the power of forcing their pretensions this then being the case here there remains no more difficulty but that the circumstances of the two persons will effectually divide the kingdoms for if the duke of berry who is the younger brother keeps the crown of france not the house of austria would be more inconsistent with his interest than his brother philip who cannot but with regret see him established on a throne which was his birthright and which he had with esau given up for a mess of spanish pottage  the renunciation joined with want of power has double efficacy in this case and i see nothing remaining to doubt the duke of berry being able to maintain himself against philip unless we should suppose a faction in france to favor king philip which considering the absolute dominions of the kings of france is also not very probable but if this should happen then are all the confederates engaged as allies to the duke of berry to support him in his claim and so france britain holland and the empire are in confederacy against spain which is such a wild disproportion that the danger cannot be thought sufficient to any wise man to make the least uneasiness in our minds on the other hand if the present dauphin lives and should have children as may very probably happen then the whole chimera vanishes at once and the renunciation may never come to take place or if it do it may be so many ages hence that no man can so much as suggest what the circumstances of that time may be or make any provision against it be  then that either of these cases are the present state of europe as one of them must be what rational doubt can any man start in the present case why this is not a sufficient security to europe against the fear of uniting the kingdoms of france and spain since to argue against it must be to argue against human nature and suppose the young duke of berry who is a prince of as much fire as most men in europe should tamely and quietly give up his claim to the crown of france and that too after he is in possession of it and quit it to his brother who has been expunged by his own voluntary act and deed and by a formal renunciation which is made legal and accepted in all the most effectual and strongest terms in the french constitution and all this to be done by the strongest prince to the weakest by the prince who has power in his hands to keep possession to that prince who has no power forcibly to dispossess him  these are absurdities necessary only to a baffled argument and which none but the weakest people in the world would lay any weight upon and serve only to confirm any reasonable person in the validity of this renunciation and in the truth of what her majesty has laid down in these three heads   that the balance of power is secured   that the kingdoms of france and spain are divided effectually   that the nature of the treaty is such that it executes itself   finis
