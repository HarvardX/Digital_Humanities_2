temple bar and by the booksellers and pamphletsellers of london and westminster mdccxxx price sixpence  on royal benevolence most humbly inscribed to her majesty queen caroline most bounteous queen my grateful thanks i pay which scarcely for the dress of words will stay your royal majesty a muckworm took from labor pleased with his mean trifling book and now the reptile at your footstool lays in humble strains to sing your worthy praise the wits profane may court uranias aid and make addresses to a fictious shade but i need no such phantoms to inspire your royal bounty sets my soul on fire and what i loved before i now admire as on our parents labor was entailed i worked and fallen state of man bewailed i prayed for ease from sorrow want and pain and labored my poor offspring to maintain without ambitious thoughts or wishes vain i found my ease in only rest from pain and blessed the giver when i thrashd the grain yet want sometimes would stare me in the face and scarce my labor would supply my race when heaven in pity to my poor estate brought me in favor with the wise and great and heaping bounty upon bounty more raised me to plenty from a threshingfloor your royal goodness over my cottage shone with brighter beams than did the rising sun and from a barn companion to the mice placed me at ease and in a paradise under great heaven my queen i must adore whose bounteous soul no captive needs implore like phoebus in his glory all she sees and blesses all in various degrees may heaven preserve all who surround her throne and may her line never want a royal son now as i have leisure fancy to display my pen shall ever grateful homage pay for sure no wretch can ere so stupid prove as to be blind to such abundant love what am i  what i was  from whence i came are thoughts cannot leave me long without a theme when ere i view the grain in barn or field or see a farm that does gods blessing veild the prospect will such contemplation raise as must begin in joy and end in praise no meadow green or stack or cock of hay but where i view will furnish an essay and then the objects of my praise will be the mighty lord and her great majesty our god the author of benevolence who does by second causes gifts dispense in goodness as in greatness infinite his children to good actions does excite he saw her majesty made up of love and often heard her orrisons above to know his will and knowing it to do his work is all she aims at here below the almighty seeing so much christian grace and how on earth she ran the heavenly race has constituted royal caroline his agent here to make his glory shine the noble great and powerful humbly kneel submissive full of loyalty and zeal and ask but to obey to all commands signed by such just and mutal royal hands the poor anticipated have no more than but to have it barely known they are poor nay some have strove their poverty to hide through shame or what should shame remaining pride but such our royal queen in secret found and brought them out of mire to blessed ground and this contriving and performing good runs in each vein of hanoverian blood on providence could mortals taste of heavenly bliss and joy the rapture would the human frame destroy our little minds tossed with perpetual cares are lost when grief or joy comes unawares excess shakes nature but vicissitude in moderation is an interlude when right applied to all our humane good i who have labored in a threshingfloor was once contented in my state though poor yet like all mortals still i prayed for ease but labored still like the industrious bees knowing the winter comes when food is dear and nature wants supplies of wholesome cheer justly to think is happiness on earth and cheerful thoughts at labor is sound mirth i who have labored for a trifling sum was pleased to think the time of pay was come one shilling goes for this and one for that and still the flail went patt and patt apatt the wife would say how can you be content i know not how to pay your quarters rent i bid her look on birds in bushes there and see the little silly insect here behold the order of the universe and ask the hen and chickens for a purse she talked like woman guided by a will who nothing knew of real good or ill but when she had the course of things surveyed she owned what all must own heaven sends its aid to all its creatures reason and instinct join and both with care complete our gods design a virtuous man may various troubles find but still the greatest troubles in the mind the death of friends affects us  poor we pine but could we see our makers great design there is some good end and something that is divine finis
