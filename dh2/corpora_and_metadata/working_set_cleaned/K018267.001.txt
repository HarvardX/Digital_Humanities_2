george iii portrait of george iii  a complete history of the late war or annual register of its rise progress and events in europe asia africa and america  and exhibiting the state of the belligerent powers at the commencement of the war their interests and objects in its continuance interspersed with the characters of the able and disinterested statesmen to whose wisdom and integrity and of the heroes to whose courage and conduct we are indebted for that naval and military success which is not to be equalled in the annals of this or any other nation  illustrated with a variety of heads plans maps and charts  by j wright gent  in two volumes  vol i  london printed for david steel bookseller at the bible and crown king street little tower hill  mdcclxv  the preface we have taken the earliest opportunity that a judicious inspection and mature consideration of events could give us of presenting to the public a complete history of the late war not less important than we hope useful and correct written with an impartiality which should be the guide of every historian and from which we have not deviated through national affection  we have taken up our history from the commencement of the war and have bestowed all the pains upon it so interesting a subject requires which however we must acknowledge deserves much more skilful workmen none was ever more formed to excite curiosity from the importance of events the dignity of the persons engaged the greatness of the actions performed and the amazing revolutions of fortune for the reader will here find the scattered accounts of this war which has been carried on in the four quarters of the world united in one connected narrative and continued to the peace  to effect this from the materials that offered has been a work of more labor than may at first appear and to render these transactions which have not been less our amazement than the worlds in general the more conspicuous and clear we have added in notes the accounts transmitted from the commanders of our fleets and armies and published by authority when facts were recent and the immediate object of universal attention these will illustrate and confirm the history and our readers must be pleased to see so many curious and important pieces which while they give the clearest evidence support the national character to future ages in many places we find them filled with the actions of inferior officers which with less care in their superiors would have been lost in the multiplicity of events this care not less commendable than useful will excite officers to seize every opportunity of immortalizing their fame and doing honor to their respective corpse some of these letters must be useful in forming the young soldier as they are very expressive

of prussia ground of the quarrel between her imperial majesty and that monarch treaty of petersbourg treaty of versailles king of prussia enters saxony and bohemia battle of lowositz saxon army surrenders  the original plan of this work proposed no more than that each volume should contain a narrative of those events which distinguish its own year but because we have entered upon our undertaking in the heat of an almost general and very important war i thought it would not be unnecessary or disagreeable to look a little farther back it would be difficult perfectly to understand the operations of the several powers at war without reviewing the transactions of the preceding years nor would it be easy to enter into the spirit of these without examining the causes which more nearly or remotely operated to produce those troubles that have involved so many parts of the world in one common distraction  the war in which all parties and interests seem now to be so perfectly blended arose from causes which originally had not the least connection the uncertain limits of the english and french territories in america and the mutual claims of the houses of austria and brandenbourg on the duchy of silesia it is no wonder that the two former powers seizing on a country in which they considered the right of the natural inhabitants as nothing should find it a very difficult matter to settle their own for a long time neither of these powers were sufficiently acquainted with the geography of america to enable them to ascertain the limits of their several pretensions with any tolerable exactness nor indeed were these matters deemed of sufficient moment to call for a very laborious discussion at the treaty of utrecht whilst so many more important interests or what then seemed more important were discussed the limits of nova scotia then called acadia were expressed only in general terms and left to be put on a more certain footing by subsequent negotiations these negotiations pursued with no vigor and drawn out into an excessive length seemed only to increase the former confusion after the accession of the present royal family a french connection perhaps necessary from the circumstances of the time and afterward a certain negligence of all affairs but those of our domestic polity suffered this important point to vanish almost wholly out of our consideration during this interval our colonies on the continent of north amerca extended themselves on every side whilst agriculture and the maritime commerce flourished on their coasts the indian trade drew several of our wandering dealers far into the inland country and beyond the great mountains here they found themselves in a delightful climate in a soil abundantly fruitful and watered with many fair and navigable rivers these advantages joined to those of the indian trade appeared to compensate for its remoteness from the sea it was judged that as the first settlers on the coast we had a good right to the inland country and if so to the navigation of the missisippi which opened another door to the ocean with these views a company of merchants and planters obtained a charter for a considerable tract of land near the river ohio on the western side of the alleganey mountains but within the province of virginia and the adventurers began to settle pursuant to the terms of their patent  now began to shoot forth the seeds of another dispute which had long lain unobserved but which proved altogether as thorny and intricate as that concerning the limits of acadia the french pretending to have first discovered the mouths of the missisippi claimed the whole adjacent country toward new mexico on the east quite to the apalachian or alleganey mountains on the west they drove off the new settlers and built a new fort called du quesne on the forks of the river monongahela a situation which commanded the entrance into all the country on the ohio and missisippi  the reader will observe that i do not pretend to decide concerning the right of either nation in this contest it is evident enough that the consideration of the right had much less influence on both parties than the consideration of convenience should the french be able to unite canada to their colonies at the mouth of the missisippi by a possession of all that vast country which lies between them the english colonies must lose all share in the indian trade in time of peace and in time of war be exposed to continual dangers or to the ruinously chargeable defense of a frontier more than   00 miles in length if on the contrary the french should fail to make good these claims on the ohio and those on nova scotia their two colonies entirely disunited and the entrance into one shut up for the winter season by frost and the entrance into the other difficult in all seasons by the banks at the mouth of the missisppi must certainly lose all their value to france and in their fall involve much of the fortune of their great settlements in the west indies  colonies to arm and three operations were actually undertaken one against fort du quesne under braddock the other two against the french forts in nova scotia and the fort of crown point on the frontiers of new york the two courts in the mean time breathed nothing but peace and exchanged reciprocal professions of friendship and good will which deceived neither party  they who are of opinion that the passions and characters of the ruling men influence all public concerns as much as the public interests themselves thought they saw other causes operating to hasten this breach on the death of a great minister which happened some time before the administration was new molded some persons then taken in were considered as belonging to a party not perfectly united with the remains of the old administration it was thought that the leading man of this party proposed to work out the old servants of the crown in order to make way for a more uniform system as long as peace subsists government is supported by itself and any change is difficult but the conduct of a war is a thing critical to a ministry the leader of this party therefore conscious of his own talents which all men acknowledged to be conspicuous and of his connections which were considerable warmly pushed on a war seconded by the fairness of the public motives and the general voice of the people in this war his friends relied that things must necessarily be so embarrassed that the old party would find themselves obliged to retire and to leave the stage clear for them to serve their country according to their own plans and on their own terms this design was believed to be pushed forward by another great man of that party who had played a game nearly of the same kind before and in whom an advanced age had not abated any thing of his natural fire and love of violent councils  adm boscawen portrait of admiral boscawen under general braddock that general abounding too much in his own sense for the degree of military knowledge he possessed commanding in a country which he did not know and carrying on a species of war in which he had no experience suffered himself when he had advanced within  0 miles of fort du quesne to be surprised by an ambuscade of french and indians    during this summer our court took a resolution not to wait the precarious operation of our arms in america for redress of the grievances complained of but to strike such a blow as would at once put a security into our hands for the evacuating the places the enemy had fortified in our territories and disable them in the two most material points the resources of their trade and their seamen their merchant ships were every where attacked as if war had been actually declared and vast numbers brought into our ports the french made all europe resound with complaints of what they called a proceeding so unjust and a violation of the law of nations so flagrant and unprecedented but whether it was that they were really in no condition to act or that they intended to influence the other courts in their favor by a show of extraordinary moderation they contented themselves with this and neither declared war nor made any sort of reprisal for several months after  this was done whilst the nation trembled under a shameful panic too public to be concealed too fatal in its consequences to be ever forgotten the real invasion did not lessen our fears of the imaginary one it threw us into a confusion that suffered us to be sensible of nothing but our own weakness we did not look upon ourselves sufficiently secured by the arrival of the hanoverian and hessian troops which the same weakness had induced us to call to our assistance the ministry seemed to have been infected with the common terror for though they had very early notice or the french designs such was the apprehension of the invasion or such the illcontrived disposition of our navy that admiral byng was not dispatched to the mediterranean before the  th of april and then with a squadron of no more than  0 ships of the line  the engagement with the french fleet under m galissoniere the retreat of byng by which the garrison of fort st philip was cut off from all hopes of relief of a court martial to revive the british spirit and to the unfortunate necessity of shedding the blood of an admiral a person of a noble family as a sacrifice to the discipline of our navy    the alliance with russia was chosen for reasons which were then sufficiently plausible though it is to be hoped they can never subsist again the long ill understanding between the king of prussia and our court and his close connection with that of versailles raised no illgrounded apprehensions that he might be induced to act a dangerous part on this occasion russia was therefore a proper ally who had both a political and personal enmity to this monarch and who would be sure to employ a great power with great vigor in such a cause but this system was in a short time totally reversed the king of prussia had been too well apprised of the close conjunction of the courts of petersburg and vienna and of the real motive to that conjunction to have the least design of embroiling himself with england matters were therefore very soon explained and the treaty between his prussian majesty and this court to keep all foreigners out of the empire was signed at london in january      these treaties were censured as inconsistent with each other but in reality they were consistent enough aiming precisely at the same object to oppose the schemes meditated by france for disturbing the affairs of germany  if reflecting on the sentiments of these courts there was something unexpected in the alliance between great britain and prussia it was soon followed by another alliance of a nature infinitely more surprising the empress queen of hungary finding england in no disposition to cooperate in her designs had recourse to other measures the house of austria which had formerly united europe to preserve her from the power of france now entered herself into the most intimate union with that power by this extraordinary revolution the whole political system of europe assumed a new face it was indeed a revolution so extraordinary that we shall be justified if we interrupt the course of this narrative to look back at the causes which produced it  the house of brandenbourg a little more than two centuries ago was in a very humble condition but by the part she took in the reformation which put into her hands the estates of the teutonic order by a marriage from which she acquired the duchy of cleves and by an uncommon succession of able princes who carefully improved every turn in the affairs of germany to their advantage she raised herself by degrees to a considerable state to an electorate and at last to a royalty not only in name but in power the late king of prussia in order to strengthen this power though he past almost his whole reign in the most profound peace gave his whole attention to his army frugal in all other respects in this alone he was expensive it was his business and what was perhaps of greater moment it was his only diversion thus in a reign apparently inactive there was always kept up an army of near  00000 men in as much exercise as they could have in war and formed with the most perfect discipline  when his present majesty came to the throne he immediately showed a disposition of employing effectually that military force which his father had spent his life only in forming and training he managed his dispute with the bishop of liege by the summary method of force and seemed disposed to carry all things with so high an hand as made him indeed much respected but much dreaded too by the princes of the empire who saw that there was another power to be feared in germany besides that of austria but these were small matters rather signs of the disposition of this prince than exertions of it he meditated much greater things and only waited an opportunity to make good the ancient claims of his family on the most considerable part of the duchy of silesia the right to that duchy had been a very intricate affair but the house of austria availing herself of the greatness of her power and of a dissension between the elector frederick ii and his son prevailed with the elector to give up that right for an equivalent then she persuaded his son to confirm the treaty and at the same time for a trivial consideration to give up the equivalent itself the king of prussia not thinking himself bound by these acts though confirmed be a long possession took advantage of his own power and the embarrassed circumstances of the house of austria to resume what their power and the embarrassed circumstances of his family had formerly deprived him of for immediately on the death of charles the  th  the queen of hungary could not easily lose the memory of the wound she had received in the loss of one of the finest and richest parts of all her dominions silesia which she had just yielded extended in length  00 miles along the course of the large and navigable river oder a country of the most exquisite fertility and highest cultivation abounding with men abounding with valuable manufactures and yielding a clear yearly revenue of  00000 pounds sterling the peace was hardly concluded by which she resigned this valuable territory than she set on foot practices for recovering it she entered into a treaty with the court of petersbourg of an innocent and simply defensive nature so far as appeared to the public but six secret and separate articles were added to it  to this so extraordinary a treaty the king of poland was invited to accede and he did so far accede to it as to show he perfectly agreed in his sentiments with these courts but his situation in the jaws of a formidable enemy and the experience of passed misfortunes had rendered him so weary that he declined signing the treaty but still with the consent of the parties concerned whom he fully convinced of his resolution to cooperate in all their measures he desired and they agreed that in the success of their arms he should have a share in the spoil on the footing of a treaty for the eventual portion of the king of prussias dominions made in the last war  in consequence of these measures all sort of means were employed to embroil the king of prussias affairs in the north and particularly to render him personally odious to the czarina when their machinations had taken full effect and russia was fixed in an unalterable enmity to that monarch preparations of magazines and armies were made in bohemia and moravia and the king of poland under pretense of a military amusement drew together about   000 men with which he occupied the strong and important post of pirna the queen of hungary saw that she stood in need of yet stronger supports than these in the arduous business she had undertaken she found that great britain which had often done so much for her distress would do little for her ambition she therefore had recourse to france who joyfully accepted an alliance that promised to confound the whole germanic body concluded a treaty with the empress at versailles the  st of may      a remarkable era in the political history of europe  the secret articles of the treaty of petersbourg the fountain of the present troubles and the steps taken to put that treaty in execution though formed and carried on with as much secrecy as earnestness could not escape the vigilance of his prussian majesty who watched all their motions and had perfect intelligence of their most hidden designs when therefore he perceived that by the breach between england and france the empress queen would take advantage of these troubles to avail herself of her alliances and her armament he ordered his minister at vienna to demand a clear explication and proper assurances concerning the preparations he saw making and receiving only a dry and equivocal answer that the empress had taken measures for her own security and that of her allies and friends the king believed himself no longer bound to preserve any terms a dangerous war was to be kept out of his own territories at any rate and being always in perfect readiness for action he fell upon saxony with a considerable army  at first the king of prussia seemed only to demand a free passage for his troops and an observance of the neutrality professed by the king of poland might be able to convey some relief to the saxons resolved to bring him to action to the success of which he knew his own presence would greatly contribute he therefore left the blockade of the saxon army joined his forces under keith and engaged the austrians at lowositz here he obtained a victory  chap ii state of the english ministry the characters and designs of the several factions a coalition oswego taken by the french calcutta taken by the nabob angria reduced by admiral watson  whilst the king of prussia passed the winter in the most vigorous preparations for carrying on the war his ally great britain presented a very different face of things the loss of minorca plunged the people into the utmost grief mixed with shame for such a blot on the national honor and with indignation not only against those who had acted weakly but those who had proved insufficiently for the loss of that important possession the public resentment which at first seemed to have no other object than byng was soon turned against the ministry the clamor in parliament was great without doors it was excessive addresses praying a strict enquiry into the cause of our misfortunes were presented from all parts of the kingdom the ministry notwithstanding this general discontent had a real strength and they might have stood had they agreed amongst themselves the commons could not be brought to any angry votes and the result of the enquiry into the loss of minorca was as favorable as they could have wished but mr f  x thought it not advisable to bear a large proportion of the odium caused by counsels in which he had little share perhaps he thought this embarrassment a situation not unfavourable to the arrangement he had always aimed at he therefore suddenly threw up an employment which he hoped to resume augmented with greater power  on the removal of this principal prop the whole structure of the ministry fell to pieces the d of n the ld chapter the first lord of the admiralty resigned and the chiefs of the party by whose maneuvers they were displaced and having no ministry established we had no plan to follow  three factions divided the ruling men of the nation for the gross of the people seemed to have no further views than a redress of their grievances by whatever means that could be brought about the first of these factions was composed of those who had grown to place and power or had formed their connexions under the old ministry they were some of the most respectable persons in the nation and had undoubtedly the greatest parliamentary interest they had at the same time another interest hardly less considerable that of the monied people but in some points and those material too they were weak they were not at all popular a matter of great consideration in a government like ours and they were supposed by the gross of the people not to be under the direction of great political abilities  the second faction though not suspected of the want of sufficient ability was yet more unpopular than the former they had not attempted to preserve even the appearances essential to popularity and to them the more essential as their parliamentary strength was however respectable much inferior to the first if their influence at one court was able to balance that of the old ministry by means of a then powerful connection that very connection made them far worse at another court and worse with the generality of the people who entertained or pretended at least to entertain suspicions of a nature the more dangerous as they were only dropped in hints and whispers and never could come to a full and open explanation  the third party had little parliamentary and less court influence but they had a prodigious popularity which supplied every other defect the abilities of their leader were of the most shining kind his application equal to his abilities his disinterestedness was confessed by his enemies and though it would have shined in the days of heroism was now the more valued and set off to the greater advantage by the general selfishness which prevailed among the men of business the nation reposed the most perfect confidence in his integrity and love to his country this party conscious where its strength lay cultivated with great care the popularity which was the basis of their power even perhaps so as to impair on some occasion the dignity of government  these three factions differed from each other extremely with regard to power the grand object of all factions but in the general scheme of their politics the two first were pretty much agreed looking on france as the most constant and most dangerous enemy of great britain they dreaded the increase of her power and influence among the neighboring nations as the greatest of all evils to prevent so dangerous an aggrandisement they thought it absolutely necessary to preserve a constant attention to the balance of power and to seek our particular safety and liberty in the general safety and liberty of europe a close connection was therefore to be kept up with the powers of the continent not only by continual negotiations but by large subsidies and even by assisting them with our troops if the occasion should require such assistance for this purpose as well as to secure the more effectually our present happy establishment a considerable regular land force ought to be constantly maintained our navy they thought ought by no means to be neglected but it was only to be cultivated and employed subserviently to the more comprehensive continental system these parties were far from being friends to arbitrary power or in any sort averse to parliaments they loved the constitution but they were for preserving the authority of government entire and in its utmost lawful force to make government more easy knowing that many would disturb it from disaffection or disgust or mistaken notions of liberty they thought it just to rule men by their interests if they could not by their virtues and they had long been in the practice of procuring a majority in parliament by the distribution of the numerous lucrative places and employments which our constitution leaves in the disposal of the crown several believed that no other method was practicable considering the nature of mankind and our particular form of government  but the third and popular party was influenced by different principles they looked indeed on the power of france in the same light with the two former and were of the same opinion concerning the necessity of setting bounds to it in the means of attaining this end they differed our situation they thought dictated a narrower but a more natural a safer and a less expensive plan of politics than that which had been adopted by the other party we ought never to forget said they that we are an island and that this circumstance so favorable both to our political and to our civil liberty prescribes to us a conduct very different from that of any other nation our natural strength is a maritime strength as trade is our natural employment these must always go hand in hand and they mutually support each other but if turning our back to our real interests and abandoning our natural element we enter that inextricable labyrinth of continental politics if we make ourselves parties in every controversy if we exhaust our wealth in purchasing the useless and precarious friendship of every petty prince or state if we waste the blood of our people in all the quarrels that may arise on the continent so far from going in the right way to reduce france that we attack her on the strong side and only destroy ourselves by our ill judged efforts against the enemy that we can have nothing to fear from the superiority of france on the continent whilst we preserve our superiority at sea that we can always cut the sinews of the enemys strength by destroying their traffic that to fear an invasion from a power weak in its marine is the idlest of all fears that in case an invasion were possible a well trained national militia supplying by their zeal the defects of their discipline would prove our best protection that a standing army is in whatever shape dangerous to freedom and that a government like ours connected by its very essence with the liberty of the subject can never be in want of the supports of despotic power as little is parliamentary influence necessary a government pleasing to the people as every good government must be can never be generally opposed and men need no bribes to persuade them to their duty  these notions so opposite in their extremes might be reconciled in a medium and used to temper each other for as on one hand it would be very absurd to make no sort of advantage of our insular situation but to engage in all the business of the continent without reserve and to plunge ourselves into real evils out of a dread of possible mischiefs so on the other hand to think ourselves wholly unconcerned in the fortunes of our neighbors on the continent or to think of aiding them in any case only by the way of diversion with our fleets would be a way of proceeding still more extravagant than the former if such notions were reduced to practice we might soon lose all those advantages derived from a situation which we abused  the reasonableness of such a temperament could not be perceived during the ferment of that time in which these topics were bandied to and fro with infinite heat the resignation or rather deprivation of the popular ministry only increased their popularity and the general discontent the people could not believe that good measures could be pursued when those in whom alone they confided were not employed almost all the corporations of the kingdom presented the deprived ministers with their freedom and addressed them in the warmest manner testifying the most entire approbation of their conduct and the sincerest concern to see them out of employment  this conflict between an old established interest and the torrent of popularity continued for a long time and the nation was almost ruined by it it is not easy nor perhaps quite proper to attempt to trace the steps by which so happy a coalition as we have seen take place was brought about but it was formed in such manner has held together with such solidity and produced such excellent effects  it was high time that our domestic dissentions should be composed at last from every quarter of the world in which we had any concern by general shirley and designed to cover the country of the five nations to secure the indian trade to interrupt the communication between the french northern and southern establishments and to open a way to our arms to attack the forts of frontenac and niagara for these purposes some frigates had been fitted out for cruizing and a number of boats prepared for the transportation of troops but they all fell to the enemy with the fort where  00 pieces of cannon were and a considerable quantity of provision   00 men were made prisoners of war the place made but a trifling resistance scarce holding out three days the attempts to relieve it were too late the french demolished the fort  our losses were not confined to america the e india company received a blow which would have shaken an establishment of less strength to its foundations the news of the war between france and england had not yet reached india but a new and very formidable enemy was raised up in that quarter the nabob of bengal the nabobs are a species of viceroys to the grand mogul grown almost independent in their several provinces irritated at the protection given to one of his subjects in the english fort of calcutta and as it is said at the refusal of some duties to which he claimed a right levied a great army and laid siege to that place the governor terrified by the numbers of the enemy abandoned the fort with several of the principal persons in the settlement who saved themselves with their most valuable effects on board the ships  thus deserted mr hollwel the second in command bravely held the place to the last extremity with a few gallant friends and the remains of a feeble garrison a very noble defense was insufficient to keep an untenable place or to affect an ungenerous enemy the fort was taken and the garrison being made prisoners were thrust into a narrow dungeon  in the space of this unfortunate year we were stripped of minorca and oswego we apprehended an invasion of great britain itself our councils were torn to pieces by factions and our military force was every where in contempt amidst these losses we considered as some advantage  chap iii state

what turn the english politics were like to take in the year      seemed for some time uncertain the new ministry did not seem well established nor was it well known whether they would pursue the plans and preserve the connections of the old abroad every thing was prepared for opening the campaign with the utmost eclat all europe was in motion  france in order to demonstrate to the queen of hungary the advantageous choice she had made in connecting herself with the house of bourbon formed two great armies the first was composed of near  0000 men the flower of the french troops attended with a vast artillery and commanded by m detrees a general of the best established reputation she had in her service under him served m de contades m chevert and the count de st germain all officers of high character and all fit to command in chief if m detrees had not been appointed to that eminence this formidable army passed the rhine and marched by westphalia in order to invade the king of prussias dominions in quality of allies to the empress queen and guardians of the liberties of the empire and to no other intent as it was pretended but in reality with a view to reduce hanover also they judged that their operations against the king of prussia might be executed and their scheme to drive the king of england into some concessions with regard to america might be completed by one and the same blow the second army was commanded by the prince de soubise it consisted of about   000 men this army was destined to strengthen the imperial army of execution but before it had passed the rhine it made itself master of cleves meurs and gueldres whilst a detachment from detreess army seized upon the town of emden and whatever else belonged to prussia in east friesland  as soon as the king of prussia had entered saxony in the beginning of the preceding summer process was commenced against him in the emperors aulic council and before the diet of the empire it is not difficult to conceive how the affair must have been decided when those who feared the king of prussia believed they had a fair opportunity to reduce him and when those who feared the house of austria were by that very fear obliged to support the power they dreaded accustomed as they were to the influence of a family in which the empire had so long been in a manner hereditary and overawed by the appearance of a confederacy the most formidable the world had ever yet seen accordingly the king of prussia was condemned for contumacy and the fiscal had orders to notify to him that he was put under the ban of the empire and adjudged fallen from all the dignities and possessions which he held under it the circles of the empire were ordered to furnish their contingents of men and money to put this sentence in execution but the contingents were collected slowly the troops were badly composed and probably this army had never been able to act if it had not been for the assistance offered under the prince de soubise  the austrians who were principals in the quarrel were not behind their auxiliaries in the greatness of their preparations they made the most strenuous efforts by which they assembled a body of upwards of  00000 men in bohemia and committed the command to prince charles of lorrain assisted by m brown in the north all things threatened the king of prussia the czarina true to her resentments and her engagements had sent a body of  0000 men commanded by m apraxin who were in full march to invade the ducal prussia whilst a strong fleet was equipped in the baltic to cooperate with that army although the king of sweden was allied in blood and inclination to his prussian majesty yet the jealousy which the senate entertained of their sovereign the hope of recovering their ancient possessions in pomerania by means of the present troubles and in fine their old attachment to france newly cemented by intrigues and subsidies made their ill inclinations to the cause of prussia more than suspicious hitherto indeed nothing more than the tendency of their councils was fully known the duke of mecklenbourg took the same party and agreed to join the swedish army when it should be assembled with  000 men a proceeding which he has since had reason to repent bitterly thus were the forces of five mighty states austria russia france sweden the empire  each of which had in their turn been a terror to all europe united to reduce the heir of the marquisses of brandenbourg and in such a point of danger and glory had the great and formidable abilities of his prussian majesty placed him with little in comparison that could enable him to sustain the violence of so many shocks except what those abilities supplied but his astonishing economy the incomparable order of his finances the discipline of his armies beyond all praise a sagacity that foresaw every thing a vigilance that attended every thing a constancy that no labor could subdue a courage that no danger could dismay an intuitive glance that catches the decisive moment all these seemed to form a sort of balance to the vast weight against him turned the wishes of his friends into hopes and made them depend upon resources that are not within the power of calculation  the only army that appeared in his favor was a body of between  0 and  0000 hanoverians and hessians who with some reinforcements of his own troops formed an army of observation commanded by his royal highness the duke of cumberland this army was posted on the weser to watch the motions of m detrees the vast and unwieldy body of the french encumbered as the french armies always are by an immense baggage and an innumerable multitude of mouths without hands made a very slow progress through the rough and barren country that lies between the rhine and the weser all the abilities of the french general were employed in finding subsistence for his troops his royal highness on the other hand displayed great abilities in throwing all possible impediments in his way but when these impediments were removed by the superiority of numbers the hanoverian army gradually gave way yielding to that superiority and the french troops passed the weser without opposition  in the mean time his prussian majesty being determined according to his maxim to lay the cloth as from home as possible made his dispositions for carrying the war into bohemia as speedily as the season would admit three great bodies of his troops entered into that kingdom by three very different ways but nearly at the same time m schwerin penetrated into it from silesia the prince of bevern entered with the corpse under his command from lusatia and defeated as a preliminary to a more decisive victory a body of   000 austrians who opposed him  the austrian army was little short of  00000 men and the situation of their camp fortified by every advantage of nature the death of two of the best generals in europe m schwerin was killed at the age of eightytwo with the colonels standard in his hand at the head of his regiment m brown received a wound which from the chagrin he suffered rather than from its own nature proved mortal  about  0000 of the austrian army took refuge in prague the rest fled different ways the king of prussia lost no time to invest the place and to cut off all succors if on one hand such an immense garrison made an attack unadviseable on the other that formidable number itself seemed to make the reduction of the place by famine the more certain the king of prussia not relying solely on this prepared to bombard the town on the   th of may at midnight after a most dreadful storm of rain and thunder as if it were to display how much more ruinous the malice of men may be than the greatest terrors of nature on the signal of a rocket four batteries which discharged every twentyfour hours two hundred and eightyeight bombs besides a vast multitude of red hot balls began to pour destruction on that unfortunate city which was soon in flames in every part the garrison made a vigorous defense and one well conducted and desperate sally but they were repulsed with great loss the principal magistrates burgesses and clergy seeing their city on the point of being reduced to an heap of rubbish made the most moving supplications to the commander to listen to terms the commander was deaf to their prayers twelve thousand of the most useless mouths were driven out of the city the prussians forced them in again the affairs of the empress seemed verging to inevitable destruction a whole army was upon the point of surrendering prisoners of war the capital of bohemia on the point of being taken and with it all the rest of that flourishing kingdom the sanguine friends to the king of prussia began to compute the distance of vienna  in this desperate situation of affairs leopold count daun entered on the stage and began to turn the fortune of the war this general never had commanded in chief before but he was formed by a long course of experience in various parts of europe under the greatest generals and in the most illustrious scenes of actions though of a very noble family he had without the least assistance from court favor risen insensibly by the slow gradation of mere merit with much esteem and without any noise this general arrived within a few miles of prague the day after the great battle he collected the fugitive parties of the austrian army and retired to a post of great strength from whence he fed the troops in prague with hopes of relief but as no man better understood the superiority of the prussian troops and as he was sensible of the impression which the late defeat had left upon his men he carefully avoided to precipitate matters by an hasty action he knew that the situation he had chosen would embarrass the prussians that a large party of their army must be always employed to watch him that this would weaken their efforts against the great body shut up in prague whilst his own forces gained time to recover their spirits and to increase in strength by the daily succors which his court exerted all their powers to send him with these ideas he waited in his entrenched camp at colin to act as events should direct  the king of prussia was not less sensible than count daun of the effects of this conduct he determined at all adventures to dislodge him from the post he held but whether it was that the king feared to weaken his army which had actually an army to besiege or whether he was blinded by a train of uniform success which made him believe his arms irresistible under every disadvantage or whatever were his motives or necessities the whole army employed in this undertaking including the prince of beverns corpse did not exceed   000 men cavalry and infantry and with these he was to attack  0000 men in one of the strongest situations which could be chosen in a ground where his cavalry could not support them the want of an equal artillery the advantageous situation of the enemy their numbers their bravery their general obliged the king of prussia to quit the field what his loss was is not so certain it wa s undoubtedly great in the action but still greater by desertions and the innumerable ill consequences that follow a defeat  though the king of prussia was defeated in this battle and though he brought on his defeat in a great measure by some errors of his own yet whatever small blemish his military skill might have suffered his reputation was raised higher than ever in the opinion of all judicious men by the noble and candid manner in which he acknowledged his mistake by the firmness with which he bore his misfortune and by those astonishing strokes of genius and heroism by which he retrived his loss the smiles

as possible but their armies notwithstanding their great superiority were not in a condition from their late sufferings to make any decisive attempt upon him as the frontiers of saxony abound with situations easily defended  the king of prussias misfortunes now poured in upon him at once and from every quarter the army commanded by the duke of cumberland who continually retired before the french after they had passed the weser came however to a resolution to make a stand at hastenbeck within a few miles of hammelen where it was judged that the superior numbers of the enemy might be the least prejudicial but notwithstanding the advantages of the situation the bravery of the hanoverians and the conduct of the duke the allied army was driven from the field of battle cul de sac unable by his situation to retire or by his strength to advance he was compelled to sign the remarkable capitulation of closterseven  an enterprise was concerted in england against the coast of france to make a diversion in his favor by drawing a part of the french army to the defense of their own country england proposed to compass another great design and which she had equally at heart by the expedition which was to give an effectual blow to the marine of france the destination of this armament was kept a profound secret and whilst it excercised the penetration of all the politicians of europe it filled france with the most serious alarms the english fleet at last appeared before rochfort some time was spent before it could be resolved what plan was to be followed in the attack actions the militia of the country had time to gather and there was an appearance of two camps on the shore the commanders now took into consideration the badness of the coast the danger of landing the time the enemy had to put the place in such a posture of defense as might make any sudden attempt or coup de main unsuccessful in consequence of these deliberations they unanimously resolved to return without making any attempt the disappointment of the nation was equal to the sanguine hopes we had conceived court of enquiry of officers of reputation censured the commander a court martial of officers of reputation acquitted him the expedition served only in england to increase and imbitter our dissentions and to turn our attention to vain disputes it did nothing toward relieving the king of prussia  the russians who had made for a long time a dilatory march and seemed uncertain of their own resolution all at once hastened their motions they entered the ducal prussia under m apraxin and general fermer and marked their progress by a thousand inhuman cruelties a large body of austrians entered silesia and penetrated as far as breslau then they made a turn backwards and laid siege to the important fortress of schweidnitz justly considered as the key of that duchy which was the cause of the war another body entered lusatia and made themselves masters of zittau twentytwo thousand swedes pierced into the prussian pomerania took the towns of anclam and demmein and laid the whole country under contributions richlieu freed from all opposition on the side of hanover made his way into halberstad and the old march of brandenburgh first exacting contributions and then plundering the towns the army of the empire reinforced by that of the prince de soubise after many delays was at last on full march to enter saxony this left the austrians at liberty to turn the greatest part of their forces to the reduction of silesia general haddick pierced through lusatia passed by the prussian armies and suddenly presenting himself before the gates of berlin laid the king of prussias capital under contribution and though he retired on the approach of a body of prussians yet he still kept possession of his former post in order to interrupt the communication of the king with silesia the fate which seemed to have threatened the empress some months ago was now looked upon as the certain lot of her antagonist all his endeavors to retrieve his affairs had hitherto been equally brave and unsuccessful general lehwald had orders at any hazard to engage the russians with thirty thousand he attacked double that number strongly entrenched at a place called norkitten but after several of those wonderful efforts  many persons who saw the king of prussia when he passed lately through leipsic cannot express how much he is altered they say he is so much worn away that they scarce knew him this indeed is not to be wondered at he has not a body of iron like charles xii and he endures as great fatigues as he did he is as much on horseback as charles was and often lies upon the ground his inward sufferings cannot be less than his outward let us cast our eyes on a map of the prussian dominions and measure what he has left of the many fair possessions he had in the month of april last of which a space of seven months has stripped him whence can he have men he is shut out from the empire and from whence can he draw money the duchy of guelders the duchy of cleves the principality of moers the county of lingen the county of lipstadt the principality of minden eastfriesland embden and its infant company part of the archbishopric of magdeburgh some other parts of the march ducal pomerania a great part of silesia a great part of the kingdom of prussia berlin itself almost all his dominions in short are either taken from him or laid under contribution and possessed by his enemies who collect the public revenues fatten on the contributions and with the money which they draw from the electorate of hanover and other conquests defray the expenses of the war this picture certainly differs greatly from that which the king of prussia might have sketched

he marched to attack the imperial army whilst it was at a considerable distance he must either have left saxony exposed to the insults of the austrian parties or have greatly weakened his own forces employed in the principal action he therefore suffered the army of the empire to advance to the frontiers of misnia and even to threaten the siege of leipsic before he began to act against them he however moved toward them leaving an army in lusatia to observe the austrians on his first motions the enemy retired with precipitation but when they had reinforced themselves with numbers and courage sufficient to persuade them to advance the king of prussia in his turn retired his resolution seemed to have been to fight as near misnia as possible and as deep in the winter as he conveniently might for if he should have the good fortune to succeed against the imperial army such a blow at such a season would effectually disable them from acting any thing to his prejudice for that year at least but if on the contrary he should fail saxony was at hand in which it would prove difficult for the enemy to make any impression whilst the winter continued as for the time to be lost by following this plan and the advantage it would afford the austrians in their designs on silesia they were not to be compared with the advantages which the king received from it he knew that schweidnitz was strong and excellently provided the prince of bevern was strongly posted near it to obstruct the enemys operations the winter would lean heavier on the besiegers and on the whole he had reason to trust that his troops animated by his own presence and example would prove far superior to the enemy in enduring all the hardships of a winter campaign  after some time spent in various movements between the allied army of the imperialists and french on one side and the prussians on the other the king resolved to give battle to his enemies who were now advanced to the confines of misnia on the   th of october the king had taken his resolution at that time his army happened to be divided into several corpse some of them at a distance of no less than twenty leagues asunder yet such were the spirit and excellent dispositions of the prussians that the junction of all these corpse were fully effected on the   th and the king advanced toward the enemy the enemy fell back at his approach and repassed the sala they were followed close  the united army commanded by the prince of saxe hilburghausen and the prince of soubise was  0000 men complete but the troops of the circles were new raised and many of them not well affected to the service nor to their french allies the prussians did not amount to   000 but then they were prussians and led on by the king of prussia as soon as the armies were formed and the battle going to begin which was to decide the fate of so many nations and to determine between force and virtue the king of prussia addressed his troops nearly in the following words  my dear friends the hour is come in which all that is and all that ought to be dear to us depends upon the swords which are now drawn for the battle time permits me to say but little nor is there occasion to say much you know that there is no labor no hunger no cold no watching no danger that i have not shared with you hitherto and you now see me ready to lay down my life with you and for you all i ask is the same pledge of fidelity and affection that i give and let me add not as an incitement to your courage but as a testimony of my own gratitude that from this hour until you go into quarters your pay shall be double acquit yourselves like men and put your confidence in god the effect of this speech was such as cannot be described the general emotion burst in an universal shout and the looks and demeanor of the men were animated to a sort of heroic phrensy in this disposition which prognosticated the success engagement began  in the beginning of the action the french cavalry came on with great spirit but they were repulsed some regiments having gained an eminence defended themselves bravely but in the end they were totally routed the infantry both french and imperialists made but a faint resistance the king of prussia in person exposed to the hottest fire led on his troops the enemy gave way in every part they were seized with a panic and fled in the utmost disorder they left  000 men dead on the field of battle    pieces of cannon and many colors eight french generals   0 officers of different ranks and  000 private men were taken night alone saved from total destruction the scattered remains of an army that in the morning was so numerous and so formidable  i have not undertaken on this nor shall i undertake upon any other occasion in these preliminary chapters to enter into the detail of all the various maneuvers of every battle they are matters little understood by and little interesting to the generality of readers besides the accounts are sometimes inaccurate and seldom or never consistent with each other  the glorious success of the battle of rosbach was such as hardly wanted to be improved the enemy was left totally incapable of action the king was set free on that side but it was a freedom which gave him no respite from his labors it only gave him an opportunity of undergoing new labors in another part the austrians had a vast force and had now begun to make a proportionable progress in silesia the dependence which the king had upon the fidelity of his generals there seemed shaken by something which then appeared and still seems ambiguous in their conduct the austrians after a siege from the   th of october to the   th of november carried on under infinite difficulties and with a prodigious loss had reduced schweidnitz and obliged the prussian garrison of  000 men to surrender prisoners of war soon after as they had intelligence of the victory of rosbach and knew that the king of prussia was on full march to the relief of silesia the austrians resolved to lose no time to attack the prince of bevern in his strong camp under the walls of breslau a treble superiority incited them to this attempt they attacked the princes army with great resolution and their attack was sustained with amazing intrepidity  this advantage though dearly bought was immediately followed with many others breslau the capital of silesia as not to permit his own excellent generals and incomparable troops to triumph any where but in his own presence  the king immediately after the battle of rosbach with those troops which he had a few days before collected from places an hundred miles distant from each other began a march of upwards of two hundred more and led them from engaging one superior army to engage another still more superior from danger to hardship and from hardship to renewed danger in the most rapid march he passed through thuringia through misnia through lusatia in spite of the efforts of the generals haddick and marshal who were posted in lusatia to obstruct him and entering silesia arrived the  d of december at parchwitz upon the oder here he was joined by the prince of beverns corpse who crossed that river to meet him  about this time an incident happened which was very remarkable one of these agreeable adventures that relieve the mind amidst the perpetual horror that attends a narrative of battles and bloodshed the garrison of schweidnitz had seen with the greatest reluctance the capitulation which bound their hands from the service of their king and country whilst the austrians were conducting them to prison on their route they chanced to hear of the victory their master had gained at rosbach animated with this news they unanimously rose upon the escorte which conducted them and which happened not to be very strong and entirely dispersed it thus freed they marched on not very certain of their way in hope to rejoin some corpse of the prussian troops the same fortune which freed them led them directly to the army commanded by the king himself which was hastening to their relief great was the joy on both sides at this unexpected meeting for the prisoners had heard nothing of his majestys march this little incident whilst it added a considerable strength to the army added likewise to its spirit and seemed an happy omen of success in the future engagement  as his prussian majesty approached to breslau the austrians confiding in their superiority abandoned their strong camp the same which had been occupied by the prince of bevern and resolved to give the king battle he was marching with the utmost diligence not to disappoint them leuthen the ground which the austrians occupied was very advantageous and every advantage of the situation was improved to the utmost by the diligence and skill of count daun who remembering that he was the only general who had ever carried the field from the king of prussia knew better than any body how difficult it was to obtain such a victory all the dispositions were made accordingly the ground they occupied was a plain except that in some part it had small eminences these they surrounded with artillery the ground was also interspersed with thickets which they sought to turn to their advantage on their right and left were hills on which they planted batteries of cannon the ground in their front was intersected by many causeways and to make the whole more impracticable the austrians had felled a vast many trees and scattered them in the way the king of prussia was not terrified with this situation nor with the consciousness that above  0000 excellent troops commanded by count daun were so posted the prussians who did not exceed as it is said   000 men attacked them with their usual resolution it was almost impossible at the beginning of the engagement for the prussian horse to act on account of the impediments we have just mentioned but a most judicious disposition of the king himself overcame that disadvantage he had in his first dispositions placed four batallions behind the cavalry of his right wing foreseeing that general nadasti who was placed with a corpse de reserve on the enemies left designed to take him in flank it happened as he had foreseen that generals horse attacked the kings right wing with great fury but he was received with so severe a fire from the four battalions that he was obliged to retire in disorder then the kings flank well covered and supported was enabled to act with such order and vigor that the enemys right was obliged to give way the prussian artillery which was incomparably served and silenced that of the enemy concurring to maintain the kings infantry and to enable them to act in grounds where their horse could give them but little assistance the austrians made a gallant resistance during the whole battle the panic of the enemy did not here as at rosbach do half the business every foot of ground was well disputed the austrians rallied all their forces about leuthen which was defended upon all sides with intrenchments and redoubts after reiterated attacks made with the utmost impetuosity and sustained with great firmness the prussians mastered the post then the austrians fled on all parts they were entirely routed the king pursued them to lissa  000 of the austrians were slain   000 were made prisoners and an immense artillery upwards of  00 pieces of cannon were taken  this great and decisive action was fought on the very same day of the next month after the no less important and decisive battle of rosbach the consequences that followed the action of leuthen declared the entireness of the victory notwithstanding the rigor of the season the siege of breslau was immediately undertaken and prosecuted with such spirit that by the   th of december it surrendered and with it surrendered the garrison of   000 men prisoners of war the blockade of schweidnitz was formed as closely as the inclemency of the winter would permit whilst the prussian parties not only repossessed those parts of silesia which belonged to the king but penetrating into the austrian division reduced jagerndorf troppau and tetschen and left to the empress queen except a forlorn garrison in schweidnitz no sort of footing in that country in which a few days before she reckoned her dominion perfectly established  chap vi russians and swedes retire hanoverians resume their arms cruelty of the french condition of their army castle of harburg besieged recapitulation of the events of the year       as the misfortunes of his prussian majesty after the battle of colin came on him all at once so his successes after his victories at rosbach and lissa flowed upon him all at once likewise and in a full tide the russians though they had repulsed general lehwald suffered so much in that action and their barbarous method of making war had so destroyed the country that they seemed to themselves to have no way of safety left but in retiring out of the prussian territories this extraordinary retreat of so great an army and so lately victorious and still possessed of a good seaport in the country could scarcely be accounted for on those motives we have assigned and astonished all europe whilst it left genesis lehwald at liberty to turn his arms into pomerania against the swedes the swedes on this occasion did nothing worthy of their ancient military fame but every where retiring left the prussians an easy conquest not only of the prussian but of every part of the swedish pomerania excepting the port of stralsund they left their allies of mecklenbourg quite exposed to all the resentment of the king of prussia who chastised them with the most severe contributions and levies the french who had been ravaging the old march of brandenburg evacuated that country immediately after the battle of rosbach but one of the greatest revolutions of fortune in the war and one of the most glorious and important consequences of that victory was that the hanoverian troops were enabled to resume their arms  from the moment the capitulation of closterseven was signed the duke the richlieu who came to the command only to reap the advantages and sully the honor of anothers conquest seemed to think of nothing but how to repair from the plunder of the unhappy hanoverians the fortune which he had shattered by a thousand vices the most exorbitant contributions were levied with the most inflexible severity every exaction which was submitted to only produced a new one still more extravagant and all the orderly methods of plunder did not exempt them from the pillage licenciousness and insolence of the french soldiery however in justice to merit we must exempt from this general charge the conduct of the duke de randan governor of hanover for the french who saved the capital of the electorate from utter ruin by the strictness of his discipline by the prudence the justice and moderation of all his conduct a conduct which does more real honor to his name than the most splendid victories  the duke de richlieus rapaciousness and oppression whilst they leaned so heavily on the conquered people did the conquering army no kind of service intent only on plunder which he did not confine to the enemy he relaxed every part of military discipline and that numerous army which m detrees had sustained and brought in health and spirits through the dismal deserts of westphalia under all the opposition of a skilful adversary were now in full peace in the quiet possession of a conquered and plentiful country reduced in their numbers decayed in their health and their spirits without clothes without subsistence without order without arms in this condition they began at last to perceive that the hanoverians with the yoke of the capitulation about their necks were still formidable as they had broke almost every article of that treaty they made no scruple to add another breach in order to secure them in all the rest they attempted actually to take their arms from the hanoverian and hessian troops these gallant troops who had with a silent grief and indignation seen the distresses of their ruined country were ravished to find that the victory at rosbach encouraged their sovereign to resent at last this and all the other indignities they had suffered they began to collect and to act and under the command of the gallant prince ferdinand of brunswick reinforced with a body of prussian troops they broke from their confinement they reduced the town of harburg and laid close siege to the castle which it must be owned was defended very bravely in all other respects the french did not seem in a condition to maintain their ground any where those troops which a few months before had so submitted as to make it necessary to declare that they were not prisoners of war in order to explain their condition were now on the point of pushing their adversaries to almost the same streights such was the force of french military discipline and such the triumphs of voltaires hero  the king of prussia now saw the full effect of his counsels and his labors his dominions were freed his allies were enabled to assist him and his enemies defeated broken and flying every where before him in what light posterity will view these things is uncertain we under whose eyes as we may say they were achieved scarcely believed what we had seen and perhaps in all the records of time the compass of a single year on the scene of a single country never contained so many striking events never displayed so many revolutions of fortune revolutiens not only beyond what might have been expected but far beyond what the most sagacious foresight reasoning from experience and the nature of things could possibly have imagined the king of prussia at first triumphant the whole power of the austrians totally defeated their hopes utterly ruined then their affairs suddenly reestablished their armies victorious and the king of prussia in his turn hurled down defeated abandoned by his allies surrounded by his enemies on the very edge of despair then all at once raised beyond all hope he sees the united austrian imperial and french power levelled with the ground  0000 hanoverians a whole army submit to  0000 french and are only not prisoners of war the french are peacable masters of all the country between the weser and the elbe anon these subdued hanoverians resume their arms they recover their country and the french in a little time think themselves not secure to the eastward of the rhine  00000 men in action six pitched battles fought three great armies annihilated the french army reduced and vanquished without fighting the russians victorious and flying as if they had been vanquished a confederacy not of samller potentates to humble one great power but of five the greatest powers on earth to reduce one small potentate all the force of these powers exerted and baffled it happened as we have related and it is not the history of a century but of a single campaign  chap vii preparations for an expedition to louisbourg laid aside fort williamhenry taken exploits of admiral watson and colonel clive in india chandenagore a french fort taken victory over the nabob nabob taken and beheaded revolution in bengal treaty advantageous to the east india company admiral watson dies  with regard to the part we had in the transactions of this year though it was not so full of striking events nor does it afford such a splendid subject for narrative yet it is as interresting to an english reader and may perhaps prove more instructive as it shows us in so strong a light the miserable consequences of our political divisions which produced a general unsteadiness in all out pursuits and infused a langour and inactivity into all our military operations for whilst our commanders abroad knew not who were to reward their services or punish their neglects and were not assured in what light even the best of their actions would be considered having reason to apprehend that they might not be judged of as they were in themselves but as their appearances might answer the end of some ruling faction they naturally wanted that firmness and that enterprizing resolution without which the best capacity and intentions the most honest can do nothing in war the attachment of most men to their parties weakened their affection to their country it has been imagined that ministers did not always wish success even to their own schemes lest obnoxious men should acquire credit by the execution of them as it was suspected that officers even at the expense of their own reputation did not exert their faculties to the utmost lest a disagreeable ministerial system should establish the credit of its counsels by the vigor of their operations for my part i think that these refinements in which there is often as much malice discovered as penetration have carried the matter infinitely too far but certain it is that the spirit of personal parties and attachments never carried to greater lengths than at that time proved of very bad consequences if it had no other effect than to raise and to give a color to such suspicions as we have first mentioned whatever was the cause it is most certain that our success in america this year no more answered to the greatness of our preparations and our hopes than it did in the two preceding  the attack upon crown point which had been a principal object of our attention in the beginning seemed at this time to be laid aside and an expedition to louisbourg undoubtedly a more considerable object in itself supplied its place lord loudoun was to command the land forces in this expedition admiral holborn the navy the former left new york with a body of  000 men and sailed to halifax where he was joined by the latter course to defer the enterprise to a more favorable opportunity this resolution seems to have been most eligible in their circumstances because the council of war was almost unanimous in it  lord loudoun returned to new york and the admiral now freed from the care of the transports set sail for louisbourg in hopes as it was said of drawing the french fleet to an engagement but upon what grounds this hope was conceived i confess i cannot see as it could not be imagined that the french fleet having no sort of occasion to fight in order to protect louisbourg would choose out of a bravado to bring on an unnecessary battle however it was the english squadron continued to cruize off that harbor until the   th of september when they were overtaken by a terrible storm in which one of our ships was lost eleven dismasted and the rest returned to england in a very shattered condition this was the end of the expedition to louisbourg from which so much was expected but it was not the worst consequences which attended it  since oswego had been taken the french remained entirely masters of all the lakes and we could do nothing to obstruct their collecting the indians from all parts and obliging them to act in their favor but our apprehensions or what shall they be called did more in favor of the french than their conquests not satified with the loss of that important fortress we ourselves abandoned to the mercy of the enemy all the country of the five nations the only body of indians who preserved even the appearance of friendship to us the forts we had at the great carrying place were demolished wood creek was industriously stopped up and filled with logs by which it became evident to all those who knew that country that our communication with our allied indians was totally cut off and what was worse our whole frontier left perfectly uncovered to the irruption of the enemies savages who soon availed themselves of our errors for after the removal of these barriers and the taking of fort william henry of which we shall speak presently they destroyed with fire and sword the fine settlements which we possessed on the mohawks river and on those grounds called the german flats thus with a vast increase of our forces and the clearest superiority over the enemy we only abandoned our allies exposed our people and relinquished a large and valuable tract of country the french soon made us feel effectually the want of what we had lost and what we had thrown away  a considerable fort called fort williamhenry had been built on the southern edge of the lake george in order to command that lake and to cover our frontiers a garrison of   00 men defended it general webb with about  000 men was posted at no great distance no sooner had the french learned that my lord loudoun with the body of the army was gone on the louisbourg expedition than they prepared to take advantage of his absence they drew together all the forces which they had at crownpoint ticonderoga and the adjacent posts they added a considerable body of canadians and a greater number of indians than they had ever yet employed the whole made near  000 men with these and a very good artillery monsieur montcalm prepared to besiege fort williamhenry it is said that the advances of this commander were not made with so much secresy as to prevent general webb from having early intelligence of his motions but unfortunately no credit being given to this intelligence orders were not sent to collect the militia in sufficient time which in conjunction with his own forces and with those in the fort had either obliged the french to relinquish their attempt or to have made it a very great hazard but the siege being now regularly formed and the besiegers meeting but little opposition from within  the garrison marched out with their arms and engaged not to serve during eighteen months the french savages paid no regard to the capitulation but falling upon our men as they marched out dragged away the little effects they had left hawling the indians and blacks in our service out of their ranks scalping some carrying off others and committing a thousand outrages and barbarities from which the french commander endeavored in vain to restrain them all this was suffered by  000 men with arms in their hands from a disorderly crew of savages however the greatest part of our men though in a bad condition got to fort edward some by flight some having surrendered themselves to the french were by them sent home the enemy demolished the fort carried off the provision ammunition artillery and the vessels which we had prepared on the lake and departed without attempting any thing farther neither was any thing farther attempted on our side and thus was finished the third campaign in north america where we had actually near  0000 regular troops a great number of provincial forces and a great naval power of upwards of twenty ships of the line  a war between the maritime powers is felt in all parts of the world not content with inflaming europe and america and dissentions of the french and english pursued the tracts of their commerce and the genges felt the fatal effects of a quarrel on the ohio but here the scene is changed greatly to the advantage of our nation the bravery of admiral watson and colonel clive reestablished the military honor of the english which was sinking there as it had done in all other places admiral watson with no more than three ships of the line sailed from madrass and afer a tedious voyage arrived at the port of balasore in the kingdom of bengal  the nabob who saw that the torrent of the english valor could not be resisted by such feeble dams as forts defended by indians drew down a whole army consisting of  0000 horse and   000 foot to drive them from their conquests infinitely inferior as our troops were in number they did not hesitate to attack the nabobs army though our forces did not entirely rout the indians east india company was reestablished in all its ancient privileges an immunity from all taxes was granted and a restitution promised for all that the trade had suffered in the taking of calcutta  when all obstruction on the side of the indians was removed and the companys officers had taken possession of their ancient establishments the admiral turned his arms against the french he resolved to attack chandenagore situated somewhat higher on the river than calcutta a place of considerable strength and the principal settlement of the french in that part of the east indies in this expedition colonel clive commanded  00 europeans and   00 black soldiers the admirals watson and pocock commanded the fleet if it may be called a fleet which consisted of no more than three ships of the line the kent the tiger and the salisbury the french prepared in the best manner they could to receive them and sunk several large vessels both above and below their fort but the admiral having by carefully sounding found a safe passage without being driven to the necessity of weighing up any of the ships made so severe a fire upon the fort in which he was seconded by colonel clives batteries on the shore that the place capitulated in less than three hours  the judicious timeing of these several operations as well as those which followed was not less laudable than the gallant spirit with which they were executed before the french were alarmed cure was taken to repossess all the posts we formerly held to humble the nabob by some effectual blow and by a treaty tie up his hands from acting against us this prince had showed himself from the moment of his signing that treaty very little inclined to abide by the stipulations he had made he indeed promised abundantly but always deferred the performance upon such frivolous pretenses as evidently demonstrated his ill intentions the english commanders understood this proceeding perfectly well but they resolved to dissemble their sense of it until they had broken the french power in this province which they had greater reason to dread small as it was than all the armies of the nabob when they had fully accomplished this by the taking of chandenagore they deliberated whether they ought not to recommence hostilities with the indians a resolution in the affirmative had been attended with great difficulty and danger if a most fortunate incident had not helped to ensure success  the nabob suraja doula the same who had the last  taken calcutta had shown to his own subjects the se lent and perfidous spirit which formerly and still distressed the english his generals were mostly discontented and some of them entered into a conspiracy against him jaffier ali cawn one of his principal officers a man of great power and interest was at the head of this conspiracy as soon as their designs were ripened they communicated them to the english government in calcutta praying their assistance the chiefs there did not hesitate long what party they should take they entered into a treaty with jeffier ali cawn and the conspirators and in consequence of this treaty our troops immediately took the field uner colonel clive the admiral undertook to garrison the fort of chandenagore with his seamen in order to leave the greater number of land forces for the expedition a detachmnnt of fifty seamen with their officers were added to serve as gunners a twenty gun ship was stationed above hugly in order to preserve a communication between colonel clive and the admiral  their preliminary measures being thus judiciously taken they advanced up the river and in a few days brought the nabobs army of about  0000 men exclusive of those who favored the conspirators to an action which was decisive in favor of the english  jaffier ali cawn now declared himself openly and entering muxadavat the capital of the province with an army of his friends and victorious allies by the conqueror in about thirteen days this great revolution was accomplished and with less force and trouble than is often required to take a petty village in germany was transferred the government of a vast kingdom yielding in its dimensions to few in europe but to none in the fertility of its soil the number of its inhabitants and the richness of its commerce by the alliance with the new nabob and by the reduction of chandenagore the french were entirely driven out of bengal and all its dependencies this was one of the articles of the treaty by the other articles a perpetual alliance offensive and defensive was made between the parties the territories of the company were enlarged and upwards of two millions sterling was stipulated to be paid as an indemnification to the east india company and the sufferers in the taking of calcutta the new nabob full of gratitude to those to whom he owed his dignity gave besides the above large sums about  000000 pounds as a gratuity to the sea squadron and the troops however short of expectation our enterprises in america fell this year those in the east indies greatly exceeded every thing we could hope from the forces which were employed and it may be doubted whether all the great powers engaged in the present bloody wars in europe in which such torrents of blood were spilled and so many millions of treasure are wasted will in the conclusion reap amongst them so much solid profit as the english east india company did with a handful of men in a short campaign the joy of the nation at these signal successes was not a little damped by the death of admiral watson who lost his life by the unwholesomness of the country  chap viii french retire out of hanover the taking of hoya minden taken distress of the french generosity of the duke de randan the french retire beyond the rhine recovery of emden by commodore holmes  all the bloodshed of the last campaign in germany overtures toward peace from any of the powers at war and perhaps nothing so singular ever happened as that so many states united if not against their real interests yet against all their former habits of connection full of so many occasions of jealousy abounding with matter of complaint against each other and even involved in misfortunes which usually destroy a mutual confidence that not one of these powers either from fear or hope or weariness or levity desisted from their hostilities against the king of prussia nor did that monarch acquire one ally more by the admiration of his successes than he had formerly gained through compassion to his misfortunes all the confederates preserved the same attachment to each other to him the same animosity it is equally a matter of great admiration how the resources even of these great states could keep pace with their ambition and in a very few months supply the place of great armies almost wholly destroyed the king of prussia by his victories had added to his natural resources these resources were more considerable than is commonly imagined and the possession of saxony which yielded him great supplies saved his own revenue he was indeed not quite so fresh as at the beginning of the war but then the condition of the enemy was in many respects far worse than his his troops had besides acquired a high reputation and a clear superiority over all others the consideration however of an army greatly harrassed and a most severe winter obliged him to restrain his ardor and to attempt nothing against the austrians in the months of january february and march the same inaction owing to much the same causes prevailed amongst the hanoverians for a little time but having been reinforced about the middle of february by a body of prussian horse they put their whole army once more in motion  the duke de richlieu had been recalled and the count of clermont now commanded the french troops this was their third commander in chief within the space of a year a circumstance alone sufficient to show the unsteadiness of their councils and the irregularity of their operations in effect they every where retreated before the hanoverians whose main body marched on the right to the country of bremen whilst a second body under general zastrow kept on the left toward gifforn they pushed the french from post to post they abliged them to evacuate ottersberg bremen and werden the castle of rotterberg was taken in six hours a considerable detachment under count chabot was posted at hoya a strong fort upon the weser and a place of such consequence that prince ferdinand resolved to dislodge the enemy from it he appointed for that service the hereditary prince of brunswick with four batalions of foot and some light horse this prince not twenty year of age had already entered into the course of glory under the auspices of his uncle and full of ardor to signalize himself with joy embraced the occasion and here he gave an earnest of his fame in one of the most lively and best conducted actions in the war the first fruits of this young hero were such as would have done honor to the maturity of the most experienced soldier  the prince had a broad and deep river to pass he had no means of transporting his men but a single float town and encountered the enemy at the bridge a fierce fire well supported on either side ensued the ground was such that the prince could not bring up his whole detatchment equally sensible of this disadvantage he formed a design to overcome it as judicious as it was resolute which was to turn the enemy by attacking them in the rear to execute this design it was necessary to make a circuit about the town every thing succeeded the attack on the enemys rear was made with bayonnets fixed a terrible slaughter ensued the french abondoned the bridge and fled in confusion the prince having cleared the town of the enemy joined the party he had left the count de chabot threw himself with two batallions into the castle with a resolution to maintain himself there but in a little time he capitulated surrendering the place his stores and magazines his troops being permitted to march out the prince who had no artillery and who on account of the badness of the roads despaired of bringing up heavy cannon suffered them to depart six hundred and seventy men were made prisoners in the action and a place of much importance and which opened a passage over the weser secured to the hanoverians with the loss of less than  000 men killed and wounded i have dwelt on this action and described it as particularly as i could though nothing decisive in itself because it is not in pitched battles between great armies where the most masterly strokes of conduct are always displayed these lesser affairs frequently call for as much or more of sagacity resolution and presence of mind in the commander yet are they often slighly passed by as matters of no consequence by the generality of people who rather consider the greatness of the event than the spirit of the action  prince ferdinand continued to advance with his right on one side of the weser and his left on the other the french continued to retire and successively abandoned all the places they had occupied in the electorate except minden a garrison of  000 men defended that place but it was closely invested and in nine days the whole garrison surrendered prisoners of war officers and soldiers involved in one common distress the officers forgot their rank and the soldiers their obedience full hospitals and empty magazines a rigorous season and bad covering their baggage seized or abandoned and the hussars and hunters of the allied army continually harassing pillaging and cutting them off it was no alleviation to their misery that the inhabitants of the country which they abandoned were reduced to the same extremities the savage behavior of some of their troops at their departure took away all compassion for their sufferings but this was not universal the duke de randan who commanded in hanover quitted the place with the same virtue that he had so long held it resentment had no power to persuade him to act with rigor in the adverse turn of the french affairs than the pride of conquest had in their prosperity when he had orders to evacuate the place there were very considerable magazines of corn and forage amassed for the use of the army he had full time to burn them and he had precedents enough to have justified the action but he left the whole in the hands of the magistrates to be gratuitously distributed to the poor he employed all his vigilance to prevent the least disorder amongst his troops and was himself the last man that marched out of the town this behavior which did such honor to his name and country has made his memory for ever dear to the hanoverians drew tears of love and gratitude from his enemies and acknowledgments from the generous prince against whom he served  the french through extreme difficulties marched toward the rhine in three columns the several scattered bodies which had united at munster formed the right the body which came from paderborn and which was commanded by the prince of clermont in person marched in the middle the forces which had occupied hesse were on the left in this order they reached the rhine which they all passed except a body under count clermont who still remained at wesel and resolved to maintain that post the french army which about four months before had passed the rhine in numbers and in a condition to make the most

olmutz raised king of prussia marches into bohemia  whilst the french arms suffered such disgraces abroad they endeavored by an alteration of their councils at home to restore their credit their ministers had been long the sport of female caprice it was their power of pleasing a mistress who governed their king that alone qualified them to serve their country some of the most able men were turned out of their employments with disgrace others retired from the public service with indignation a certain low character had for a long time appeared in all the proceedings of france both within and without even in their domestic disputes and where something of a free and manly spirit appeared this spirit evaporated and spent itself upon unworthy and despicable objects these contests which involved the church the law and the crown weakened them all and the state felt all the ill effects of disunion of its orders without seeing an augmentation of power thrown into the scale of any but now taught by their misfortunes and disgraces they were obliged to an alteration in their conduct they were obliged to call men to the public service upon public principles at a time indeed when in many respects things could only be altered not mended and wise and able ministers could do little more by their penetration and public spirit than to see and lament the ruin caused by the want of those virtues in their predecessors the duke de belleisle known to all europe for his great abilities and his great exploits was at length placed at the head of the military department as secretary at war  there appeared in the common prints a speech said to be made by that nobleman in council which if it be not authentic contains at least such sentiments as would come not unnaturally from a french patriot and one who had served his king and country with honor during better times  i know said he the state of our armies it gives me great grief and no less indignation for besides the real evil of the disorder in itself the disgrace and infamy which it reflects on our government and on the whole nation is still more to be apprehended the choice of officers ought to be made with mature deliberation i know but too well to what length the want of discipline pillaging and robbing have been carried on by the officers and common men after the example set them by their generals it mortifies me to think i am a frenchman my principals are known to be very different from those which are now followed i had the satisfaction to retain the esteem the friendship and the consideration of all the princes noblemen and even all the common people in all parts of germany where i commanded the kings forces they lived there in the midst of abundance every one was pleased it fills my soul with anguish to find that at present the french are held in execration that every body is dispirited and that many officers publicly say things that are criminal and highly punishable the evil is so great that it demands immediate redress i can easily judge by what passes in my own breast of what our generals feel from the speeches they must daily hear in germany concerning our conduct which indeed would lose much to be compared with that of our allies i must particularly complain of the delays and irregularity of the posts a service which is very ill provided for i am likewise displeased with the negligence of our generals returning answers which is a manifest breach of their duty had i commanded the army a thousand things which are done would not have been done and others which are neglected would have been executed i would have multiplied my communications i would have had strong posts on the right on the left and in the center lined with troops i would have had magazines in every place the quiet and satisfaction of the country should have been equal to their present disaffection at being harrassed and plundered and we should have been as much beloved as we are at present abhorred the consequences are too apparent to need being mentioned i must insist o these things because late redress is better than the continuation of the evil  m de belleisle being established in his office turned all his attention to the cure of the evils which he lamented and exerted all the power that remained in the nation to put their army in germany once more upon a respectable footing the expedition into germany was originally a measure as contrary to the true interests of france as it was of justice and equity but having adopted that measure the consequences which arose seemed to demand that it should be pursued with vigor therefore the connection with the empress queen was drawn closer than ever and nothing was omitted to give a greater strength and a better order to the army on the rhine but these endeavors which strained all the sinews of france already too much weakened by the almost total ruin of several essential branches of their trade drew away all the resources necessary to support their navy it was then in a sufficiently bad condition from a want of seamen and stores and there were no means found or little attention used to restore it so that from a deficiency in the marine it seemed to be equally impracticable to feed the war in america or to preserve the coast of france itself from insults such was the condition of our enemies at the opening of the campaign of       as to england far from being exhausted by the war or dispirited by our ill success our hopes rose from our disappointments and our resources seemed to be augmented by our expenses with such ease and alacrity were the necessary supplies granted and raised many errors and many abuses which the war discovered without making fatal were corrected the spirit of our officers was revived by fear or by shame our trade was well protected by the superiority and prudent distribution of our naval force the revenue was frugally managed and the whole state well cemented and bound together in all its parts by the union of the administration by the patriotism which animated it and by the entire confidence which the people had in the presiding abilities and intentions as france persisted in her attachment to the enemies of his prussian majesty great britain entered into still closer engagements with that monarch the luster of whose virtues set off by his late wonderful successes quite turned our eyes from the objections which were raised against the consistency of that alliance with our interests how far it is consistent with them is i think a much more difficult point to settle than the adherents to either party seem willing to allow but it ought to be considered that the circumstances of affairs in the beginning of the war hardly admitted of any other choice it had been the height of madness to have been on ill terms with his prussian majesty at that time and it was impossible to have kept good terms with him without being on very bad ones with vienna things were in an ill situation and the balance of germany was in danger of being overset what party soever should prevail it was impossible that england could have stood neuter in this contest if she had france would not have imitated her moderation she would gladly have joined with the king of prussia to distress hanover and reduce austria these two powers so exerted would doubtless compass their end unless we interposed to prevent it and we must sooner or later have interposed unless we were resolved tamely to see france and her allies giving laws to the continent in a word france would certainly have joined with one party or the other and the party which she joined would certainly by that union prove dangerous to the common liberty and must therefore be opposed by us we must have been in spite of us engaged in the troubles of germany as we ever have been and ever shall be as long as we are a people of consideration in europe the alliance with prussia was pointed out to us by the circumstance of his acting on the defensive the king of prussia meditated no conquests but her imperial majesty indisputably aimed at the recovery of silesia which was to disturb the settled order of things and this design was the only cause of the troubles in that part of the world i am sensible that this is notwithstanding all that may be said a question of some intricacy and requires a consideration of many more particulars than the brevity of our design will allow but whether we chose our party in this alliance judiciously or not we have i imagine very great reason to be pleased with a measure which has induced france to engage so deeply in the affairs of germany at so ruinous an expense of her blood and treasure our ministry was at this time fully convinced of the prudence of the choice that had been made and resolved to support his prussian majesty and the army under prince ferdinand in the most effectual manner  00000 l were voted for the hanoverian and hessian forces and a convention between the king of prussia  the northern courts made no alteration in their system in sweden some real plots to disturb the established constitution ended in the ruin of their contrivers some fictitious plots were set on foot to give a sanction to measures against the crown party which answered their ends and as the ruling power continued the same and the internal dissensions the same the hostilities against the king of prussia were resolved with the former animosity but promised to be pursued with the former languor in russia the empress did not think her intentions well seconded by her ministers the great delays and the unaccountable retreat in the last campaign gave ground to suspect that she had been betrayed by her ministers or her generals m apraxin was moved from the command and was put under arrest he justified his conduct by express orders from count bestuchef bestuchef was removed from his office and put under arrest also count woronzoff succeeded bestuchef in his employment and the generals brown and fermor took the command of the army in the place of apraxin  as soon as the season permitted the king of prussia to recommence his operations he laid siege to schweidnitz and pushed it with so much vigor  the king resolved to make moravia the theater of the war this year moravia was fresh ground a country as yet untouched by the ravages of war if he should succeed in his operations in this country his successes by opening to him the nearest road to vienna must prove more decisive than they could any where else if he should fail the austrians were at a distance from the center of his affairs and would find it difficult to improve their advantages to his ruin after the reduction of schweidnitz the king ordered two bodies of his troops to post themselves in such a manner as to make it appear that he intended to carry the war into bohemia whilst he drew away the enemies attention from the real objects by these dispositions the main of his army by a very rapid march  m daun was no sooner apprised of the kings march toward moravia than he took his route through bohemia to that province notwithstanding that the empress queen omitted no possible endeavors to assemble a large army against the king of prussia though she had for that purpose exhausted the milanese and tuscany and swept up the last recruits in her danubian territories m daun was not yet in a condition to give the king of prussia battle neither did his character lead him to trust that to fortune which he might ensure though more slowly by conduct this wise general took his posts from gewics to littau in a mountainous country in a situation where it was impossible to attack him he had the fertile country of bohemia from whence he readily and certainly drew supplies at his rear he was from his position at the same time enabled to harass the prussian army before olmutz and to intercept the convoys which were brought to them from silesia  olmutz by the extent of its works and other advantageous circumstances is a city which it is very difficult completely to invest so that some of the kings posts being necessarily weakened by occupying so great an extent of country were attacked by dauns detachments from time to time with such success that abundant succors both of men and ammunition were thrown into the place these attacks were always made by night and very few nights passed without some attack the success was various but the operations of the siege were greatly disturbed by these continual alarms besides it is said that the austrians before the kings invasion of this province had destroyed all the forage in the neighborhood of olmutz the horse were obliged to forage at a great distance which harrassed them extremely m daun took advantage of all these circumstances it was in vain that the king of prussia endeavored by all the arts of a great commander to provoke or entice him to an engagement he profited of the advantages he had made without being tempted by them to throw out of his hands the secure game he was playing  the great object of m daun was the prussian convoys on receiving advice that a large and important one was to leave troppau on the   th of june he took measures to intercept it he ordered general jahnus who was at muglitz on the left to advance toward bahrn and a detachment which was at prerau at a considerable distance to the right to march to stadtleibe so that these two corpse should on different sides attack the convoy at one and the same time to further the execution of this project m daun himself approached the prussian army and directed all his motions as if he intended to give them battle however the king was too great a master in the game of generalship which was now playing to be deceived by this feint he detached a considerable party under general ziethen to support his convoy which was already about  000 strong before this detachment could come up the convoy was attacked but the austrians were repulsed but m daun who provided for every thing quickly reinforced his parties who renewed the engagement the next day they first suffered the head of the convoy to go unmolested but as the center was still embarrassed in a dangerous defile they easily cut off the head from the rest and then they attacked the center with the greatest fury the prussians made as good a resistance as the nature of the ground would suffer general ziethen did every thing which could be expected from an accomplished officer but in the end they were entirely routed all the wagons in that division were taken the rear was pushed back toward troppau the head alone with great difficulty arrived at the prussian camp  this was a fatal stroke because it came at a time when it was impossible to repair it the siege of olmutz had been all along attended with great difficulties and now the news which every day arrived of the nearer and nearer approach of the russians called the king loudly to the defense of his own dominions already the cossacks and calmucks made incursions into silesia and by their ravages and cruelties announced the approach of the great army the siege must be raised moravia must be abandoned marshal daun must have the honor of freeing his country and driving away such an adversary as the king of prussia from a conquest deemed certain all was performed without a battle by a series of the most refined and vigorous maneuvers that ever were put in practice  when the king of prussia saw that the unprosperous situation of his affairs obliged him to retreat he took a resolution such as a victory inspires in other he took advantage even of the excellent movement of m daun by which that able general had advanced his quarters to poznitz and placed himself so as to support olmutz in the most effectual manner by this movement however he was obliged to uncover the frontiers of bohemia the king of prussia whom nothing could escape was sensible of this advantage and therefore instead of falling back upon silesia which step would immediately have drawn the austrian army into his dominions he determined to retreat from one part of the enemies territories into another the day before the siege was raised the firing of the prussians continued as brisk as ever and showed no sort of sign of an intention to depart but in the night the whole army took the road to bohemia in two columns to cutrin the reduction of this place could leave them but a  ys march to berlin count dohna was not in a condition to oppose their progress the king was still at a great distance but it is necessary to break our narrative of his affairs however interesting to take a view of the operations of the armies on the rhine we leave the king of prussia in full march do give one body of his enemies battle after executing a retreat from the other in a manner that did his military genius the greatest honor so that on the whole it is difficult to say which gained the greatest glory the king of prussia by his retreat or m daun by the measure which obliged him to it  chap x allies pass the rhine battle of crevelt action at sangershausen action at mere allies repass the rhine  prince ferdinand had it not in his power to cut off the retreat of the french over the rhine but he pressed them closely and prepared himself to cross that river in pursuit of them his design was to carry the war beyond the maese and thereby oblige the prince de soubise to abandon the enterprise he was preparing against hesse cassel his highness executed the passage of the rhine at herven with the corpse immediately under his command  the french army retired as the prince advanced and took an advantageous camp which threatened to retard the operations of the allies their right was under rheinberg but the prince by his welljudged motions turned their left flank toward the convent of camp by which the french found themselves obliged to quit their advantageous post and to retire into meurs they still kept toward the rhine the prince advanced on the side of the maese  it was evident that whilst the french continued only to retire it would prove impossible for them to hinder the allies from executing the plan they proposed they therefore thought it advisable to change their countenance they had falled back as far as nuys they now returned on their steps and advanced as far as crevelt within a few miles of prince ferdinands camp the prince made the dispositions for a battle with his usual vigor and prudence he carefully reconnoitred the situation of the enemy he found that their right was at a village called vischelon their left extended toward anrath where it was covered with a wood crevelt which was in the front of their right was occupied by a party of their troops his highness resolved upon three attacks the first and real attack was on the flank of the enemys left wing the other two were designed to divert their attention and prevent their succouring the object of his principal attack for which purpose he recommended to his generals to make the best use of their heavy artillery and not to advance too far unless they were perfectly assured of the success of the main operation  having made these wise dispositions and perfectly learned the best routes by which the enemy might be approached kept the best countenance possible in spite of the terrible fire of the hanoverian artillery and in spite of the vigoous attempts of the hanoverian horse who had by this time and means to gain the plain covered the retreat of their scattered infantry and saved them from utter ruin the right wing and the center though they suffered grievously by the cannonading were no where broken but retreated toward nuys in the most perfect order  seven thousand of their best troops were killed wounded and taken prisoners but there was nothing in this battle so grievous to france and so affecting even to the enemy as the fate of the count de gisors this young nobleman the only son of the duke de belleisle not above twentyfive years of age newly married to the heiress of an illustrious house himself the last hope of a most noble family was mortally wounded at the head of his regiment which be brought up with the most heroic courage and inspired by his example to make incredible efforts he had been educated with all the care an excellent father could bestow on a son of an uncommon genius who was alone able to support the reputation of his family to the purest morals he had united the politest manners he had made a great proficiency in learning he knew many branches of it and loved all he had seen every part of europe and read courts and nations with a discerning eye and wanted nothing to fulfill all hope and to make him a perfect and lasting ornament and support to his country but a knowledge in the military art he entered that course of glory and danger and fell in his first campaign the unhappy father and minister saw his private misfortunes keep pace with the public calamities and the tears of his family mingled with those of his country  prince ferdinand gained a victory at crevelt which did the greatest honor to his military capacity and to the bravery of his troops but it was a victory neither entire nor decisive the french army on their own frontiers was quickly and strongly reinforced so that they were not only in a condition in some sort to make head against the allies but were enabled to detach a considerable reinforcement to the army of the prince de soubise on the other side of the rhine  although the prince had reason to imagine that he should not be able to keep his ground on this side of the rhine for any considerable time this did not hinder him from improving to the utmost the advantage he had obtained whilst the french disabled by their late defeat were in no condition to oppose him he passed the rhine with a large detachment and appeared on the   th of june before dusseldorp a city advantageously situated on the river and belonging to the elector palatine a severe bombardment obliged it to capitulate on the  th of july the garrison consisting of  000 men marched out with the honors of war prince ferdinand placed here three battalions of hanoverians and threw a bridge of boats across the river by that means he multiplied his posts and communications on both sides of the rhine and threw a new and no small impediment in the way of the french to retard their progress in case he should find himself compelled to retire after this the army of the allies and that of france spent several days in making various marches and countermarches as if they both proposed to bring on an action to which however it does not appear that either party was very strongly inclined  prince ferdinand still retained his hopes that the prince of ysenburg who commanded the hessian troops would find the prince of soubise employment for some time he had originally laid his plan in such a manner that by passing the maese and transferring the seat of war into the enemies country he might draw the french from the rhine and perhaps oblige the prince of soubise to come to the assistance of the main army under m de contades who commanded in the room of count clermont being now the fourth commander of the french troops since they entered germany but whilst prince ferdinand pleased himself with those hopes and still continued to act as far as circumstances would admit in pursuance of this plan he received an account which disconcerted all his measures  the duke de broglio supported by the corpse of the prince de soubise march under the command of the duke of marlborough to reinforce the allied army the prince in this situation of affairs had no option left but an engagement with the french army or a retreat over the rhine the former was not easy to compass as the french industriously declined a battle and it became extremely dangerous to remain long in a position with the enemies army on his left and the strong fortress of gueldre on his right in this situation his subsistence became every day more difficult to repass the rhine had its difficulties too the roads which led to that river were rendered almost impassable by the heavy rains the river itself was so swelled with them that the bridge at rees had been for some time useless  these disagreeable circumstances of the allied army did not escape the penetration of mons de chevert one of the ablest commanders among the french he formed a plan upon them which if it had succeeded must have put the allies into the greatest perplexity this general had some time before passed the rhine with an intention of making himself master of dusseldorp and he had prepared all things with great ability for that enterprise the rains usually heavy for that season and some other cross accidents had frustrated his intentions but perceiving that the same accidents which defeated his design proved also unfavourable to the enemy he resolved to turn his disappointment into an advantage and from the ruins of his first project to build another of yet greater importance baron imhoff was posted to the right of the rhine in a strong situation near mere he was to cover the bridge at rees to secure a considerable magazine and to keep open communication between the english reinforcements and the main army the plan of mons chevert was to dislodge imhoff to burn the bridge at rees to make himself master of the magazine and to render the junction of the english troops with the hanoverians impracticable to execute this judicious scheme he united several detachments from the garrison of wesel to a considerable corpse which he intended to have employed in the siege of dusseldorp the whole made near   000 men the troops under imhoff were but six batallions and four squadrons hardly  000 in all  when that general was apprised of the designs and motions of the french he saw it was in vain to expect succors from the army of prince ferdinand the swell of the river had rendered all relief impossible all his hopes were therefore in his genius and the bravery of his troops he considered that though the post he occupied was sufficiently strong the enemy might make themselves masters of rees by turning his camp and thus execute one of the principal parts of their design he considered the great difference between attacking and being attacked he considered the effect of an attempt altogether unexpected by the enemy he therefore took the resolution of abandoning his post and going out to meet them perceiving that the french were marching into difficult ground he did not lose a moment to begin the action he ordered a small party  this signal advantage over such a prodigious superiority was not more gallantly obtained than well pursued and improved imhoff saw that the rains had increased to such a degree as to leave no hopes for the allied army to pass by the bridge of rees having taken proper care of his magazines he quitted his post at mere and being reinforced by some parties who passed the river in boats he marched with the utmost diligence toward the route of the english forces and happily effected a junction which had hitherto been attended with so many difficulties  prince ferdinand in his retreat met with no obstruction but just what was sufficient to display more fully the gallantry of his officers and the spirit of his troops a town called wachtendonck was on his left as he retreated this place though not fortified is a post of much importance and being an inland surrounded by the river niers is extremely difficult of access the french had thrown a body of troops into this place the hereditary prince the first in every active service was employed to force it the bridge on his approach had been drawn up the prince seeing that if he attempted to get down this bridge the enemy would gain time to recollect themselves threw himself into the river his grenadiers animated by so gallant an example plunged in after him and furiously attacking the enemy with their bayonets in a few minutes drove them from that post this advantage joined to that gained by general imhoff and the uncommon resolution which appeared in both these actions awed the french they found that their troops raw undisciplined and little fit for hard service were not to be relied upon and they feared to bring on an action which by being decisive against them might draw on the most fatal consequences so that the prince repassed the rhine in a most excellent order even with less trouble than he had at first passed it and indeed with little molestation but what he met with from the weather such excessive rains had fallen that he in vain attempted a passage at rhineberg or at his bridge of rees  although prince ferdinand was obliged to pass the rhine and to act more upon the defensive for the future yet his vigorous conduct in the beginning was very glorious to him and very advantageous to the common cause the french suffered greatly in their military reputation the hanoverians had gained a superiority over them and now so much of the campaign was wasted that notwithstanding the greatness of their numbers it was not probable that they would find themselves able to make any considerable progress in their designs against the kings electoral dominions for this year the advantage gained by broglio and soubise was not attended with the consequences which might have been apprehended prince ysenburg kept so good a countenance in a strong post he had chosen that the french did not choose to attack him again and since prince ferdinand had repassed the rhine he might always be well supported  chap xi retreat from bohemia measures of count daun battle of custrin king of prussia marches into saxony and joins prince henry  by the retreat of the prussians from moravia the war had assumed a new face the generals who conducted it had changed hands the king of prussia was obliged to act upon the defensive m daun was now in a condition of displaying his talents in an offensive war the affairs of the king of prussia were scarce ever in a more critical situation than at that time the russians seemed at first disposed to enter into silesia but now they had united their several disjointed corpse penetrated into the new march of brandenburgh and having commenced the siege of custrin a place that threatened them with no great opposition they were arrived within a few days march of berlin count dohna posted with a greatly inferior force at frankfort on the oder watched without being able to obstruct their progress in pomerania the generals weedel and manteufel opposed almost the same ineffectual efforts to the arms of sweden the army of the empire and a considerable body of austrians under general haddick advanced into saxony and possessing themselves by degrees of those strong posts which compose the frontiers of misnia they continually streightened the quarters of prince henry that prince was strongly encamped at dippolswalde with about  0000 men in order to cover dresden and command the course of the elbe thus circumstanced the king could not find his account in remaining long in bohemia where it was impossible to effect any thing decisive every thing depended upon his being able to drive the russians out o his territories who with a mighty forced ruined every place they arrived at and seemed not only to make war against him but against human nature itself  m daun was soon apprised of the king of prussias intentions but he considered that if he was to pursue the king into silesia he most encounter with difficulties almost insuperable several strong places stood in his way and i would prove easy for the prussian troops left for the defense of that duchy to take an advantageous camp under one of those places and thus oblige them to waste unprofitably the time which might be employed in the execution of more judicious projects besides that in this manner of proceeding he could never act in concert nor preserve any effectual communication with the several bodies of his allies to push forward with his whole force directly to berlin could at best be regarded as a coup de main which could prove nothing decisive in the campaign even supposing the project should succeed but it was rather probable that it would not succeed as the king of prussia might clear his hands of the russians before the army of m daun could for want of subsistence arrive in the lower lusatia every consideration therefore pointed out the relief of saxony as the great object of the austrian operations it was an object apparently to be compassed with greater ease and if compassed productive of more solid advantages than any other the army of the empire already superior to that of prince henry could cooperate in the design and the recovery of saxony once effected the king of prussia would see himself entirely divested of one of the principal resources he had to rely upon in the war for money provisions and forage whilst his hereditary dominions stripped of this strong barrier defenseless in themselves and assaulted on three sides by powerful armies could scarce find them employment to the end of the campaign  m daun having resolved upon his plan of operations suffered the king of prussia to continue his march toward the russians without any molestation he contented himself with leaving a considerable body of troops under the generals harsch and de ville on the southern frontiers of silesia in order to form some enterprise on that side which might draw the attention and forces of the prussians as far as possible from the great object of his operations when he had made these dispositions he marched toward saxony through the country of lusatia by zittau gorlitz and bautzen his first project was bold he proposed to cross the elbe at meissen by which the communication between dresden and leipsic would be cut of at one stroke then he proposed to attack prince henry in his camp at seidlitz whilst the army of the empire fell upon him in another quarter thus the prince was to be put between two fires and his retreat into dresden to be rendered impracticable but upon mature consideration this project was laid aside m daun reflected that the fortress of sonnestein of which he was not yet in possession would prove no small impediment to his designs  about that time the imperial court elated with their recent success began to show with what moderation they were likely to behave if it continued and increased they entirely threw of all the little appearance of respect they had hitherto retained for the king of great britain and several others of the most respectable princes and persons of the empire they made the abuse of their authority go hand in hand with the success of their arms on the   st of august a conclusum of the aulic council was issued against the king of great britain as elector of hanover against the landgrave of hesse cassel against prince ferdinand of brunswick the count of lip buckebourg and in general against all the adherence to the king of prussia threatening them with penalties indignity person and estate in consequence of this decree letters avocatory were issued notifying to the sovereign princes that if they did not within a limited time disperse their armies break off their connection with the king of prussia pay their quota of roman months and send their contingents to the army of execution they were to be put under the ban of the empire to all other persons who held any dignity in the empire orders were given and penalties were threatened suitable to their condition they in short went all lengths but that of actually and formally putting them under the ban which they would not have failed to do if their success had answered its beginnings so little regard had the court of vienna to former services of the most interesting nature and so entirely did she seem to forget that she owed to the king of great britain not only that power which she now unjustly and ungratefully turned against him but almost the very being of the house of austria so entirely did she forget that this monarch had expended his treasures employed his armies and even exposed his person in her cause when it was not only abandoned but attacked by almost all the rest of europe however the violent proceedings of the aulic council drew no one state or person from the kings of great britain and prussia they rather had a contrary effect in rousing the whole evangelic body to a sense of their own danger much less were they able to stop the progress of the allied arms  the king of prussia conducted his retreat out of bohemia in admirable order the generals jahnus and laudohn for several days hung upon his rear with two strong bodies they took advantageous posts sometimes on one side sometimes on the other sometimes together sometimes separately and threw all possibly impediments in his way but the vigor of the prussians drove them with loss from every post so that by the  th of august they were obliged entirely to desist from their pursuit the king of prussia freed from all molestation marched with the utmost diligence by wisoca politz landshut and arrived on the  0th at franckfort on the oder here he joined the troops under count dohna the army was now in a condition to act his courage and fidelity did every thing for the defense of the walls and ruins of the place but the walls built in the old manner did not promise a successful defense the enemy had posted themselves in the suburbs and in the firing of the town the principal magazine of the besieged was blown up  the protector and avenger of his dominions was now however at hand on the   th the king of prussias whole army passed the oder at glustebissel about twenty english miles to the northeast of custrin the russians on the first notice of his approach broke up the siege of that place and marched toward the villages of zwicker and zorndorff it was the kings intention to wind round the left flank of their army and to take them in the rear by which he hoped to throw them into confusion but in this he found himself disappointed the russian generals had foreseen his purpose and made excellent dispositions as the ground did not admit them to extend greatly in length they threw themselves into a square body composed of four lines forming a front almost equal on every side and on every side surrounded by cannon and chevaux de frize in this formidable disposition they waited the attack of the prussians  it was on the   th of august that the king of prussia after a march of    days from the midst of moravia brought his army in presence of the russians the king had never been personally engaged with that enemy before his troops had never obtained any advantage over them the whole fortune of the war depended upon the event of this day the prussians were now in the closest sense to fight for their country which was ready to fall under one of the severest scourges with which providence has chastised a nation nothing was wanting which could inspire the soldiers with revenge every where the marks of the enemies cruelty were before their eyes the country desolated on every side and the villages in flames all round the field of battle  at nine oclock in the morning the battle began by a fire of cannon and mortars which rained on the right wing of the russians without the least intermission for near two hours nothing could exceed the havoc made by this terrible fire nor the constancy with which the muscovite foot raw and unexperienced sustained a slaughter that would have confounded and dispersed the compleatest veterans they fell in their ranks new regiments still pressed forward to fill their places and to supply new slaughter when the first line had fired away all their charges they rushed forward on the prussians that firm body of the prussian infantry which had often stood and often given so many terrible shocks by one of those unaccountable movements of the human mind that render every thing in war so precarious gave way in the presence of their sovereign and when they had in a manner secured the victory retired in disorder before the half broken battalions of the muscovites had the russian officers known how to profit of this disorder had they immediately thrown in their horse with vigor to complete it and entirely break that body this had probably been the last day of the prussian greatness the king was not so negligent for just in this anxious moment whilst the battle was yet in suspense by a very rapid and masterly motion he brought all the cavalry of his right to the center with which general sedlitz at their head bursting in upon the russian foot uncovered by their horse and disordered even by their advantage they pushed them back with a most miserable slaughter the repulsed battalions of prussia had time to recollect and to form themselves and now returning to the onset with a rage exasperated by their late disgrace they entirely turned the balance of the fight the russians were thrown into the most horrid confusion the wind blew the dust and smoke full in their faces they no longer distinguished friends or enemies they fired upon each other in this distraction they plundered their own baggage which stood between the lines and intoxicated themselves with brandy orders were now no more heard nor obeyed the ranks fell in upon one another and being crammed together in a narrow space every shot discharged by the prussians had its full effect whilst the russians kept up only a scattered fire without direction or effect and quite over the heads of their enemies it was now no longer battle but a horrid and undistinguished carnage yet still which is a wonderful circumstance the russians thus distracted and slaughtered kept their ground the action continued without intermission from nine in the morning until seven at night at last the night itself the fatigue of the prussians and a judicious attack on their right wing which drew their attention on that side gave the russian army some respite to recover their order and an opportunity of retiring a little from the scene of their disaster on their side near  0000 fell upon the spot they had more than  0000 wounded most of them mortally     officers not including the inferior were killed wounded and taken prisoners of two particular regiments consisting before the battle of      effective men only      were left their whole loss on this bloody day way       men that of the prussians in every way did not amount to  000  the gazettes of both parties warmly disputed the vain honor of the field of battle on the most diligent enquiry it appears that both parties spent the night on or very near the place of action but this is an affair of little consequence the prussians had all the fruits and most of the proofs of a victory the most complete and decisive a vast train of artillery taken the military chest a number of prisoners many of them officers of high rank the retreat of the russian army the next and the following days their general fermors request for leave to bury the dead their incapacity to advance or form any new enterprise the king of prussias unmolested operations against his other enemies all these form the most clear and certain demonstration of a victory in all the points for which a victory is desirable  nothing less indeed than a very complete victory could have done any essential service to the kings affair at that time when four armies of his enemies were making their way to one common center and threatened to unite in the heart of brandenburg the king renewed the attack on the russians the next morning the event of the last day had showed them that there was no way of safety but in a retreat and in effect they retreated before the prussians as far as landsperg on the frontiers of poland the king of prussia was convinced that their late check must wholly disable them from attempting any thing material against his dominions on that side and he saw clearly that whatever he might hope to gain by improving his advantage against the russians he must lose far more by allowing his other enemies to make a progress on the side of saxony he satisfied himself therefore with leaving a small body of troops under count dohna to observe the motions of the muscovite army and marched with the greatest part of his forces and the utmost expedition to the relief of prince henry  m daun having laid aside his first project for passing the elbe at meissen enterprised nothing new on the side of saxony for some days he contented himself with taking a position at stolpen to the eastward of the elbe by which whilst he preserved to himself an easy communication with the army of the empire he interrupted the communication between bautzen and dresden he favored the operations of general laudohn who had advanced through the lower lusatia to the confines of brandenburgh and by drawing the attention of the prussian forces which were left in silesia to the northward of that duchy he facilitated the progress of the generals harach and de ville in the southern parts admirable dispositions without question if the time had not called for more vigorous measures and if the rescue of saxony from the king of prussia had not been the great object of the campaign it is not impossible that the court of vienna had still such an hankering after silesia as induced them to slaken their efforts on the side of saxony in hopes that if m daun could protract the operations there so as to find full employment for the king of prussia their other forces might reduce silesia with great facility and thus perhaps by aiming at two such difficult objects at once as it generally happens they lost them both upon any other supposition it is not very easy to account for the seeming inactivity of m daun whilst he had so fair a game in his hands however advantageously prince henry might have chosen his post or however strongly he might have secured it yet the prodigious superiority of the combined armies seems to have more than overbalanced that advantage and to have justified nay to have demanded some bold and decisive attempt  in fact this appeared at length to be the marshals own opinion for when the strong fortress of sonnestein most unaccountably surrendered with a garrison of   00 men to the austrian general macguire after the resistance of no more than a single day toward dresden this was to bring matters to a speedy decision but now the king of prussia by the most rapid marches had reached the frontiers of saxony the whole design was disconcerted and far from being able to dislodge prince henry they found themselves utterly unable to prevent the king his brother from joining him with his whole army  these advantages glorious as they were were not the only ones which followed the victory at zorndorf the swedes who directed their motions by those of their russian allies hastened their operations when that army had advanced into brandenburgh general wedel was detached from saxony to stop their progress and the prince of bevern now governor of stettin gave them some opposition all this however had proved ineffectual if the news of the defeat of the russians had not alarmed the swedes in such a manner as to make them return with more expedition than they had advanced though the king of prussias affairs began to put on a better appearance by these efforts the fortune of the war still hung in a very dubious scale the enemy was still superior the swedes and russians had still some footing in his dominions the austrians and imperialists were yet in saxony and if the kings armies had it in their power to take strong situations the enemy had the same advantages the condition of things was extremely critical and the least error or misfortune threatened still to plunge the king of prussia into an abyss of calamities  chap xii general oberg defeated at lanwerenhagen king of prussia surprised at hochkirchen m keith and prince francis of brunswich killed affair at gorlitz king of prussia marches into silesia m daun invests dresden the suburbs burned king of prussia raises the siege of neiss and cosel he returns into saxony the austrians retire into bohemia dispositions for the winter  the operations of the armies in westphalia seemed for a long time to languish the grand army of the french under m de contades was wholly unable to drive prince ferdinand from the posts which he had chosen so judiciously along the lip the other division of the french forces under the prince de soubise had made no great progress on the side of hessecastle against the prince isenburg who still kept his ground in that principality in order to protect the course of the weser and to cover the electorate the french were sensible that an attack on the principal army of the allies would prove a very dangerous attempt in which even if they should have some success their progress into the kings electoral dominions must be very slow and difficult but as the body of the allies employed in hessecastle was far the weakest and as an advantage on that side promised them the command of the weser and a better passage into the heart of the enemies country they determined to make an attempt there to further this design a considerable detachment was made from the army of m de contades which increased the prince of soubises corpse to at least  0000 men prince ferdinand who was sufficiently aware of the enemies plan had some time before sent general oberg with a strong reinforcement to join the prince isenburg but notwithstanding this reinforcement the whole force of the allies in hesse did not exceed   000 this body was attacked by the french at lanwerenhagen and their great superiority especially in point of cavalry  great consequences might have been apprehended from this affair but the vigilance of prince ferdinand who had established the most ready communications all along the lip suffered the victorious army to reap but little advantage from their victory that accomplished general advanced with the most expedition toward rheda and the p isenburgh having fallen back upon him they joined in such a manner as perfectly to secure the weser without losing any thing on the side of the rhine and although these necessary motions in some sort uncovered the electorate so as to lay it open to the incursions of the enemies light troops who penetrated even to the gates of hanover yet the french were not in a condition to establish any considerable body or to take any post of moment in that part  during this time the armies of the king of prussia and m daun made no very remarkable movements the marshal kept his advantageous camp at stolpen by which he preserved a communication with the army of the empire the army was secured by its inaccessible situation but it enterprised nothing of consequence the king of prussia on the other hand having taken possession of the important post of bautzen which lies so opportunely for commanding at once both misnia and lusatia extended his right wing to hochkirchen by this position he preserved a communication with the army of his brother prince henry he protected brandenburg from the incursions of the austrians and at the same time that he secured these interesting objects he was better situated for throwing succors into silesia than he could be any where else consistently with his general plan the two armies kept the most watchful eye upon each others motions the principal aim of the king of prussia seemed to have been the preventing m daun from communicating with bohemia the great intention of m daun was to cut off the king from silesia things were so balanced that it did not seem possible by mere skill in marches and positions to answer these ends very fully therefore a battle seemed inevitable but it seemed too that considering the situation of both armies a battle could not be attempted without extreme danger to the party who should begin the attack  m daun saw that if any more time was lost without action the very season must oblige him to evacuate saxony and thus give up all the fruits of the campaign he came to a resolution of giving the king of prussia battle but even in the vigor of this resolution appeared the extreme caution which characterises that able general having communicated his design to the prince of deuxponts and settled measures with him he marched in the dead of a very dark night in three columns toward the right of the king of prussias camp notwithstanding the darkness of the night notwithstanding the necessary division of the austrian army  how the kings outguards were kept so as to make such a surprise practicable is hard to say it is hard to accuse the vigilance of so able a commander or the attention of so many finished officers as served under him to speak of treachery is a way of accounting for misfortunes more common than reasonable however it was the prussians had not time to strike their tents when they found the enemy in the midst of the camp and an impetuous attack already begun scarce had the battle begun when a defeat seemed certain not so much from the confusion of the troops as the irreparable loss of two officers in the highest command and of the greatest merit m keith received two musket balls and fell dead upon the spot prince francis of brunswick had his head shot off by a cannon ball as he mounted his horse the king of prussia had then the whole of affairs to sustain alone at the time when he most wanted assistance but his presence of mind his firmness his activity remedied in some measure the effects of this unforseen attack and the losses and disorders it had occasioned he was every where present and inspired his troops with an ador like his own the king ordered some detachments from his left to reinforce his right wing but in the moment the orders were received the left itself was furiously attacked general retzow who commanded in that quarter with difficulty repulsed the austrians and was not able to afford any considerable assistance to the right which was alone obliged to support the whole weight of the grand attack  the austrians in the beginning of the engagement had beaten them out of the village of hochkirchen as the fate of the day depended upon that post the hottest of the dispute was there the prussians made three bloody and unsuccessful attacks on the village on the fourth they carried it but the austrians pouring continually fresh troops upon that spot drove them out at length after reiterated efforts and a prodigious slaughter on all sides then the king despairing of the fortune of that field ordered a retreat his troops which had been suddenly attacked in a dark night by superior numbers and had run to arms some half naked and all in the utmost confusion had notwithstanding made a most vigorous resistance and maintained the fight for near five hours they made their retreat in good order without being pursued supported by the good countenance of their cavalry and the fire of the numerous and well served artillery which was placed in the center of their camp they lost in this bloody action at least  000 men killed wounded and prisoners together with many cannon the austrian account allowed their own loss in killed and wounded to amount to near  000  the king of prussia in retiring from hochkirchen in fact only altered the position of his right wing which fell back as far as weissenberg his left still remained at bautzen this position was nearly as good as the former the great loss was the loss of reputation which always attends a defeat and the loss of two great generals which attended this in particular m keith was a scochman born he engaged with his brother the lord marshal in the rebellion of      being obliged to relinquish his country on this occasion he entered into the troops of spain and afterward passing into russia he obtained a considerable command and performed many signal services in their wars with turkey and sweden and served them also in peace by several embassies but finding the honors of that country no better than a splendid servitude and not meeting with those rewards which his long and faithful services deserved he left that court for one where merit is better known and better rewarded and having been employed since the beginning of the war in a distinguished command in the king of prussias armies he fell at last in a service that was worthy of him  if the king of prussia lost some reputation in suffering himself to be surprised in this affair he fully retrieved it by his extraordinary conduct in the course of the action and his admirable efforts after it on the whole perhaps when all circumstances are considered the king of prussia will appear greater in this defeat than in any victory he ever yet obtained the wing of his army that was attacked was surprised at a distance from him the two generals that commanded it slain in the first onset his other principal generals wounded the whole wing in confusion without a leader to come in these desperate circumstances in haste from another quarter to recover all twice to repulse the enemy and at last to retire overborne only by numbers and fatigue without being pursued is such an instance of great generalship as perhaps has never been exceeded  whilst these things were doing in saxony the russians made no farther attempts on the side of brandenburgh they remained in their camp near landsperg until the   st of september when after several feigned motions made to cover their real design they began their retreat toward pomerania where they arrived on the   th  it was impossible that they should keep their ground in that province during the winter unless they could secure some seaport from whence they might be supplied with provisions the little town of colberg was very opportune for that purpose as it is a seaport on the baltic and so meanly fortified that the reduction of it appeared to be as easy as expedient on the third of october they formed the siege of this inconsiderable place with a body of   000 men but such was the bravery of major heydon the governor and such the incapacity of the russians for operations of this nature that this little town defended only by a rampart without any outwork and lined with a very feeble garrison held out against the repeated attacks of the enemy twentysix days with the most savage barbarity both the open towns and defenseless villages leaving as strong impressions of contempt for their incapacity as of horror for their cruelty  after the defeat which the king received at hochkirchen he omitted no measures to prevent the enemy from making any material advantage of it he perceived clearly that the advantage they proposed to derive from it was to cover the operations of their armies in silesia and that they had no longer any serious design upon saxony during this campaign the king therefore made no scruple to reinforce his army by considerable detachments from that of prince henry which were brought up by that prince himself and as he saw that neiss the siege of which had been already formed and prosecuted with great vigor must certainly surrender if it were not speedily succored he resolved to march into silesia  to the execution of this design the greatest difficulties started up on all sides the army of m daun lately victorious had no other business than to intercept him to fight was dubious to avoid it hard if he could even avoid a battle he had much to apprehend from the efforts of the enemy to harrass him on his march if he should be so happy as to escape or conquer these difficulties yet his march entirely uncovered saxony and abandoned that most interesting possession very poorly defended to all the force of two powerful armies  on the other hand if the consideration of saxony should detain him in his present situation silesia ran the same risque and the same or greater disadvantages must ensue to his affairs by suffering the austrians to obtain a footing there this dilemma which would have rendered a meaner genius entirely inactive and hindered him from taking any resolution only obliged the king of prussia to take his resolution with the greater speed and to execute it with the greater vigor  on the   th of november at night he quitted his camp at dobreschutz and making a great compass he arrived without any obstruction from the enemy in the plain of gorlitz a body of the austrians had in vain endeavored to secure this post before him those that arrived were defeated with the loss of  00 men by this happy march all the advantages of m dauns studied position of all the fruits his boasted victory at hochkirchen were lost in a moment and an open passage to silesia lay before the king he pursued his march with the greatest diligence general laudohn with   000 men was sent to pursue him that active general continually harrassed his rear guard but the king continued his march without interruption and suffered him to take many little advantages rather than by delaying to contest small matters to endanger a design which might be decisive of the whole campaign  on the other hand daun not content with the obstacles which general laudohn threw in the kings way sent a large body of horse and foot by another route to reinforce the army which under the generals harsch and de ville had formed the siege of neiss and the blockade of cosel but he perceived that all these measures would probably prove ineffectual as his principal project which was to cover silesia had been defeated he therefore turned his views toward saxony and satisfying himself with detaching general laudohn which might create an opinion that the whole austrian army pursued he followed the king no further than gorlitz which place he immediately quitted and having by forced marches gained the elbe he passed that river at pirna  in the mean time the king of prussia drew nearer and nearer to neiss the siege of that fortress was commenced on the  th of august on the  d of october it was completely invested and the place was pushed on one side with the greatest vigor and on the other maintained with the most consummate skill and bravery until the approach of the king of prussia obliged the austrians on the  st of november to raise the siege leaving a considerable quantity of military stores behind them the same terror obliged the parties employed in the blockade of cosel to leave that place at liberty and to fall back together with the armies of the generals harsch and de ville into bohemia and the austrian silesia  the king of prussia when he had thus by the report of his march without fighting driven his enemies out of silesia coup de main and if they succeeded in this attempt the great height of the houses being six or seven stories and entirely commanding the ramparts would render the reduction of the body of the place equally easy and certain these considerations determined him to set these suburbs on fire  it is well known that the suburbs of dresden compose one of the finest towns in europe and are greatly superior to that which lies within the walls here the most wealthy parts of the inhabitants reside and here are carried on those several curious manufactures for which dresden is so famous count daun foresaw this consequence of his attempt he endeavored to intimidate the governor from this measure to which he knew the cruel reason of war would naturally lead him by threatening to make him personally answerable for the steps he should take but count schmettau answered with the firmness that became a man of honor and a soldier that he would answer whatever he should do and would not only burn the suburbs in case m daun advanced but would likewise defend the city itself street by street and at last even the castle which was the royal residence if he should be driven to it when the magistrates were apprised of this resolution they fell at the feet of count schmettau and implored him to change his mind and to have mercy on that devoted part of their city the part of the royal family who remained in dresden joined their supplications to those of the magistrates they prayed him to spare that last refuge of distressed royalty and to allow at least a secure residence to those who had been deprived of every thing else all entreaties were vain schmettau continued firm in his resolution he told them that their safety dded on themselves and on m daun that if he made no attempts the suburbs should be still secure but that if he took any farther steps the necessity of his masters service and his own honor would compel him to act very disagreeable to the lenity of his disposition the magistrates retired in despair combustibles were laid in all the houses  at three a clock next morning  m daun saw this fire which whilst it laid waste the capital of his ally made it more difficult for him to force it he sent in some empty threats to the governor but the saxon minister at ratisbon made grievous complaints to the diet of what he represented as the most unparalleled act of wanton and unprovoked cruelty that had ever been committed the emissaries of the court of vienna spread the same complaints and they made no scruple to invent and to alter facts in such a manner as to move the greatest pity toward the sufferers and the greatest indignation against the king of prussia all these however were in a short time abundantly confuted by the authentic certificates of the magistrates of dresden and of those officers of the court who were perfectly acquainted with the transaction by these certificates it appears that only   0 houses were consumed though this was a terrible calamity it was nothing to the accounts given in the gazettes of the austrian faction by these certificates it appears also that the people were not surprised but had sufficient notice of the governors intentions to enable them to provide for their safety in a word all the charges of cruelty against the prussian commander and soldiery were fully overthrown  this fire made a coup de main impracticable regular operations demanded time and the king of prussia was now in full march toward saxony m daun retired from before the place on the   th the king after crossing lusatia passing the elbe and joining his troops under count dohna and general wedel arrived triumphantly at dresden on the  0th the armies of m daun and the empire gave way toward bohemia into which kingdom they soon after finally retreated without enterprising any thing further six sieges were raised almost at the same time that of colberg carried on by general palmbach under the orders of marshal fermor that of neiss by m de harsch that of cosel that of dresden by m daun the blockade of torgau by m haddick and that of leipsick by the prince of deuxponts  about the time that the austrians retired into winter quarters the french did the same and the hanoverians permitted them to do it without molestation the season being too far advanced and their army perhaps not of sufficient strength for offensive operations and prince ferdinand kept the field no longer the british troops had no occasion of signalizing their bravery this year but without a battle the nation suffered a considerable loss and was touched with a very deep and general sorrow the duke of marlborough died in munster the  0th of october of a fever contracted by the fatigues of the campaign never did the nation lose in one man a temper more candid and benevolent manners more amiable and open a more primitive integrity a more exalted generosity a more warm and feeling heart he left all the enjoyments which an ample fortune and an high rank could bestow in the public eye and which every milder virtue every disposition to make and to be made happy could give in a domestic life he left these for the service of his country and died for its defense as he had lived for its ornament and happiness  if we compare the events of this year with those of the last we shall find in the actions of the present year perhaps something less of that astonishing eclat fewer battles not so many nor so striking revolutions of fortune but we may discover upon all sides far greater management and a more studied and refined conduct more artful movements a more judicious choice of posts more quick and vigorous marches if in the last year the king of prussia was the hero of the imagination he is this year the hero of the judgment and we have i think reason to admire him upon juster principles obliged to evacuate moravia he throws himself into bohemia and executes a retreat with all the spirit of an invasion he marches more than an hundred miles through an enemys country followed and harrassed by large armies who are unable to obtain any advantage over him gaining at length his own territories he engages the vast army of the russians and defeats it he is unable to follow his blow but he disables them from striking any against that part of his dominions which he is obliged to leave whilst he is engaged with the russians on the frontiers of poland the austrians and imperialists enter saxony before they can do any thing decisive the king is himself suddenly in saxony and by his presence at once disconcerts all their projects the scene is again changed they surprise him in his camp at hochkirchen two of his generals are killed his army defeated his camp is taken they attack silesia with a formidable army notwithstanding his late defeat notwithstanding the great superiority of his enemies notwithstanding the advantage of their posts he makes an amazing sweep about all their forces eludes their vigilance renders their positions unprofitable and marching with an astonishing rapidity into the remotest parts of silesia obliges the austrian armies to retire with precipitation out of that province then he flies to the relief of saxony which his enemies had again profited of his absence to invade and again by the same rapid and well conducted march he obliges them to abandon their prize defeated by the austrians he acquired by his conduct all the advantages to the most complete victory he guarded all his possessions in such a manner as to enable them all the endure his absence for some short time and he conducted his marches with such spirit as did not make it necessary to them to hold out any longer he made twice the circuit of his dominions and in their turn he relieved them all  nor was the conduct of prince ferdinand of brunswick less worthy of admiration placed at the head of a body of troops who were but lately obliged to lay down their arms he found the enemy in possession of the whole open country and of all the strong places in it commencing the campaign in the midst of a severe winter without any place of strength in his hands he drove the enemy from all those they held he obliged them to repass the rhine he followed and defeated them in a pitched battle being afterward obliged by the great force of france on its own frontier and the numerous armies they had in different places to repass the rhine he defended lip against numbers greatly superior and though they defeated a part of his army they were not able to turn their victory to the least advantage prince ferdinands campaign may well pass for a perfect model of defensive operations  the austrians in taking winter quarters disposed their forces so as to form a chain of an amazing length from the frontiers of moravia passing through bohemia all along the skirts of silesia and the borders of saxony there the imperial army joined this chain and continued it through thuringia and franconia where it was united to the quarters of the prince de soubise thse troops had fallen back from hesse cassel finding themselves unable to maintain their ground in the landgraviate the prince de soubises cantonments extended westward along the course of the maine and lahn to meet those of the m de contades which stretched to the rhine and continued the chain beyond it quite to the maese so as to command the whole course of the rhine and both sides both upwards and downward prince ferdinand was unable to extend himself to such a length and especially found it impracticable to establish quarters on the other side of the rhine but he disposed his troops in the most advantageous manner in the bishoprics of munster paderborn and hildesheim and in the landgraviate of hesse cassel the several bodies may all unite with ease and support each other to preserve a communication between this and the prussian army as well as to break some part of that formidable chain of the enemy the king sent some bodies of his troops into thuringia who dispossessed the army of the empire of several of their posts there and they now threaten to penetrate still farther  the king of prussia when he had a second time driven the austrians and imperialists out of saxony resolved to keep no measures with that unhappy country he declared that he was resolved no longer to consider it as a deposit but as a country which he had twice subdued by his arms he therefore ordered those of the king of polands privy council who still remained at dresden to retire at a very short warning but if the king of prussia had a right as perhaps he had to consider saxony as a lawful conquest he certainly seemed not to consider the people as subjects when he continued to exact the most severe contributions and in a manner too very little becoming a lawful sovereign for he surrounded the exchange with soldiers and confining the merchants in narrow lodgings on straw beds he obliged them by extreme suffering to draw bills on their foreign correspondents for very large sums this city had been quite exhausted by former payments and had not long before suffered military execution and enemy that acted thus had acted severely but when a country is entirely possessed by any power and claimed as a conquest the rights of war seem to cease and the people have a claim to be governed in such a manner as becomes a just prince especially when no extreme necessity in his affairs compels him to these rigorous courses to retaliate on these miserable people some part of the cruelties committed by the russians on his dominions seems to be very unreasonable as it is but too obvious that the barbarity of that people could not be restrained however it might be exasperated by the total destruction of saxony such retaliations are odious and cruel we heartily wish we could praise the king of prussia as much for his temporate use of his conquest as for those wonderful and heroic qualities by which he obtained it we might be considered as partial in our account if we had omitted to take notice of what is alleged against the king of prussia when we have spoken so fully of the outrages committed by his enemies it is now time to turn our eyes from this great theater toward lesser events but such as will employ us altogether as agreeably the operations of the british leets and armies in europe and america against the french  chap xiii the burning of the ships at st maloes taking of cherburg defeat of st cas operations in america siege and taking of louisbourg english army defeated at ticonderoga they take frontenac the french abandon fort du quesne conclusion of the annals of the year       in the beginning of this year the good condition of our navy and our army the spirit and popularity of the ministry the wise choice of commanders in contempt of vulgar and trivial maxims the prevalence of the contrary to all these amongst the enemy gave us the best grounded hopes of a vigorous and successful campaign concerning the theater of our operations there was some doubt it was the opinion of some that our push in europe should be made on the side of germany and that we ought to strengthen the army of prince ferdinand with such a respectable body of troops as might enable that finished commander to exert all his talents and to improve to the utmost the advantages he had already obtained over the french they imagined that if an early and considerable reinforcement were sent to the prince whilst the french army was yet in a distressed condition and if in this condition that should receive any considerable blow they would find it extremely difficult to retrieve it and receiving this blow on the frontier of their own territories the prince might carry the war into france itself and thus very probably bring matters to a speedy decision that in pursuing this plan a diversion on the coast of france was by no means excluded and that on the contrary it must on this plan be attended with consequences infinitely more important than it could otherwise that otherwise france might laugh at the little desultory efforts of an handful of men who were to be embarked and disembarked with great difficulty and hazard and which would always be obliged to fly at the first approach of an enemy that whilst the french had only an army greatly inferior in number to engage on the side of germany they would always find themselves well able to act abroad and defend themselves at home  on the other hand it was strongly urged that we ought to make the destruction of the french marine our great object and to consider all continental operations only in a secondary light that by sending a large body of english troops to the kings army on the rhine we must necessarily weaken our efforts in america and on the coast of france and by drawing away all our forces we must shake that internal security which invigorated all our operations abroad that whilst we maintained an army of  0000 foreigners in germany it would be the greatest imprudence to send also a large body of our own national troops into the same country and by that means not only squander away our men but employ almost every penny granted for the land service out of great britain a method which could not fail of exhausting us in a very short time that the force already in germany was sufficient to keep the french engaged and that the proposed expeditions to france would be attacking the coast now in one part now in another and keeping all parts in continual alarms necessarily detain a very considerable part of their forces at home and thus make a powerful diversion whilst it was pursuing what ought to be the grand perpetual object of all our operations the destruction of the french maritime power  the latter opinion prevailed but it was however so far modified by the arguments on the other side that after some time a few regiments were sent into germany as we have before related these and better reasons no doubt determined the operations on the coast of france but whilst the necessary preparations were making their destination was kept an inviolable secret and now as they had the year before inspired france with no little terror two squadrons by the latter end of may were in readiness for sailing the greater under lord anson the smaller under commodore how which was so designed to convoy the transports and to favor the landing and reimbarkment the land forces consisted of sixteen battalions and nine troops of light horse they were commanded by the late duke of marlborough they sailed from portsmouth but as soon as the fleet set sail widely and to observe the french squadron in breast the other part of the fleet which was commanded by commodore how with the transports arrived without any accident in cancalle bay at a small distance from the city of st maloes here the troops landed without opposition coup de main and though for want of outworks it was ill qualified to sustain a regular siege yet our forces were for want of strength and artillery sufficient altogether as ill qualified for such an operation they were therefore contented with setting fire to about an hundred sail of shipping many of them privateers  before the fleet returned they reconnoitred the town of granville on the coast of normandy but finding that a large body of troops were encamped in the neighborhood they made no attempt there from thence they moved toward cherbourg and made the proper dispositions for landing near that place but a hard gale blowing into the shore and the transports beginning to fall foul on each other it became extremely hazardous to attempt landing besides the provision was near exhausted and the soldiers by being so long cooped up in the transports were grown sickly it became highly necessary to return home and they arrived at st helens on the   thof june  the success of this expedition by which the french suffered largely with scarce any loss on our side though it sufficiently answered the intention of the armament fell somewhat short of the expectations of the public who had formed much greater hopes than it was possible for the nature of such enterprises to fulfill however their hopes were again revived by seeing that every thing was prepared for another expedition and that our armies and fleets were to be kept in constant action during the summer the time was now come when we were to turn the tables upon france and to retaliate by real attacks the terrors which had been raised by her menaces of an invasion the duke of marlborough had now taken the command of the english forces in germany and general bligh succeeded him in this command prince edward resolved to go upon the expedition and to form himself for the service of his country under so brave and able a commander as how it is easy to imagine how much the spirit the presence and example of the gallant young prince who went with the utmost cheerfulness through all the detail of a midshipmans duty inspired both the seamen and the troops  on the first of august the fleet set sail from st helens in a few days they came to anchor before cherbourg the french had drawn a line strengthened by forts along the most propable places for landing they had drawn down three regiments of regular troops and a considerable body of militia to the shore and had in all appearance threatened a very resolute opposition to the descent of the english forces but the commodore disposed the men of war and bomb ketches so judiciously and made so sharp a fire upon the enemy that they never ventured out of their entrenchments  cherbourg is on the land side an open town neither is it very strongly defended toward the sea the harbor is naturally bad but the place is well situated in the midst of the channel for protecting the french and annoying the english commerce in time of war and perhaps for facilitating an invasion on england itself monsieur belidor the famous engineer had demonstrated its importance and proposed a plan for the improvement and defense of the harbor as well as for the fortifications of the town this plan was approved and partly put in execution by the building of a mole digging a basin and making sluices and flood gates with excellent materials and a vast expense the work had been for a considerable time discontinued but in this expedition that work of so great ingenuity charge and labor was totally destroyed whilst our humanity regrets the unhappy necessity of war we cannot help thinking that the english nation was freed by the success of this expedition from what might one day be cause of no trivial alarms  when this work of destruction was over all the vessels in the harbor burned and hostages taken for the contributions levied on the town the forces reimbarked with great speed and safety without any interruption from the enemy  the nation exulted greatly in this advantage especially as it almost accompanied the news of our glorious successes in america nothing was omitted to give the action its utmost eclat the brass cannon and mortars taken at cherbourg were drawn from kensington to the tower quite through the city in great pomp and order adorned with streamers  the fleet when it left cherbourg was driven to the coast of england but the troops were not disembarked it was resolved that the coast of france should have no respite and accordingly they sailed toward st maloes and landed in the bay of st lunar at a small distance from the town of st maloes this choice of a place for landing must necessarily have surprised all those who remembered upon what reasons the attempt against that place had been so recently laid aside there was no other object of sufficient consideration near it the town was at least in as good a posture of defense as it had been then and the force which was to attack it had since then been considerably lessened there is undoubtedly something very unaccountable as well in the choice as in the whole conduct of this affair the persons in the principal commands shifted the blame from one to another there is nothing more remote from our design than to set up for judges in matters of this nature or ungenerously to lean on any officer who meaning well to the service of his country by some misfortune or mistake fails in such hazardous and intricate enterprises we shall be satisfied with relating the facts as they happened  as soon as the troops were landed in the bay of st lunar it became evident that the design against st maloes was utterly impracticable other projects were then proposed but they all seemed equally liable to objection whilst they debated concerning a plan for their operations the fleet was in the greatest danger the bay of st lunar is extremely rocky and the experience of the people of the country together with what he saw himself convinced the commodore that it was impossible to remain any longer in this road with tolerable safety therefore he moved up to the bay of st cas about three leagues to the westward  the fleet was separated from the land forces but it was still easy to preserve a communication between them and as no attack was yet apprehended they made no scruple to penetrate farther into the country in two days they arrived at the village of matignon having had several skirmishes with small bodies of the enemy who from time to time appeared on their flanks and who always disappeared when they were briskly encountered by this time the duke daiguillon governor of britanny was advanced within six miles of the english army with a body of twelve battalions and six squadrons of regular troops and two regiments of militia this determined the council of war to retreat they wanted but three miles to the bay of st cas but in this little march a considerable time was consumed and the french army was close upon them before they could be completely reimbarked a very steep hill formed a sort of amphitheatre about the bay of st cas where the embarkation was making but before the last division which consisted of all the grenadiers of the army and the first regiment of the guards could get off the french had marched down this hill through an hollow way and formed themselves in a long line against the few english troops that remained there remained in this exigency only the expedient of assuming a bold countenance and attacking them with vigor the bravery of our troops on this desperate occasion was worthy of a better fortune the ships and frigates seconded their efforts and made a severe fire upon the enemy all was to no purpose their ammunition was at last spent the enemies numbers prevailed our little body attempted to retreat but they fell into confusion they broke an horrible slaughter followed many ran into the water and met their fate in that element the shore was covered with dead bodies general drury was drowned sir john armitage a young volunteer of great fortune and hopes was shot through the head several officers men of large fortune and consideration fell at length the firing of the frigates ceased and the french immediately gave quarter about  00 were made prisoners  00 were killed and wounded  in the midst of this carnage in the midst of a fire that staggered the bravest seamen who managed the boats commodore how exhibited a noble example of intrepidity and fortitude by ordering himself to be rowed in his own boat through the thickest of the fire to encourage all that were engaged in that service and to bring off as many men as his vessel could carry  this affair dispirited the people of england and elated the people of france far more than an affair of so little consequence ought to have done it was in fact no more than the cutting off a rear guard there is often more bloodshed in skirmishes in germany which make no figure in the gazettes and certainly if our expeditions to the coast of france were planned with any judgment on our part we had rather reason to congratulate ourselves that we were able to land three times on that coast with so inconsiderable a loss the french indeed had reason to magnify this loss and they did greatly magnify it in order to console their people who had seen their trade suffer so much and their country so long insulted with impunity  mayjor general amherst portrait of major general amherst  whatever our successes were on the coast of france they did not affect us in the same manner with those which we had in america from this part of the world we had long been strangers to any thing but delays misfortunes disappointments and disgraces but the spirit which had been roused at home diffused itself into all parts of the world where we had any concern and invigorated all our operations  admiral boscawen with a powerful fleet of men of war and several transports sailed for halifax from england feb the   th he had the chief command in the expedition against louisbourg and in particular the direction of the naval operations general amherst from whose character great things were expected and who justified these expectations was to command the land forces these amounted to about   000 men including some light troops fitted for the peculiar service of the country the whole fleet consisting of     ships set sail from the harbor of halifax on the second of june they appeared before louisbourg they were six days on the coast before a landing was found practicable such a prodigious surf swelled all along the shore that no boat could possibly live near it the french not trusting to this obstacle had drawn intrenchments in every part where it might be possible to land supported them with batteries in convenient places and lined them with numerous infantry at length the surf though violent at best  when the fire of the frigates continued about a quarter of an hour general wolfes division moved toward the land the enemy reserved their shot until the boats were near in shore and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and musquetry upon them the surf aided their fire many of the boats overset many were broken to pieces the men jumped into the water some were killed some drowned the rest supported and encouraged in all difficulties by the example spirit and conduct of their truly gallant commander gained the shore took post fell upon the enemy with such order and resolution that they soon obliged them to fly in confusion as soon as this post was made good and center moved toward the left and the right followed the center so that the landing was completed though not without much time and trouble in an excellent order and with little loss  the operations of a siege are too minute and interesting to make a detail of them agreeable to readers who are not conversant in the art military the operations against louisbourg for several days went on very slowly owing entirely to the prodigious surf and the rough weather which made it extremely difficult to land the artillery stores and instruments to be employed in the siege however the excellent conduct of the generals amherst and wolf by degrees overcame all the difficulties of the weather which was extremely unfavourable the ground which was rugged in some places and boggy in others and the resistance of the garrison which was considerable the french had five men of war of the line in the harbor who could bring all their guns to bear upon the approaches of the english troops the first thing done was to secure a point called the lighthouse battery from whence they might play upon these vessels and on the batteries on the other side of the harbor general wolf performed this service with his usual vigor and celerity and took possession of this and all the other posts in that quarter which had been displayed during the course of this siege the admiral who had all along done every thing possible to second the efforts of the land forces notwithstanding the severity of the weather resolved on a stroke which by being decisive of the possession of the harbor might make the reduction of the town a matter of little difficulty he resolved to send in a detachment of  00 seamen in boats to take or burn the two ships of the line which remained and if he should succeed in this he proposed the next day to send in some of his own great ships who might batter the town on the side of the harbor this was not more wisely planned by the admiral than gallantly and successfully executed by captain lforey in spite of the fire from the ships and the batteries  this stroke in support of the spirited advances of the land forces was conclusive the town surrendered the next day  the taking of louisbourg a was an event the most desired by all our colonies that harbor had always been a receptacle convenient to the enemies privateers who infested the english trade in north america it was the most effectual blow which france had received from the commencement of the war by the taking of louisbourg she lost the only place from whence she could carry on the cod fishery and the only place she had in a convenient situation for the reinforcements that were sent to support the war in the other parts of america and with louisbourg fell the island of st johns and whatever other inferior stations they had for carrying on the fishery toward gaspesie and the bay de chaleurs which our ships soon after this event entirely destroyed it is incredible how much this success in america joined to the spirit of our other measures operated to raise our military reputation in europe and to sink that of france and consequently how much it influenced our most essential interests and those of our allies  major general amherst journal of the siege of louisbourg on the   th of may i had the good fortune to meet admiral boscawen with the fleet and the troops coming out of the harbor of halifax lieut genesis braggs regiment from the bay of fundy joined the fleet this day  the   th we had fine weather the ships kept well together the whole consisted of     sail the dublin went very sickly into halifax  the  0th the wind blew hard in the afternoon the ships were greatly dispersed  the   st the wind sometimes contrary obliged us to tack and it blew fresh  the  st of june capt rous in the sutherland came from off the harbor of louisbourg said two ships had got in the  0th that there were    sail in the harbor we saw the entrance of gabarus at night  the  d it was foggy in the morning about twelve saw louisbourg and the ships in the harbor the fleet with about a third of the troops anchored in gabarus bay and this evening with brigadiers generals lawrence and wolf i reconnoitred the shore as near as we could and made a disposition for landing in three places the next morning in case the troops arrived  the enemy had a chain of posts from cape noir to the flat point and irregulars from thence to the bottom of the bay some works thrown up at the places which appeared practicable to land at and some batteries  on the  d most of the transports came in this morning all well prepared for landing but the surf on shore was so great it was impossible to land this day brigadier general whitmore arrived from halifax at which place i have left col monckton to command as one bay was found to have less surf than the others a disposition was made to land the next morning in one place instead of three  the  th the wind and surf were so very high admiral boscawen told me it was impracticable to land  the  th a great swell and fog in the morning and the admiral declared it still impracticable to land  the  th an appearance of change of weather in the morning early i was resolved to seize the first opportunity the signal was made to prepare to land between five and six oclock and at eight all the men were in the boats the fog came on again and the swell increased during the time the men were getting into the boats and the admiral again declared it impracticable to land i ordered the troops on board their respective ships first acquainting them with the reason for so doing  the  th the weather bad in the morning in the afternoon the swell rather decreased and gave us great hopes of landing at daybreak the next morning for which orders were given and braggs regiment who were in a number of sloops to sail under convoy by the mouth of the harbor to lorembec sending at the same time a proportion of artillery destined for the light house point with orders to make all the show they could of landing but not to land till further orders intending to draw the enemys attention on that side  from the  d to this time the enemy have been reinforcing their posts adding to their works cannonading and throwing shells at the ships and making all the preparations they can to oppose our landing seven transports were now missing with troops on board three of which came in at night the admiral gave all necessary orders for the frigates to cover our landing  on the  th the troops were assembled in the boats before break of day in three divisions and commodore durell having viewed the coast by order of the admiral and given me his opinion the troops might land without danger from the surf in the bay on our left the kennington and halifax snow began the fire on the left followed by the grammont diana and shannon frigates in the center and the sutherland and squirrel upon the right when the fire had continued about a quarter of an hour the boats upon the left rowed into the shore under the command of brigadier general wolf whose detachment was composed of the four eldest companies of grenadiers followed by the light infantry a corpse of   0 men chosen as marksmen from the different regiments serve as irregulars and are commanded by major scott who was major of the brigade and the companies of rangers supported by the highland regiment and those by the eight remaining companies of grenadiers  the division on the right under the command of brigadier genesis whitmore consisted of the royal lascelles monckton forbes anstruther and webb and rowed to our right by the white point as if intending to force a landing there  the center division under the command of brigadier general lawrence was formed of amhersts hopsons otways whitmores lawrences and wharburtons and made at the same time a show of landing at the fresh water cove this drew the enemys attention to every part and prevented their troops posted along the coast from joining those on their right  the enemy acted very wisely did not throw away a shot till the boats were near in shore and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and musketry upon them the surf was so great that a place could hardly be found to get a boat on shore notwithstanding the fire of the enemy and the violence of the surf brigadier wolf pursued his point and landed just at their left of the cove took post attacked the enemy and forced them to retreat many boats overset several broke to pieces and all the men jumped into the water to get on shore  so soon as the left division was landed the first detachment of the center rowed at a proper time to the left and followed then the remainder of the center division as fast as the boats could fetch them from the ships and the right division followed the center in like manner  it took up a great deal of time to land the troops the enemys retreat or rather flight was through the roughest and worst ground i ever saw and the pursuit ended with a cannonading from the town which was so far of use that it pointed out how near i could encamp to invest it on which the regiments marched to their ground and lay on their arms the wind increased and we could not get any thing on shore  the loss of his majestys troops at landing is capt baillie and lieut cuthbert of the highland regiment lieut nicholson of mine   sergeants   corporal and    men killed    were of my regiment the grenadiers of which   were shot and the rest drowned in trying to get on shore  five lieutenants   sergeants   corporal and    men wounded and of the five companies of rangers   ensign and   private killed   wounded and   missing  on the enemys side   captains of grenadiers and   lieutenants are prisoners   officer killed and an indian chief several men likewise killed and i imagine about  0 men taken prisoners they were sent on board as fast as possible by some of the prisoners i had intelligence that m st julien colonel commanded in the cove that there were   battalions in the town namely bourgogne artois royal marine cambise and volontaires etrangers with about  00 canadians the three first regiments wintered in louisbourg volontaires etrangers came there not long since with part of the fleet and cambise the night before we landed  we took from the enemy three    pounders seven   pounders and seven   pounders two mortars and fourteen swivels all which were placed along the shore to prevent our landing with ammunition tools and stores of all kinds  the  th lieut genesis braggs regiment returned in their sloops from lorembec the weather continued extremely bad the surf so great that we could get only some of our tents on shore in the afternoon  the  0th the furf still continued and it was with great difficulty that we got any thing on shore  the   th the weather grew clear and better and the light   pounders which i had ordered on shore immediately after the troops were now only landed and some artillery stores with them  on the   th from intelligence i had received that the enemy had destroyed the grand battery and called in their outposts i detached brigadier wolf with   00 men   companies of grenadiers   companies of rangers and some light infantry round the n e harbor to the light house point with an intention to silence the island battery and at the same time to attempt to destroy the ships in the harbor sending at the same time by sea the proportion of artillery tools etc that had been ordered for this service  i received this day a report from brigadier wolf that he had taken possession of the light house point and all the posts on that side the harbor which the enemy had abandoned leaving several cannon which were rendered useless tools etc and a great quantity of fish at lorembec the weather continued extremely bad but we got some tools on shore this night so that on the   th we began to make a communication from the right to the left in front of the camp and i ordered three redoubts on the most advantageous ground in the front a party of the enemy came out this day toward our camp but were soon beat back by the light infantry before two picquets could well get up to their assistance we worked at three redoubts in front all night  the   th the enemy cannonaded us a great part of the day the surf still continued so great that it was with the greatest difficulty we could land any thing the fleet under the command of sir charles hardy which appeared yesterday for the first time was in the night blown off to sea  the   th i sent four more mortars in a sloop to the light house but we could not get any artillery landed on this shore at night two deserters from the volontares etrangers came in said they had   killed and  0 wounded in the skirmish on the   th  the   th the first fine weather we landed    days provision and got many things on shore but could not land any artillery  the   th i got colonel bastide on horseback and with col williamson and major m kellar we reconnoitred the whole ground as far as we could and colonel bastide was determined in his opinion of making approaches by the green hill and confining the destruction of the ships in the harbor to the light house point and the batteries on that side i added two   inch mortars and three royals to the light house batteries  the   th we had fine weather some indians took three of the transports men at the bottom of gabarus bay who landed there contrary to orders the road for the artillery was pushed on as fast as possible we got three    pounders on shore though the surf was great the beginning of the day  the   th the batteries on the light house were intended to have been opened this night but could not be got ready so soon lecho a french frigate of    guns was brought in today had got out of the harbor the   th at night and was bound to quebec by her we have intelligence that the bizane got out the day we landed and the comette since our arrival off the harbor  the  0th the island battery and ships fired at the batteries on the shore who began their fire this last night the enemy burnt an old ship at the bottom of the harbor  the   st very bad weather and the surf high the enemy discovered us making the road for the artillery and cannonaded us threw some shot into the left of the camp but did not oblige me to decamp any part an advanced redoubt toward green hill was thrown up this night  the   d the bad weather continued we were employed on the road and getting up a block house on the left by the miray road to secure the communication to the n e harbor and light house and to hinder any parties from going into the town  the   d the admiral assured me there were above a hundred boats lost in landing the troops and provisions this day fine weather and we now have on shore twelve    pounders and six    pounders the enemy fired a great deal from their shipping and island battery and threw some shot into the left of the camp colonel messervey and most of his carpenters taken ill of the smallpox which is a very great loss to the army gabions and fascines are landed and carried forward as fast as possible to make an epaulement to green hill the batteries at the light house fire with success against the island battery and i hope will soon silence it  on the   th the enemy fired on the light house batteries from the town and shipping and on our advanced redoubt which was finished they fired from the town colonel bastide remained fixed in his opinion of advancing by green hill we had this day in the park of artillery thirteen    pounders and seven    pounders  the   th the cannonading continued night and day in the evening the island battery was silenced their own fire had helped to break down part of their works fascines and gabions were forwarded to green hill as fast as possible all the men employed at work and making the necessary communications the enemy fired a good deal at our advanced redoubt  the   th a small alarm on the left of a party that had advanced from the town had got up to the block house which was not quite finished they had with them a barrel of pitch to set it on fire the guard on it was not sufficient to oppose a large party but a detachment was sent out so quick that they were forced to retreat without effecting their design though two of the men had been in the block house and they were drove back into the town very fast three hundred pioneers ordered to green hill admiral boscawen landed  00 marines and took the post at kennington cove which is a great ease to the army i desired of the admiral four    pounders and two    pounders to leave at the light house to keep the island battery in ruin that with a proper number of men entrenched there brigadier wolf with his detachment might be able to come round the harbor bringing his artillery with him and to try to destroy the shipping and to advance toward the west gate  the   th one brass    pounder was lost in    fathom water by slipping off the catamaran a kind of raft much used at sea  as they were coming from the ship to land it the cannon i asked of the admiral were landed this night at the light house  the   th a great many popping shots and cannonading as the post at green hill was covered we began the road over the bog and throwing up an epaulement colonel messervey and his son both died this day and of his company of carpenters of  0  men all but    in the smallpox who are nurses to the sick this is particularly unlucky at this time  the   th cannonading continued the frigate fired constantly at the epaulement we pursued working at the road which cost a great deal of labor at night the enemy sunk   ships in the harbours mouth apollo a two decked one la fidelle of    guns la chevre and la biche of    guns each and they cut off most of their masts remain in the harbor five of the line of battle and a frigate of    guns  the  0th at night some firing at kennington cove the marines thought they saw indians the frigate fired all night at the epaulement as the men worked in the night time  the  st of july the enemy creeped out in the morning to get some old palisades and wood brig wolf and major scotts light infantry pushed them in with a very brisk fire and the brigadier took post on the hills from whence it was intended to try to demolish the shipping we marched forward on the right forced the enemy back to cape noir with a smart fire  the  d the epaulement and road went on heavily from the extreme badness of the ground the enemy continued their cannonading and threw some shells we skirmished all day with parties out of the town  the  d a great cannonading from the town and shipping on the batteries brig wolf was making an advanced work on the right thrown up at   0 yards from the covered way with an intention of erecting a battery to destroy the defenses of the place it being pretty well on the capital of the citadel bastion and the falling of the ground from this place toward the works would hinder discovering as much of the works as would be necessary to do them any considerable damage in the evening the sea officers thought some of the ships would try to get out of the harbor the batteries on the left immediately played on them but it grew so dark they could not continue  the  th a great fog when there were glares of light the cannonading began  00 men kept continually making fascines  the  th very bad weather the epaulement was hastened on as much as possible it swallowed up an immense number of fascines cost some men as the frigate cannonaded on it without ceasing  the  th a sloop sailed out of the harbor with a flag of truce to sir charles hardy to carry some things to their wounded officers and prisoners  the many difficulties of landing every thing in almost a continual surf the making of roads draining and passing of bogs and putting ourselves under cover render our approach to the place much longer than i could wish  on the  th we had very foggy weather cannonading continued all day and a good deal of popping shots from the advanced posts  the  th i intended an attack on some advanced posts at cape noir but it did not take place col bastide got a contusion by a musket ball on his boot which laid him up in the gout  the  th in the night the enemy made a sortie where brigadier lawrence commanded they came from cape noir and though drunk i am afraid rather surprised a company of grenadiers of forbss commanded by lord dundonald who were posted in a fleecke on the right major murray who cammanded three companies of grenadiers immediately detached one and drove the enemy back very easily whitmores and braggs grenadiers behaved very well on this occasion lord dundonald was killed lieut tew wounded and taken prisoner capt bontein of the engineers taken prisoner   corporal   men killed   sergeant    men missing    men wounded the sortie was of five picquets supported by  00 men a captain chevalier de chauvelin was killed a lieutenant wounded and taken prisoner    men killed   wounded and brought off prisoners besides what wounded they carried into the town one of which a captain died immediately the enemy sent out a flag of truce to bury their dead which when over the cannonading began again the frigate was so hurt she hauled close to the town the ships fired very much against brig wolfes batteries  the  0th the road at the epaulement went on a little better the enemy fired a great deal and threw many shells  the   th a waggoner was taken off by some indians between the blockhouse and the left of the n e harbor  the   th it rained very hard all night not a man in the detachment could have a dry thread on we made an advanced work to green hill at night the waggoner who had been taken luckily made his escape said they were   0 canadians the citadel bastion fired very smartly  the   th the enemy threw a great many shells we perfected our works as fast as we could bad rainy weather the enemy was at work at cape noir to hinder us taking possession near that point which is of no consequence some deserters came in said a sloop of miray got in three days ago  the   th the batteries were traced out last night with an intention to place twenty    pounders divided in four different batteries to destroy the defenses and a battery of   mortars with some    pounders to ricochet is half charging a gun by which the bullet skips upon the ground like stones when skimmd upon the water the works and the town  the   th the cannonading and firing continued the enemy tried to throw some shells into camp supposed to be intended against our powder magazine at ten at night the light house battery fired some rockets as a signal of ships sailing out of the harbor this was probably the ship which brought news to france of the english landing and escaped notwithstanding the vigilance of so great a fleet  sir charles hardy answered it the frigate got out and sir charles hardys fleet got under sail and went to sea before day break capt sutherland posted at the end of the ne harbor was attacked and there was a great deal of firing the grenadiers of brig wolfes corpse marched to sustain him and all the light infantry it was over before they could get up and by a deserter from the enemy they were only  00 men come from miray where they left mons de bosbiere who had on the other side the water  00 men with boats to pass major scott with the light infantry pursued but could not get up with them i encamped a corpse forward  the   th toward night brig wolf pushed on a corpse and took possession of the hills in the front of the barasoy where we made a lodgment the enemy fired very briskly from the town and shipping  the   th a great fire continued from the town and shipping we resolved to extend the parallel from the right to the left the fleet returned  the   th all last night the enemy fired musketry from the covert way and tried to throw shells into the camp  the   th i relieved the trenches by battalions the    battalions forming   brigades a smart fire from the covert way the batteries on the left fired against the bastion dauphine with great success  the   st one of the ships in the harbor that had some powder blown up in her made a great explosion and set the ship on fire which soon caught the sails of two more they burned very fast and we kept firing on them the whole time to try to hinder the boats and people from the town to get to their assistance the of    guns entreprennant capricieux and superb of    guns each  were the three burned ships the prudent and bienfaisant remained  the   d two batteries on the right opened with thirteen    pounders and another of   mortars and fired with great success the enemy fired very well from the town for some time and threw their shells into our works our shells put the citadel in flames i ordered col williamson to confine his fire as much as he could to the defenses of the place that we might not destroy the houses a lt of the royal americans going his rounds on an anvanced post lost his way and was taken prisoner near cape noir a battery was begun on the left for four    pounders    d the cohorns were used at night and the french mortars sent to throw stones from the trenches the enemy fired all sorts of old iron and any stuff they could pick up col bastide was out today for the first time since he received the contusion our batteries fired with great success this night the shells set fire to the barracks and they burnt with great violence  on the   th the fire was very brisk on our side and the enemys decreased the admiral gave me  00 seamen to help to work at the batteries etc and  00 miners added to a corpse of  00 already established that we might make quick work of it and they were immediately employed the   gun battery opened and another of   erecting one of the men of war in the harbor the bienfaisant fired at our trenches at high water and the citadel and bafiion dauphine fired against the   gun battery but our men firing small arms into the embrazures beat the enemy off their guns  the   th the batteries fired with great success the admiral sent me word he intended to send in boats with  00 men to take or destroy the prudent and the bienfaisant in the harbor i ordered all the batteries at night to fire into the works as much as possible to keep the enemys attention to the land the miners and workmen went on very well with their approaches to the covered way though they had a continued and very smart fire from it and grape shot and all sorts of old iron from the guns of the ramparts we continued our fire

fatigue of this siege with great firmness and alacrity  the plan of our operations in america were however by no means confined solely to this object important as it was two other attempts were proposed the first attempt was with a great force to drive the french from ticonderoga and crown point in which if we could succeed the enemy would lose those posts from which they were in the best condition to molest our colonies and by losing them would lay open an easy road into the very heart of their settlements in canada the second attempt was to be made with a considerable though an interior force from pensylvania against fort du quesne the success of this attempt would establish us in the possession of the ohio  see the map of america at the latter end and break off the connection between canada and louisiana  genesis abercrombie commander in chief of our forces in america conducted the first of those expeditions he embarked upon lake george with near   000 troops regulars and provincials and a numerous artillery on the  th of july and after a prosperous navigation arrived the next day at the place where it had been proposed to make the landing they landed without opposition the enemies advanced guards fled at their appearance the english army proceeded in four columns to ticonderoga as the country through which their march lay was difficult and woody and the guides which conducted the march to this unknown country were extremely unskilful the troops were bewildered the columns broke and fell in upon one another whilst they marched on in this alarming disorder the advanced guard of the french who had lately fled before them was bewildered in the same manner and in the same disorder fell in with our forces a skirmish ensued in which this party was quickly defeated with the loss of near  00 killed and     prisoners the loss on the english side was inconsiderable in numbers but great in consequence lord how was killed this gallant man from the moment he landed in america had wisely conformed and made his regiment conform to the kind of service which the country required he did not suffer any under him to encumber themselves with superfluous baggage he himself set the example and fared like a common soldier the first to encounter danger to endure hunger to support fatigue rigid in his discipline but easy in his manners his officers and soldiers readily obeyed the commander because they loved the man and now at the moment when such abilities and such an example were the most wanted was fatally lost a life which was long enough for his honor but not for his country it adds indeed to the glory of such a death and to the consolation of his country that we still possess the heir of his titles his fortunes and his virtues whilst we tremble to see the same virtues exposing themselves to the same dangers soon after the news of lord howes death arrived the following advertisement appeared in the public papers an application worthy of a roman matron in the virtuous times of the republic and which could not fail of success where the least spark of virtue existed  to the gentlemen clergy freeholders and burgesses of the town and country of the town of nottingham as lord how is now absent upon the public service and lieut col how is with his regiment at louisbourg it rests upon me to beg the favor of your votes and interest that lieut col how may supply the place of his late brother as your representative in parliament  permit me therefore to implore the protection of every one of you as the mother of him whose life has been lost in the service of his country  albemarle street sept         charlotte how      excepting this loss the army had hitherto proceeded successfully in a little time they appeared before ticonderoga this is a very important post and as strongly secured  the general caused the ground to be reconnoitred and the engineer made so favorable a report of the weakness of the entrenchment that it appeared practicable to force it by musquetry alone a fatal resolution was taken in consequence of this report not to wait the arrival of the artillery which on account of the badness of the ground could not be easily brought up but to attack the enemy without loss of time they were confirmed in this precipitate resolution by a rumor that a body of  000 men were on their march to join the french at ticonderoga and very shortly expected to arrive  when the attack began the difficulty of the ground and the strength of the enemies lines which had been so little foreseen was but too severely felt although the troops behaved with the utmost spirit and gallantry they suffered so terribly in their approaches and made so little impression on the entrenchment that the general seeing their reiterated and obstinate efforts fail of success being upwards of four hours exposed to a most terrible fire thought it necessary to order a retreat to save the remains of the army near  000 of our men were killed wounded and taken prisoners the number of the taken being very inconsiderable this precipitate attack was followed by a retreat as precipitate insomuch that our army gained their former camp to the southward of lake george  general abercrombies account of his expedition against ticonderoga camp at lake george july         the embarkation of the artillery stores and provisions being completed on the evening of the  th instant next morning at break of day the tents were struck and all the troops amounting to      regulars officers light infantry and rangers included and  0   provincials including officers and batteau men embarked in about  00 baeaux and     whale boats the artillery to cover our landing being mounted on rafts  at five in the evening reached sabbath day points    miles down the lake where we halted till ten then got under way again and proceeded to the landing place a cove leading to the french advanced guard which we reached early next morning the  th  upon our arrival sent out a reconnoitring party and having met with no opposition landed the troops formed them in four columns regulars in the center and provincials on the flanks and marched toward the enemys advanced guard composed of one battalion posted on a logged camp which upon our approach they deserted first setting fire to their tents and destroying every thing they could but as their retreat was very precipitate they left several things behind which they had not time either to burn or carry off in this camp we likewise found one prisoner and a dead man  the army in the foregoing order continued their march through the wood on the west side with a design to invest ticonderoga but the wood being very thick impassable with any regularity to such a body of men and the guides unskilful the troops were bewildered and the columns broke falling in one upon another  lord how at the head of the right center colum supported by the light infantry being advanced fell in with a french party supposed to consist of about  00 regulars and a few indians who had likewise lost themselves in the retreat from the advanced guard of these our flankers killed a great many and took     prisoners among whom were five officers and three cadets  but this small success cost us very dear not as to the loss of numbers for we had only two officers killed but as to consequence his lordship being the first man that fell in this skirmish and as he was very deservedly universally beloved and respected throughout the whole army it is easy to conceive the grief and consternation his untimely fall occasioned for my part i cannot help owning that i felt it most heavily and lament him as sincerely  the  th the troops being greatly fatigued by having been one whole night on the water the following day constantly on foot and the next day under arms added to their being in want of provision having dropped what they had brought with them in order to lighten themselves it was thought advisable to return to the landing place which we accordingly did about eight that morning  about eleven in the forenoon sent off lieut col bradstreet with the   th regiment six companies of the first battalion of the royal americans the batteau men and a body of rangers and provincials to take possession of the sawmill within two miles of ticonderoga a fort built about two years ago on the narrow passage or communication between lake george and champlain it has all the advantages that nature or art can give it being defended on three sides by water which is surrounded by rocks and o the half of the fourth side by a swamp and where h fals there the french had erected an entrenchment and breast wot about   feet high it is in the way to crown point and must be taken by our forces before they can march thither see the plate  which he soon effected as the enemy who were posted there after destroying the mill and breaking down their bridge had retired some time before  lieut col bradstreet having laid another bridge a cross and having sent me notice of his being in possession of that ground i accordingly marched thither with the troops and we took up our quarters there that night  the prisoners we had taken being unanimous in their reports that the french had eight battalions some canadians and colony troops in all about  000 encamped before their fort who were intrenching themselves and throwing up a breastwork and that they expected a reinforcement of  000 canadians besides indians who had been detached under the command of mons de levy to make a diversion on the side of the mohawk river but upon intelligence of our preparations and near approach had been repeatedly recalled and was hourly expected it was thought most advisable to lose no time in making the attack wherefore early in the morning of the  th i sent mr clerk the engineer across the river on the opposite side of the fort in order to reconnoitre the enemys intrenchments  upon his return and favorable report of the practicability of carrying those works if attacked before they were finished it was agreed to storm them that very day accordingly the rangers light infantry and the right wing of provincials were ordered immediately to march and post themselves in a line out of cannon shot of the intrenchments the right extending to lake george and the left to lake champlain in order that the regular troops destined for the attack of the intrenchments might form on their rear  the piquets were to begin the attack sustained by the grenadiers and by the battalions the whole were ordered to march up briskly rush upon the enemys fire and not give theirs until they were within the enemys breastwork  after these orders issued the whole army except what had been left at the landingplace to cover and guard the batteaux and whale boats and a provincial regiment at the sawmill were put in motion and advanced to ticonderoga where they unfortunately found the intrenchments not only much stronger than had been represented and the breastwork at least eight or nine feet high but likewise the ground before it covered with felled trees the branches pointed outward which so fatigued and retarded the advancing of the troops that notwithstanding all their intrepidity and bravery which i cannot too much commend we sustained so considerable a loss without any prospect of better success that it was no longer prudent to remain before it and it was therefore judged necessary for the preservation of the remainder of so many brave men to prevent a total defeat that we should make the best retreat possible accordingly after several repeated attacks which lasted upwards of four hours under the most disadvantageous circumstances and with the loss of     regulars klled    missing      wounded and    provincials killed   mssing and     wounded officers of both included i retired to the camp we occupied the night before with the broken remains of several corpse sending away all the wounded to the bateaux about three miles distance and early the next morning we arrived there ourselves embarked and reached this place the evening of the  th immediately after my return here i sent the wounded officers and men that could be moved to fort edward and albany  to repair the misfortune of this bloody defeat general abercrombie detached col bradstreet with about  000 provincials against fort frontenac the colonel with great prudence and vigor surmounted great difficulties brought his army to oswego where he embarked on the lake ontario and arrived at frontenac the   th of august this fort stands at the communication of lake ontario with the river st lawrence the entrance into which river it in some manner commands however for a post of such moment it was poorly fortified and poorly garrisoned it was taken without the loss of a man on our side  colonel bradstreets letter to general amherst on the reduction of fort frontenac oswego aug         i landed with the troops within a mile of fort frontenac without opposition the   th the garrison surrendered prisoners of war the   th between   and   in the morning  it was a square fort of  00 yards the exterior side and had in it   0 men some women children and indians  0 pieces of cannon half of which were mounted sixteen small mortars with an immense quantity of provisions and goods to be sent to the troops gone to oppose brig genesis forbes their western garrisons indians and to support the army under the command of m levy on his intended enterprise against the mohawk river valued by the french at  00000 livres  we have likewise taken   vessels from   to    guns which are all they have upon the lake two of which i have brought here one richly laden and the rest and the provisions i have burnt and destroyed together with the fort artillery stores etc agreeable to your excellencys instructions should i succeed the garrison made no scruple of saying that their troops to the southward and western garrisons will suffer greatly if not entirely starve for want of the provisions and vessels we have destroyed as they have not any left to bring them home from niagara  the terms on which the garrison surrendered were prisoners of war until exchanged for equal numbers and rank   it is very possible that the success of col bradstreet greatly facilitated that of the expedition under genesis forbes the general had had a very tedious and troublesome march through a country almost impassable very little known and continually harassed on his route by the enemies indians an advanced guard of this army consisting of about  00 men under major grant had most unaccountably advanced to fort du quesne with a design as it should seem of reducing the place by a coup de main but the garrison suddenly sallying out and attacking them warmly on all sides killed and made prisoners many of this party and dispersed the rest this was however their last success for the body of the army being conducted with greater skill and circumspection baffled all their attempts so that the french being convinced by several skirmishes that all their efforts to surprise the troops or interrupt their communication were to no purpose and being conscious that their fort was not tenable against a regular attack they wisely abandoned the place after destroying their works

upon the missisippi having been abandoned or at least not seconded by their friends the indians whom we had previously engaged to act a neutral part after thoroughly convincing them in several skirmishes that all their attempts upon our advanced posts in order to cut of our communication were vain and to no purpose so they now seem all willing and well disposed to embrace his majestys most gracious protection  give me leave therefore to congratulate you upon this important event of having expelled the french from fort du quesne and this prodigious tract of fine rich country and of having in a manner reconciled the various tribes and nations of indians inhabiting it to his majestys government  so far i had wrote you the   th but being seized with an inflammation in my stomach

in one of those channels of the river niger by which it is supposed to discharge its waters into the atlantic ocean the river niger according to the best maps rises in the east of africa and after a course of  00 miles nearly due west divides into three branches the most northerly of which is the senegal as above the middle is the gambia or gambra and the most southern rio grande senegal empties itself into the atlantic ocean in    north lat the entrance of it is guarded by several forts the principal of which is fort lewis built on an island of the same name it is a quadrangular fort with two bastions and of no inconsiderable strength at the mouth of the river is a bar the best season for passing it is from march to august or september or rather from april to july because the tides are then highest the english had formerly settlements here out of which they were driven by the french who have engrossed the whole trade from cape blanco to the river gambia which is near  00 miles the dutch were the first who settled senegal and built two forts the french made themselves masters of them in      in      the english seized them but next year the french retook them and have kept them ever since they built fort lewis in      and have beyond it a multitude of other settlements extending  00 leagues up the river the principal commodities which the french import from this settlement are that valuable article gum senega hides beeswax elephants teeth cotton gold dust negroe slaves ostrich feathers ambergris indigo and civet  at present we are obliged to buy all our gum senega of the dutch who purchase it from the french and they set what price they please on it but as the trade to africa is now open by this important acquisition the price of this valuable drug which is so much used in several of our manufactures will be much reduced  from the east indies we have this year heard nothing remarkable it does not seem that the french notwithstanding the great struggle they made to send out a strong armament under genesis lally have been in a condition to enterprise any thing it is said and probably with good foundation that the greatest part of that force was dwindled away with sickness during the voyage our naval force was exerted with spirit and effect in the mediterranean the french found that the possession of minorca could not drive us from the dominion of the mediterranean where admiral osborn gave the enemies maritime strength such blows as they must long feel and which merited him the greatest of all honors to be joined with the conquerors of louisbourg in the thanks of the representative body of their country  the coming year seems big with great events in germany the affairs of the rival powers of prussia and austria appear to be more nearly balanced than at any time since the beginning of the war this force is as great as ever and their animosity is no way lessened great steps are taken to assemble powerful armies on the rhine whilst great britain has sent out two considerable armaments one to the west indies the other to africa the success of which must go a great way toward determining the issue of the war other great preparations are also making on the part of great britain in the mean time the dutch enraged at the captures of their ships make complaints and threaten armaments the death of the princess of orange which happened at a most critical juncture adds more perplexity to affairs in that quarter if we look to the southward the clouds seem gathering there also the imminent death of the king of spain will be an event fruitful of troubles in this affair the king of sardinia the house of austria and the house of bourbon will find themselves concerned to say nothing of the maritime powers in a word the flame of war threatens to spread in every part of europe  the annual register or history of the war for the year      chap i the inclinations of the powers at war at the closing the last campaign the king of spains death apprehended condition of the king of prussia empress queen russia sweden holland france and england  whoever reflects upon the conclusion of the several campaigns since the year      will easily perceive that at the end of the last the fortune of the several powers at war seemed more nearly upon a balance than it had been at the close of any of the former the campaign was rather less bloody than that which immediately preceeded it and it was not concluded with any action of such an eclat as could greatly raise or depress the hopes of any of the contending parties all parties became more cautious because it became every day more evident that the fortune of war was not to be decided by any single stroke however considerable the prize was reserved for the player of the skilful game for the most attentive patience for the greatest depth of resources an equality of this kind seemed at last to promise europe some repose all sides might now give and receive honorable and equitable terms and peace might be settled on that footing on which it has been usually made for some time past in our part of the world but the great designs entertained by each power revenge imbittered by the blows which all had felt in their turns the consideration of the vast expenses that fell upon all and which a peace at that time would have made fruitless even the hopes arising from the equivocal appearances of the last campaign estranged every court from the disposition to peace insomuch that there were no terms directly offered by any of the belligerent power nor did any of the neutral interpose their mediation besides these another cause operated powerfully a great event was hourly expected about this time an event which threatened to involve the southern parts of europe in the calamities of that war that had so long wasted the northern and which whenever it should take place threatened to render the political system infinitely more intricate and probably to give the war quite a new turn  the late king of spain by the force of a conjugal affection rarely seen in that dignity since the death of his queen had been given up to a melancholy which preyed upon his health and affected his understanding his death or incapacity appeared inevitable within a short time the king of naples don carloss was next in the order of succession in the treaty of aix la chapelle it had been agreed that the dutchies of parma placentia and guastalla should be restored to the house of austria in case don carlos should ever come to the crown of spain these countries were at the end of that war in the hands of the empress queen or her allies her imperial majesty had set up a claim to the reversion of these dutchies on the extinction of issue male in the house of farnese but the ambition of the queen of spain to make all her children sovereigns put powerful bars in her way to it this ambition was one of the causes which made the last so general a war the peace of aix la chapelle which put a period to that war after settling these contested dutchies as an establishment for don philip second son to the king of spain provided that whenever the event which we have mentioned above should take place that is to say the accession of don carlos to the crown of spain then the kingdom of naples and sicily should pass to the infant don philip and the dutchies which formed his establishment should refer to the house of austria  the king of naples not without reason looked upon this article of the treaty of aix la chapelle as injurious to his rights accordingly he never acceded to it no method in this case could be seen which might prevent matters from coming to extremities except the situation of the empress engaged as she was with a powerful adversary who kept her forces strained to the utmost pitch she was in no condition to engage in a new war however interesting the object might be her ally france who so ineffectually assisted her in germany could not probably assist her with more effect in italy she therefore seemed to have no other part left than to acquiesce for the present and wait in silence a more favorable opportunity to assert her claims the event of the king of spains death has since happened it has produced none of these immediate effects which were apprehended and this probably proceeded from the cause which we have just now hinted a dead calm at present broods over italy but in this tranquillity and silence there are materials gathering which may in no very distant period burst in a terrible tempest over that delightful country they are very nearly the same that produced the last troubles there and may not only revive them but spread the horrors of war once more over all europe  such were the inclinations of the powers at war at the opening of this year their strength seemed also very entire in particular the resources of the king of prussia appeared astonishing after the great blows he had suffered and after the advantages he had gained but gained at so high a price he was still able to show himself the father and benefactor as well as the protector of his people in the midst of the devouring waste of such an expensive war from the funds of his oecomony he was enabled to remit the taxes to those parts of his dominions which had suffered from the russian barbarity he even advanced money to those which had suffered the most considerably  to take a nearer view of his situation we must observe that the whole kingdom of prussia still remained in the hands of the muscovites the duchy of cleves together with his other possessions on the rhine could yield him nothing they were held by the french but in these respects his situation was not worse than it had been almost from the beginning of the war he had to balance these losses the rich country of saxony which he had twice in one campaign wrested from the hands of the austrians add to this the renewal of the subsidy treaty with great britain on the advantageous terms of the former year these were undoubtedly great supports and the king seemed as entire in power and more advanced in reputation than ever  but to a more critical examination things had an aspect not quite so favorable this appearance was rather specious than entirely solid and whilst all without looked full and fair within there was a decay of substance and an hollowness that rung at the slightest touch that incomparable body of troops which at the beginning of the war had given him so great a superiority no longer existed in the same persons if his troops derived advantages from a long series of active service these advantages were equally on the side of the enemy his army had known what it is to be beaten and it is no wonder if a sort of weariness and despair began to creep upon them after such an infinite train of unrewarded fatigues when they saw that so many wonderful exploits had not yet ended the war in their favor many of his best generals had been killed in battle or died or had retired or were disgraced the hoards which he had amassed before the war by this time must have been entirely spent his dominions must have been greatly exhausted both of men and money saxony could no longer yield such supplies as formerly the indigence of the subdued inhabitants set bounds to the rapacity of the conqueror the subsidy of great britain did a great deal but it could not supply the deficiencies on this and on every other side these circumstances probably made the king of prussia more cautious and dilatory than usual  the court of vienna had as great burdens to sustain as the king of prussia and she had suffered much greater blows that power has a strength somewhat unaccountable and peculiar to herself more deficient in pecuniary funds than any other great power in europe she is better able to subsist and to do considerable things without them for by a long habit the whole state is formed to its necessities and the subject is more ready to supply free quarter and to endure military license than any other the country is abundantly fruitful in all its parts and whilst the war is carried on near home an arbitrary government operating on so extensive an object can hardly fail of such resources as must serve an austrian army which is still paid in a great measure as tacitus describes the troops of the ancient germans to have been they have a plentiful table in lieu of pay nam epulae et quanquam incompti largi tamen apparatus pro stipendio cedunt tacit de moribus germ      and indeed it must be owned that there is no sovereign who is more highly honored in his dominions or obeyed with a greater mixture of love and reverence by all his subjects than her imperial majesty so that having a very ample power very willing obedience a large territory and many men not sufficiently employed in the arts of peace it perhaps may be guessed in what manner she has been able to supply her many and great losses and to continue a war like the present better than states more abundant in money she is besides and this is a matter of no small consequence supported by the countenance the authority and the forces of the empire and she has for her allies the first and most formidable names in europe in the wars which this power carried on in the last and in this century though usually not very successful she has always been the last to desire a peace though frequently slow in her operations she makes amends by an extraordinary perseverance  this slowness could not escape general observation in the actions of the last year that the austrians did not play with sufficient spirit the great game which was in their hands after the battle of hochkirchen and the entry of the russians into the new march of brandenburgh seems hardly disputable perhaps it was that the court of vienna by an error common to many courts but particularly so to this and often fatal to it interfered too much and too minutely in the operations of the campaign  it is not impossible that the character of marshal daun himself might have had some share in this inactivity a character almost in all things the direct reverse of that of his prussian majesty he saw that the king active resolute and advantageous wasted himself even by that activity and spirit to which he owed his most brilliant successes should the austrians carry on the war in the same spirit they might suffer in the same manner without being ever able to equal much less to exceed that great monarch in a style of action peculiarly his own daun therefore by principle seems to have kept his army from coming to action in order to oppose a strength entire and recruited by a long rest to that of the king of prussia wasted by the efforts it was obliged to make incessantly and on every side his design seemed to be that the issue of the war should rather arise from the general result and concurrence of all the operations gradually producing a solid though a slow advantage than from the effects of a bold quick and masterly stroke in fact the austrians felt all the benefits and all the inconveniences which usually attend this sort of conduct a conduct which probably lost them saxony in the last campaign and which has secured them the possession of what they now hold in that country the austrians and prussians watched the time and one another and came very late to action  the court of petersburg still adhered to its old system in spite of the late ill success of her arms and all the efforts of the british minister to withdraw her from her alliance if she had some loss of men it was the least loss she could feel and she thought that whilst the war was carried on at the expense of others the reduction of so near so dreaded and so hated a rival as the king of prussia and the opportunity of the forming her troops to service and perfecting her officers were objects of consequence enough to keep her closely attached to her first sentiments  the swedes preserved likewise the same connection but they continued as before an inconsiderable and inglorious part of the war  holland preserved her neutrality but it was a neutrality little respected and indeed in itself little respectable divided in her councils attentive only to private interests she disgusted the english and neither pleased nor served the french for some of the subjects of that republic had carried on the trade of france in their bottoms which subjected them to frequent captures from the english men of war and privateers this prodoced loud complaints in holland and warm remonstrances to the court of london these complaints met with little attention being in many respects but indifferently founded the affair was drawn out in length until the dispute was extinguished by the destruction of its object some of the french colonies were reduced and the trade in the others grown too small and too hazardous to be continued longer with any hope of advantage  the affairs of france and england were partly connected with the general system and partly distinct and independent france perceived that the strength of the english and the exertion of that strength increased continually in america she knew from the natural inferiority of her colonies and the feeble state of her navy that she could not in reason hope for great success in that quarter for which reason although she sent a fleet under mons bmpart into the west indies and some men of war with as many store and transport ships as she could steal out of the river st lawrence her great efforts were to be made in europe she had two objects the recovery of hanover and the invasion of these islands in either of which if she succeeded there could be no doubt but that it would prove a sufficient balance for all that she had suffered or had to apprehend in any other part of the world  with regard to the first object though it was difficult to attain it and though if it should be attained it did not promise to answer her purposes so well as the latter yet it was upon that she chiefly depended hitherto indeed the success which france had in germany was not at all proportioned to the prodigious efforts which she made she began to find herself much exhausted the wants of the french obliged them to pay little respect to neutral or even to friendly powers so that the esteem and assistance which they had in germany diminished continually they eat up the country and seized on such towns as were convenient to them without any ceremony yet freed from all these restraints their army had made very little progress their generals had not displayed any great abilities and their army in itself very badly composed was deficient in discipline to a degree which is scarcely credible they kept neither guards nor posts nor sentinels a great part of their troops wandered from the camp into the neighboring towns and retuned drunk their councils of war were held in a tumultuous and disorderly manner and all their designs were perfectly known in the camp of the allies where a very different picture was exhibited with regard to regularity and caution  the french troops have several essential defects in their constitution which prevent them from equalling those of germany and other nations several regiments are in a manner hereditary in great families who placed at their first outset at a very high point of military rank think it unnecessary to attain the qualifications which lead others to it step by step as to the rest of the officers as their pay is small and their hopes little few study the art military as a profession they serve because it is the fashion to do so and that it is thought necessary to be a gentleman thus they dispatch their business as a disagreeable task and having little to lose in the service it is almost impossible to preserve a due subordination the common mn are little more than abject vassals and therefore want that high spirit which in their gentry makes some amends for the want of knowledge and assiduity and as they are corrupted by the example of their superiors so by their negligence they are left without any restraint the officers do not choose to incur the ill will of their men or to give themselves trouble by exercising that wholesome severity in which the health and vigor of military discipline consist  the german common people are indeed in a still lower state of vassalage than the french and might therefore be supposed naturally no better soldiers but their bodies are more robust and hardy their treatment is severe and rigorous their subordination is most exact which makes their discipline perfect and germany is so habituated to war that all the people may be said to be born soldiers these things give the germans a great superiority over the french a superiority which was more visible in this than in any former war  these defects in their army were increased by the low state of their finances which caused their troops to be very ill paid the french court made some attempts to keep up their credit by changing their former methods of raising money mr silhoute was made comptroller of the finances and the farmers general were removed from their former employment of finding the supplies new methods were divised which might stave off the entire ruin of their finances until their armies in germany could strike some effectual blow or their project of an invasion which quieted the minds of the people in some degree should be put in execution  with regard to the latter project france had formerly found that the bare report of such a design had served many material purposes but in england things had since then been greatly changed the threats of an invasion increased our internal strength without raising any apprehensions they in a great measure executed the militia act which hardly any thing else could have put in execution they increased the regular troops both in their number and their species england for the first time saw light horse and light foot there reigned in both houses the most perfect and unprecedented union among the great men there was no difference that could in the least affect the conduct of the war the dispute concerning the preference of the continental and the marine system was entirely silenced because a system took place which comprehended both and operated in both as fully as the warmest advocates of either could desire never did england keep a greater number of land forces on foot on the continent of europe in england in america when she turned all her power to her land forces only never did she cover the seas with such formidable fleets when her navy alone engaged her attention such is the effect when power and patriotism unite when liberty and order kiss and when a nation sits with a happy security under the shade of abilities which she has tried and virtues in which she dares to confide  chap ii the allied army moves successful skirmishes on the side of the allies battle of bergen prince ferdinand retirs to windeken plan of the campaign general wobersnows expedition into poland prince henrys into bohemia and franconia general macguire defeated bamberg pillaged prince henry returns to saxony hesse abandoned by the allies  the seizing of francfort in the last year by a most flagrant violation of the liberties of the empire had given the french and their allies the most material advantage they had acquired in the campaign for it secured to them the course of the maine and the rhine and made it easy to them to receive every kind of reinforcement and supply it secured likewise that communication between them the imperial and the austrian armies and formed that chain from which they derived no small benefit of mutual succor and concurrence in their operations much depended upon their being dislodged from that post as well with regard to the fortune of his britannic majestys army as to that of the king of prussia such a stroke must necessarily have the greatest influence on the events of the whole ensuing campaign prince ferdinand sensible of this as soon as the season permitted him to enter upon action drew his troops out of their cantonments and at the head of thirty thousand men prepared to dislodge them before they could receive the supplies of which they were in daily expectation the rest of his army consisting of about ten or twelve thousand men were left to guard the electorate and to watch the bishopric of munster some detachments of hanoverians and prussians had in the latter end of february driven the imperialists and austrians from the posts which they occupied at erfurth and eisinach and some places in the country of hesse this drew a strong body of the enemy into that part which pushed them back but the hereditary prince of brunswick who led the army of the allies through ways before deemed impassable to an army defeated them in some severe skirmishes several places of importance were taken several whole battalions were made prisoners with their officers the french alarmed at the vivacity of this beginning judged it but the prelude to something more decisive accordingly the duke of broglio took an advantageous post near bergen at a village between francfort and hanau which it was necessary the allies should master before they could penetrate to his line this place he had made his right and secured his flanks and center in such a manner that the attack could only be made at that village  in this disposition was the french army when the allies approached they formed themselves under an eminence and began the attack on the village of bergen between nine and ten in the morning with great intrepidity they were received with a very severe fire which the enemy had prepared for them they made three attacks in the space of about two hours and were every time repulsed  prince ferdinand now observed that the enemy still kept a good countenance in their post and that his own troops began to fall into some disorder this able general who never risques his fortune on a single throw began to think of a retreat whilst his loss was yet inconsiderable and the disorder of his men easily to be repaired but a retreat in the face of a victorious enemy was hazardous and the day was not yet above half spent in this exigence he made such movements as strongly indicated a design of falling once more upon the village in the enemys right and of making at the same time a new attack upon their left these appearances were farther countenanced by a cannonode on both these posts supported with an uncommon fury the french deceived by these maneuvers kept close in their posts they expected a new and a lively attack every moment they returned the cannonade as briskly as they could and in this posture things continued until night came on when the prince made an easy retreat without disorder or molestation and halted at windeken  in this action the loss of the allies was about two thousand in every way that of the french was by no means less considerable the allies indeed suffered nothing in their reputation their countenance through the whole action having been excellent prince ferdinand gained as much honor and displayed as much skill as could have been obtained or shown upon a more fortunate occasion the event however was in its consequences far from indifferent for the allies having missed this blow the french still kept francfort and all advantages which they drew from that situation they had time and means to receive their reinforcements and they acquired in a short space such a superiority as obliged prince ferdinand to content himself with acting on the defensive for a long time after  the advantages which would have arisen from another issue of that battle appeared more fully from the operations which were carrying on the side of bohemia and which probably were designed to concur with those of the prince in some grand and comprehensive scheme there is no doubt that the army of the allies and those of his prussian majesty had determined to act in concert and had settled some plan for that purpose and though it should not be discovered with equal certainty what that plan was it may not however be unpleasant to trace it as far at least as a reasonable conjecture guided by the lights derived from the tendency of each operation may lead us for if we succeed at all in such an attempt it diffuses at wonderful clearness over the whole narrative  it is not impossible then that it was designed in the first place to keep the russians at a distance until the latter end of the summer by the destruction of their magazines in poland that on the other side prince ferdinand should attempt to drive the french toward the rhine and to get between them and the army of the empire which having thus lost its communication with the french prince henry should rush out of saxony and fall upon them in bohemia and franconia and cut off also their communication with the great body of the austrians then the imperialists would find themselves situated between two hostile and superior armies whilst in bohemia marshal daun would be either obliged to try his fortune single handed with the king of prussia or totally to abandon that kingdom into which it was in the power of the prussians to enter in opposite parts at once  the first part of this plan was executed with great spirit and success so early as the   d of february the prussian general wobersnow marched into poland from glogau in silesia with fortysix squadrons and twentynine battalions where they routed some bodies of cossacks and after having destroyed several immense magazines particularly one at posen said to be sufficient for the subsistence of fifty thousand men for three months they retured without any loss into silesia on the   th of april  as for the second act of this military drama it was executed with as great success and with some advantages more striking than the first prince henry commanded the prussian troops in saxony which the public accounts called forty thousand men he had certain intelligence that some movements which had purposely been made by the king of prussia had drawn the greatest part of the austrian troops which had been posted as a watch upon saxony toward the frontiers of silesia he immediately took advadtage of this opening and entered bohemia in two columns one marched toward peterswade first penetrated as far as loboschutz and leitmeritz the enemy flying before them and every where abandoning or burning the vast magazines which they had amassed in all those parts  the body under general hulsen did as much service and it had a more active employment the pass of pasberg strong in itself was defended by a considerable body of austrians general hulsen having conducted his cavalry by another way so as to fall directly on their rear attacked them with his infantry in front and drove them out of all their intrenchments one general fiftyone officers and no less than two thousand private men were made prisoners on this occasion  after this fatiguing expedition the prince gave his troops a few days to rest and then led them once more to action he directed his march through the voigtland toward the army of the empire they entered franconia by the way of hoff they attacked general macguire who commanded a body of austrians and imperialists here they were bravely resisted for the whole day but the numbers and spirit of the prussians prevailing macguire gladly took advantage of the night to make a retreat having lost about five hundred men a few skirmishes more decided the fate of franconia the army of the empire retreated as the prussians advanced and abandoned the rich bishoprics of bamberg and wurtzburg to contribution the town of bamberg surrendered upon terms that part of the plan which prince ferdinand was to have executed had ailed it was impossible on one hand to hinder the french army from succouring that of the empire or on the other to prevent a body of austrians from availing themselves of his absence to penetrate into saxony in these circumstances any farther stay in franconia was useless and might be dangerous his army loaded with booty and contribution returned to their old situation the austrians retired into bohemia at their approach  appearances were hitherto favorable enough to the prussians however none of the great ends proposed by the general plan were fully answered the russians notwithstanding the destruction of their magazines continued their march toward silesia count dohna who had raised great contributions and levies in the duchy of mecklenburg was preparing to oppose them on the side of brandenburgh other parties under other commanders were posted at those places where their irruption was the most apprehended the approach of this army brought things nearer and nearer to a crisis the eyes of all europe were fixed with anxiety and expectation on their progress it appeared the more formidable because the progress of the french arms was very rapid after the battle of bergen  prince ferdinand finding that another attack was not advisable retreated continually the french possessed themselves of hesse without opposition they met as little in making their way through the bishopric of paderborn and whilst their grand army under marshal de contades pushed the allies in that quarter and on the side of hesse m darmentieres was posted by wesel to advance on that side as occasion should require the condition of the allied army was extremely dubious whilst the french increased in their numbers and spirit their new success gave them reason to hope for a campaign as fortunate as that of       chap iii expedition to the west indies under hopsen and moore account of martinico failure there the causes of it guadaloupe invaded description of that island basse terre attacked and burned genesis hopson dies operations against grand terre several passes forced the inhabitants capitulate bravery of a french lady marygalante taken  great britain was not content with the efforts which she had made in germany america the interests of which had given rise to the war was the object which principally engaged her attention this was indeed the proper object of her natural strength and by her success in this quarter she most effectually laid the axe to the root of the enemys naval power and cut away one great part of the resources which fed the war a squadron of nine ships of the line  their first object was martinico the first in reputation of the french caribbees the seat of government the center of all the trade which france carries on with those islands strong both by nature and art this island lies in the   th degree n lat the shore is on every side indented with very deep bays which they call cul de sacs and the sands only discoverable at low water form in many places a hidden and almost insurmountable barrier a lofty ridge of almost impassable mountains runs north west and south east quite through the island all the space on both sides is intersected at inconsiderable distances with deep gullies through which the water pours down in the rainy seasons with great impetuosity in other respects the island is pleasant and fruitful well watered and well cultivated abounding with plantations and villages all along the sea coast the two principal places are st pierre and port royal both town considerable in this part of the world for their magnitude trade and strength  by this short description may be discerned how desirable such a conquest was and the difficulties which naturally opposed themselves to it they were the greater because at this time there was in the island a considerable number of regular troops they have at all times a numerous and well armed militia not contemptible for their discipline and well suited to the service of the country add to this that they can bring into the field a large body of negroes habituated to arms and in general well affected to the interests of their masters  the english forces landed without opposition on the west side of port royal harbor aften the men  very little was done at port royal but it was hoped that more would be done at st pierre they accordingly set sail for that place but when they had arrived before it and examined the coast resolved not to return with the disgrace of having done nothing worthy of the greatness of the armament and the expectation of their country they considered that the island of guadaloupe was an object though not of such an eclat of full as much real consequence as martinico and they knew that it was neither so strong in troops or fortifications their first failure might lead to an advantage as considerable as that which they had missed in pursuance of these resolutions they set sail for guadaloupe  the island is called guadaloupe from a resemblance which it bears to a chain of mountains of the same name in old spain to speak with exactness guadaloupe is rather to be considered as two islands divided from each other by a small arm of the sea or salt water river not above three hundred feet over where it is widest one of these islands is called the grand terre the other more particularly and by distinction guadaloupe they are together in a circle about ninety leagues the first is nearly destitute of fresh water and not perfectly cultivated but it is otherwise with guadaloupe no part of the world is furnished with more or better no less than fifty rivers in that small circuit throw themselves into the sea many navigable by boats for two some even for three leagues into the country not to mention the numberless springs which rise among the rocks and after a thousand beautiful meanders lose themselves in the larger streams the first accounts which we have of that country are lavish in the description of its beauties and the latest agree with them that no part of the west indies perhaps of the world affords more agreeable and romantic scenes it is full of high mountains one of which towers far above the rest and is a volcano continually emitting smoke and fire from hence they have considerable quantities of sulphur they have also hot baths fit for all the medicinal purposes in which such waters are used the land in the valleys is extremely fertile it produces the usual west india commodities sugar indigo coffee cotton and ginger the mountains abound with game so that there is nothing in the island wanting for the convenience and delight of life in an air more temperate and salubrious than is commonly breathed between the tropics  the french began to plant colonies in this island as early as the year      but for a long time this together with all their other colonies continued in a languishing condition it was in the beginning of the present century that they began to emerge after the peace of utrecht had given france time to breathe she turned her attention strongly to these islands guadaloupe partook however less of this care than martinico and yet by its natural advantages it does not fall short of that island neither in the quantity or the goodness of its produce if it does not greatly exceed it in both as it certainly does in its capacity to receive all sorts of improvement the importance of this island until its late conquest was very little known in england the reason was this by an old regulation the people of guadaloupe were forbid to trade directly with europe but were obliged to send all their produce to martinico from whence they had all their european commodities a strange regulation to be continued in an age so enlightened as this by a nation so enlightened as france  the english made attempts upon this island in      and   0  but they were neither powerful enough nor conducted with sufficient ability to produce any permanent effect the troops wasted the country and retired with their booty but on the occasion of which we are going to speak they were more able strong and fortunate  on the   d of january the fleet came before the town of basse terre the capital of the island a place of considerable extent large trade and defended by a strong fortress this fortress in the opinion of the chief engineer was not to be reduced by the shipping but commodore moore notwithstanding this opinion brought four men of war to bear upon the citadel the rest were disposed against the town and the batteries which obstructed the landing about nine in the morning a fire from all sides began which continued with the utmost fury until night when the citadel and all the batteries were effectually silenced during this cannonade the bombs that were continually showered upon the town set it on fire in several places it burned without interruption the whole of this and the following day when it was almost totally reduced to ashes the loss was prodigious from the number of warehouses in the town full of rich but combustible materials nothing could be more striking than the horror of the spectacle from the mutual and unremitted fire of so many great ships and batteries heightened with a long line of flames which extended along the shore and formed the back ground of this terrible picture  in this lively engagement our loss was very inconsiderable the next day the forces landed without opposition  general hopson died on the   th of february and general barrington succeeded him he embarked part of his forces for the grand terre where colonel crump attacked and reduced the towns of st anne and st francois whilst this attack diverted the enemys attention the general fell upon the strong post of gosier and possessed himself of it and thus the grand terre was in a manner reduced and disabled from sending any relief to the other part  there is a considerable mountain not far from the town of basse terre called dos dasne or the asses back thither a great part of the enemy had retired it is a post of great strength and great importance as it keeps a watch upon the town and at the same time forms the only communication there is between that town and the capes terre the plainest pleasantest and most fruitful part of the whole island it was not judged practicable to break into it by this way and all the rest of guadaloupe was in the enemys possession therefore a plan was formed for another operation by which it was proposed to surprise petit bourg goyave and st marys and by that way to march into capes terre which might be easily reduced but this design failing it was necessary to attempt those places by main force col clavering and col crump landed near arnonville and attacked the enemy strongly entrenched at a post strong by nature called le corn this was forced another intrenchment at petit bourg had the same fate a third near st marys yielded in the same manner an opening being at last made into the capes terre the inhabitants saw that the best part of the country was on the point of being given up to fire and sword they came in and capitulated their possessions  three small islands near guadaloupe deseada santos and petite terre  this capitulation was hardly signed when the french squadron under m bompart appeared before the island and landed at st annes in the grand terre the general of the french caribbees with six hundred regular troops two thousand buccaneers and a large quantity of arms and ammunition the capitulation was made at the most critical time for had this reinforcement arrived but a day sooner the whole expedition had probably been lost  thus came into the possession of great britain this valuable island after a campaign of near three months in which the english troops behaved with a firmness courage and perseverance that ought never to be forgotten intolerable heat continual fatigue the air of an unaccustomed climate a country full of lofty mountains and steep precipices posts strong by nature and by art defended by men who fought for every thing that was dear to them all these difficulties only increased the ardour of our forces who thought nothing impossible under commanders who were not more distinguished for their intrepidity and skill than their zeal for the service of their country and the perfect harmony and good understanding that subsisted between them there is nothing perhaps so necessary to inspire confidence into the soldier as to observe that the officers have a perfect confidence in one another a  it must not be omitted that many of the inhabitants exerted themselves very gallantly in the defense of their country a woman a considerable planter in the island particularly distinguished herself she was called madam ducharmey this amazon put herself at the head of her servants and slaves and acquitted herself in a manner not inferior to the bravest men  a the hon genesis barringtons letter to the right hon mr secretary pit particularising his proceedings at guadaloupe may        in my last letter of the  th of march i had the honor to acquaint you that the troops under my command at guadaloupe except the garrison of fort royal were all embarked with their baggage etc without the loss of a man the fleet sailed the next morning for fort louis but from the very great difficulty of turning to windward were not able to reach it till the   th at four in the afternoon when all the ships of war but only    of the transports came to an anchor the others were either driven much to leeward or prevented by the winds and strong currents from weathering the point of saints  i went on shore at fort louis that evening to see the fort and the works carrying on by the detachment that had already been sent thither from basseterre  on the   th i went in a boat to reconnoitre the two coasts of this bay as well the grand terre side as that of guadaloupe to find a proper place for making a descent but commodore moore having acquainted me in the evening of that day that he had received certain intelligence of a french squadron of skips of war consisting of nine sail of the line and two frigates being seen to the northward of barbados and that it was therefore necessary for him to quit this place with all the ships of war under his command and go into prince ruperts bay in the island of dominico as a situation more advantageous for the protection of basseterre and this place as well as the english islands i thought it advisable the next day to call together the general officers to consider what in our present situation was best to be done and it was determined notwithstanding the divided state of the troops by the separation of the transports the weak state of fort louis and the impossibility of supplying it with water but from the ships and the many difficulties which then appeared that it would be most for his majestys service and the honor of his arms to do the utmost to keep possession of the fort and to wait some further intelligence of the motions of the enemy  commodore moore sailed the next morning for prince ruperts bay with all the ships of war except the roebuck of  0 guns which he left as some protection to the transports  from this time to the   th i continued to direct works to be made for the security of the camp and for the finishing as well as strengthening the lines when the chief engineer who was on board one of the transports that could not before get up being arrived and having made to me a report of the weakness of the fort i thought it necessary to call a council of war to consider the state thereof and it being debated whether the fort might not be made tenable and kept as a garrison for his majestys service on a more circumscribed plan though it appeared impossible to keep it in the present extent of outposts it was determined after much consideration that from its weakness and bad construction its being commanded by several heights very contiguous to it as well as the great difficulty i may indeed say the impossibility of procuring for the present and establishing a constant supply of water and other more necessary things for the support and defense of a garrison in this part of the world not to be tenable however sir i was determined to hold it until some future event might convince me what was best to be done for his majestys service  i reflected on the state of the army under my command and of the little probability there was of succeeding in any attempt of reducing the country by the troops i had without the assistance of the ships of war to cover them in landing but however i determined to make a descent on the coast of grand terre and for that purpose i ordered col crump with a detachment consisting of  00 men to go in some of the transports that carried most guns and endeavor to land between the towns of st anne and st francois and destroy the batteries and cannon which was happily executed with very little loss  as i imagined by my sending col crump to attack the towns of st anne and st francois the enemy would be obliged to detach some of their troops from the post of gosier i ordered two days after he sailed the only  00 men i had left to be put on board transports and lie off that town and in the morning of the   th i went to reconnoitre the battery and intrenchments and perceiving that the enemy appeared less numerous than for some time before i made a disposition for forcing them by two different attacks this was executed the next morning at sunrising with great spirit and resolution by the troops and notwithstanding the fire of the enemy from their intrenchments and battery both were soon carried with little loss and the enemy drove into the woods the troops immediately destroyed the cannon and battery with the town  this being happily effected i ordered the detachment to force its way to fort louis and at the same time sent orders for the garrison to make two sallies one to the right in order to put the enemy between two fires and the other to attack their lines as i knew that which i had just made would oblige them to send troops to oppose our passage on that side the first was made but the latter by some mistake was not executed which had it been done we must have inevitably been in possession of their lines the detachment from gosier forced their passage with some loss notwithstanding a very strong pass that the enemy were possessed of and took possession of a battery of three   pounders which would the next day have played upon our camp  governor desbrisay whom i had left at fort royal in basseterre having been killed by the blowing up of some cartridges that took fire from the wadding of a   pounder that was discharged from the upper bastion of fort royal at a body of the enemy on the   d of march i appointed major melvill who commanded the detachment of the   th regiment from the leeward islands to be governor in his room major trollone a lieut of the   d regiment and two private men were likewise killed by this accident and a capt another lieut and   men wounded and the parapet of that bastion levelled with the ground by the explosion  at the same time that i was acquainted with this accident i was told that the enemy had erected a bombbattery and thrown several shells into the fort and that they had for some time past been working as the garrison suspected upon another battery i therefore ordered governor melvill to cause a sortie sally to be made from the garrison in order to destroy it accordingly a detachment of  00 men sallied out under the command of capt blomer on the  st of april and without much difficulty forced the enemys intrenchments and got into the work which proved to be a battery of one   pounder and one    nearly completed our people spiked the guns and returned to the garrison with the loss of only six men killed and six wounded  as i thought the fort by this accident might want the assistance of the chief engineer i sent him thither immediately as well as the commanding officer of the artillery that no time might be lost in putting it again in a proper state of defense  the remaining part of the transports with the troops being now arrived nine having come on the   d of march and the others by one or two in a day as i had long intended so soon as it was in my power to make an attack on the gaudaloupe side as the enemy had there some posts of infinite consequence i formed upon the information of some negroes who promised to conduct the troops in flatbottom boats by night a design of surprising petit bourg guoyave and st maries at the same time the first was to be effected by brig crump who the moment he had made himself master of it was to march to bay mahaut and destroy the batteries there as well as a large magazine of provisions that the enemy had collected from the dutch and to hinder any more arriving the latter under brig clavering after he had surprised st maries and guoyave was to march into the capesterre and reduce that fine country the success of this appeared not only to me but to the gentlemen who were to execute it almost infallible but the night proved so bad and the negroe conductors were so frightened that they run several of the boats on the shoals of which that coast is full so that though brig clavering did land with about  0 men yet the place was so full of mangroves and so deep in mud that he was obliged to return but not without the enemys discovering our design  this obliged me to attempt by force what could not be effected upon a safer plan but as i then was laid up in a most severe fit of the gout in my feet head and stomach i sent brigadiers clavering and crump to reconnoitre the coast near arnoville and upon their report i ordered   00 regulars and   0 of the antigua volunteers to land under the protection of the woolwich man of war what happened afterward you will see by the following letter which i received at petit bourg from brig clavering on the   th of april  at m poyens capesterre gaudaloupe april         sir on thursday the   th of april at daybreak i landed with the troops which you put under my orders consisting of   00 men exclusive of the antigua volunteers at a bay not far distant from arnoville the enemy made no opposition to our landing but retired as our troops advanced to very strong intrenchments behind the river le corn this post was to them of the greatest importance as it covered the whole country to the bay mahaut where the provisions and supplies of all sorts were landed from st eustatia and therefore they had very early taken possession of it and had spared no pains to strengthen it though the situation was such as required very little assistance from art the river was only accessible at two narrow passes on account of a morass covered with mangroves and those places they had occupied with a redoubt and well pallisaded intrenchments defended with cannon and all the militia of that part of the country we could only approach them in a very contracted front which was at least reduced to the breadth of the roads intersected with deep and wide ditches our artillery which consisted of four field pieces and two hawbitzers were ordered to keep a constant fire on the top of the intrenchments to cover the attack made by duroures regiment and the highlanders who on this occasion behaved with the greatest coolness and resolution keeping up as they advanced a regular platoon firing this behavior so intimidated the enemy that they abandoned the first intrenchment on the left into which the highlanders threw themselves sword in hand and pursued the enemy with part of duroures regiment into the redoubt  the enemy still kept their ground at their intrenchments on the right from whence they annoyed our people very much both with musquetry and cannon and though those who had carried the first intrenchments had got into their rear yet till a bridge could be made to pass the river they could not get round to attack this post this took us up near half an hour but however we got up time enough to take near  0 of the enemy prisoners as they were endeavoring to make their escape amongst whom were some of the most considerable inhabitants of the island  we found in both the intrenchments six pieces of cannon our loss was one officer and    men killed and two officers and    men wounded  so soon as the ditches could be filled up for the passage of the artillery we proceeded on our march toward petit bourg a considerable number of the enemy had lined an intrenchment about half a mile on the left of the road but when they perceived we were endeavoring to surround them they abandoned it keeping always about  00 yards in our front setting fire to the sugarcanes which obliged us more than once to leave the road to avoid any accident to our powder  the troops arrived late on the banks of the river lezard behind which at the only ford the enemy had thrown up very strong intrenchments protected with four pieces of cannon on the hill behind them  having reconnoitred the side of the river and finding it might cost us very dear to force the passage at the ford i therefore kept up their attention all the night by firing into their lines during which time i got two canoes conveyed about a mile and a half down the river where being launched we ferryed over before break of day in the morning a sufficient number of men to attack them in flank whilst we should do the same in front the enemy soon perceived their danger and left their intrenchments with the greatest precipitation  thus we passed without the loss of a man still pursuing them to petit bourg which place they had fortified with lines and a redoubt filled with cannon  we found capt uvedale there in the granada bomb throwing shells into the fort the enemy did not remain in it long when they saw our intention of occupying the heights round them but left us masters of that and the port with all the cannon round the place  we halted here the   th to get provisions for the troops  on the   th at day break brig crump was detached with  00 men to the bay mahaut and at the same time capt steel with  00 to guoyave about   miles in our front to destroy a battery there the panick of the enemy was such that they only discharged their cannon at him and abandoned a post that might have been defended against an army he nailed up   pieces of cannon and returned the same evening to petit bourg brig crump returned likewise the next day with his detachment from the bay mahaut where he found the town and batteries abandoned these he burnt with an immense quantity of provisions that had been landed there by the dutch and reduced the whole country as far as petit bourg  the heavy rains on the succeeding days had so swelled the rivers that it was impossible for the troops to advance however this delay gave us an opportunity of strengthening the post a petit bourg  on the   th in the evening the antigua volunteers took possession again of guoyave they were supported early the next morning by a detachment commanded by lieut col barlow who had orders to repair the road for the passage of the cannon  on the  0th after leavin   0 men to guard petit bourg the remaining part of the detachment with the cannon moved on to guoyave in order to proceed afterward to st maries where we were informed the enemy were collecting their whole force to oppose us and had likewise thrown up intrenchments and made barricadoes on the road to prevent our approach to it we were not long before we perceived them but at the same time we found as well by our own observation as by the information of the guides that it was not impossible to get into their rear by roads the enemy thought impracticable and consequently had guarded with very little care  a detachment was immediately formed under col barlow for this service and orders were sent to hasten the march of the artillery which from the badness of the roads had not been able to get up the first shot from our cannon placed very near their intrenchment with the alarm that was given by our detachment in the rear made the enemy very soon sensible of the dangerous situation they were in and indeed their precipitate flight only saved them from being all taken prisoners  we pursued them as far as the heights of st maries where we again formed our men for a fresh attack on the lines and batteries there  whilst the barricadoes were levelling for the artillery we attempted a second time to pass the woods and precipices that covered the flanks of the enemys lines but before we could get up our cannon they perceived our movement and began to quit their lines to oppose it which made us resolve without any further delay to attack them immediately in front and it was accordingly executed with the greatest vivacity notwithstanding the constant firing of both their cannon and musquetry they abandoned here all their artillery and went off in so much confusion that they never afterward appeared before us  we took up our quarters at st maries that night and the next day entered the capesterre which is the richest and most beautiful part of this or any other country in the west indies eight hundred and seventy negroes belonging to one man only surrendered this day  here mess de glainvilliers and duqueruy deputed by the principal inhabitants of the island met me to know the terms you would grant them and as i accompanied them to petit bourg the next day and there presented them to you it is not necessary for me to mention any transaction since that time  i cannot however conclude without doing justice to those to whose merit is due the success that has attended the kings arms on this occasion i mean the spirit and constancy of the troops to brig crump without whose concurrence i never undertook any thing but chiefly to yourself sir who planned the whole enterprise and who furnished me with all these means without which neither bravery or prudence can little avail  i have the honor to be etc j clavering   the hon general barringtons letter to the right hon mr secretary pit dated head quarters in the capesterre guadaloupe may        i have the satisfaction to inform you that by great perseverance and changing entirely the nature of the war by carrying it on by detachments i have at length made myself master of guadaloupe and grand terre this is a work sir that i believe the most sanguine considering our total separation from the fleet could not expect to have been performed by so small a body of men  i shall not in this trouble you with a detail as i have done myself the honor of sending it to you in my other letter i shall only say in general that the great good conduct and zeal of brigadiers clavering and crump and the bravery of the troops got the better of every obstacle forced the enemy in all their intrenchments and strong passes took  0 pieces of cannon and advanced as far as the capesterre the only remaining unreduced part of the country this at last brought the enemy to terms my situation was such that it was absolutely necessary that what was done should not be procrastinated as i was determined to grant no truce for time enough for the inhabitants to recover from their fears mr moore was absent the thing pressed and some resolution was to be taken immediately that which i took was according to the best of my understanding and i hope sir you will approve of it  i believe sir the infinite consequence and value of guadaloupe and grand terre is not perfectly known in england as if i am rightly informed there is more ugar grown here than in all the leeward islands put together besides great quantities of cotton and coffee the country especially the capesterre the finest i ever saw watered with good rivers every mile or two and a port belonging to it where all the navy of england may ride safe from hurricanes all this can be explained much better than i can by letter by brig clavering whose infinite zeal for his majestys service and talents as a soldier i hope will recommend him to protection such men are rare and i think i may venture to assure you there are few things in our profession that he is not equal to if it should be thought fit to honor him with the execution of any future commands  i have appointed col crump to the government who since governor haldane left us i have made act as brigadier his merit is very great both as a soldier and a man of judgment he is of this part of the world understands the trade customs and genius of the people and as he thinks nobly and desinterestedly he would not have accepted of the government but in hopes of advancing himself in the army by that means i cannot say how very useful and how much our successes are owing to his good conduct and great zeal  as i have now nothing to fear from the land i am repairing as well as i can fort louis and fortifying the isle of cochon for the greater security of the harbor the poor people here are in a miserable condition but i shall do every thing in my power to procure them the things they want  i have the honor to send you enclosed the capitulation of the governor as well as that of the inhabitants the latter have behaved in all their dealings with great candor and it is a justice i owe them to acquaint you with it  it has not as yet been possible for me to go round ths island to see the different posts that must be occupied i therefore cannot yet determine the exact number of troops that will be necessary to be left for their defense  the great assistance i have received from capt lynn of his majestys ship the oebuck in the different services i have been carrying on for the reduction of these islands ought not to be forgot by me as well as his first lieutenant mr keating both whom i beg leave to recommend to your favor  i find it is impossible from the different parts of the islands where they are to be received for me to procure a return of the artillery and stores which have been delivered up in consequence of the capitulation to send by this opportunity but i hope to be able to have the honor of sending it very soon  i cannot help congratulating myself that i had just signed the capitulation with the inhabitants of the grand terre when a messenger arrived in their camp to acquaint them that m beauharnois the general of these islands had landed at st annes on the windward part of that island with a reinforcement from martinico of  00 regulars  000 buccaneers and  000 stand of spare arms for the inhabitants with artillery and mortars under the convoy of m bomparts squadron this support had it arrived there an hour sooner must have made the conquest of that island very difficult if not impossible as soon as he heard the capitulation was signed he reimbarked again  commodore moores letter to the right hon mr secretary pit dated cambridge in prince ruperts bay dominique may         by the griffin which arrived here on   th of april i was honored with your letter signifying his majestys most gracious approbation of my conduct and of the behavior of those under my command which i took the liberty to communicate to those gentlemen and give me leave to say sir nothing can contribute so much to our happiness as being honored with and executing orders to the honor of his majestys arms  give me leave sir to congratulate you on the capitulation of the island of guadaloupe and grand terre which major genesis barrington sends to you by this express in gaining which great honor is due to the troops the strong hold the enemy had could not be conquered but by great conduct and resolution  i hope the conquest will prove as great an acquisition as it appears to me  it is with great pleasure i think i may say sir that on this expedition great unanimity has been kept up between the two corpse as well in obedience to his majestys commands as from our own inclinations it has ever been my wish to have such harmony subsist and i flatter myself i have always succeeded  i beg leave to acquaint you sir that on the  d inst being informed the french squadron under the command of m bompart was to windward of marigalante i put to sea in the night and endeavored to get up with them but after beating five days and having gained very little two of our cruizers that i had sent different ways to watch the enemys motions saw them the  th inst return betwixt the two islands into fort royal from the almost constant lee currents it being very difficult for ships to get to windward it must always be in the enemys choice whether they will come to a general action or not their squadron consists of nine sail of the line and three frigates  i shall in conjunction with genesis barrington give every assistance in my power to any other services  soon after the reduction of guadaloupe former island this is a small place but the conquest is of consequence as the french by this are left no footing in the leeward islands martinico is one of those to the windward these beginnings were happy omens of the success of the more important undertaking which was to be carried on in another part of america the reputation of our arms there except in the reduction of louisburg had hitherto not been very great but other commanders were now appointed and other maxims prevailed however we postpone the narrative of these very interesting events to consider those which intervened on the continent of europe in which too we are to see our arms no less distinguished and to behold england emerging from the rubbish of low principles and timid conduct once more become the pride and terror of europe and acting in a manner not unworthy the most illustrious periods of her history  chap iv progress of the french after the battle of bergen munster and other places taken

cut off his retreat to the weser to which he kept very close as he knew the infinite consequence of that communication however if the enemy sailed to compass that object all the his serene highness prince ferdinand portrait of prince ferdinand maxima res effecta timor om abesto virg l  precautions of the prince proved also ineffectual to retard the progress of their arms ritberg was surprised lipstadt was blockaded minden was taken by assault where a garrison of   00 men were made prisoners and where immense magazines fell into their hands darmentieres advanced against munster he attempted to take the place by a coup de main though foiled in his attempt with considerable loss he did not desist he drew up his cannon from wesel and after a short siege  in this general gloom that overspread the fortune of the allies the prince kept himself unmoved and attentive to his designs he did not suffer himself to be disconcerted by blows which he had probably foreseen and the ill consequences of which he knew how to prevent the body of the french army after the taking of minden had posted themselves near the city to which the right of their army extended their left was protected by a very steep hill in their front was a large morass and a rivulet covered their rear nothing could be more advantageous than this situation and whilst they continued in it nothing could be enterprised against them the army of the allies after a continued retreat began at last to advance and fixed their camp altogether as advantageously at petershagen a place about three leagues from the enemy  things were brought to that pass that nothing but a battle could hinder the french from taking winter quarters in the electorate there was no possibility of attacking them with any hope of success in the camp which they then occupied the point was to draw them from that post into the plain but the movements necessary to effect this were extremely hazardous to an inferior army in sight of the enemy the operations of prince ferdinand on this occasion displayed so penetrating and uncommon a genius such a guarded boldness such a certainty of the grounds he went upon such a perfect possession of himself that perhaps there is no instance in history of generalship so complete and finished for which reason we shall endeavor from the best lights we have to draw out at length the several parts that concurred to form this remarkable piece we could indeed wish that the authentic accounts of so very memorable an event had been more clear and explicit but we must content ourselves with the materials we have  on the   th of july prince ferdinand forsook his camp on the weser and marched toward hillen a village considerably to his right with the greatest part of his army however he took care to leave on the brink of that river a body under general wangenheim which extended to the town of thornhausen where they were entrenched and supported by a considerable artillery he had the day before detached the hereditary prince of brunswick  the french were not inattentive to these movements their generals immediately held a council of war and the result was that they gave completely into the snare that was laid for them they saw as they imagined the allied army divided and disjointed and now the happy moment presented itself for the attack of general wangenheim who they knew was not strong and who seemed at a great distance from the rest of the army so that it appeared impossible that he could be relieved this body being routed as it easily might it was obvious that they should then be able to place themselves between prince ferdinands army and the weser and cut off his communication with that river the great object at which they aimed through the whole campaign and in which was involved the certain destruction of the allies  full of these ideas they left their advantageous post and in eight columns passed the morass in their front  the allies finding the french slower than they expected began to advance and threatened the enemys center this was composed almost wholly of horse but it was the flower of their cavalry who anticipated the shock of the allies and began the engagement the brunt of the battle was almost wholly sustained by the english infantry and some corpse of hanoverians which stood the reiterated charges of so many bodies of horse the strength and glory of the french armies with a resolution steadiness and expertness in their maneuver which was never exceeded perhaps never equalled they cut to pieces or entirely routed these bodies two brigades of foot attempted to support them but they vanished before the english infantry waldegraves and kingsleys regiments distinguished themselves in a particular manner this day nor were their commanders less ditinguished the enemys horse which composed their center being entirely discomfited and their right which attacked wangenheim having made no sort of impression they thought of nothing but a retreat  at this point of time the prince sent orders to ld george sackville who commanded the whole british and several brigades of the german cavalry to advance that cavalry formed the right wing of the allies extended to the morass and if it could have charged at the instance of the enemys retreat such a shock at that time and in that situation would in all probability have left the french without an army in germany but the orders were not sufficiently precise or they were not sufficiently understood by the english commander so that there was some delay in waiting for an explanation the critical minute passed away the british cavalry lost their share in the glory of the action and the french retreated in some order favored by the spirited and welljudged efforts of the duke of broglio and the advantages which the possession of minden gave them  what is remarkable the french attributed their misfortune in this battle to the same error in their disposition which lost them the battle of blenheim that of composing their center almost wholly of cavalry without any proper support of foot  the battle was over but then it was that the effects of prince ferdinands admirable dispositions appeared in their full luster the french not having been molested by the british cavalry in their retreat had an opportunity of regaining their former advantageous post they had indeed lost the honor of the day and missed the stroke which they had meditated they had likewise lost a great number of men but all these losses and disgraces might be repaired and there seemed nothing decisive in the day of the minden it had certainly happened as it then appeared if the prince who foreseeing this and neglecting nothing which could be provided had not formed the plan of detaching away the hereditary prince in the manner already related at five in the morning of that day this young hero attacked a large body of the french under the duke de brisac this body though posted in a most advantageous manner he entirely defeated and obliged them to take refuge in minden the news of this blow came with an ill omen to m de contades in the instant when the english infantry began to engage his center the enemy himself could not help admiring the dexterity of the stroke under which he sunk and full of astonishment at a conduct at once so daring and judicious paid the just applause to a general who could detach with security so large a body from his army when he was going to attack an enemy already much superior to him in numbers  this happy stroke decided the affair all the passes through which the french could draw succor or provision were seized they relinquished their strong post they fled through minden and passing the weser retreated to the eastward of that river thus losing all the advantages which they had made in the campaign and forced to retreat through a country different from that through which they had advanced and in which they had taken no measures to procure subsistence  the loss of the french in this action amounted to about seven thousand men killed wounded and prisoners among whom were many officers of considerable rank the loss of the allies was not more than two thousand the english as they gained the greatest glory so they were the greatest sufferers twelve hundred of the killed and wounded were of that nation the prince on the day after the battle paid the due honors to these illustrious corpse as well as to several of the hanoverians who had behaved in the same gallant manner he did justice to the merit of the officers he distinguished their names and even particularised so low as captains to some in the most obliging manner he sent considerable presents and he omitted nothing to show that he knew what it is to be well served and how to encourage the troops and officers to do their duty with spirit and cheerfulness  although the english had the greatest share in the honor of this signal day and that the prince acknowledged their merit in the strongest terms a yet a cloud was cast over their triumph there were some expressions in the orders for the rejoicing which were supposed to convey a very severe reflection on lord g s commander in chief of the english forces the prince required with an emphasis which seemed particularly pointed that his orders by his aids de camps for the future should be more exactly obeyed in a manner still less to be misunderstood he expressed his concern that the marquis of granby had not had the command of the british cavalry had he commanded his highness made no doubt that the success of the day had been much more complete and brilliant the severe insinuation concerning the disobedience to orders and the invidious compliment to a subordinate officer were clear declarations  a prince ferdinands orders the day after the battle of minden his serene highness orders his greatest thanks to be given to the whole army for their bravery and good behavior yesterday particularly to the british infantry and two battalions of hanoverian guards to all the cavalry of the left wing and to genesis wangeinheims corpse particularly the regiment of holstein the hessian cavalry the hanoverian regiment du corpse and hamerstins the same to all the brigades of heavy artillery his serene highness declares publicly that next to god he attributes the glory of the day to the intrepidity and extraordinary good behavior of these troops which he assures them he shall retain the strongest sense of as long as he lives and if ever upon any occasion he shall be able to serve these brave troops or any of them in particular it will give him the utmost pleasure his serene highness orders his particular thanks to be likewise given to genesis sporken the duke of holstein lieutenant generals imhoff and urff his serene highness is extremely obliged to the count de buckeburg for his extraordinary care and trouble in the management of the artillery which was served with great effect likewise to the commanding officers of the several brigades of artillery viz col brown lieut col hutte major hasse and the three english captains phillips drummond and foy his serene highness thinks himself infinitely obliged to major generals waldegrave and kingsly for their great courage and good order in which they conducted their brigades his serene highness further orders it to be declared to lieut genesis the marquess of granby that he is persuaded that if he had had the good fortune to have had him at the head of the cavalry of the right wing his presence would have greatly contributed to make the decision of that day more complete and more brilliant in short his serene highness orders that those of his suite whose behavior he most admired be named as

much reason to be satisfied with their conduct and his serene highness desires and orders the generals of the army that upon all occasions when orders are brought to them by his aid de camps that they be obeyed punctually and without delay  prince ferdinand in the orders of the  d of august having omitted captain machean sent the following wrote in his own hand sir it is from a sense of your merit and a regard to justice that i do in this manner declare i have reason to be infinitely satisfied with your behavior activity and zeal which in so conspicuous a manner you made appear at the battle of thornhausen on the first of august the talents you possess in your profession did not a little contribute to render our fire superior to that of the enemy and it is to you and your brigade that i am indebted for having silenced the fire of a battery of the enemy which extremely galled the troops and particularly the british infantry  accept then sir from me the just tribute of my most perfect acknowledgments accompanied with my sincere thanks i shall be happy in every opportunity of obliging you desiring only occasions of proving it being with the most distinguished esteem  your devoted and entirely affectionate servant ferdinand  the news of a victory so glorious to our troops and of a censure so disgraceful to their commander came at once to england in proportion to the joy which filled all hearts in proportion to their opinion of the great general to whom they owed so seasonable an an advantage was their indignation against the unfortunate commander to whom it was attributed that this advantage was not greater the public as usual judged definitively upon the first charge they never pardon a general whose error it is to fall short in vain they are prayed to suspend their judgment and to wait for a full discussion the matter is already decided they have a fact against an officer and they look upon all reasoning in his favor not so much a defense of his conduct as the exertion of eloquence and artifice to palliate a neglect of duty this indeed makes the case of officers particularly hard but then it always shows them what they have to do  the merits of the matter are still regarded in the same light by the public but the heat the eagerness and curiosity of the first movements being over the matter will be heard whenever it comes to be again discussed with less attention but with less passion too it is not for us to deliver any opinion in so nice a controversy we have in points of less moment hitherto declined it and we shall always decline it until the proper judges before whom it probably will come shall have taught us what to think there is indeed no doubt that if the cavalry of the allies right wing situated as it was had been brought to act at the critical time when it had orders to move the battle of minden had proved as decisive as that of hocsted but whether it was a fault in the giving or the delivering of the orders or whether it was some misapprehension in him who received them we cannot but sincerely pity a commander of such admirable talents who by the error or the misfortune of a moment lost an opportunity that would have ranked him for ever with the marlboroughs and the brunswicks  a few days after the battle his lordship resigned his command and returned to london he was but a few days in london when he was deprived of all his military employments the marquis of granby whom the opinion of prince ferdinand and the desires of the whole army had pointed out succeeded him in his command a generous and ardent courage an affability of manners that flowed from no artifice a manly freedom and openness of soul a cheerful and unreserved conversation a munificence that knew no bounds so many qualities of the man and of the soldier endeared him to the whole army and rendered english and foreigners his inferiors his equals and his superior in command unanimous in his favor  whilst these changes were making prince ferdinand lost no time to improve his victory by the pursuit of the french who retired in the utmost distress the allies were not indeed able to overtake the main body of their army but they naraed them extremey and the french were obliged to sacifice a great part of their army piecemeal to preserve the rest entire the necessity of providing subsistence drove them toward cassel the prince pursued the marquis of granby portrait of the marquis of granby them obliged them to evacuate that place and once more freed that poor distressed country from the french tyranny the castle of ziegenhayn after an hours defense gave the allies about  00 prisoners after this the hereditary prince of brunswick  here a bound was set to the progress of the allied arms not that they were stopped by any considerable obstruction from the main body of the french in that quarter but from some effects in another quarter of the unsuccessful beginning of the campaign from which the battle of minden had not yet perfectly disengaged them munster was still behind them and still in the hands of the enemy who had a powerful garrison in that city m de contades who even after his defeat exceeded the allies in numbers and had now no further view of an offensive campaign sent a strong body under darmentieres which was reinforced by some troops from the lower rhine to near   000 men to cover that place prince ferdinand had before detached general imhoff from cassel in order to reduce it on the approach of darmentieres imhoff was obliged to raise the siege but being soon after reinforced sanguine hopes of conquest set them down just where they had begun it  the event of the battle of minden and the subsequent misfortunes of the french arms threw versailles into the utmost confusion ths news of that defeat arrived just as the king was taking horse to hunt he retired silent and dejected into the apartment of madam de pompadour and for some time saw none of his ministers the duke of broglio and m de contades mutually accused each other for the ill conduct of that day the public acquitted broglio belleisle and his general contades lost all reputation but the duke still preserved his employment and a considerable part of his influence at court  as soon as the first confusion and surprise of so unexpected an event was a little abated it was resolved to send reinforcements to their army in germany and at the same time to send thither some officer of experience and authority who might judge and compose if possible the differences which subsisted between the commanders as well as to assist in the deliberations for retrieving their affairs public misfortunes call great men from their obscurity m de etrees was chosen on this occasion and invested with an authority which he unwillingly accepted when he arrived at the french camp  whilst the french endeavor to piece up their broken fortune in germany they made some show of pushing the other part of their scheme with vigor all their ports were full of the preparations for an invasion of the british dominions men of war trasports and flatbottomed boats now almost a word of ridicule were prepared with great diligence they talked of a triple embarkation m thurot was to command a small squadron and several transports from dunkirk which it was believed were intended for scotland this man from a master of a merchant ship became a captain of a privateer in which capacity he greatly annoyed the english trade and acquired a reputation at a time when france does not abound with great men his services in this way and his daring spirit recommended him to a command in the kings service  the design against england as the voyage hither is the shortest was to be attempted from havre and some other ports of normandy in flatbottomed boats the third embarkation which was supposed against ireland was to be made from vannes in the lower brittany where a large body of troops was assembled commanded by the duke daiguillon governor of that province this embarkation was to be covered by the fleet under m de conflans which was preparing with great diligence in breast had this design been such as it was represented and had it been put into execution there is no doubt but such an attempt upon both kingdoms at three different places at once must have thrown the whole into no small confusion but excellent measures were taken on the part of england to frustrate their designs whatever they might have been  a squadron under commodore boys was stationed before dunkirk admiral rodney was sent to bombard havre which service he performed with success admiral hawke blocked up the harbor of breast with a strong squadron whilst a lesser kept a watch upon that of vannes these precautions were continued the whole summer during which time the french proceeded rather slowly but after the battle of minden had destroyed their hopes in germany they turned to this object with the greater attention what issue it had we shall relate in its proper place but their first attempts on the ocean proved as unsuccessful as their arms on land  a great fleet was equipped at toulon which some destined for america whilst others believed it was designed to unite itself with that of breast to favor the invasion admiral boscawen who commanded in the mediterranean blocked up this squadron until some unfavourable weather and the foulness of his ships obliged him to return to gibraltar to refit the french took this opportunity to sail out  they had arrived very near gibraltar before the admiral had notice of their approach but notwithstanding that our ships were not perfectly prepared to sail the admiral used such great expedition that in two hours after the account arrived the english fleet was out at sea  the english fleet was composed of fourteen ships of the line besides frigates the enemy had twelve of the line they were superior in the bulk of their ships and in the number of men if they were inferior in the number of vessels and it is the opinion of many persons of judgment that if they had formed a line of battle and fought mr boscawen in order they might very well have hoped for a better issue of this matter than they found but the evil genius of france operating on the cowardice or incapacity of their commander induced them to separate their fleet and fly the english ships were newly refitted they proved better sailors and the men animated with the spirited example of their admiral engaged the french ships as they could overtake them and they overtook some of them off cape lagos in portugal a brisk engagement ensued two of the enemys ships the ocean and the redoubtable were run on shore and burned the first was the ship of m de la clue the french admiral who escaped to land but being grievously wounded and as it is said having lost both his legs he died soon after two other capital ships the centaure and modeste were taken  the scattered remains of their fleet with difficulty got into the harbor of cadiz where they were soon after blocked up and where they still remain this action happened on the   th of august and it gave a great eclat to the british arms which in the same month had triumphed so signally both by sea and land b  b admiral boscawens letter to mr clevland secretary to the admiralty dated namure off cape st

wedel battle of cunnersdorf king of prussia repasses the oder soltikoff and daun communicate king of prussia detaches general wunsch into saxony parallel of the king of prussia and prince ferdinand of brunswick  as the king of prussias victory at rosbach had given the hanoverians an opportunity to free their country it might be expected that the affair at minden would have served to free his prussian majesty from some of the numerous armies that oppressed him but as this battle was fought in the middle of the season for action and as munster still continued in the possession of the french prince ferdinand could not venture at that time to make any detachment from his army in the kings favor without risquing all the advantages which he had obtained from his victory the king of prussia was therefore left alone to struggle with the austrians russians imperialists and swedes  the russians whose motions governed those of all the other armies left their camp at posna in poland and quitting the vistula drew near to the banks of the oder they were under the command of a russian nobleman count soltikoff count dohna who had been ordered to oppose them saw that their numbers were too considerable and their posts too strong to be attacked with any prospect of advantage so that he contented himself with observing their motions and harassing their march this conduct seemed more dilatory and timid than the circumstances or the inclinations of the king could bear he is said to have reproached that general in so severe a manner for a conduct in which he was in all probability very justifiable that he took the first opportunity to resign his command and under the pretense of recovering his health retired to berlin the king immediately put general wedel into his place with positive orders to engage the russian army at all events to enable him to obey his commands he reinforced him with several detachments from his own army the positiveness of the kings orders on this occasion may perhaps be censured but it must be owned that the time required a course next to desperate his hereditary dominions were in the utmost danger and nothing but some great and fortunate stroke could effectually prevent the junction of the austrian and russians armies an event which of all others he had the greatest reason to dread  fortified in some measure by the reinforcements he had received and in consequence of his orders genesis wedel resolved to attack the russians on their march manteuffel was wounded the prussians were obliged to retire but they were not pursued and they passed the oder without molestation the russians seized upon the towns of crossen and frankfort on the oder  the king of prussia since the beginning of the war had never hitherto obtained an advantage where he was not personally present his presence now became more necessary than ever since the action at zulichau the russians had penetrated a considerable way into his territories and had taken possession of the important city of frankfort upon the oder he therefore marched with  0000 of his best troops to join the broken army of wedel in order to drive this formidable and determined enemy from his country prince henry commanded the remainder of his army which was too well posted to fear any insult during his absence the eyes of all were fixed upon his march and his soldiers who remembered zorndorf eagerly longed to try their strength once more with the same antagonists  m daun was not unapprised of the motions of the russians or the designs of the king of prussia he knew that the great fault of the russian troops was the want of a regular and firm cavalry which might be depended upon in a day of action this defect was a principal cause of their misfortune at zorndorf in the last year a misfortune which disconcerted all the operations of that campaign as this was the only want which the russians were under so it was that which daun was best able to supply at a short warning with this view he selected about   000 of his horse and there is no better horse than that of the austrians which with about  000 foot he placed under the command of genesis laudohn one of the ablest officers in that service this body was divided into two columns one of which marched through silesia and the other through lusatia by extreme good fortune and conduct with little loss or opposition they both joined the russian army and were received with transports of joy  in the mean time the king of prussia who was unable to prevent this stroke joined general wedel at muhlrose before into saxony with nine thousand men in order to oppose the imperialists in that country with these reinforcements he was not able to raise his army to fifty thousand complete that of the russians since the junction of laudohn was upwards of ninety thousand they had besides taken a post which they had so strongly entrenched and defended with such a prodigious number of cannon that it was extremely difficult and hazardous to attempt them yet under these accumulated disadvantages it was absolutely necessary that he should fight the detachments from count dauns army already menaced berlin saxony which he was obliged to leave exposed had become a prey to the imperialists and the russians united with the austrians encamped before his eyes in silesia the best and richest part of his dominions in short his former reputation his present difficulties his future hopes every motive of honor and of safety demanded an engagement the campaign hasted to a decision and it was evident that nothing farther could be done by marches and choice of posts the sanguine temper of other generals has often obliged them to fight under disadvantages but the king of prussias circumstances were such that from the multitude of his enemies he was neither able to consult times nor situations rashness could hardly dictate any thing which in his condition would not have been recommended by prudence  when the attack was resolved the kings troops put themselves in motion at two in the morning and having formed themselves in a wood  the russian entrenchments were forced with great slaughter seventytwo pieces of cannon were taken but still there was a defile to be passed and several redoubts to be mastered which covered the village of cunnersdorf these were attacked with the same resolution and taken one after another the enemy made another stand at the village and endeavored to preserve their ground there by pushing forward several battalions of horse and foot but their resistance there proved not more effectual than it had done every where else they were driven from post to post quite to the last redoubts for upwards of six hours fortune favored the prussians who every where broke the enemy with an unparallelled slaughter they had driven them from almost all the ground which they had occupied before the battle they had taken more than half their artillery scarce any thing seemed wanting to the most complete decision  the king in those circumstances wrote a billet to the queen to this effect madam we have beat the russians from their entrenchments in two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory this news arrived at berlin just as the post was going out and the friends of the king of prussia throughout europe exulted in a certain conclusive victory mean time fortune was preparing for him a terrible reverse  the enemy defeated in almost every quarter found their left wing shattered as it was to be more entire than any other part of the army count soltikoff therefore assembled the remains of his right and gathering as many as he could from the center reinforced that wing and made a stand at a redoubt which had been erected on an advantageous eminence in a place called the jew burying ground nothing was wanting to finish matters in favor of the king but to drive the russians from this their last hope but this enterprise was difficult it is confidently said that the prussian generals were unanimous in opinion that they should not endeavor at that time to push any further the advantages they had obtained they represented to the king that the enemy was still very numerous their artillery considerable and the post which they occupied of great strength that his brave troops who had been engaged for so long a time in the severest action perhaps ever known and in one of the hottest days ever felt were too much exhausted for a new attempt an attempt of such extreme difficulty as might daunt even troops that were quite fresh that the advantage he gained would be as decisive in its consequences as that at zorndorf and whilst the enemy filled the gazettes of their party with frivolous disputes of the field of battle he would be reaping as he did then all the effects of an unquestioned victory that the enemy would be obliged to retire immediately into poland and to leave him at liberty to act in other quarters where his presence was full as necessary  these reasons were very cogent and for a few moments they seemed to ha some weight with the king but his character soon determined him to a contrary resolution he could not bear to be a conqueror by halves one effort more was alone wanting to that victory which would free him for ever from the adversary which had leaned heaviest on him during the whole war  once more he put all to the hazard his infantry still resolute and supported by their late success were readily brought to act again they drew on their bodies fainting with heat and labor to a new attack but the enterprise was beyond their strength the situation of the enemy was impregnable and their artillery which began to be superior to that of the prussians on account of the difficulty of the ground which made it impossible for the latter to bring up any other than a few small pieces repulsed these feeble battalions with a great slaughter with an astonishing perhaps with a blameable perseverance the prussian infantry was brought to a second attack and were a second time repulsed and with a loss greater than at first these efforts being unsuccessful the affair was put to the cavalry they made redoubled but useless attacks the horses were spent as well as those they carried  it was just at that time when the prussian horse was wasted by these unsuccessful efforts that the greatest part of the russian and the whole body of the austrian cavalry which had been hitherto quite inactive and which was therefore quite fresh rushed down upon them broke them to pieces forced them back upon their foot and threw the whole into irreparable disorder the whole army was seized with a panic and in a few minutes those troops so lately victorious and irresistible were totally dispersed and defeated the king did every thing to restore the field hazarding his person even beyond his former daring and prodigal of a life which he seemed to think ought not to be separated from conquest thrice he led on his troops to the charge two horses were killed under him several balls were in his clothes the efforts of skill courage and despair were made and proved ineffectual a single error outweighed them all scarcely a general hardly an inferior officer in the army was without some wound that of general seidlitz was particularly unfortunate for to that wound the failure of the horse which he commanded was principally attributed it was to the spirit and conduct of this able officer that a great part of the success at zorndorf was owing and the last campaign it is known that if it had not been for a seasonable movement of the horse the whole prussian army had then been in great danger of a defeat  the night and the prudent use of some eminences which were defended as well as circumstances would admit preserved the prussian army from total destruction however this loss was far greater than any which they had sustained from the beginning of the war all their cannon was taken the killed wounded and prisoners by the most favorable accounts were near twenty thousands general putkammer was killed on the spot these generals whose names are so distinguished in this war itzenplitz hulsen finck wedel and seidlitz were among the wounded as was the prince of wurtenburg and five major generals the enemy could not have fewer than ten thousand killed on their side for hardly ever was a more bloody battle  when the king of prussia found himself obliged to quit the field he sent another dispatch to the queen expressed in this manner remove from berlin with the royal family let the archives be carried to potzdam the town may make conditions with the enemy we should in vain attempt to draw the picture of the court and city on the receipt of such news in the midst of the joy which they indulged for that which they had received but a few hours before the terror was increased by the indistinct relation that soon followed which gave them only to understand that their army was totally routed that there was no account of the king and that a russian army was advancing to take possession of their city  the day after the battle the king of prussia repassed the oder and encamped at retwein from thence he moved to fustenwalde and placed himself in such a manner that the russians did not venture to make any attempt upon berlin he continually watched their army a part of which instead of turning toward brandenburgh marched into lusatia where it joined that of the austrians here the victorious general soltikoff for the first time met m daun and amidst rejoicings and congratulations consulted about the measures for improving their success  the russian and austrian armies thus united scarce seemed from their strength and their victories to have any other deliberation left than of what part of the prussian dominions they should take possession the king was twice defeated with a vast loss he was cut off from all communication with the army of his brother prince henry yet to the astonishment of all the world the superior the victorious and united army acted upon the defensive and were curbed in all their motions and frustrated in all their designs by the inferior the beated and divided nothing ever showed the genius of the king of prussia more fully than his conduct after the battle of cunnersdorf in a few days after so terrible a defeat every thing was in order in his camp he supplied the loss of his artillery from his stores in berlin he recalled general kleist with about five thousand men from pomerania in presence of two such armies as those of m daun and count soltikoff he detached six thousand men from his small body to the relief of saxony where the army of the empire had availed itself of his absence to reduce the whole country hall wittemberg leipsic torgau and at last dresden itself had opened their gates to the imperialists with the remainder of his troops he put himself between the russians and great glogau covered that city which was the object of the enemys designs and saw them soon after notwithstanding their two victories obliged to return again into poland and to leave him free for the rest of the campaign  what was done by the king of prussia since that time will be the subject of another chapter after we have related the proceedings of the english and french in america to which the order of time directs our present attention but we cannot dismiss the affairs of germany in which two such battles as those of minden and cunnersdorf were fought with events so different for the common cause without observing something concerning the two generals who conducted them  they are certainly in reputation the first in europe which probably never produced two greater men though they differ as much in their characters and in the kind of talents they possess as they agree in the greatness of their abilities for war the king of prussia rapid vehement impatient often gives decisive blows but he often misses his stroke and wounds himself prince ferdinand is cool deliberate exact and guarded he sees every possible advantage he takes it at the moment pursues it as far as it will go but never attempts to push it farther nothing in the man disturbs the commander in him we do not see a person who is a great soldier it is the idea of a perfect general it is a general in the abstract ferdinand suffers his temper to be guided by his business he never precipitates matters he takes them in their order and their course and trusts nothing to fortune the king on the other hand leads and even forces circumstances he does not endeavor to remove but to overleap obstacles he puts all to the risque and by suffering fortune to play her part in his designs he acquires a splendour and eclat in his actions which mere wisdom could never give him prince ferdinand is famous for never committing a fault the king of prussia is above all the world in repairing those he has committed like some of the great masters in writing when ever he makes or seems to make a mistake it is a signal to the observer to prepare for some great and admirable stroke of spirit and conduct his errors seem to be spurs to his abilities he commits an error he repairs it he errs again and again astonishes us by his manner of escaping we should often condemn the commander but that we are always forced to admire the hero  chap vi plan of the campaign in north america three expeditions ticonderoga and crown point abandoned colonel townshend killed expedition to niagara colonel prideaux killed sir william johnson defeats the french takes fort niagara consequences of this  the theater of our operations in america is of such a vast extent that if we had persevered in the course we pursued for some time in attacking but one place at once the war would inevitably be spun out to an extreme length without bringing on any thing decisive and it would have rendered our natural superiority of little use by suffering the french to collect as they had hitherto done their strength into one single point which enabled them to contend with us with a force sufficient for the service in that country this year another method was followed it was proposed to attack the french in all their strong posts at once to fall as nearly as possible at the same time upon crown points niagara and the forts to the south of lake erie whilst a great naval armament and a considerable body of land forces should attempt quebec by the river st lawrence  this plan was very advisable as it tended to weaken by distracting the resistance of the enemy and whilst we adhered to it it was clearly impossible for the french to maintain their ground in any of those places which were attacked without very weakly defending or even deserting some of the others and if by the means of such diversions any of those places should fall into our hands the campaign could not be said to be spent to no purpose but besides the end in distracting the enemys defense there was another proposed of no less consequence which was to make a concurrence in all the various operations so that whilst they divided the enemy they might mutually support one another  general amherst who commanded the american forces in chief with the most considerable body amounting in regulars and provincials to about twelve thousand men was to attack ticonderoga and crown point by lakegeorge the reduction of those forts would naturally lay open the lake champlain where having established a sufficient naval force he was by the river sorel which forms the communication between this lake and the great river st lawrence to proceed directly to quebec the capital of canada here he was to make a junction with general wolf and admiral saunders who having entered the river st lawrence at the opposite quarter would probably have commenced the siege of quebec by the time that general amherst might find it practicable to join them it was not doubted that if this junction could be effected the reduction of that city would follow of course  the third of the grand operations was against the fort near the fall of niagara a place of very great consequence both in war and in peace the reduction of this was committed to brigadier general prideaux under whom sir william johnson commanded the provincials of new york and several indians of the five nations who were engaged in our service by the credit that gentleman had obtained among their tribes  the object of this operation lay too remote from the others to expect with any great confidence that they could be assisted by its success in any other manner than by weakening the enemys forces however it was hoped that if they should be fortunate enough to take niagara early in the season the troops might be embarked on the lake ontario and finding no longer any obstruction from fort frontenac which was destroyed last year might fall down the river st lawrence and possibly either make themselves masters of montreal or by their approach at least draw such a force to that part as greatly to facilitate our designs upon quebec and crown point but if this scheme in addition to its own end should not facilitate either of the other two capital undertakings it would probably as it was the most important place the french had in that part of the world draw all the troops they had upon the lakes to attempt its relief which would leave the fort on those lakes exposed to a fourth though inferior expedition which was made against them under general stanwix in reality it afterward had that effect  the army under general amherst was the first in motion the lake george or as the french call it lake sacrament is a long but in proportion narrow water about forty miles in length and enclosed on either side with marshy grounds this communicates by another long and very narrow straight with lake champlain this straight is secured at each side by a fort that to the side of lake george is called ticonderoga that to the champlain lake is called fort frederick or crown point both extremely strong in their situation and the former of which had repulsed our troops with a very considerable slaughter as has been related amongst the events of the last year  general amherst after he had passed lake george arrived with very little opposition from the enemy before ticonderoga at first the french made some appearance as if they meant to defend the place but as they knew the strength of our forces as they saw that the preparations for the attack were making with as much judgment as vigor and as the enterprise which was preparing against quebec did not leave them a force so considerable as they had there in the preceding campaign they abandoned their fort in the night  general amrst immediately set himself about repairing the fortifications of this post which effectually secured the lake george covered our colonies and was of such vast importance to enable him to push forward his offensive operations or to favor his retreat in case of a reverse of fortune the only loss of any consequence which the english army suffered in making this valuable acquisition was the death of colonel townsend who was killed in reconnoitring by a shot from the fort the steady bravery the promising genius and the agreeable manners of this officer caused this loss to be considered as a very great one they compared this melancholy event with the death of lord how they remembered how much these young soldiers resembled each other both in their virtues and in the circumstances of their fate both dear to the troops and having both lost their lives on an expedition against this place  although the general had reason to imagine that the same reasons which had induced the enemy to abandon their fort and lines at ticonderoga would persuade them also to relinquish crown point he took all his measures with the same care as if he expected an obstinate defense at the fort and an attempt to surprise him on his march he remembered how fatal security had proved to us in that part of the world upon many occasions  the french abandoned the fort as it had been foreseen the general retired with about three thousand five hundred men to the bottom of lake champlain and posted himself at the island called isle du noix he was still pretty strong on the lake having several armed boats and sloops with which he hoped to prevent the progress of the english into the interior parts of canada general amherst as soon as he had taken possession of crown point used every endeavor to attain a naval superiority on the lake agreeable news of the reduction of niagara by the troops under sir william johnson and he had the pleasure and encouragement of seeing two of the great objects of the campaign accomplished whilst he prepared himself to cooperate in the accomplishment of the third which was to be decisive of the whole the body which had been appointed for niagara under general prideaux without any accident arrived at the fort which lies at the bottom of the lake toward the southwest a  a sir william johnsons letter to major general amherst on his conquest of the fort at niagara   th july      sir i have the honor to acquiant you by lieutenant monterieff niagara surrendered to his majestys arms the   th instant a detachment of   00 men with a number of indians under the command of messrs aubry and de lignery collected from detroi venango and presque isle made an attempt to reinforce the garrison the   th in the morning but as i had intelligence of them i made a disposition to intercept them the evening before i ordered the light infantry and picquets to take post on the road upon our left leading from niagara falls to the fort in the morning i reinforced these with two companies of grenadiers and part of the   th regiment the action began about half an hour after nine but they were so well received by the troops in front and the indians on their flank that in an hours time the whole was completely ruined and all their officers made prisoners among whom are mons aubry de lignery marin repentini etc to the number of    i cannot ascertain the number of killed they are so dispersed among the woods but their loss is great  as this happened under the eyes of the garrison i thought proper to send my last summons to the commanding officer for his surrendering which he listened to m monrieff will inform you of the state of our ammunition and provisions i hope care will be taken to forward an immediate supply of both to oswego as the troops that were defeated yesterday were drawn from those posts which lie in general stanwixs route i am in hopes it will be of the utmost consequence to the success of this expedition the public stores of the garrison that can be saved from the indians i shall order the assistant quartermastergeneral and the clerk to take an account of as soon as possible  as all my attention at present is taken up with the indians that the capitulation i have agreed to may be observed your excellency will excuse my not being more particular  permit me to assure you in the whole progress of the siege which was severe and painful the officers and men behaved with the utmost cheerfulness and bravery i have only to regret the loss of general prideaux and colonel johnson i endeavored to pursue the late generals vigorous measures the good effects of which he deserved to enjoy  w johnson   this is without exception the most important post in america and secures the greatest number of communications for it is situated at the very entrance of a straight by which the lake ontario is joined to that of erie which is connected with the other three great seas of fresh water by the course of the st riv st lawrence which runs through them all and carries off their superfluous waters to the ocean a little above the fort is the cataract of niagara which is esteemed the most remarkable in the world for the quantity of water and the greatness of the fall this fall would interrupt the commerce between the lakes but for a road which the french have made up the hilly country that lies up the straight so that there is here a good carryingplace and not very tedious for after a portage of about eight miles you reimbark again and proceed without any interruption to the lake erie  as the great communication of those who go by water is along this straight and carrying place so those who travel by land are obliged to cross it the lakes are so disposed that without a somewhat hazardous voyage the indians cannot any otherwise pass from the northwest to the southeast parts of north america for many hundred miles the fort of niagara thus naturally commands all the five nations and all those indian tribes that lie to the northward of the lakes as well as those that are scattered along the banks of the ohio ouabache and missisippi and according as it is possessed by the english or the french connects or disjoints the colonies of canada and lousiana protects or lays open our own and is in all respects of so much consequence that it was the opinion of persons the most conversant in american business that this attempt ought to have been made much earlier and that if such an attempt made at such a time had succeeded it would have contributed very much to the security of those parts of our colonies which were the most exposed and would have at the same time greatly facilitated all our offensive measures and shortened the war  from the time that the french were acquainted with this place they were fully possessed with an opinion of its importance both with regard to commerce and to dominion they made several attempts to establish themselves here but the indians who seemed more sensible of the consequences than we were constantly opposed it they guarded this spot for a long time with a very severe and prudent jealousy  but whilst we neglected confiding in our strength to cultivate the friendship of the indians the french sensible of their weakness omitted no endeavor to gain these savage people to their interests and they prevailed at last under the name of a trading house to erect a strong fort at the mouth of the straight on the very best harbor not only on this but on any of the lakes an harbor which is safe from every wind and open for the whole year a french officer an able and enterprising man had been a prisoner among the iroquois for a long time and having according to their custom been naturalized he grew extremely popular amongst them and at last acquired his liberty he communicated to the then governor of canada the plan of an establishment at niagara and he himself undertook to execute it he returned amongst the iroquois and pretending great love for their nation which was now his own told them that he would gladly come to make frequent visits to his brethren but it was proper for that purpose that they should allow him to build an house where he might live at ease and according to his own manner at the same time he proposed to them advantages in trade from this establishment a request which seemed a compliment to those to whom it was made was readily granted the house was built by degrees this house extended itself it was strengthened by various additions and it grew at last to a regular fortress which has ever since awed the five nations and checked our colonies  the siege of this place had not been long formed before general prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bursting of a cohorn an express was sent to general amberst who always attentive to the service lost no time to send an officer of character to command in his place but the command which in the interim devolved upon sir william johnson could not have been better bestowed he omitted nothing to continue the vigorous measures of the late general and added to them every thing his own genius could suggest respected by the regular troops dear to the provincials almost adored by the indians possessed of that genius for acquiring popularity amongst all kinds of men and that versatile disposition which we so seldom see united with disinterestedness and integrity he employed those talents solely for the benefit of his country the troops remembering that it was under that general the first advantage had been obtained over the french pushed on the siege with so much alacrity that in a few days they had brought their approaches within an hundred yards of the covered way  the french were alarmed at the imminent danger of this interesting place they therefore collected all the regular troops and provincials which they could draw from all their posts about the lakes and to those joined a large body of savages in order to give the english battle and to raise the siege the amounted in all to   00 men  when general johnson was apprized of their approach he ordered his light infantry supported by some grenadiers and regular foot to take post on the road to his left by which the french were to take their route he placed his indians on his flanks whilst he took measures to receive the french who came to relieve the place he posted a strong body in such a manner as to secure his trenches from any attempt of the garrison during an engagement  in this disposition he waited to receive the enemy their whole army was ruined the pursuit was hot and bloody and it continued for five miles seventeen officers were made prisoners among whom were the first and second in command    this was the second very important service performed by general johnson in this war and a second time he had the good fortune to make the commander in chief of the enemy his prisoner it must not be omitted to the honor of this gentleman that though he was not regularly bred a soldier the most complete officer could not have made more excellent dispositions for the battle or have conducted the siege from the beginning to the end with a more cool and steady resolution or with a more complete knowledge of all the necessary maneuvers of war the taking of niagara broke off effectually that communication so much talked off and so much dreaded between canada and louisiana and by this stroke one of the capital political designs of the french which gave occasion to the present war was defeated in its direct and immediate object  chap vii the expedition against quebec the isle of orleans occupied description of the town and harbor of quebec situation of the french army action at the falls of montmorenci general wolf sickens the camp removed to point levi the troops go up the river the battle of quebec general wolf killed french defeated m de montcalm killed quebec surrenders movements of general amherst on lake champlain  the consequences which attended the reduction of the fort of niagara as well as those upon lake champlain were very interesting but the great and central operation to which all the rest tended and to which even those were to be only subservient was that against quebec the capital of canada and as this was to be the decisive stroke it was proper that the greatest force should have been employed against it if we reckon the maritime force there is no doubt that we employed a greater number of men against quebec than against the champlain forts but the land forces from some cause fell much short of the number originally proposed for they did not exceed  000 men regulars and provincials though the original plan intended  000 for that expedition independent of the junction of those under genesis amherst whose assistance on the occasion was taken for granted in this expedition genesis wolf commanded the land forces the fleet was under admiral saunders    as this island extends quite up to the basin of quebec it was necessary to possess it in order to act against the town for the most westerly point of this island advances toward an high point of land on the continent called point levi both of these shut up the view of the northern and southern channel which environ the isle of orleans so that the harbor of quebec appears to be a basin landlocked upon all sides the possession of both these points were necessary as they might be employed either with great advantage against the town or much to the annoyance of the besiegers for whilst the enemy continued masters of those it was impossible for a ship to lie in the harbor of quebec when these posts were possessed which was done with little difficulty the harbor and town of quebec appeared full to the view at one a tempting and discouraging sight for no place seems possessed of greater benefits of nature nor any of which nature seems more to have consulted the defense  quebec says f charlevoix can boast of a fresh water harbor capable of containing an hundred men of war of the line at one hundred and twenty leagues distance from the sea it lies on the most navigable river in the universe the river st laurence up to the isle of orleans that is for about     leagues from its mouth is no where less than from four to five leagues broad but above that isle it narrows so that before quebec it is not above a mile over hence this place got the name of quebeis or quebec which in the algonquin tongue signifies a strait  the city is the seat of the governor and the intendant and the supreme tribunals of justice for all the french north america it is also an episcopal see and a place of considerable trade it is large in extent and elegant in many of its buildings both public and private it consists of an upper and lower town the lower which is narrow is built upon a strand at the foot of a lofty rock upon which the upper town stands this rock extends itself and continues with a bold and steep front westward along the river st laurence for a considerable way another river from the northwest called st charles falls here into the former washing the foot of the rock on which quebec stands the point on which the town is built thus becomes a sort of peninsula by the junction of these rivers so that whoever attacks quebec must either make his approaches above the town and overcome the precipice which i have mentioned or cross the river st charles and attempt it upon that side the former of those methods must appear to a prudent commander wholly unadviseable and the latter extremely difficult if the former method should be attempted they would have that dangerous precipice to overcome defended by the enemies whole force which the attack would draw to this quarter on the other hand the country from the river st charles to the northward for more than five miles is extremely rough broken and difficult full of rivulets gullies and ravines and so continues to the river of montmorenci which flows by the foot of a steep and woody hill on the side of the river st laurence is a bank of sand of great extent which prevents the approach of any considerable vessel  in this advantageous situation was the french army posted upon what was deemed the only accessible side of quebec all along from the river st charles to that of montmorenci entrenched at every attackable spot with the river and sandbank abovementioned in their front and thick impenetrable woods upon their rear it is impossible to imagine a stronger post a post at once more defensible in itself or better calculated for succouring a city on which side soever it should be attacked thus posted they greatly exceeded in number the besiegers being about  0000 men under an able and thitherto fortunate commander m de montcalm who though he was superior in number to the english resolved to risque nothing and wisely relied on the natural strength of the country  when wolf saw the situation of the town the nature of the country the number of the troops and their position though of a sanguine temper and highly adventurous he began to despair but however another commander might have thought inaction in such circumstances justified to himself or even to the world by such strong appearances wolf resolved to leave nothing unattempted but amidst the choice of difficulties which lay before him to pitch upon those where the valor of his troops might be employed with the best prospect of success  as soon as he had secured the west point of the isle of orleans and that of levi he erected batteries there of cannon and mortars on the high ground from the point of levi which looks toward the town these fired continually upon the place admiral saunders was stationed below in the north channel of the isle of orleans opposite to montmorenci admiral holmes was stationed above the town at once to distract the enemies attention and to prevent any attempts from the enemy against the batteries that played upon the town  after this wise disposition was made of the fleet genesis wolf caused the troops to be transported over the north channel of the river st laurence to the northeast of montmorenci with a view of passing that river and bringing the enemy to an engagement some heights which commanded the enemies intrenchments and a ford above and another below the falls encouraged him to this attempt but upon reconnoitring the ground the opposite shore was found so steep and woody that he could not hope to put his design in execution which was by moving toward the enemies flank to draw them to an engagement to bring the french to an action was his single object he had found that any attempts to assault the city would prove to no purpose whilst the fleet could only batter the lower town and must suffer greatly by the cannon and bombs of the upper whilst they were employed in this ineffectual service for after the reduction of the lower town the passages to the upper were extremely steep and moreover so well entrenched that this advantage would prove little toward the reduction of the place  the only point left therefore was by every means to entice or force the enemy to an engagement and to this end no means were omitted by sending detachments up the river and by every appearance of a design to attack the town on that side but the marquis de montcalm in choosing his post was well apprised of its importance he knew sufficiently the nature of the country up the river and he trusted to it and therefore kept himself closely in his post disposing his parties of savages in which he was very strong in such a manner as to make any attempt upon him by surprise absolutely impossible in the mean time from the town fireships and boats were let down the stream to destroy the shipping which as they almost wholly filled the channel were greatly endangered but by the extraordinary skill and vigilance of admiral saunders every vessel of this kind sent against them was towed ashore without doing the least mischief  the general finding that all his efforts to decoy the enemy to an engagement had proved unsuccessful and sensible that they desired nothing more than to act defensively until the season itself should fight for them and oblige the english to retire he came at last in spite of all difficulties to the resolution of attacking them in their entrenchments on the side of montmorenci the place where the attack was to be made was chosen with great judgment as the only place thereabouts in which the artillery could be brought into use as there and there only the greatest part or even the whole of the troops might act at once and that there the retreat in case of a repulse was secure at least for a certain time of the tide having determined upon the place where the attack was to be which was at the mouth of the river montmorenci the best dispositions for it were made both on the part of the admiral and of the general  the english grenadiers who led the attack had orders immediately after their landing to form themselves on the beach but instead of forming themselves as they were directed from the hurry and noise of their landing or from an illgoverned ardor they rushed impetuously toward the enemies entrenchments in the utmost disorder and confusion without waiting for the corpse which were to sustain them and join in the attack in this disorder they were met by a violent and steady fire from the entrenchments by which they were thrown into more confusion and obliged them to shelter themselves behind a redoubt which the french had abandoned on their approch  the general perceiving that it was impossible for these grenadiers to form under so severe a fire that the night drew on a violent tempest was gathering and the tide began to make saw clearly that he had nothing further left than to order a retreat with as little disadvantage as possible he therefore called off those troops and having formed behind brig moncktons corpse which was on the beach in excellent order the whole repassed the river without molestation the general exposing his person with that intrepidity which distinguished him both during the attack and the retreat  the loss in this check was not inconsiderable and the event on the whole was such as to discourage any further attempts upon that side they returned to the old measures the general again sent some bodies above the town and some men of war sailed up the stream for more than twelve leagues they received intelligence that the enemy had amassed some magazines of provisions in the interior country and they proposed by getting between them and the town to draw the french army from their entrenchments to the longdesired engagement but if they failed to compass this they might at least destroy the ships of war which the enemy had in the river and help to open a communication between them and genesis amherst on whom their last expectations were fixed and who they flattered themselves was on his march to their assistance  but though they succeeded in destroying some of the enemies magazines there was nothing of great moment in this they could not come near the men of war however they received intelligence from some prisoners of the success of sir william johnson against niagara they learned likewise that the french had soothed the difficulties in the way of genesis amherst by abandoning crown point and ticonderoga but this intelligence otherwise so pleasing brought them no prospect of the approach of any assistance from that quarter the season wasted apace the general fell violently ill consumed by care watching and a fatigue too great to be supported by a delicate constitution and a body unequal to that vigorous and enterprising soul that it lodged it was not enough for him to escape from so great an expedition uncondemned and unapplauded to be pitied was he thought but a milder censure and he knew that no military conduct can shine unless it be gilded with success his own high notions the public hope the good success of other commanders all turned inward upon him oppressed his spirits and converted disappointment into disease as soon as he had a little recovered he dispatched an express with an accouns of his proceedings to england c written indeed in the style of despondency but with such perspicuity clearness and elegance as would have ranked him amongst our best writers if his military exploits had not placed him among our greatest commanders  c major general wolfes letter and admiral saunderss to mr secretary pit relative to the operations at quebec head quarters at montmorenci in the river saint laurence sept        sir i wish i could upon this occasion have the honor of transmitting to you a more favorable account of the progress of his majestys arms but the obstacles we have met with in the operations of the campaign are much greater than we had reason to expect or could foresee not so much from the number of the enemy though superior to us as from the natural strength of the country which the marquis de montcalm seems wisely to depend upon  when i learned that succors of all kinds had been thrown into quebec that five battalions of regular troops completed from the best of the inhabitants of the country some of the troops of the colony and every canadian that was able to bear arms besides several nations of savages had taken the field in a very advantageous situation i could not flatter myself that i should be able to reduce the place i sought however an occasion to attack their army knowing well that with these troops i was able to fight and hoping that a victory might disperse them  we found them encamped along the shore of beaufort from the river st charles to the falls of montmorenci and entrenched in every accessible part the   th of june we landed upon the isle of orleans but receiving a message from the admiral that there was reason to think the enemy had artillery and a force upon the point of levi i detached brig monckton with four battalions to them from thence he passed the river the   th at night and marched the next day to the point he obliged the enemys irregulars to retire and possessed himself of that post the advanced parties upon this occasion had two or three skirmishes with the canadians and indians with little loss on either side  colonel carleton marched with a detachment to the westermost point of the isle of orleans from whence our operations were likely to begin  it was absolutely necessary to possess these two points and fortify them because from either the one or the other the enemy might make it impossible for any ship to be in the basin of quebec or even within two miles of it  batteries of cannon and mortars were erected with great dispatch on the point of levi to bombard the town and magazines and to injure the works and batteries the enemy perceiving these works in some forwardness passed the river with   00 men to attack and destroy them unluckily they fell into confusion fired upon one another and went back again by which we lost an opportunity of defeating this large detachment the effect of this artillery has been so great though across the river that the upper town is considerably damaged and the lower town entirely destroyed  the works for the security of our hospitals and stores on the isle of orleans being finished on the  th of july at night we passed the north channel and encamped near the enemys left the river montmorenci between us the next morning captain danks company of rangers posted in a wood to cover some workmen were attacked and defeated by a body of indians and had so many killed and wounded as to be almost disabled for the rest of the campaign the enemy also suffered in this affair and were in their turn driven off by the nearest troops  the ground to the eastward of the falls seemed to be as it really is higher than that on the enemys side and to command it in a manner which might be made useful to us there is besides a ford below the falls which may be passed for some hours in the latter part of the ebb and beginning of the flood tide and i had hopes that possibly means might be found of passing the river above so as to fight the marquis de montcalm upon terms of less disadvantage than directly attacking his intrenchments in reconnoitring the river montmorenci we found it fordable at a place about three miles up but the opposite bank was entrenched and so steep and woody that it was to no purpose to attempt a passage there the escort was twice attacked by the indians who were as often repulsed but in these rencounters we had  0 officers and men killed and wounded  the   th of july two men of war two armed sloops and two transports with some troops on board passed by the town without any loss and got into the upper river this enabled me to reconnoitre the country above where i found the same attention on the enemys side and great difficulties on ours arising from the nature of the ground and the obstacles to our communication with the fleet but what i feared most was that if we should land between the town and the river capt rouge the body first landed could not be reinforced before they were attacked by the enemys whole army  notwithstanding these difficulties i thought once of attempting it at st michaels about three miles above the town but perceiving that the enemy were jealous of the design were preparing against it and had actually brought artillery and a mortar which being so near to quebec they could increase as they pleased to play upon the shipping and as it must have been many hours before we could attack them even supposing a favorable night for the boats to pass by the town unhurt it seemed so hazardous that i thought it best to desist  however to divide the enemys force and to draw their attention as high up the river as possible and to procure some intelligence i sent a detachment under the command of col carleton to land at the point de trempe to attack whatever he might find there bring off some prisoners and all the useful papers he could get i had been informed that a number of the inhabitants of quebec had retired to that place and that probably we should find a magazine of provisions there  the colonel was fired upon by a body of indians the moment he landed but they were soon dispersed and driven into the woods he searched for magazines but to no purpose brought off some prisoners and returned with little loss  after this business i came back to montmorenci where i found that big townshend had by a superior fire prevented the french from erecting a battery on the bank of the river from whence they intended to cannonade our camp i now resolved to take the first opportunity which presented itself of attacking the enemy though posted to great advantage and every where prepared to receive us  as the men of war cannot for want of a sufficient depth of water come near enough to the enemys intrenchments to annoy them in the least the admiral had prepared two transports drawing but little water which upon occasions could be run a ground to favor a descent with the help of these vessels which i understood would be carried by the tide close in shore i proposed to make myself master of a detached redoubt near to the waters edge and whose situation appeared to be out of musket shot of the intrenchment upon the hill if the enemy supported this detatched piece it would necessarily bring on an engagement what we most wished for and if not i should have it in my power to examine their situation so as to be able to determine where we could best attack them  preparations were accordingly made for an engagement the   st of july in the forenoon the boats of the fleet were filled with grenadiers and a part of brig moncktons brigade from the point of levi the two brigades under the brigadiers townshend and murray were ordered to be in readiness to pass the ford when it should be thought necessary to facilitate the passage of this corpse the admiral had placed the centurion in the channel so that she might check the fire of the lower battery which commanded the ford this ship was of great use as her fire was very judiciously directed a great quantity of artillery was placed upon the eminence so as to batter and enfilade the left of their intrenchments  from the vessel which run aground nearest in i observed that the redoubt was too much commanded to be kept without very great loss and the more as the two armed ships could not be brought near enough to cover both with their artillery and musquetry which i at first conceived they might but as the enemy seemed in some confusion and we were prepared for an action i thought it a proper time to make an attempt upon their intrenchments orders were sent to the brigadiers generals to be ready with the corpse under their command brig monckton to land and the brigadiers townshend and murray to pass the ford  at a proper time of the tide the signal was made but in rowing toward the shore many  the boats grounded upon a ledge that runs of a considerable ance this accident put us into some disorder lost a great deal off time and obliged me to send an officer to stop brig towshends march whom i then observed to be in motion while the seamen were getting the boats off the enemy fired a number of shells and shot but did no considerable damage as soon as this disorder could be set a little to rights and the boats were ranged in a proper manner some of the officers of the navy went in with me to find a better place to land we took one flatbottomed boat with us to make the experiment and as soon as we had found a fit part of the shore the troops were ordered to disembark thinking it not yet too late for the attempt  the    companies of grenadiers and  00 of the scond royal american battalion got first on shore the grenadiers were ordered to form themselves into four distinct bodies and to begin the attack supported by brig moncktons corpse as soon as the troops had passed the ford and were at hand to assist but whether from the noise and hurry at landing or from some other cause the grenadiers instead of forming themselves as they were directed ran on impetuously toward the enemys intrenchments in the utmost disorder and confusion without waiting for the corpse which were to sustain them and join in the attack brig monckton was not landed and brig townshend was still at a considerable distance though upon his march to join us in very great order the grenadiers were checked by the enemys first fire and obliged to shelter themselves in or about the redoubt which the french abandoned upon their approach in this situation they continued for some time unable to form under so hot a fire and having many gallant officers wounded who careless of their persons had been solely intent upon their duty i saw the absolute necessity of calling them off that they might form themselves behind brig moncktons corpse which was now landed and drawn up on the beach in extreme good order  by this new accident and this second delay it was near night a sudden storm came on and the tide began to make so that i thought it most advisable not to persevere in so difficult an attack lest in case of a repulse the retreat of brig townshends corpse might be hazardous and uncertain  our artillery had a great effect upon the enemys left where brigadiers townshend and murray were to have attacked and it is probable that if those accidents i have spoken of had not happened we should have penetrated there whilst our left and center more remote from our artillery must have bore all the violence of their musquetry  the french did not attempt to interrupt our march some of their savages came down to murder such wounded as could not be brought off and to scalp the dead as their custom is  the place where the attack was intended has these advantages over all others hereabout our artillery could be brought into use the greatest part or even the whole of the troops might act at once and the retreat in case of repulse was secure at least for a certain time of the tide neither one or other of these advantages can any where else be found the enemy were indeed posted upon a commanding eminence the beach upon which the troops were drawn up was of deep mud with holes and cut by several gullies the hill to be ascended very steep and not every where practicable the enemy numerous in their intrenchments and their fire hot if the attack had succeeded our loss must certainly have been great and theirs inconsiderable from the shelter which the neighboring woods afforded them the river st charles still remained to be passed before the town was inverted all these circumstances i considered but the desire to act in conformity to the kings intentions induced me to make this trial persuaded that a victorious army finds no difficulties  the enemy have been fortifying ever since with care so as to make a second attempt still more dangerous  immediately after this check i sent brig murray above the town with   00 men directing him to assist rear admiral holmes in the destruction of the french ships if they could be got at in order to open a communication with genesis amherst the brigadier was to seek every favorable opportunity of fighting some of the enemys detachments provided he could do it upon tolerable terms and to use all the means in his power to provoke them to attack him he made two different attempts to and upon the north shore without success but in a third was more fortunate he landed unexpectedly at de chambaud and burnt a magazine there in which were some provisions some ammunition and all the spare stores clothing arms and baggage of their army  finding that their ships were not to be got at and little prospect of bringing the enemy to a battle he reported his situation to me and i ordered him to join the army  the prisoners he took informed him of the surrender of the fort of niagara and we discovered by intercepted letters that the enemy had abandoned carillon and crown point were retired to the isle aux noix and that genesis amherst was making preparations to pass the lake champlain to fall upon m de bourlemaques corpse which consists of three battalions of foot and as many canadians as make the whole amount to  000 men  the admirals dispatches and mine would have gone eight or ten days sooner if i had not been prevented from writing by a fever i found myself so ill and am still so weak that i begged the general officers to consult together for the public utility they are all of opinion that as more ships and provisions have now got above the town they should try by conveying up a corpse of   or  000 men which is nearly the whole strength of the army after the points of levi and orleans are left in a proper state of defense to draw the enemy from their present situation and bring them to an action i have acquiesced in their proposal and we are preparing to put it in execution  the admiral and i have examined the town with a view to a general assault but after consulting with the chief engineer who is well acquainted with the interior parts of it and after viewing it with the utmost attention we found that though the batteries of the lower town might be easily silenced by the men of war yet the business of an assault would be little advanced by that since the few passages that lead from the lower to the upper town are carefully entrenched and the upper batteries cannot be affected by the ships which must receive considerable damage from them and from the mortars the admiral would readily join in this or in any other measure for the public service but i could not propose to him an undertaking of so dangerous a nature and promising so little success  to the uncommon strength of the country the enemy have added for the defense of the river a great number of floating batteries and boats by the vigilance of these and the indians round our different posts it has been impossible to execute any thing by surprise we have had almost daily skirmishes with these savages in which they are generally defeated but not without loss on our side  by the list of disabled officers many of whom are of rank you may perceive sir that the army is much weakened by the nature of the river the most formidable part of this armament is deprived of the power of acting yet we have almost the whole force of canada to oppose in this situation there is such a choice of difficulties that i own myself at a loss how to determine the affairs of great britain i know require the most vigourous measures but then the courage of a handful of brave men should be exerted only where there is some hope of a favorable event however you may be assured sir that the small part of the campaign which remains shall be employed as far as i am able for the honor of his majesty and the interest of the nation in which i am sure of being well seconded by the admiral and by the generals happy if our efforts here can contribute to the success of his majestys arms in any other parts of america  i have the honor to be with the greatest respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant james wolf  sterlingcastle off point levi in the river st lawrence  th of september      sir in my letter of the  th of june i acquainted you i was then off scutari standing for the river st laurence on the   th i had got up with the first division of the fleet and transports as far as the middle of the isle of orleans where i immediately prepared to land the troops which i did the next morning the same day the second and third divisions came up and the troops from them were landed likewise  i got thus far without any loss or accident whatever but directly after landing the troops a very hard gale of wind came on by which many anchors and small boats were lost and much damage received among the transports by their driving on board each other the ships that lost most anchors i supplied from the men of war as far as i was able and in all other respects gave them the best assistance in my power  on the   th at midnight the enemy sent down from quebec seven fireships and though our ships and transports were so numerous and necessarily spread so great a part of the channel we towed them all clear and aground without receiving the least damage from them the next night genesis monckton crossed the river and landed with his brigade on the south shore and took post at point levi and genesis wolf took his on the westmost point of the isle of orleans  on the  st of july i moved up between the points of orleans and levi and it being resolved to land on the north shore below the falls of montmorenci i placed on the  th inst his majestys sloop the porcupine and the boscawen armed vessel in the channel between orleans and the north shore to cover that landing which took place at night  on the   th i ordered capt rous of the sutherland to proceed with the first fair wind and night tide above the town of quebec and to take with him his majestys ships diana and squirrel with two armed sloops and two catts armed and loaded with provisions  on the   th at night they all got up except the diana and gave genesis wolf an opportunity of reconnoitring above the town those ships having carried some troops with them for that purpose the diana ran ashore upon the rocks off point levi and received so much damage that i have sent her to boston with    sail of american transports those which received most damage in the gale of the   th of june where they are to be discharged and the diana having repaired her damages is to proceed to england taking with her the mast ships and what trade may be ready to accompany her  on the   th at mignight the enemy sent down a raft of firestages of near a hundred radeaux which succeeded no better than the fireships  on the   st genesis wolf determined to land a number of troops above the falls of montmorenci in order to attack the enemys lines to cover which i placed the centurion in the channel between the isle of orleans and the falls and ran on shore at high water two catts which i had armed for that purpose against two small batteries and two redoubts where our troops were to land about six in the evening they landed but the generel not thinking it proper to persevere in the attack soon after part of them reembarked and the rest crossed the falls with genesis wolf upon which to prevent the two catts from falling into the enemys hands they being then dry on shore i gave orders to take the men out and set them on fire which was accordingly done  on the  th of august in the night i sent twenty flatbottomed boats up the river to the sutherland to embark    0 of the troops with brig genesis murray from a post he had taken on the south shore i sent admiral holmes up to the sutherland to act in concert with him and give him all the assistance the ships and boats could afford at the same time i directed admiral holmes to use his best endeavors to get at and destroy the enemys ships above the town and for that purpose i ordered the lowestoffe and hunter sloop with two armed sloops and two catts with provisions to pass quebec and join the sutherland but the wind holding westerly it was the   th of august before they got up which was the fourth attempt they had made to gain their passage  on the   th at night admiral holmes and genesis murray with part of the troops returned they had met with and destroyed a magazine of the enemys clothing some gunpowder and other things and admiral holmes had been ten or twelve leagues above the town but found it impracticable at that time to get farther up  genesis wolf having resolved to quit the camp at montmorenci and go above the town in hopes of getting between the enemy and their provisions supposed to be in the ships there and by that means force them to an action i sent up on the   th at night the seahorse and two armed sloops with two catts laden with provisions to join the rest above quebec and having taken off all the artillery from the camp at montmorenci on the  d inst in the afternoon the troops embarked from thence and landed at point levi the  th at night i sent all the flatbottomed boats up and this night a part of the troops will march up the south shore above the town to be embarked in the ships and vessels there and tomorrow night the rest will follow admiral holmes is also gone up again to assist in their future operations and to try if with the assistance of the troops it is practicable to get at the enemys ships  as genesis wolf writes by this opportunity he will give you an account of his part of the operations and his thoughts what further may be done for his majestys service the enemy appear numerous and seem to be strongly posted but let the event be what it will we shall remain here as long as the season will permit in order to prevent their detaching troops from hence against genesis amherst and i shall leave cruizers at the mouth of the river to cut off any supplies that may be sent them with strict orders to keep that station as long as possible the town of quebec is not habitable being almost entirely burnt and destroyed  i enclose you the present disposition of the ships under my command twenty of the victuallers that sailed from england with the echo are arrived here one unloaded at louisbourg having received damage in her passage out and another i have heard nothing of no ships of the enemy have come this way that i have had any intelligence of since my arrival in the river except one laden with flour and brandy which was taken by capt drake of the lizard  before admiral durell got into the river three frigates and seventeen sail with provisions stores and a few recruits got up and are those we are so anxious if possible to destroy  yesterday i received a letter from gen amherst to whom i have had no opportunity of writing since i have been in the river dated camp off crown point august   th wherein he only desires i would send transports and a convoy to new york to carry to england six hundred and seventy prisoners taken at the surrender of niagara  i would have wrote to you sooner from hence but while my dispatches were preparing genesis wolf was taken very ill he has been better since but is still greatly out of order  i shall very soon send home the great ships and have the honor to be  with the greatest respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant charles saunderrs  he resolved when he sent away his account to continue the campaign to the last possible moment and after a deliberation with his officers determined that any further attempts at montmorenci were to little purpose and that their principal operations should be above the town in order if possible to draw the enemy to an action but the design of wolf was deeper and more particularly directed than it had been before the camp at montmorenci was broke up and the troops were conveyed to the southeast of the river and encamped at point levi the squadron under admiral holmes made movements up the river for several days successively in order to draw the enemies attention as far from the town as possible this succeeded in some measure for though it could not persuade the marquis de montcalm to quit his post it induced him to detach m de bougainville with   00 men to watch their motions and to proceed along the western shore of the river whilst the english army directed its march the same way on the eastern bank  when genesis wolf saw that matters were ripe for action he ordered the ships under admiral saunders to make a feint as if they proposed to attack the french in their entrenchments on the beauport shore below the town and by their motions to give this feint all the appearance of a reality which it possibly could have this disposition being made below the town the general embarked his forces about one in the morning and with admiral holmess division went three leagues further up the river than the intended place of his landing in order to amuse the enemy and conceal his real design then he put them into boats and fell down silently with the tide unobserved by the french sentinels posted along the shore the rapidity of the current carried these boats a little below the intended place of attack the ships followed them and arrived just at the time which had been concerted to cover their landing considering the darkness of the night and the rapidity of the current this was a very critical operation and it required excellent heads both on the part of the marine and the land service to preserve a communication and to prevent a discovery and confusion  as the troops could not land at the spot proposed when they were put on shore an hill appeared before them extremely high and steep in its ascent a little path winded up this ascent so narrow that two could not go abreast even this path was entrenched and a captains guard defended it these difficulties did not abate the hopes of the general or the ardor of the troops the light infantry under colonel how laying hold of stumps and boughs of trees pulled themselves up dislodged the guards and cleared the path and then all the troops surmounting every difficulty gained the top of the hill and as fast as they ascended formed themselves so that they were all in order of battle at day break  montcalm when he heard that the english had ascended the hill  he filled the bushes that were in his front with detachments of indians and his best marksmen to the number of about   00 his regular forces formed his left his right was composed of the troops of the colony supported by two battalins of regulars the rest of the indians and canadians extended on that side and attempted to outflank the left of the english which was formed to prevent that design in a manner which the military men call potence that is in a body which presents two faces to the enemy here brigadier general townshend commanded six regiments and the louisbourg grenadiers were disposed in a line to the right of this body extending to the river a regiment was drawn up behind the right for a reserve it was formed in eight subdivisions with large intervals the light infantry under colonel how protected the rear and the left the dispositions on both sides were judicious and the engagement on both sides began with spirit  the english troops were exhorted to reserve their fire and they bore that of the enemys light troops in front which was galling though irregular with the utmost patience and good order waiting for the main body of the enemy which advanced fast upon them at forty yards distance our troops gave their fire which took place in its full extent and made a terrible havoc among the french it was supported with as much vivacity as it was begun and the enemy every where yielded to it but just in the moment when the fortune of the field began to declare itself general wolf in whose life every thing seemed included fell general monckton the next to him in command fell immediately after and both were conveyed out of the line the command now devolved on general townshend it was at a very critical time for though the enemy began to fall back and were much broken the loss of the two generals was a very discouraging circumstance and it required great temper and great exertions to support the advantages that had been gained and to push them to their proper extent general townshend showed himself equal to so arduous a duty the troops preserved their spirit and each corpse seemed to exert itself with a view to its peculiar character the grenadiers with their bayonets the highlanders with their broad swords and the rest of the forces with a steady and continued fire drove the enemy in great disorder from every post and completed their defeat during the whole action colonel how with his light infantry covered the left wing in such a manner as entirely to frustrate the attempts of the enemies indians and canadians upon that flank  the field now seemed to be completely decided when a new enemy appeared which threatened to bring on a fresh engagement and to put all again to the hazard m de bougainville whom the feigned movements of the english troops had drawn up the river turned back on discovering their real design and now appeared on the rear of the army with a body of  000 men but fortunately the main body of the french was by this time so broken and dispersed that the general was able to establish his rear and to turn such an opposition on that side that the enemy retired after a very feeble attempt  in this decisive action our troops lost about  00 men on the side of the enemy at least   00 were killed but however glorious this victory was and however important in its consequences it must be admitted that it was very dearly bought soldiers may be raised officers will be formed by experience but the loss of a genius in war is a loss which we know not how to repair the death of wolf was indeed grievous to his country but to himself the most happy that can be imagined and the most to be envied by all those who have a true relish for military glory unindebted to family or connections unsupported by intrigue or faction he had accomplished the whole business of life at a time when others are only beginning to appear and at the age of thirtyfive without feeling the weakness of age or the vicissitude of fortune having satisfied his honest ambition having completed his character having fulfilled the expectations of his country he fell at the head of his conquering troops and expired in the arms of victory  the circumstances that attended the death of such a person are too interesting to be passed over in silence and they were indeed such as spoke the whole tenor of his life he first received a wound in his head but that he might not discourage his troops he wrapped it up in his hankerchief and encouraged his men to advance soon after he received another bll in his belly this also he dissembled and exerted himself as before when he received a third in his breast under which he at last sunk and suffered himself unwillingly to be carried behind the ranks as he lay struggling with the anguish and weakness of three grievous wounds he seemed only sollicitous about the fortune of the battle he begged one who attended him to support him to view the field but as he found that the approach of death had dimmed and confused his sight he desired an officer who was by him to give him an account of what he saw the officer answered that the enemy seemed broken he repeated his question a few minutes after with much anxiety when he was told that the enemy was totally routed and that they fled in all parts then said he i am satisfied and immediately he expired  without the same advantages the enemy also had an heavy loss in this battle which no doubt contributed to their defeat m de montcalm commander in chief was killed on the spot an officer who had done the highest services to his country throughout the whole american war and perfectly supported his reputation in this last seen of it having made the most perfect dispositions that human prudence could suggest both before the battle and in the engagement it is something remarkable that in both armies the first in command should be killed and the second dangerously wounded but general monckton happily recovered the french officer died a little after the battle  five days after the action the enemy seeing that the communication between the town and the army was cut off  a the honnurable genesis moncktons letter to the right honorable mr secretary pit dated river st lawrence camp at point levi september         sir i have the pleasure to acquaint you that on the   th instant his majestys troops gained a very signal victory over the french a little above the town of quebec general wolf exerting himself on the right of our line received a wound pretty early of which he died soon after and i had myself the great misfortune of receiving one in my right breast by a ball that went through part of my lungs and which has been cut out under the blade bone of my shoulder just as the french were giving way which obliged me to quit the field i have therefore sir desired general townshend who now commands the troops before the town and of which i am in hopes he will be soon in possession to acquaint you with the particulars of that day and of the operations carrying on i have the honor to be etc  rob monckton p s his majestys troops behaved with the greatest steadiness and bravery  as the surgeons tell me that there is no danger in my wound i am in hopes that i shall be soon able to join the army before the town    the honorable

inst in an action with the french on the heights to the westward of this town  it being determined to carry the operations above the town the posts at point levi and lisle dorleans being secured the general marched with the remainder of the force from point levi the  th and  th and embarked them in transports which had passed the town for that purpose on the  th  th and  th a movement of the ships was made up by admiral holmes in order to amuse the enemy now posted along the north shore but the transports being extremely crowded and the weather very bad the general thought proper to cantoon half his troops on the south shore where they were refreshed and reimbarked upon the   th at one in the morning the light infantry commanded by col how the regiments of bragg kennedy lascelles and anstruther with a detachment of highlanders and the american grenadiers the whole being under the command of brigadiers monckton and murray were put into flatbottomed boats and after some movements of the ships made by admiral holmes to draw the attention of the enemy above the boats fell down with the tide and landed on the north shore within a league of cape diamond an hour before daybreak the rapidity of the tide of ebb carried them a little below the intended place of attack which obliged the light infantry to scramble up a woody precipice in order to secure the landing the troops by dislodging a captains post which defended the small entrenched path the troops were to ascend after a little firing the light infantry gained the top of the precipice and dispersed the captains post by which means the troops with a very little loss from a few canadians and indians in the wood got up and were immediately formed the boats as they emptied were sent back for the second embarkation which i immediately made brigadier murray who had been detached with anstruthers battalion to attack the four gun battery upon the left was recalled by the general who now saw the french army crossing the river st charles general wolf thereupon begun to form his line having his right covered by the louisbourg grenadiers on the right of these again he afterward brought otways to the left of the grenadiers were braggs kennedys lascelless highlanders and anstruthers the right of this body was commanded by brigadier monckton and the left by brigadier murray his rear and left were protected by col howes lightinfantry who was returned from the four gun battery beforementioned which was soon abandoned to him general montcalm having collected the whole of his force from the beauport side and advancing showed his intention to flank our left where i was immediately ordered with general amhersts battalion which i formed en potence my numbers were soon after increased by the arrival of the two battalions of royal americans and webbs was drawn up by the general as a reserve in eight subdivisions with large intervals the enemy lined the bushes in their front with   00 indians and canadians and i dare say had placed most of their best marksmen there who kept up a very galling though irregular fire upon our whole line who bore it with the greatest patience and good order reserving their fire for the main body now advancing this fire of the enemy was however checked by our posts in our front which protected the forming our own line the right of the enemy was composed of half of the troops of the colony the battalion of la sarre languedoc and the remainder of the canadians and indians their center was a column and formed by the battalions of bearn and guienne their left was composed of the remainder of the troops of the colony and the battalion of royal rousillon this was as near as i can guess their line of battle they brought up two pieces of small artillery against us and we had been able to bring up but one gun which being admirably well served galled their column exceedingly my attention to the left will not permit me to be very exact with regard to every circumstance which passed in the center much less to the right but it is most certain that the enemy formed in good order and that their attack was very brisk and animated on that side our troops reserved their fire till within forty yards which was so well continued that the enemy every where gave way it was then our general fell at the head of braggs and the louisbourg grenadiers advancing with their bayonets about the same time brigadiergeneral monckton received his wound at the head of lascelless in the front of the opposite battalion fell also m montcalm and his second in command is since dead of his wounds on board our fleet part of the enemy made a second faint attack part took to some thick copse wood and seemed to make a stand it was at this moment that each corpse seemed in a manner to exert itself with a view to its own peculiar character the grenadiers braggs and lascelless pressed on with their bayonets brigadier murray advancing with the troops under his command briskly completed their rout on this side when the highlanders supported by arstruthers took to their broad swords and drove part into the town and part to the works at their bridge on the river st charles  the action on our left and rear was not so severe the houses into which the light infantry were thrown were well defended being supported by col how who taking post with two companies behind a small copse and frequently sallying upon the flanks of the enemy during the attack drove them often into heaps against the front of which body i advanced platoons of amhersts regiment which totally prevented the right wing from executing their first intention before this one of the royal american battalions had been detached to preserve our communication with our boats and the other being sent to occupy the ground which brigadier murrays movement had left open i remained with amhersts to support this disposition and to keep the enemys right and a body of their savages which waited still more toward our rear opposite the posts of our light infantry waiting for an opportunity to fall upon our rear  this sir was the situation of things when i was told in the action that i commanded i immediately repaired to the center and finding the pursuit had put part of the troops in disorder i formed them as soon as possible scarce was this effected when m de bougainville with his corpse from cape rouge of  000 men appeared in our rear i advanced two pieces of artillery and two battalions toward him upon which he retired you will not i flatter myself blame me for not quitting such advantageous ground and risking the fate of so decisive a day by seeking a fresh enemy posted perhaps in the very kind of ground he could wish for viz woods and swamps  we took a great number of french officers upon the field of battle and one piece of cannon their loss is computed to be about   00 men which fell chiefly upon their regulars  i have been employed from the day of action to that of the capitulation in redoubting our camp beyond insult in making a road up the precipice for our cannon in getting up the artillery preparing the batteries and cutting off their communication with the country the   th at noon before we had any battery erected or could have any for two or three days a flag of truce came out with proposals of capitulation which i sent back again to the town allowing them four hours to capitulate or no farther treaty the admiral had at this time brought up his large ships as intending to attack the town the french officer returned at night with terms of capitulation which with the admiral were considered agreed to and signed at eight in the morning the   th instant the terms we granted will i flatter myself be approved of by his majesty considering the enemy assembling in our rear and what is far more formidable the very wet and cold season which threatened our troops with sickness and the fleet with some accident it had made our road so bad we could not bring up a gun for some time add to this the advantage of entering the town with the walls in a defensible state and the being able to put a garrison there strong enough to prevent all surprise these i hope will be deemed sufficient considerations for granting them the terms i have the honor to transmit to you the inhabitants of the country came in to us fast bringng in their arms and taking the oaths of fidelity until a general peace determines their situation  i have the honor to enclose herewith a list of the killed and wounded a list of the prisoners as perfect as i have yet been able to get it and a list of the artillery and stores in the town as well as those fallen into our hands at beauport in consequence of the victory by deserters we learn that the enemy are reassembling what troops they can behind the cape rouge that m de levy is come down from the montreal side to command them some say he has brought two battalions with him if so this blow has already assisted general amherst by other deserters we learn that m de bougainville with  00 men and provisions was on his march to fling himself into the town the   th the very morning it capitulated on which day we had not completed the investiture of the place as they had broke their bridge of boats and had detachments in very strong works on the other side the river st charles  i should not do justice to the admiral and the naval service if i neglected this occasion of acknowledging how much we are indebted for our success to the constant assistance and support received from there and the perfect harmony and correspondence which has prevailed throughout all our operations in the uncommon difficulties which the nature of this country in particular presents to military operations of a great extent and which no army can itself solely supply the immense labor in artillery stores and provisions the long watchings and attendance in boats the drawing up our artillery by the seamen even in the heat of action it is my duty short as my command has been to acknowledge for that time how great a share the navy has had in this successful campaign  i have the honor to be etc geo townshend  vice admiral saunders letter to the right honorable mr secretary pit sir i have the greatest pleasure in acquainting you that the town and citadel of quebec surrendered on the   th instant and i enclose you a copy of the articles of capitulation the army took possession of the gates on the land side the same evening and sent safe guards into the town to peserve order and to prevent any thing from being destroyed and capt palliser with a bdy of seamen landed in the lower town and did the same the next day our army marched in and near a thousand french officers soldiers and seamen were embarked on board some english catts who shall soon proceed for france agreeable to the capitulation  i had the honor to write to you the  th inst by the rodney cutter the troops mentioned in that letter embarked on board the ships and vessels above the town in the night of the  th inst and at four in the morning of the   th began to land on the north shore about a mile and a half above the town general montcalm with his whole army left their camp at beauport and marched to meet him a little before ten both armies were formed and the enemy began the attack our troops received their fire and reserved their own advancing till they were so near as to run in upon them and push them with their bayonets by which in a very little time the french gave way and fled to the town in the utmost disorder and with great loss for our troops pursued them quite to the walls and killed many of them upon the glacis and in the ditch and if the town had been further off the whole french army must have been destroyed about   0 french prisoners were taken that day among whom are ten captains and six subaltern officers all of whom will go in the great ships to england  i am sorry to acquaint you that general wolf was killed in the action and general monckton shot through the body but he is now supposed to be out of danger general montcalm and the three next french officers in command were killed but i must refer you to general townshend who writes by this opportunity for the particulars of this action the state of the garrison and the measures he is taking for keeping possession of it i am now beginning to send on shore the stores they will want and provisions for five thousand men of which i can furnish them with a sufficient quantity  the night of their landing admiral holmes with the ships and troops was about three leagues above the intended landing place general wolf with about half his troops set off in boats and dropped down with the tide and were by that means less liable to be discovered by the french sentinels posted all along the coast the ships followed them about three quarters of an hour afterward and got to the landing place just in the time that had been concerted to cover their landing and considering the darkness of the night and the rapidity of the current this was a very critical operation and very properly and successfully conducted when general wolf and the troops with him had landed the difficulty of gaining the top of the hill is scarce credible it was very steep in its ascent and high and no path where two could go abreast but they were obliged to pull themselves up by the stumps and boughs of trees that covered the declivity  immediately after our victory over their troops i sent up all the boats in the fleet with artillery and ammunition and on the   th went up with the men of war in a disposition to attack the lower town as soon as general townshend should be ready to attack the upper but in the evening they sent out to the camp and offered terms of capitulation  i have the farther pleasure of acquainting you that during this tedious campaign there has continued a perfect good understanding between the army and the navy i have received great assistance from admirals durell and holmes and from all the captains indeed every body has exerted themselves in the execution of their duty even the transports have willingly assisted me with boats and people on the landing the troops and many other services  i have the honor to be etc charles saunders  thus the capital of french america was rendered to the english after a most severe campaign of near three months and perhaps if the whole be considered there never was an enterprise of such difficulty carried on with a more gallant perseverance or accomplished with more vigor and ability a city strong in situation and fortifications was to be attacked an army greatly superior in number to the besiegers was posted under the walls of that city in an impregnable situation that army was to be forced to a battle against the inclinations of a wise and cautious commander a theater of more than five leagues was to be filled and operations of that extent to be carried on in the eye of the superior army by less than  000 men in this contest with so many difficulties one may say with nature itself the genius of the commander showed itself superior to every thing major general james wolf portrait of major general james wolf all the dispositions to that daring but judicious attempt near silery which at last drew montcalm from his entrenchments were so many masterpieces in the art of war but it is certain that these things notwithstanding the extraordinary abilities of the general could never have been compassed had not the marine cooperated with an unanimity diligence and skill which never could have taken place but from that perfect love to their country that animated all those that were concerned in this expedition here was no murmuring nor discontent nor absurd jealousy no mean competition between the land and seaservice but the most zealous endeavors to second each others efforts and the most generous inclinations on each side to give a due praise to their mutual services  when the news of this decisive action arrived in england we all remember though it is very difficult to describe the various and mixed emotions with which every one was affected but two days before this came was received the express which general wolf had sent off after the affair of montmorenci when the general doubted the public thought they had reason to despair but whilst this gloom was fresh and in the midst of the general despondency a second express arrives and brings all at once an account of the victory the taking of quebec and the death of general wolf the effect of so joyful news immediately on such a dejection and then the mixture of grief and pity which attended the public congratulations and applauses was very singular and affecting the sort of mourning triumph that manifested itself on that occasion did equal honor to the memory of the general and to the humanity of the nation  a little circumstance was talked of at that time and it deserves to be recorded as it shows a firmness of sentiment and a justness of thinking in the lower kind of people that is rarely met with even amongst persons of education the mother of general wolf was an object marked out for pity by great and peculiar distress the public wound pierced her mind with a particular affliction who had experienced the dutiful son the amiable domestic character whilst the world admired the accomplished officer within a few months she had lost her husband she now lost this son her only child the populace of the village where she lived unanimously agreed to admit no illuminations or firings or any other sign of rejoicing whatsoever near her house lest they should seem by an illtimed triumph to insult over her grief there was a justness in this and whover knows the people knows that they made no small sacrifice on this occasion  the ation which never suffers any public service to pass unrewded proceeded to honor the merits of the living and o the dead the minister himself made the motion for this purpose in the house of commons and all the force of eloquence was displayed in setting off these services in their proper light a magnificent monument was voted for the deceased general in westminster abbey the living generals and admirals received the greatest of honors the thanks of their country by their representatives  it is not known with certainty in what manner the french disposed of the remainder of their army after the battle of quebec it is probable that they retired toward montreal and trois rivieres the only places of any consequence which they had left in canada in order to deprive them of subsistence in any attempt they might be induced to make toward the recovery of quebec in the winter the country along the river was laid waste for a very considerable extent a measure which for the sake of humanity we could have wished not to have been found necessary  whilst the operations were thus successfully carried on in the river st laurence general amherst was not wanting in his endeavors on the side of lake champlain though the retreat of the french from crown point and ticonderoga had left him entirely master of lake george he found that the command of lake champlain was still an object of some difficulty mr bourlemaque who commanded in that part had retired to the isle de noix at the bottom of the lake where he had three thousand five hundred men strongly entrenched he had likewise four stout armed sloops by which he could easily defeat any attempts by boats  general amherst found it necessary to attain a naval superiority upon the champlain before he could hope to push his operations any further but this was a work of so much time that it made it absolutely impossible to attain the great end of the campaign the communication with general wolf who was left in the manner we have seen to the exertion of his single strength the naval preparations were not perfectly accomplished before the  0th of october they consisted of a great radeau eighty four feet in length and twenty in breadth which carried six twentyfour pounders the rest consisted of a brigantine and a sloop  covered by these the army was embarked in boats in a most excellent disposition and proceeded a considerable way up the lake were in hopes to weigh up the french appearing no where to oppose them the armed sloops returned to crown point soon after the troops  the memorable and vigorous campaign of      which made full amends for the inactivity of the former was thus happily closed by the taking of niagara ticonderago and above all quebec the french in the little remaining part of canada are invested upon every side the troops which they have under mr levy at montreal and those under mr bourlemaque at isle de noix can neither be recruited with men nor properly supplied with military stores all communication with france being cut off so that in the opening of the next campaign if they are attacked with vigor from the side of quebec whilst general amherst advances with his body by lake champlain of which he has now the entire dominion the resistance will be no more than sufficient to give reputation to the conquest and it will depend more upon our own sentiments of convenience what part of north america we shall leave to france than to any efforts they may make in that part of the world happy if our european system should so far concur as to leave us free to conclude a peace in america upon its own merits  chap viii prince henrys march into saxony general vehla defeated king of prussia enters saxony prussians defeated at maxen again defeated at meissen m daun occupies the camp at pirna munster surrenders to the allies hereditary prince of brunswick defeats the duke of wurtemburg at fulda march of the hereditary prince of brunswick to saxony  we took notice in the preceding part of our narrative of that movement of the king of prussia by which he got between the russians and great glogau and thereby baffled their design upon that important place this movement at once daring prudent and necessary hindered the russians from taking winter quarters in his dominions but at the same time it unavoidably cut off all communication with the army of prince henry  that prince seeing that he could not second the operations of the king his brother on the side of silesia contrived another expedient of cooperating with him which was immediately to direct his march toward saxony there was no object the possession of which was more interesting on that account it was very proper but this march answered also another end for it drew the attention of m daun to the side of saxony and disabled him from assisting the designs of the russians against glogau either with his whole army or with any considerable detachment from it the whole country of lusatia through which this projected march lay was in a manner overspread with the enemy m daun with the main army of the austrians lay at a place called sorau opposite to the princes camp five bodies of russians occupied as many advantageous posts between the bober and the neiss general laudohn possessed the whole country along the spree with several austrian corpse to get round m daun it was necessary to make a vast circuit and to march between the austrian and russian armies for more than sixty english miles  before the prince entered upon this arduous design by several bold movements he obliged m daun to retreat from sorau to gorlitz and from gorlitz as far as bautzen keeping himself as much as possible between the prince and saxony but his royal highness having perceived the direction in which m daun was moving made a compass to the northward of the austrians into the lower lusatia passed the neiss at rothenburg and marching with the utmost expedition arrived at hoyers werda in two days from his leaving his posts near zittau harrased continually tossed from hand to hand the sport of violence and fortune suffered equal distresses from its deliverers and its enemies  the prussian army from the beginning of this war has been particularly distinguished for its marches and there is certainly nothing in all the various operations of war which more particularly distinguishes good troops and able and spirited leaders but this march of prince henry over such a tract of country almost every where occupied by the enemy in so short a time and with so little loss is perhaps one of the most extraordinary and the best conducted of the marches that have been made by the prussian or any other army  this fortunate stroke together with the retreat of the russians afforded some hope that notwithstanding his repeated disasters the king of prussia might still conclude the campaign to his advantage the detachments under finck and wunsch had no sooner entered misnia than they attained a superiority over the united armies of austria and the empire all the places which in so short a time they had seized in as short a time were reduced to the obedience of their former masters wunsch had engaged their army and defeated one of its wings this victory gave them the possession of every thing to the gates of dresden the only town which remained to the enemy of all those they had taken they found themselves unable to prevent prince henry from passing the elbe they found themselves unable to prevent general hulsen from coming to his relief with a considerable detachment they ound themselves unable to prevent the king from joining himself to those when  it is true that m daun was superior to him in numbers and yet more so in situation he could at any time take possession of the famous camp at pirna where he could not be attacked with any prospect of success but then the freezing of the elbe the snow on the mountains which divide bohemia from saxony and the continual molestations which might be expected from the prussian parties made this situation as dangerous in some respects as it was desirable in others  it was the opinion of many that these advantages on the side of the king of prussia well pursued without aiming at more would in a short time infallibly have obliged m daun to relinquish his strong post and to retire into bohemia abandoning dresden and with it all the fruits of his victorious campaign but the king possessed by an idea of the ill situation of the austrians thought that advantages of greater moment and more decisive might he drawn from it he knew that the passes into bohemia were so difficult that by some posts properly chosen and strongly guarded the subsistence of the austrians might be made impracticable and even their retreat rendered so difficult that m daun would find himself compelled to fight at a disadvantage and to put to the hazard of the field all that his caution and prudence had been so long and so painfully procuring  upon this plan the king having obliged m daun to retreat as far as plauen advanced himself as far as kesseldorf and ordered general finck with a strong corpse to turn the austrians and seize the defiles of maxen and ottendorf through which alone it seemed possible for the austrians to communicate with bohemia this was so successfully executed that there appeared no doubt that the king had effectually secured one of his principal objects and had placed daun between two fires  whilst the prussians enjoyed this security m daun who was aware of their design had so occupied all the eminences about this rough and dangerous place and all the passes into it that the prussians were hardly attacked when their defeat seemed inevitable it is probable that they had got too far into these defiles and had not taken proper measures to secure a retreat or any sort of communication with the grand army they became too late sensible of their situation and they made for a whole day the most intrepid efforts to disengage themselves from it but they were foiled in every attempt with considerable loss of men and of the most part of their artillery  night put a stop to the engagement the austrians employed it effectually to entangle the prussians by guarding with double strength and vigilance every avenue through which it was possible for them to escape so that when the morning appeared  it was unquestionably the greatest blow which the prussians had felt from the beginning of the war considering the critical time the numbers taken and the loss of reputation which arose from the manner in which they were taken it is no wonder that such an extraordinary advantage thus cheaply obtained should greatly have elevated the friends of the house of austria they had put the cheat upon the prussians they had caught their enemy in the very trap which they had laid as they thought with such address for them they had now received a full indemnification for the capture of the saxon army which had surrendered in much the same manner and very near this place in the year       the king of prussia had not time to recover from this stroke under which he was yet staggering when he received another blow and a severe one general durceke was posted at the right of the elbe opposite to meissen  m daun was not so carried away with this flood of success as to depart in the least degree from his usual cautious management two advantages were now obtained which with a very few efforts might be improved to the entire destruction of the king of prussia at least many generals would have thought so but m daun thought that the same conduct which with no risque and with little loss had reduced the king so low was the most likely if pursued to bring on his entire ruin he resolved to give that monarch no sort of chance to recover his fortune daun after the two great victories he had himself newly obtained retired behind dresden and as if he had been beaten as often as he was victorious he took refuge in the impregnable camp at pirna having so disposed matters that the king of prussia now to weak to send out any great detachments could not prevent his communication with bohemia  whilst the king of prussia carried on his unsuccessful campaign in saxony through all the rigours of the severest winter for many years felt in europe the army of the allies kept the field with better fortune it is true things had been so disposed by the obstinate resistance of munster and the reinforcements which arrived in the french army that prince ferdinand did not find himself in a condition to force them to a decisive action and therefore the situation of the two armies had continued much the same for a considerable time at length munster after a series of operations sometimes a siege sometimes a blockade now broken off and now resumed  not long after this the hereditary prince of brunswick all whose enterprises are distinguished with a peculiar eclat and splendour that mark them for his own performed a service that curbed the french even more than the loss of munster prince charles of bevern was also engaged in this design  the duke of wurtemburg had renewed his treaty of subsidy with france and having recruited and augmented his troops he lay at fulda a great way to the right of the french army the hereditary prince formed a design to attack him at that distance  on the   th of november taking a small but well chosen corpse of horse and foot and disengaging them from their baggage he arrived in two days at fulda where the wurtemburgers enjoyed themselves in full security a feu de joye had been ordered for that day the troops were all in their best clothes the duke had invited all the ladies in the town to his table and to a ball which he intended to have given that very day but the hereditary prince disconcerted their measures both of war and diversion a large party of the wurtemburg troops were posted in a plain before the town the hereditary prince fell upon them unawares in their front and flank and drove them into the town into which he closely pursued them here they made some appearance of maintaining their ground for some minutes but they were soon driven out on the other side and hotly pursued by the prince of brunswick without the town they were met by prince charles of bevern who had made a compass about the place and attacked them vigorously as soon as they had got out of it four battalions made some resistance and were all cut to pieces or made prisoners the rest with the duke himself covered by the resistance of these battalions made a shift to escape above a thousand prisoners were made on this occasion and the prince returned to the camp of the allies after having effectually disabled this corpse from performing any thing considerable and this action was of the greatest consequence as by the disposition of that corpse at fulda there was an appearance as if the french meant to form a communication with the army of the empire for the mutual extension and security of their winter quarters  this enterprise was only the prelude to another which promised to be much more extensive in its consequences the season was now grown too severe to suffer the allies to push any further the advantages they had obtained over the french at the same time it disabled the french from attempting any thing considerable against them besides these advantages of the season by possessing munster the allies were no longer obliged to keep so large a body of men in westphalia these were the considerations which suffered prince ferdinand to turn his eyes to the distressed state of the king of prussias affairs after the two great blows which that monarch had suffered there was no hope of dislodging m daun with his single force and he was utterly unable to avail himself as heretofore of the rigor of the season to strike a decisive blow prince ferdinand distant as he was from his distressed ally and so near to an enemy superior in numbers did not hesitate to send him succors to enable him if possible to make a final effort he detached therefore   000 of his best men and placed them under the command of the hereditary prince with whose vigor and diligence he was perfectly acquainted and under whom he knew the soldiers would endure any hardship with cheerfulness they marched from korsdorff  this junction raised for a while the spirits and hopes of the prussian army but in effect it did more honor to the abilities of the hereditary prince than service to the king the season which fought equally against all sides the inaccessible camp at pirna and the caution of m daun rendered it impossible for the king notwithstanding this reinforcement to make any attempt so that after several movements in hopes of bringing the austrians to an engagement he was obliged at length to desist and to suffer the shattered remains of his army to repose in winter quarters after the fruitless fatigues of so long so laborious and so bloody a campaign  the king of prussia did not derive the benefits that were expected from this detachment the french had no sooner notice of it than they attempted to avail themselves of the weakness it caused in the allied army the duke of broglio was now at the head of the french troops he had lately returned from versailles having ruined the character of m de contades established his own removed his rival and in spite of seniority had acquired the marshals staff and the command of the army he thought he had now an opportunity for an action of eclat to distinguish his entrence into command he attempted to attack prince ferdinand by surprise but finding him perfectly prepared  chap ix the preparations at vannes and breast the english fleet driven from their station the action near belleisle french fleet defeated war in the east indies in      french fleet under m dache twice beaten m de lally takes fort st davids and repulsed at tanjour lays siege to madrass obliged to raise the siege conclusion of the annals of       the severity of the winter could not put a stop to the operations of the land armies it had no more effect upon the operations at sea which went on with vigor in spite of the inclemency of the season the invasion projected by france which the engagement off cape lagos had retarded was by no means laid aside  the preparations for a naval equipment in the harbor of breast and for transporting a body of forces from vannes went on continually the winter did not delay these preparations because it was hoped that in that season the british fleet might be obliged to take refuge in their own harbors and thus might afford an opportunity for the french fleet to come out unopposed and to execute the object of their destination before the british navy could be in readiness to encounter them  in fact they were not wholly disappointed in their expectations a violent storm forced sir edward hawke to quit his station off breast he came with his whole fleet to anchor in torbay  the french fleet availed itself of his absence to put to sea  and now the event of the whole war was put to the issue for upon the good or ill success of this stroke every thing depended admiral hawke lost not a moments time to put again to sea  it is impossible here to pass over the gallant behavior of one of our admirals as it helps to mark the genius and spirip of this happy time and as this is one of the finest instances of it admiral saunders came into port from his quebec expedition immediately after hawke had sailed after such a long voyage and so severe a campaign unbroken by fatigue and still insatiated with glory he determined immediately to set sail again and partake the honor and danger of the coming engagement for this purpose no time was to be lost and he had no orders but he thought the exigencies of his country sufficient orders and he knew that at this time the letter of military discipline would never be set against its spirit he therefore set sail without waiting for orders with ten ships but fortune did not favor the generosity of his intentions and he did not join the british fleet time enough for the engagement  as sir edward hawke concluded that the first rendezvous of the enemys fleet would be at quiberon he directed his course with all diligence for that bay but here again fortune for a while seemed to declare for the french for a strong wind blown in an easterly point drove the english fleet a great way to the westward but at length it became more favorable and bore them in directly to the shore about eight oclock the headmost ships discovered the enemy bearing to the northward between the island of belleisle and the main land of france  hawke saw at last what he had so long and so ardently wished for though hitherto in vain the enemy in his reach but yet there were such difficulties in his way as would have checked a very cautious commander or perhaps any commander in circumstances less critical to the public safety on the slightest inspection of the chart it will appear that all this sea is sown thick with sands and shoals and shallows and rocks our pilots were by no means well acquainted with it and the wind blew little less than a violent storm and the waves ran mountain high in these circumstances they were to attack a very strong squadron of the enemy on their own coast with which they were perfectly acquainted all these difficulties only animated the english admiral in one of the finest ships in the world commanding the flower of the british navy and seconded by some of the most tried and bravest officers in the service and above all not dubious of himself he ordered the ships nearest the enemy immediately to chase and by engaging them to give time for the rest of the fleet to come up  m conflans had two choices either to fly or to stand and fight it out but he followed neither perfectly for some time he appeared as if he meant to fight but after giving the british ships time to come near him when it was too late he crowded all the sail he could carry at the same time he showed an attention to keep his squadron together  at half an hour after two the action began with great fury in two hours the enemy had lost three ships of the line one struck two were sunk outright hawke ordered his ship to reserve her fire to pass by all the others and to be laid along side of the soleil royal the best ship in the french navy and commanded by m de conflans the master remonstrated on the almost inevitable danger of the coast hawke answered you have done your duty in this remonstrance now obey my orders and lay me along side the french admiral a french ship of  0 guns generously put himself between them hawke was obliged to bestow here the fire he had reserved for a greater occasion and at one broadside sunk her to the bottom the headmost of the english ships fired on the enemy as they came up to them and then passed on to others leaving those behind to improve their success and destroy or take them and by this method they had got up quite to the van of the enemy and would have totally destroyed their fleet had not night interposed to save them before night came on the enemys fleet was much dispersed but in the eagerness of the pursuit two of the english ships unfortunately run upon a sand called the four and were lost the enemy fled in to their own coast seven ships of the line threw overboard all their guns and escaped into the river villain about as many more got out to sea and made for other ports  nothing could be conceived more dreadful than the night which succeeded this action a violent storm blew all night long it was a pitchy darkness a dangerous coast surrounded them on almost all sides a continual firing of distress guns was heard without knowing whether they came from friend or enemy and on account of the badness of the coast and the darkness of the night our people were equally unable to venture to their assistance  when morning came on they found the french admiral had run his ship and another called the heroes on shore the first was set on fire by the enemy the other by our seamen thus concluded this remarkable action c in which the french had four capital ships destroyed one taken and the whole of their formidable navy in which consisted the last hope of their marine shattered disarmed and dispersed the long threatened invasion which was to repair their losses in every part of the world was dissipated and the credit of their arms broken along with their forces the behavior of the english captains and seamen on the contrary added as much to the glory of the british arms as to the safety of their country perhaps there never was a naval engagement of such extent in which no captain was accused nor even in any degree suspected of misbehaviour or cowardice in which those who engaged and those who did not gave proofs that they were equally ardent in the service of their country  sir edward hawkes letter to mr clevland secretary to the admiralty royal george off penris point nov    sir in my letter of the   th by express i desired you would acquaint their lordships with my having received intelligence of    sail of the ine and three frigates of the breast squadron being discovered about    leagues to the n w of belleisle steering to the eastward all the prisoners however agree that on the day we chased them their squadron consisted according to the accompanying list of four ships of  0 six of    three of  0 eight of    one frigate of    one of    and one of    guns with a small vessel to look out they sailed from breast the   th inst the same day i sailed from toybay  concluding that their first rendevous should be quiberon the instant i received the intelligence i directed my course thither with a pressed sail at the first wind blowing hard at s by e and s drove us considerably to the westward but on the   th and   th though variable it proved more favorable in the mean time having been joined by the maidstone and coventry frigates i directed their commanders to keep a head of the squadron one on the starboard and the other on the larboard bow at half past eight oclock in the morning of the  0th belleisle by our reckoning bearing e by n one fourth n the maidstone made the signal for seeing a fleet i immediately spread abroad the signal for a line abreast in order to draw all the ships of the squadron up with me i had before sent the magnanime a head to make the land at three fourths past nine she made signal for an enemy observing on my discovering them that they made off i threw out the signal for the seven ships nearest them to chase and draw into a line of battle ahead of me and endeavor to stop them till the rest of the squadron should come up who were also to form as they chased that no time might be lost in the pursuit that morning there were in chase the rochester chatham portland falkland minerva vengeance and venus all which joined me about eleven oclock and in the evening the sapphire from quiberon bay all the day we had very fresh gales at n w and w n w with heavy squalls  m conflans continued going off under such sail as his squadron could carry and at the same time keep together while we crowded after them with every sail our ships could bear at half part two p m the fire beginning ahead i made the signal for engaging we were then to the southward of belleisle and the french admiral headmost soon after led round the cardinals rocks so called  while his rear was in action about four oclock the formidable struck and a little after the thesee and superb were sunk about five the heroes struck and came to an anchor but it blowing hard no boat could be sent on board her night was now come and being on a part of the coast among islands and shols of which we were totally ignorant without a pilot as was the greatast part of the squadron and blowing hard on a ee shore i made the signal to anchor and came to in fifteen fathom water the island of dumer bearing e by n between two and three miles the cardinals w half s and the steeples of crozie s e as we found next morning  in the night we heard many guns of distress fired but blowing hard want of knowledge of the coast and whether they were fired by a friend or an enemy prevented all means of relief  by daybreak of the   st we discovered one of our ships dismasted ashore on our four a sand bank  the french heroes also and the soleil royal which under cover of the night had anchored among us cut and run ashore to the westward of crozie on the latters moving i made the essexs signal to slip and pursue her but she unfortunately got upon the four and both she and the resolution are irrecoverably lost notwithstanding we sent them all the assistance that the weather would permit about fourscore of the resolutions company in spite of the strongest remonstrahces of their captain made rafts and with several french prisoners belonging to the formidable put off and i am afraid drove out to sea all the essexs are saved with as many of the stores as possible except one lieutenant and a boats crew who were drove on the french shore and have not been heard of the remains of both ships have been set on fire we found the dorsetshire revenge and defiance in the night of the  0th put out to sea as i hope the swiftsure did for she is still missing the dorsetshire and defiance returned next day and the latter saw the revenge without thus what loss we have sustained has been owing to the weather not the enemy seven or eight of whose line of battle ships got to sea i believe the night of the action  as soon as it was broad daylight in the morning of the   st i discovered seven or eight of the enemys line of battle ships at anchor between point penris and the river villain on which i made the signal to weigh in order to work up and attack them but it blowed so hard from the n w that instead of daring to cast the squadron loose i was obliged to strike top gallant masts most of those ships appeared to be aground at low water but on the flood by lightening them and the advantage of the wind under the land all except two got that night into the river villain  the weather being moderate on the   d i sent the portland chatham and vengeance to destroy the soleil royal and heroes the french on the approach of our ships set the first on fire and soon after the latter met the same fate from our people in the mean time i got under way and worked up within penris point as well for the sake of its being a safer road as to destroy if possible the two ships of the enemy which still lay without the villain but before the ships i sent ahead for that purpose could get near them being quite light and with the tide of flood they got in  all the   d we were employed in reconnoitring the entrance of that river which is very narrow and only twelve feet water on the bar at low water we discovered at least seven if not eight line of battle ships about half a mile within quite light and two large frigates moored across to defend the mouth of the river only the frigates appeared to have guns in  by evening i had twelve long boats fitted as fireships ready to attempt burning them under convoy of the sapphire and coventry but the weather being bad and the wind contrary obliged me to defer it till at least the latter should be favorable if they can by any means be destroyed it shall be done  in attacking a flying enemy it was impossible in the space of a short winters day that all our ships should be able to get into action or all those of the enemy brought to it the commanders and companies of such as did come up with the rear of the french on the  0th behaved with the greatest intrepidity and gave the strongest proof of a true british spirit in the same manner i am satisfied would those have acquitted themselves whose bad going ships or the distance they were at in the morning prevented from getting up our loss by the enemy is not considerable for in the ships which are now with me i find only one lieutenant and    seamen and marines killed and about  0  wounded when i consider the season of the year the hard gales of wind on the day of action a flying enemy the shortness of the day and the coast we are on i can boldly affirm that all that possibly could be done has been done as to the loss we have sustained let it be placed to the necessity i was under of running all risks to break this strong force of the enemy had we had but two hours more daylight the whole had been totally destroyed or taken for we were almost up with their van when night overtook us  yesterday came in here the pallas fortune sloop and the proserpine fireship on the   th i had dispatched the fortune to quebec with directions to captain duff to keep directly on his guard in his way thither he fell in with the phebe a french frigate of  0 guns under jurymasts and fought her several hours during the engagement lieutenant stuart  d of the ramilies whom i had appointed to command her was unfortunately killed the surviving officers on consulting together resolved to leave her as she proved too strong for them i have detached captain young to quiberon bay with five ships and am making up a flying squadron to scour the coast to the isle of aix and if practicable to attempt any of the enemys ships that may be there  i am sir etc edward hawke  list of ships with sir edward hawke nov  0      ships guns men commanders royal george  00   0 sir edward hawke capt

the express the fate of the enemy being determined he refused to be put on shore when the admiral declared his intentions of seeking the enemy but went with him as a volunteer  those who think such matters deserving of their notice have observed that this decisive naval engagement the surrender of the prussian troops at maxen and the taking of munster happened on the same day the  0th of november  this was the conclusion of the french affairs in europe the issue of the campaign in america had not been more favorable to them although the events in the east indies belong properly to the last year yet as the accounts did not arrive until this and that the actions there were of great importance and equally fortunate on our side it is proper that we should take some notice of them here  the english had by no means that superiority over the french in the east indies which they had in america it was here the french seemed to have made those efforts by which they hoped in some degree to balance their losses in other parts they had a very strong squadron under m dache in those seas m de lally an officer of credit and of greater rank than had usually been sent on that service commanded a body of  000 europeans a great army in a country where the name of an european is itself a strength  in the beginning their success seemed proportioned to their forces they took the fort and city of st davids but in a very short time the ill star of france which in no part of the world set well on their affairs began to influence them here m dache in two naval engagements was worsted and prevented from cooperating with the land forces for the rest of the campaign and had the spirit and conduct of admiral pococke been as well seconded by some of his captains as it was by others there is great reason to believe that the french naval power had been as effectually destroyed in those seas as it had been in those of europe  notwithstanding these checks it was necessary that m lally should act but it was not only the disgrace of the french fleet but an extreme want of money which delayed his operations a prince of the country the king of tanjour appeared the only resource which was open to this prince he applied for a considerable sum of money which being absolutely refused he carried the war into his dominions and laid siege to his capital city but after lying several days before it and after having even made a practicable breach the skill of some english gunners the want of provisions and ammunition and the disorders which reigned in his army obliged him to return without the money and with the mortification of being beaten from a place only fortified after the indian manner  this failure in their pecuniary expectations and their repulse from an indian town were bad encouragements to the undertaking of an enterprise against an european enemy and a fortification in some degree regular but having seized upon a dutch vessel as it is thought much with its own consent which contained a large treasure they set out at length to besiege madrass but here their success was no better than at tanjour though their strength was greater and their efforts much more obstinate  colonel draper and major brereton defended the place with the utmost skill and bravery mr pigot likewise with equal generosity and prudence seconded their endeavors by the supplies of stores and ammunition which were admirably distributed and cooperated with the military with a firmness and intrepidity by which he obtained an honor equal to any in the defense of the place whilst the town was defended with great spirit within parties were continually sent out which so infested the roads through which the enemys convoys were to pass that their army in the trenches were infinitely weakened by the detachments which they were obliged to send out after a siege of more than two months they were obliged to abandon their enterprise and by that means renounce for ever all those sanguine hopes which they had entertained from the forces in this part of the world the english on the contrary went on from success to success whilst they defeated the french on the eastern coast of the great peninsula of india on the western they took the great and opulent city of surat from the powers of the country with very little loss  general lally left madrass in the utmost transports of rage and despair which a man of honor and ability in his profession can feel who is ill seconded by his troops neglected by those who ought to support him and cheated by the villainy of contractors and of all those who turn war into a low traffic a genesis lallys letter to m de lyrit dated madrass the   th of february      a good blow might be struck here there is a ship in the road of  0 guns laden with all the riches of madrass which it is said will remain there till the  0th the expedition is just arrived but m gorlin is not a man to attack her for she has made him run away once before the bristol on the other hand did but just make her appearance before st thomas and on the vague report of thirteen ships coming from porto novo she took fright and after landing the provisions with which she was laden she would not stay long enough even to take on board twelve of her own guns which she had lent us for the siege  if i was the judge of the point of honor of the companys officers i would break him like glass as well as some others of them  the fidelle or harlem or even the aforesaid bristol with the twelve guns restored to her would be sufficient to make themselves masters of the english ship if they could manage so as to get to the windward of her in the night maugendie and tremillier are said to be good men and were they employed only to transport  00 wounded men that we have here their service would be of importance  we remain still in the same position the breach made these fifteen days all the time within fifteen toises of the wall of the place and never holding up our heads to look at it  i reckon we shall at our arrival at pondicherry endeavor to learn some other trade for this of war requires too much patience  of   00 cipays which attend our army i reckon near  00 are employed upon the road to pondicherry laden with sugar pepper and other goods and as for the caulis they are all employed for the same purpose from the first day we came here  i am taking my measures from this day to set fire to the black town and to blow up the powder mills  you will never imagine that  0 french deserters and  00 swiss are actually stopping the progress of  000 men of the kings and companys troops which are still here existing notwithstanding the exaggerated accounts that every one makes here according to his own fancy of the slaughter that has been of them and you will be still more surprised if i tell you that were it not for the two combats and four battles we sustained and for the batteries which failed or to speak more properly which were unskilfully made we should not have lost  0 men from the commencement of the siege to this day  i have wrote to m de larche that if he persists in not coming here let who will raise money upon the paleagers for me i will not do it and i renounce as i informed you a month ago i would do meddling directly or indirectly with any thing whatever that may have relation to your administration whether civil or military for i had rather go and command the caffres of madagascar than remain in this sodom which it is impossible but the fire of the english must destroy sooner or later even though that from heaven should not  i have the honor to be etc etc signed lally p s i think it necessary to apprize you that as m de soupire has refused to take upon him the command of this army which i have offered to him and which he is empowered to accept by having received from the court a duplicate of my commission you must of necessity together with the council take it upon you for my part i undertake only to bring it back either to arcotte or sadraste send therefore your orders or come yourself to command it for i shall quit it upon my arrival there     his letter is a strong and very striking picture of these agitations and certainly it is worthy of remark that every where there should appear something more unaccountably wrong and weak in the management of the french than has been in the conduct of that or almost any other nation at any time it seems to argue an essential and radical fault in some superior part of their government more easily indeed visible in its consequences than discoverable in its cause  in europe they received offers of peace from the kings of great britain and prussia but as they did not expect from their situation very advantageous or honorable terms they resolved to act in one instance the roman part and still hold out determined to hazard the last extremities perhaps hoping something favorable from the fortune of their allies since their own had deserted them and resolving to contract their plan and to make one strong effort in one part rather than unprofitably to waste their strength upon severeal inferior objects this effort could be made with any prospect of success only in germany a a the duc de belleisles letter to marshal contades dated versailles july         jai toujours peur que fischer ne soit parti trop tard il est cependant bien important et bien essentiel que nous puissions tirer de grosses contributions je ne vois de ressources pour nos depenses les plus urgentes et pour les reparations des troops que dans largent que nous pourrous avoir du pais enemy dou il faudra egalement tirer des subsistances de toutes especes independamment de largent cest a dire des foins des pailles des avoines pour lhyver des bleds des bestiaux des chevaux et meme des hommes pour recruter toutes nos troops etrangeres la guerre ne doit pas etre prolongee et peutetre faudratil suivant les evenemens qui arriveront dici a la fin de septembre fair un veritable desert en avaunt de la ligne des quartiers que lonjugera a propos de tenir pendant lhyver afin que lennemi se trouve dans une impossibilite reelle den pouvoir aprocher en nous reservant de la subsistence seulement sur la route qui pourra nous convenir de prendre dans le milieu de lhyver pour culbuter ou enlevert nous memes les quartiers des ennemis cest pour pouvoir remplir cet objet que je fais travailler sans ralache a tout ce quil faut pour que toutes vos troops sans exception soient bien habillees bien armees bien equipees et bien reparees en tout point avaunt la fin de novembre avec des tents neuves pourque si cela convient aux affairs politiques ou militaires du roy vous puissiez assembler le tout ou party de votre armee pour agir offensivement et avec viguer des le commencement de janvier et que vous ayez la satisfaction de montrer a nos ennemis et a toute leurope que les francois scavent agir et fair la guerre en toutes saisons quand ils ont un general tell que vous et un ministre militaire qui scait prevoir et se concerter avec le general  vous sentez mons le marechal que ce que je vous dis peut devenir non seulment utile et honorable mais peutetre meme necessaire relativement a ce que vous scavez et dont jevous parlerai encore dans ma lettre particuliere  i am still afraid that fischer set out too late it is however very important and very essential that we should raise large contributions i see no other resource for our most urgent expenses and for refitting the troops but in the money we may draw from the enemys country from whence we must likewise procure subsistence of all kinds independently of the money that is to say hay straw oats for the winter bread corn cattle horses and even men to recruit our foreign troops the war must not be prolonged and perhaps it may be necessary according to the events which may happen between this time and the end of september to make a downright desert before the line of the quarters which it may be thought proper to keep during the winter in order that the enemy may be under a real impossibility of approaching us at the same time reserving for ourselves a bare subsistence on the route which may be the most convenient for us to take in the middle of winter to beat up or seize upon the enemys quarters that this object may be fulfilled i cause the greatest assiduity to be used in preparing what is necessary for having all your troops without exception well clothed well armed well equipped and well refitted in every respect before the end of november with new tents in order that if it shall be advisable for the kings political and military affairs you may be able to assemble the whole or part of your army to act offensively and with vigor from the beginning of january and that you may have the satisfaction to show our enemies and all europe that the french know how to act and carry on war in all seasons when they have such a general as you are and a minister of the department of war that can foresee and concert matters with the general  you must be sensible sir that what i say to you may become not only useful and honorable but perhaps even necessary with respect to what you know and of which i shall say more in my private letters  sign m duc de belleisle   but the supplies necessary for this great charge were difficult to a nation whose trade was wholly destroyed on this occasion they did not scruple to break in upon the public faith and to find supplies for one year in an expedient that struck at the sources of all future credit they stopped the payment on many public bills and funds the french court stopped payment of the following public debts viz   the three kinds of rents created on the posts   those constituted upon the chest of redemption   the coupons of bills on the same chest   those of the two royal lotteries   the reimbursement of bills drawn to bearer on the same chest   the bills of the two royal lotteries   the rents created on the two sols per pound of the tenth penny   the reimbursement of the capitals of rents   the payments of bills dischargeable in nine years under the name of annuities  0 those of the new actions on the benefit of the farms    all the bills drawn by the colonies upon the government amounting to     000 l  the king threw in his own plate into the public stock as an example and a request that others should contribute in the same manner from their private fortune to the necessities of the state though several of the nobility and many churches and convents sent in their plate there was yet a general backwardness to give into this method of supply and to trust the public with so considerable part of their substance at the instant when they saw it so notoriously break its faith in other particulars  however these resources such as they are will enable them to keep the war on foot they turn their whole attention to germany where they have very greatly augmented their army and placed it under a general from whom they have some hopes after their repeated disappointments and the frequent changes they have made they propose also another army under the prince de soubise if they can compass this latter project as it is believed they may the system of germany is still in very imminent danger for notwithstanding the tried goodness of our troops and the admirable commander at the head of them it is certain even with any reinforcements we may be able to send we shall find it very difficult to contend with two armies supposing that we shall have no other than french armies to contend with and that the king of prussia should be able as he has hitherto been to find employment for the many the powerful and the implacable enemies that surround him  it is certain he is much reduced and that his resources are nearly exhausted these are facts which cannot be concealed and yet some glimmering of hopes may be still perceived when we consider the admirable talents for war and government which that monarch possesses and when we consider even the events of the last to him unfortunate campaign where after having suffered four capital defeats and having obtained no one considerable advantage he has yet continued in some sort superior in the field the enemy has not been able to make the least impression upon his dominions and he has at last more than divided saxony with them the city of dresden is all that they possess in that country and the acquisition of which has been the only fruit f four campaigns and four victories in one campaign and the efforts of the united forces of austria russia and the empire to say nothing of france and sweden  as for great britain she has only to fear from her connections in no one year since she was a nation has she been favored with so many successes both by sea and land and in every quarter of the globe nor have her officers both by sea and land ever done more honor to their country by their skill and bravery and with regard to the internal administration it suffices to say that whilst france became bankrupt without delay or murmuring there have been more than six millions borrowed in england at a very easy rate and that the interest on this immense sum has been made good by a single tax upon malt which will scarce be felt by the people by this the resources of england may be imagined especially if we consider that highly as we are taxed for the necessary charges of the war we have not been prevented from great and expensive voluntary exertions of public spirit and beneficence the cities of london and westminster and after their example other towns made a large subscription for enlisting soldiers subscriptions were also carried on to a great amount for clothing the enemies prisoners abandoned through the neglect or poverty of their sovereign and for administering to the relief of the families of those who had fallen in the battles of quebec and minden thus actuated by the warmest patriotism which far from extinguishing seemed to kindle a beneficence toward our enemies in their distress  the condition of europe which all people thought would have been decided in this campaign is nearly as dubious as ever and the difficulties which oppose themselves to a peace are rather augmented than diminished here then we close the scene and conclude the events of the present year in the next we hope notwithstanding appearances after so many scenes of horror to have the more pleasing task of relating the steps taken to a general peace on terms as particularly advantageous to our

the several powers concerned great britain and prussia propose an accommodation difficulties in concluding a peace the condition and hopes of france demands on the king of prussia treaty said to be between russia and austria  if all the wars which have harrassed europe for more than a century had not proved it the events of the last campaigns must have satisfied every thinking man that victories do not decide the fate of nations four most bloody and to all appearance most ruinous defeats which he suffered in that year had despoiled the king of prussia of no more than a single town after these accumulated blows he still found himself in a condition to make good his winter quarters to cover his dominions and to tempt the favor of fortune in another campaign  to carry our attention a little further back who could have imagined that when the french had compelled the hanoverian troops to lay down their arms when they had thrust them into a defenseless corner had bound them down with the yoke of a strict and severe capitulation and had possessed themselves of every place which could boast the smallest share of strength in the kings german dominions that in a few months they should find themselves compelled to fly before their captives and after having suffered a considerable defeat should be pushed back almost on their own territories  on the other hand it might have been supposed that the effects of these advantages under the management of a very great commander who was besides largely reinforced could have been frustrated only by the loss of some great battle but the fact was otherwise the hanoverians without any adverse stroke in that campaign were obliged to repass the rhine and the lip and since that time fortune having decided nothing by the events of five years war has given to prince ferdinand the possession of a great part of westphalia in the manner of a conquered country and yet sees him abandoning hesse and with difficulty covering the borders of hanover  in short the victory of crevelt could not enable the duke of brunswick to defend the rhine the battle of bergen did not give m broglio an entrance into hanover the great victory of minden did not drive the french from the maine we have seen armies after complete victory obliged to act as if they had been defeated and after a defeat taking an offensive part with success and reaping all the fruits of victory  these reflections are still more strongly enforced by the fortune of the king of prussia covered with the laurels of lowositz prague rosbach and lissa when he began after so many complete triumphs to pursue his advantages and to improve success into conquest the scene was suddenly altered as soon as he attempted to penetrate with effect into the enemies country without having suffered any very signal blow without any considerable mistake committed upon his side fortune who has as it were attached herself to the defensive immediately forsook him he was not able to take a single place and those advantages which at other times and situations would have laid the foundation of lasting empire have in his case only protracted a severe destiny which some think in the end inevitable but which as many as great and as entire victories since obtained over his forces have not been yet able to bring upon him  the balance of power the pride of modern policy and originally invented to preserve the general peace as well as freedom of europe has openly preserved its liberty it has been the original of innumerable and fruitless wars that political torture by which powers are to be enlarged or abridged according to a standard perhaps not very accurately imagined ever has been and it is to be feared will always continue a cause of infinite contention and bloodshed the foreign ambassadors constantly residing in all courts the negotiations incessantly carrying on spread both confederacies and quarrels so wide that whenever hostilities commence the theater of war is always of a prodigious extent all parties in those diffusive operations have of necessity their strong and weak sides what they gain in one part is lost in another and in conclusion their affairs become so balanced that all the powers concerned are certain to lose a great deal the most fortunate acquire little and what they do acquire is never in any reasonable proportion to charge and loss  frequent experience of this might prove one of the strongest grounds for a lasting peace in europe but that spirit of intrigue which is the political distemper of the time that anxious foresight which forms the character of all the present courts prevent the salutary effects which might result from this experience these modern treaties of peace the fruits not of moderation but necessity those engagements contracted when all the parties are wearied and none satisfied where none can properly be called conquerors or conquered where after having sought in vain to compel they are content to overreach them in the very moment they are formed and from the very act of forming them with the seeds of new dissentions more implacable animosities and more cruel wars for if to forward the work of peace any member in these alliances should acquire a cession of any importance in its favor this afterward becomes a ground for another alliance and for new intrigues to deprive them of their acquisition to settle the peace of germany silesia was yielded in      to the king of prussia and that cession gave occasion for the war of       the kings of great britain and prussia chose the moment of success to propose an accommodation and they desired that the opposite powers should concur with them in nominating some place for a congress some spoke of leipsic as a means of indemnification to that unfortunate city the states general would have given a town of theirs king stanislaus offered nancy his capital but the time of peace was not yet come the two kings made a display of moderation and they had reason to think that if their proposals should be accepted which probably they did not then expect they must naturally take the lead in that negotiation and must give the whole a turn to their advantage but the adverse alliance unanimously rejected their efforts and the refusal of some of its members was couched in terms sufficiently haughty  to speak impartially they could not at that time have accepted propositions for peace france had suffered in every quarter in her present condition she could scarcely look for every favorable terms as they had now abandoned in despair all attempts by sea and consequently all efforts in north america and both the indies all their hopes were centered in germany hitherto their fortune in that country had not been very encouraging but still in that country lay their best and indeed their only prospect the strength and perseverance of the two empresses the wasted condition of the king of prussia the enormous expense of the german war to england which must gradually exhaust the resources of her credit and with them the patience of an inconstant people had inspired with no small hope all these considerations confirmed their resolution of hearkening to no terms until by acquiring superiority or at least an equality they might be assured of procuring such as were not very disadvantageous or humiliating  the empress queen upon her part had a moral certainty that she could not procure by a treaty proposed at such a juncture those objects for which she had begun and with such steadiness in every fortune had carried on the war in reality her circumstances then were and they still continue very intricate and embarrassed it was necessary that she should have allies of great power but if they have done her great services they have formed high pretensions indeed so high that if she and her allies cannot absolutely prescribe the terms of peace it is impossible that they should all be in any degree satisfied  her situation in this respect has pushed ad internecionem the war between her and the king of prussia even the cession of all silesia in her favor cannot procure a peace for that monarch the russians will never let loose their hold of the ducal prussia a country conquered by their own arms a possession which rendered the king most formidable to them and which is their sole indemnification for what they have expended in a war entered into for other views than those of glory or even of revenge it has been confidently asserted that the empress queen of hungary has actually guarantied the possession of that country to its conquerors this is indeed a very extraordinary step and the fact is not sufficiently authenticated but the report is not altogether improbable we may be sure that if such a guarantee has been made it has been entered into upon some reciprocal engagement of equal force and for an object equally important  nothing but the last desperate necessity nothing in short but being conquered in the most absolute sense will ever induce the king of prussia to submit to both these cessions by such a submission beside being despoiled of that conquest which is the great glory of his reign and constitutes the firmest support of his revenue he will see his hereditary dominions curtailed of another province from whence he derives his royal title and what makes it of infinitely greater importance in his eyes the best commercial part of his territories and that only part of his territories by which he could have hoped to become in any degree a maritime power  but though it were possible that his prussian majesty could be brought to submit to these humiliating terms a great deal still remains to be adjusted there are other demands which though not so high in their nature nor so strongly enforced are notwithstanding considerable and cannot with any decency be totally neglected what is the nature of the bargain between the empress and the senate of sweden has not yet been made public be it what it will this is probably the least perplexing part of the whole  but some indemnification for the king of poland on whose dominions the greatest calamities of the war have fallen seems absolutely necessary and on what principle can austria ever expect an ally if she should secure all the benefits of the pacification to herself and leave to her confederates nothing but the sufferings of a war in which they were involved purely in her quarrel  this variety of demands all to be satisfied out of the dominions of a single prince must necessarily perplex the work of peace with almost insurmountable difficulties it ought not indeed to be concealed that there are circumstances which seem to lead to some solution of this embarrassment but if they are attentively concerned they will i believe be rather found to increase it  great britain has had remarkable success against france at sea in america and in the indies on the continent of europe her fortune is even at this day tollerably balanced the two weak parts therefore in the opposite alliances i speak only with regard to the events of the present war are france and prussia as therefore france will expect some cessions from great britain it is reasonable that they should be bought by some moderation of the rigorous terms which otherwise would have been imposed on prussia  all the sacrifices to peace must be made out of the advantage acquired by austria and great britain but when great britain shall have consented to some concessions to forward this great work what return can the empress queen make but an abatement of her demands upon silesia that is by giving up that grand favorite and indeed to her sole object for which she has brought upon herself a heavy war disgusted her ancient and natural allies and purchased the aid of her natural enemy at the price of places which the best blood of europe has been so often shed to preserve in her family to all who consider the character of that court it will appear very plainly that she will hazard almost any thing and even risque those consequences to which her imprudent alliance with france has exposed her rather than accept a peace which must deprive her of her hopes of silesia  when these things are weighed it will not appear wonderful that there have been so few serious overtures for peace and that the longer the war continues the greater difficulties seem to oppose themselves to any conclusion of it  the only hope that remains of any happy conclusion is that some of the great members of the alliance wearied and exhausted will at length fly off and thereby throw the rest into such confusion that a peace will be suddenly huddled up and all difficulties not removed but forgotten by not allowing time to weigh and study what may be gained or lost this must produce a system of pacification the nature of which it is impossible to foresee because it cannot be said upon which side this defection will begin but principally because the war still continues in the event of which in spite of all that can be conjectured from the strength and present condition of the powers concerned fortune will have so large a share but we may predict without rashness that the first overtures will be between great britain and france for they never think of peace in germany  chap ii state of the english garrison at quebec designs of monslevi preparations for a siege french army marches from montreal their strength battle of sillery genesis murray defeated quebec besieged the english fleet under lord colville arrives french vessels destroyed levi raises the siege  this was the posture of europe at the close of the campaign of      and all thoughts of peace being entirely removed the war was prosecuted in this part of the world with the utmost vigor as soon as the season permitted them to recommence operations  but in america the severity of winter was not able wholly to interrupt the progress of the war canada had been supposed conquered by the taking of quebec indeed without the possession of that place it had been impossible to reduce that country but still a great deal remained to complete the advantage to which the taking of quebec had only given an opening the french troops after their defeat had retired into the heart of their country and the english navy having provided the town sufficiently with military stores and provisions set sail fearing lest they should be overtaken by the frost ten battalions two companies of the artillery one of american woodrangers in all about  000 men formed the garrison which was left in quebec to command canada during the winter and to facilitate the entire reduction of that province in the ensuing campaign they were under the orders of general murray  as the river st laurence is commonly shut up by ice for the greater part of the winter all communication with europe was cut off the conquering army was therefore subject to be invested in quebec the french commander m levi was sensible of this advantage and he saw that it was the only resource by which he could have any chance of preserving canada he accordingly prepared to make use of this last and only opportunity and he was not without some prospect of success  he knew that the fortifications of quebec were weak and incomplete without any kind of outwork that the town was almost a general ruin since the late siege and that the english garrison had been much enfeebled and greatly reduced in their numbers by the scurvy he knew also that by some misfortune no provision had been made to prevent his attaining a superiority on the river as no vessels had been left on a supposition that they could not be useful in winter  the winter had passed in skirmishes always terminating in favor of the english by which they enlarged the sphere of their subsistence m levi had indeed proposed during the rigor of the season to attempt the place by a coup de main and had made preparations for that purpose but the activity of the garrison was such and all the outposts so well secured that he thought it more prudent to abandon that design and to postpone his operations to the opening of the spring when a regular siege might be formed  the forces which still remained in canada were not unequal to the attempt ten battalions of regular troops amounting to near  000 men  000 of experienced militia of canada about  00 savages this was the force which m levi had collected at montreal and with which he took the field on the   th of april    0  his provisions ammunition and heavy baggage fell down the river st laurence under the convoy of six frigates from    to    guns by this squadron which there was nothing to oppose he acquired the undisputed command of the river a point of the greatest importance to the whole design in ten days march the french army arrived at the heights of abraham three miles from quebec  when genesis murray perceived the approach of the enemy he had two parts to take either to keep within the town and confiding in his troops which though weak as an army were strong as a garrison to sustain the siege to the utmost extremity or to march out and by trying the fortune of the field to avoid the tedious hardships of a siege in a place which seemed to him scarcely tenable  he resolved on the latter part but when he came to review his ability for this undertaking he could possibly draw into the field no more than  000 men however he was not frighted by the enemys great superiority he determined to engage and he grounded his resolution on the following reasons  first that his army notwithstanding its inferiority was in the habit of beating the enemy that they had a fine train of field artillery that to shut themselves up at once within the walls was putting all upon the single chance of holding out for a considerable time a wretched fortification a chance which an action in the field could hardly alter at the same time that it gave an additional one and perhaps a better and in fine that if the event was not prosperous he might after holding out to the last extremity retreat with what should remain of the garrison to the isle of orleans or coudres and there wait for reinforcements  it is not easy to comprehend the prudence of engaging in the open field an army four times superior especially when the weaker army had it in their power to keep upon the defensive in a strong post and quebec may well be considered at least as a strong retrenchment it is as hard to understand how the chance of holding out a fortress should not be lessened after a defeat of the troops which compose the garrison who must necessarily suffer by such an event both in numbers and in spirit it is equally difficult to conceive how the remains of that garrison which should be driven from quebec could have safely retreated to the isle of orleans or coudress or have remained in either of those places with any tolerable security whilst the enemy were as they were confessedly masters of the river these are matters not so easily comprehended by those who are at a distance from the scene of action there circumstances may have given these reasons their due weight and they had the greater influence from the character of the general a man of the most ardent and intripid courage passionately desirous of glory and emulous of the reputation wolf had acquired he knew that a bold and successful stroke and well pursued might so disable the enemy who were in no likelihood of receiving speedy or considerable succors from france that the way to conquest would lie plain and open before him and he might expect the honor of the total reduction of canada before the arrival of the rest of the kings forces to his assistance  thus depending on fortune on the tried goodness of his troops and his own courage to animate them he marched out of the city and descended from the heights of abraham with the army mentioned above and twenty fieldpieces the right and left of the enemys van possessed themselves of some small woody eminences the main army marched by the road of st foix and formed themselves under the shelter of the woods whilst the body of the enemies army was yet unformed the english troops attacked their van both on the right and left with the utmost impetuosity and drove them from the eminences though they were well maintained the advanced posts of the french center gave way without a blow and fell back upon their main army  hitherto the fortune of the field was favorable to the english but now the advantages they had obtained brought them full on the main army of the french which formed in columns and advanced with great rapidity to support their broken vanguard the fire became very hot and stopped the progress of our troops whilst those of the enemy having supported their center wheeled round the flanks of the british army to the left and right and formed a semicircle which threatened to close upon our rear proper movements were made to protect the flanks but it was evident the army was in the greatest danger not only of a defeat but of seeing itself surrounded and its retreat to quebec entirely intercepted near one thousand men soldiers and officers a third of the army had been by this time killed and wounded nothing could be now thought of but as speedy a retreat as possible and in this there were difficulties which nothing but the bravery of the soldiery and the skill and spirit of the officers could overcome they gained quebec with little loss in the pursuit but they were obliged to leave their cannon which they could not bring off on account of the wreaths of snow which even in this advanced season and in the temperate latitude of    still lay upon the ground the french lost at least  000 in the action  when the account of this victory arrived in europe the french were for a while infinitely elated the blow was sensibly felt in england our sanguine hopes were at once sunk if quebec was lost it was evident that the greatest difficulties must have arisen to our affairs in america and the reduction of canada must become the work of more than one campaign nobody imagined that the town could hold out longer after such a defeat and the fleet sent from europe to reinforce the place was then at a great distance  nevertheless all things were prepared at quebec for a vigorous defense the late check he had received only roused the governor to more strenuous efforts he knew that the loss of the place would be attributed to the temerity of his councils he was sensible that in proportion to the honors paid by the public to those who had conquered quebec would their indignation fall upon those by whom it should happen to be lost and that in general nothing makes a worse figure than a rashness which is not fortunate these thoughts were perpetual stings to a mind like his passionately desirous of glory and that very disposition which led him to fight unsuccessfully with a weak army gave him activity and success in the defense of a weak fortification  the french whose whole hope of success depended on perfecting their work before a british squadron could arrive lost not a moments time to improve their victory they opened trenches before the town the very night of the battle but it was the   th of may before they could bring two batteries to play upon the fortifications they were greatly deficient in this respect their accounts say they had no more than twelve pieces of iron artillery which carried twelve pound balls the english train was without comparison superior before the french had opened their batteries     pieces of cannon were placed on the ramparts the fire of the besiegers was therefore always slack interrupted and of little effect  notwithstanding the weakness of the enemies fire the superiority of the english artillery and the resolution of the governor and garrison the relief of the place depended entirely on the early arrival of the british fleet which was looked out for every hour with the most anxious expectation had any french ships of force come before the english it was the general opinion that the place must inevitably have fallen into their hands  on the  th of may to the great joy of the garrison an english frigate anchored in the basin and brought them an account that the british squadron commanded by lord colville was then in the river on the   th a ship of the line and a frigate arrived the next morning the two frigates were sent to attack the french squadron above the town they executed their commission so well that in a moment all the french vessels of whatever kind were dispersed and the greatest part destroyed or taken  m levi who had the mortification to behold from the eminences this action which at one stroke put an end to all the hopes he had conceived from the late victory was persuaded that these frigates by the boldness of their manner must have been the vanguard of a considerable reinforcement and that too close at hand he therefore raised the siege in the utmost hurry and precepitation leaving behind all his artillery and a great part of his ammunition and baggage although lord colville with the rest of the squadron did not arrive at quebec until two days aftera  the hon james murrays letter to mr secretary pit dated quebec may       0 sir having acquainted general amberst three weeks ago that quebec was besieged by an army of   000 men i think it necessary to do myself the honor of addressing directly to you the more agreeable news of the siege being raised lest by your receiving the former intelligence before the latter some inconvenience might arise to his majestys service  by the journal of my proceedings since i have had the command here which i have the honor to transmit to you you will perceive the superiority we have maintained over the enemy during the winter and that all lower canada from the point autremble was reduced and had taken the oath of fidelity to the king you will no doubt be pleased to observe that the enemys attempts upon our posts and ours upon theirs all tended to the honor of his majestys arms they were always baffled and we were constantly lucky  i wish i could say as much within the walls the excessive coldness of the climate and constant living upon salt provisions without any vegetables introduced the scurvy among the troops which getting the better of every precaution of the officer and every remedy of the surgeon became as universal as it was inveterate insomuch that before the end of april  000 were dead and above  000 of what remained totally unsit for service  in this situation i received certain intelligence that the chevalier de levis was assembling his army which had been cantoned in the neighborhood of montreal that he had completed his eight battallions and forty companies of the troops de colonie from the choice of the montrealists had formed these forty companies into four battalions and was determinad to besiege us the moment that st laurence was open of which he was entirely master by means of four kings frigates and other craft proper for this extraordinary river  as i had the honor to acquaint you formerly that quebec could be looked upon in no other light than that of a strong cantonment and that any works i should add to it would be in that style my plan of defense was to take the earliest opportunity of entrenching myself upon the heights of abraham which entirely commanded the ramparts of the place at the distance of  00 yards and might have been defended by our numbers against a large army but the chevalier de levis did not give me time to take the advantage of this situation the   d   th and   th of april i attempted to execute the projected lines for which a provision of fascines and of every necessary material had been made but found it impracticable as the earth was still covered with snow in many places and every where impregnably bound up by the frost  the night of the   th i was informed the enemy had landed at point au tremble  0000 men and  00 barbarians the post we had taken at the embouchure of the river caprouge the most convenient place for disembarking their artillery and stores and for securing their retreat obliged them to land where they did  0 miles higher up  the   th having broke down all the bridges over the caprouge and secured the landing places at sillery and the foulon i marched with the grenadiers piquets amhersts regiment and two field pieces and took post so advantageously as to frustrate the schemes they had laid of cutting off our posts they had begun to form from the defile they were obliged to pass but thought proper to retreat on reconnoitring our position and about four this afternoon we marched back to town having withdrawn all our posts with the loss of two men only though they did every thing in their power to harrass the rear  the enemy was greatly superior in number it is true but when i considered that our little army was in the habit of beating that enemy and had a very fine train of field artillery that shutting ourselves up at once within the walls was putting all upon the single chance of holding out for a considerable time a wretched fortification a chance which an action in the field could hardly alter at the same time it gave an additional one perhaps a better i resolved to give them battle and if the event was not prosperous to hold out to the last extremity and then to retreat to the isle of orleans or coudres with what was left of the garrison to wait for reinforcements  this night the necessary orders were given and half an hour after six next morning we marched with all the force i could muster viz three thousand men and formed the army on the heights in the following order amhersts anstruthers  d battalion of royal americans and webbs composed the right brigade commanded by col burton kennenys lascelless highlanders and townshends the left brigade commanded by col fraser otways and the third battalion of royal americans were the corpse de reserve major dallings corpse of light infantry covered the right flank and capt hazzens company of rangers with  00 volunteers under the command of capt donoald macdonald a brave and experienced officer covered the left the battalions had each two field pieces  while the line was forming i reconnitred the enemy and perceived their van had taken possession of the rising grounds three quarters of a mile in our front but that their army was upon the march in one column as far as i could see i thought this the lucky moment and moved with the utmost order to attack them before they had formed we soon beat them from the heights they had possessed though they were well disputed and major dalling who cannot be too much commended for his behavior this day and his services during the winter forced their corpse of grenadiers from a house and windmill they had taken hold of to cover their left flank here he and several of his officers were wounded his men however pursued the fugitives to the corpse which were now formed to sustain them they halted and dispersed along the front of the right which prevented that wing from taking advantage of the first impression they had made on the enemys left they had immediately orders given them to regain the flank but in attempting this they were charged thrown into disorder retired to the rear and from the number of officers killed and wounded could never again be brought up during the action otways was instantly ordered to advance and sustain the right wing which the enemy in vain made two attempts to penetrate on these occasions capt ince with the grenadiers of otways were distinguished while this passed there the left were not idle they had dispossessed the enemy of two redoubts and sustained with unparallelled firmness the bold united efforts of the enemys regulars indians and canadians till at last fairly fought down and reduced to a handful though sustained by the  d battalion of royal americans from the reserve and kennedys from the center where we had nothing to fear they were obliged to yield to superior numbers and a fresh column of roussillon which penetrated  the disorder of the left was soon communicated to the right but the whole retired in such a way that the enemy did not venture upon a brisk pursuit we left most of our cannon as the roughness of the ground and the wreaths of snow made it impossible to bring them off what could not be brought off were nailed up  our killed and wounded amounted to one third of those in the field that of the enemy by their own confession exceeds   00 men which may be readily conceived as the action lasted an hour and three quarters  here i think it my duty to express my gratitude to the officers in general and the satisfaction i had in the bravery of all the troops  on the night of the   th the enemy opened trenches against the town and at the same we set to work within to fortify it which we never had in our power to attempt sooner from the severity of this climate during the winter and the absolute necessity of executing works of more immediate importance last autumn before the frost set in i wanted the assistance of major mackeller the chief engineer dangerously wounded in the action his zeal for and knowledge in the service is well known but the alacrity of the garrison made up for every defect  my journal of the siege which accompanies this sets forth in full what was done and i flatter myself the extraordinary performances of the handful of brave men i had left will please his majesty as much as they surprised us who were eye witnesses to them  great praise is due to commodore swanton and the captains schomberg and dean i have not words to express the readiness vivacity and valor they showed in attacking and destroying the enemys squadron capt dean has lost his ship but it was in a good cause and he has done honor to his country  the morning of the   th of may i had intended a strong forty to have penetrated into the enemys camp which from the information of the prisoners i had taken and the concurrent account of the deserters i conceived to be very practicable  for this purpose i had ordered the regiments of amherst townshend lascelles anstruther and highlanders with the grenadiers and light infantry under arms but was informed by lieut malpin of my battalion whom i sent out to amuse the enemy with small allies that their trenches were abandoned  i instantly pushed out at the head of these corpse not doubting but we must have overtaken and forced their rear and had ample revenge for the   th of april but i was disappointed for they had crossed the river caprouge before we could come up with them however we took several prisoners and much baggage which would otherwise have escaped they left their camp standing all their baggage stores magazines of provisions and ammunition    pieces of battering cannon four of which are bras    pounders  0 field pieces   mortars   petards a large quantitg of scaling ladders and entrenching tools beyond number and have retired to their former asylum jacques cartier from the information of prisoners deserters and spies provisions are very scarce ammunition does not abound and the greatest part of the canadians have deserted them at present they do not exceed  000 men the minute i am joined with that part of my garrison which was sent from hence last autumn i shall endeavor to cooperate with mr amherst toward completing the reduction of this country though if rightly informed he can hardly act by the lakes before the month of july of which i am the more convinced because from the intelligence forwarded to him last february of the enemys designs by lieut montusor he would certainly have been upon them before now had it been at all practicable  major maitland the bearer of these dispatches who has acted as adjutant general this last winter is well acquainted with all our transactions here he has a thorough knowledge of the country and can give you the best lights with regard to the measures farther to be taken relative to his majestys views in canada  i cannot finish this long letter without observing how much i think myself obliged to the lieut governor col burton his activity and zeal were conspicuous during the whole course of this winters campaign and i flatter myself sir you will be pleased to lay his services before his majesty  p s since i have wrote the above a nation of indians has surrendered and entered into an alliance with us  i have the honor to be with great regard sir yours etc james murray    admiraltyoffice june       0 captain schomberg arrived this morning with dispatches from lord colville and commodore swanton dated at quebec the   th of may giving an account that on the   th of that month the latter arrived at the isle of bec in the river of st laurence with the vanguard and diana where he intended to wait for such of his squadron as had separated from him in his passage from england but having on the   th received advice from brig genesis murray that the enemy had besieged quebec he got under sail with the utmost dispatch and anchored above point levi the   th in the evening where he found the leostoffe one of his squadron which arrived a few days before and whose commander capt deane immediately came off to him with a message from the general earnestly recommending the speedy removal of the french naval force above the town consisting of two frigates two armed ships and many smaller vessels in consequence of which he ordered capt schomberg of the diana and capt deane of the leostoffe to slip their cables early the next morning and attack the enemy but they were no sooner in motion than the enemy fled in the greatest hurry and disorder the pomona one of the frigates was driven on shore above cape diamond the atalanta the other frigate run ashore and was burnt at point au tremble about ten leagues above the town and most of the other ships and vessels were likewise driven ashore or effectually destroyed  the night following the enemy raised the siege of quebec very precipitately leaving their cannon small arms stores etc behind them  the leostoffe run upon some unknown rocks in pursuit of the enemy and was irrecoverably lost but the officers and men were saved  lord colville sailed from halifax with the squadron under his command the   d of april but did not arrive at quebec till the   th of may having been much retarded in his passage by thick fogs great quantities of ice and contrary winds  gazette extraordinary thus was fortunately preserved from the most imminent danger the most considerable place we had taken in the war and that which gave us the most decisive advantage the triumph of the french and the anxiety of england were but short the account of the siege and the raising it followed close on the heels of each other and there was nothing now to cloud the prospect of the certain reduction of canada by the united efforts of three english armies who by different routs were moving to attack those parts of it which still remained to france in the mean time that haughty power was obliged to sit the impotent spectator of the ruin of her colonies without being able to send them the smallest succor it was then she found what it was to be inferior at sea  we shall resume the american affairs when we have reviewed the scenes that began about this time to open on the theater of europe  chap iii distress of saxony m broglio commands the main body of the french army st germain commands on the rhine english army reinforced king of prussias losses theater of the war in the east of germany positions of the austrian and prussian armies battle of landshut prussian army under fouquet destroyed  a winter remarkably severe succeeded the bloody campaign of      at bareith in the night of the   th of december the cold was insupportable reamurs therometer was sunk to    which is precisely the same degree it fell to in   0  a year like this distinguished by the intenseness of the cold and the fury of war birds dropped dead in their flight at leipsic ten sentinels were froze to death an infectious disease which began in the armies diffused itself among the inhabitants of saxony and made a dreadful havoc a pestilential contagion raged among the cattle famine was soon added to the rest of their calamities and every misery that can afflict mankind was poured out upon that unfortunate people with the most liberal measure there was no prospect of an allevation of these distresses on the contrary the sufferings of the people only made their sovereigns more earnest for revenge and out of the general want a resource arose to their armies who were the more readily recruited because the scanty pay and subsistence of a soldier became an object of envy to the wretched peasantry in most of these countries and death seemed more honorable and less certain by the sword than by penury and disease  france and england vied in their endeavors to augment their forces in germany m broglio had now the command of the grand army and the sole conduct of the general plan of operations he had early in this year been honored with the staff of a marshal of france and nothing was omitted to give luster to his command and to furnish him with every means of exerting his talents his corpse was augmented to near  00000 effective men thirty thousand drawn out of their quarters in dusseldorp cleves cologne and wesel and completed by draughts from france formed a separate army on the rhine under the count de st germain this disposition was made not only to divide the attention of the allied army but to prevent the ill consequences of the misunderstanding which was known to subsist between this general and the duke de broglio the third army proposed at the close of the foregoing campain did not appear  on the side of england the preparations were not less considerable in proportion to her ability for that kind of war six regiments of foot commanded by major general griffin were forthwith sent to reinforce the allied army elliots regiment of light horse soon followed them at the opening of this campaign we had in germany twelve regiments of heavy and one of light horse and twelve regiments with two highland battalions of foot the whole amounted to near   000 men in the course of the summer they were further reinforced to near   000 such a number of british troops serving in one army had not been seen on the continent for two hundred years past the allied army indeed fell short of the french in numbers but they exceeded it in the quality of the troops those newly arrived from england were fresh but not undisciplined the old were indeed harrassed but they had been accustomed to victory  in the beginning of the year the death of the landgrave of hesse cassel had excited some apprehensions  the king of prussia was under far greater difficulties he had felt the heaviest blows and was most scanted in the means of healing them  his losses were not to be reckoned by the men killed and prisoners but by armies destroyed or taken forty generals had died or were slain in his service since the  st of october      exclusive of those who had been wounded disabled or made prisoners and this alone would have been a loss not to be repaired if these murdering wars which cut off so many experienced officers did not at the same time form so many more to supply their places the king had renewed his alliance on the former terms with great britain by his indefatigable industry no gaps were seen in his armies but they were no longer the same troops and if the king of prussia had formerly the merit of ably commanding the most excellent armies he has now to fill up the most remarkable deficiency on the part of his troops by his own heroism and to undertake far more arduous enterprises than his first with infinitely weaker instruments his affairs wore a bad aspect in the opening of the former year in this they seemed altogether desperate  the russians had suffered but they were sufficiently reinforced the swedes who had been generally obliged to give ground in the winter had in that of      the advantage in several smart skirmishes and had even taken prisoner the prussian general manteuffel as to the austrians victorious for a whole campaign almost without fighting their armies and magazines were full their corpse complete their men fresh vigorous and full of resolution several skirmishes of consequence had been fought during the cessation of the great operations and they were generally to their advantage  the king of prussia was sensible that in this as in the former campaigns he should be attacked by four armies and that his dominions would be invested upon every side as these operations were very extensive and complicated to enable the reader to form an idea of the campaign it will not be amiss to say something of the ground the king had to defend which is circumstanced in this manner  to the north is pomerania this country is very open and it is defended on that part on which the swedes generally act with but few and those mean fortifications anclam demmein and passewalk but then the swedish army is not numerous and if they should attempt to penetrate far into the country they must leave stetin in which there is always a strong garrison behind them to their left which would render their subsistence difficult and their retreat in case of any misfortune extremely hazardous and they have not sufficient strength to master this place by a regular siege this has always proved a check to the progress of that army even when they have been otherwise successful  this same country to the eastward of the oder is one great object of the russian designs its chief strength in this quarter is the town of colberg a place they have frequently attempted but always without success and their failure in this instance has been the main cause why they have never been able to take winter quarters in the king of prussias dominions or even during the campaign to make any considerable impression upon pomerania for they can have no communication with their own country by sea for want of this port on their rear lies the extensive and inhospitable desert of waldow and this with the uncertain disposition of the city of dantzick renders their supplies of provision from poland difficult and precarious neither is it possible in these circumstances to unite their forces with those of sweden acting in the same country the oder flows between them which is so commanded by the city of stetin as to make all communication between these armies in a great measure impracticable insomuch that on the side of pomerania the force of these two powers is compelled to act separately without concert and therefore weakly and ineffectually  to the westward the king of prussia is sufficiently covered by the city of magdebourg the strongest place in his dominions and in that part of germany here are his greatest magazines and his principal founderies and this is the repository of whatever he finds necessary to place out of the reach of sudden insult  to the southward he is obliged to defend saxony and silesia both of these countries on their frontiers toward bohemia rise into very rough broken and mountainous grounds abounding in advantageous posts and strong situations lusatia lies between them a level sandy plain interspersed with pinewoods extending without any obstacle to the very gates of berlin through this country the kings communication between silesia and saxony must be kept up and therefore it has been from the beginning of this war the great scene of those remarkable marches and countermarches by which his prussian majesty has acquired so great a reputation and also of those bold and sudden attempts which have distinguished some of the generals of the adverse party as an army cannot be advantageously posted in this territory it has not been usual for a considerably body to remain there long and it is particularly unfavourable to defensive operations this country may be considered as the curtin and the frontiers of saxony and silesia as the bastions that flank the sort of fortification which the king is to maintain  no part of that monarchs territories are naturally more defenseless than the eastern at the same time that it is attacked by the most powerful of his enemies a country altogether sandy and level extends along both sides of the oder from the northern frontier of silesia until it meets pomerania a country of the same kind there is no respectable fortification on this side and the river warta that falls here into the oder makes the transport of provisions and consequently the subsistence of the armies that act against him more easy  as to silesia it is covered on the bohemian side with mountains and it contains places of such strength as to be above the necessity of yielding to the first army that appears before them indeed it is to be remarked that such a degree of strength seems sufficient for the kind of service which has distinguished this war never was a war of such a length and extent in which fewer sieges of consequence have been formed and the late service which affords so large a field for experience in every other species of military operations affords very little matter of improvement in the art of reducing or defending strong places  the king of prussias design seems to have been to save himself as much as possible to the end of the campaign the only time when his success might be decisive and his illfortune not ruinous he therefore formed a defensive plan in pursuance of this he withdrew his outposts from freyberg and drawing a chain of cantonments from the forest of tharandt on his right to the elbe he took a most advantageous camp between that river and the multa strongly intrenching it where it had not been previously fortified by nature and furnished it with so numerous an artillery that they reckoned in their front only   0 pieces of cannon  in this situation he covered the most material parts of saxony kept the attention of m dauns army engaged and was enabled to send out reinforcements to prince henry or elsewhere as occasion should require without exposing one part whilst he defended the other  whilst the kings army defended his conquests in misnia prince henry had assembled an army about franckfort on the oder and took various positions about that place and crossen in this position he commanded three principal communications in such a manner as to protect at once silesia the new march of brandenburg and the avenues to berlin all which were threatened by several bodies of the enemy general fouquet had established his quarters near the county of glatz and whilst he covered that side of silesia he communicated with prince henry and was so disposed as to send to or receive succors from him as either party should happen to be pressed  m daun as soon as he saw that the king of prussia had fortified himself in his post he too buried himself in entrenchments and kept the most attentive eye upon all hi majestys motions whilst he confined himself in this position in order to tie down the king of prussia genera laudohn with a strong but light and disincumbered army moved from the camp he had occupied during the winter in bohemia and presenting himself alternately on the side o lusatia and on the frontiers of silesia threatened sometimes to penetrate into berlin sometimes by a bold stroke to effect a junction with the russians and attack prince henry sometimes to sit down before glatz schweidnitz or breslau and thus the alarm was spread upon every side not knowing where the storm would fall  at length he declared himself having by several fein persuaded general fouquet that his intentions were against schweidnitz that general marched thither a considerable body of his troops and left glatz uncovered as soon as laudohn perceived this movement he on his side made another and possessed himself of landshut and when he had taken landshut he pretended a design of securing this post by leaving a small body of troops there this feint also succeeded and drew general fouquet from schweidnitz back again to landshut he drove the austrians from that place without difficulty but in the mean time laudohn made himself master of several important passes by which he was in some sort enabled to surround the corpse of general fouquet  the commander finding himself in those dangerous circumstances had nothing left but to fortify his post formerly made a very strong one with additional works which he did with such effect that it had more the resemblance of a regular fortification than an entrenchment however the army he commanded was far from numerous and he was obliged to weaken it still farther by a detachment of  000 men to preserve if possible a communication with schweidnitz  laudohn longed to distinguish himself by some capital stroke he had now by a series of very artful movements procured a most favorable opportunity first therefore he shut up with great dexterity the passes on every side and rendered his adversarys retreat impracticable then he began an attack on the prussian entrenchments in the dead of the night in three different places  on the side of the vanquished the slain were about  000 the prisoners were one general of foot namely general fouquet two major generals two hundred and thirteen officers of the inferior rank and upwards of  000 private soldiers    pieces of artillery with a number of colors never was a more entire and decisive victory the whole army general officers every thing was destroyed scarce three hundred of the body entrenched by landshut escaped the corpse alone which was to preserve the communication together with some bodies of cavalry who had not been engaged with difficulty got into schweidnitz where they expected every moment to be besieged this advantage cost the austrians above   000 men killed and wounded  chap iv the austrians take glatz situation of the prussian armies king of prussia marches toward silesia and deceives m daun king of prussia returns to saxony siege of dresden town burned return of daun siege raised breslau besieged by the austrians march of prince henry laudohn retreats  this victory was pursued with as much rapidity as it was obtained with courage and address baron laudohn immediately returned back from landshut fell like a storm upon glatz glatz consists of two fortresses the old and the new the old was taken by storm the new surrendered at discretion two thousand brave men and some good works could not defend it against the impetuosity of the austrians one hundred and one pieces of brass cannon were taken immense magazines of provision and military stores piled up in this frontier place to favor in better times an irruption into bohemia fell into the hands of the conqueror every thing gave way the possession of glatz laid all silesia open and the austrians might turn their arms upon any side without the least danger to the freedom of their retreat neither was there any sort of army to give the least obstruction the king of prussia held down by m daun was in saxony prince henry was also at a great distance toward custrin if that prince attempted to move to the relief of silesia he laid open brandenburgh and even berlin itself to the irruptions of the russians if he remained in his post silesia was inevitably lost even his speediest march seemed by no means a certain way to relieve it the king was yet further distant and any motion of his threatened to shake and unhinge the whole scheme of his defense exposing at once saxony and berlin the loss of his third army small as that army was laid him under difficulties that seemed insuperable  favored by these circumstances laudohn had only to choose what direction he should give his arms silesia as has been observed lay open before him he had threatened schweidnitz but he saw that breslaw was a place of greater consequence much more easily reduced and that the possession of it facilitated a junction with the russians a point on which the ultimate improvement of his victory wholly depended the place besides is of so great extent and the works of so little comparative strength that he had no small hopes of mastering it before prince henry could come if he should at all attempt to come to its relief  he therefore delayed no longer than the march of his heavy artillery and the necessary preparatives required to lay siege to the capital of silesia of whose safety the most sanguine friends of his prussian majesty began to despair  but in the interval between the battle of landshut and the commencement of the siege of breslau the king of prussia was not idle his thoughts were continually employed to repair this disaster all ordinary resources were impracticable or ineffectual his genius alone could enter the lists with his ill fortune placing therefore his hopes in himself he aimed by a daring and unexpected stroke to draw even from so severe a misfortune some new and more brilliant advantages  in pursance of the plan he had laid  the two armies continued their route through lusatia that of the king of prussia a little to the northward that of marshal daun to the southward both apparently pushing toward the same object and with equal eagerness but as the army of the marshal had rather the shorter cut to make and as he moved with far greater and more unaffected diligence he got very considerably the start of the king  when his majesty was apprised that m daun had gained full two days march upon him  then was this most unfortunate city a third time exposed to the fury of war the inhabitants suffered in their habitations for the weakness of the works and there were armies both without and within of such mutual and determined rage and so careless of all things but their enmity that they little scrupled to strike at each other through the bodies of the suffering saxons all europe had now its eyes turned to the event of this masterly maneuver and certainly through the whole course of this eventful war nothing appeared more worthy of regard nor at any time had there been exhibited a piece of generalship more complete than the conduct of the king of prussias march  since dresden had fallen into the hands of the austrians it had been strengthened with the addition of several new works the burning of the suburbs by the prussians in order to keep them out became an advantage to them when they came to possess the town in short the place was rendered in all respects more defensible than formerly it had also a very large garrison under general macguire an officer of courage and experience who resolved to maintain it to the last extremity when he was summoned to surrender he made answer that it was impossible the king could have been apprised with his being entrusted with the command of that capital otherwise so great a captain as his majesty would not make such a proposal to an officer of his standing that he would defend himself to the last man and wait whatever the king should think proper to attempt  both parties being therefore inspired with the utmost resolution the one to attack the other to defend the siege was pushed on by every method of force and address there was scarce any intermission of assaults surprises coups de mains sallies and all kind of actions used on such occasions and all the most vigorous in their way in the mean time three batteries of cannon and mortars played continually but with much greater damage to the buildings than effect on the fortifications  marshal daun was in silesia when he heard all at once of the deceit put upon him by the king of prussia of his return to saxony of the siege and the extreme danger of dresden his return was as rapid as his march had been on the   th he appeared within a league of dresden his approach only caused the prussians to redouble their efforts that day they had received reinforcements of heavy cannon and mortars and battered the place with new fury the cathedral church the new square several principal streets some palaces the noble manufactory of porcelain were all entirely reduced to ashes  the siege continued till the   d the night of the   st m daun had thrown sixteen battalions into dresden it was in vain to continue any longer the pretense of besieging a whole army within the town whilst at the same time there was another army to reinforce it without the king withdrew his forces without molestation from the suburbs though there were three considerable armies of the enemy in the neighborhood besides that which was within the walls  thus ended without the success so masterly a proceeding deserved the king of prussias famous stratagem but the want of success can detract nothing from the merit of the measure by drawing marshal daun from saxony to silesia he gained the use of eight days free of obstruction from the enemys grand army eight days at a time when hours and even moments were critical in this time he had certainly a chance at least of reducing dresden and by the possession of that place he would have found himself infinitely better able to carry his arms to the defense of every part of his territories for the present and for the future would have that great place of retreat in case of any misfortune if he failed in this attempt his affairs were precisely in their former condition and he could not suffer in reputation by having made it  as the king of prussia could not be blamed for the speedy return of marshal daun and the consequences of that return so neither in effect could the marshal suffer any just imputation in having been deceived by the kings march he knew that there were very plausible motives to call and even to press him to move that way he knew that if the king should get into silesia without any opposition from him laudohn might not only be deprived of all the advantages he could hope for from his late victory but by being attacked by the united armies of the king and his brother would run the risque of a defeat that might fully revenge that of landshut  whatever the merit of either of the commanders might be on this occasion it is certain that laudohn met no considerable obstruction  but laudohn who saw all things prepared for an obstinate defense did not wholly trust to his military maneuvers he sent a letter to the governor count tavenzien to intimidate him by the display of his strength he set forth that his forces consisted of  0 battalions and  0 squadrons that the russian army of   000 men were within three days march that it was in vain for the governor to expect succor from the king of prussia who was then at the other side of the elbe that it was still more vain to look for relief from prince henry who could scarce hope to stand his own ground against the grand army of the russians that in case of obstinacy he could expect no reasonable terms and that these were the last that should be offered moreover he reminded him that the place was a mercantile town not a fortress and that he could not defend it without contravening the laws of war  these rules by which honor is reduced to act not by its own feelings but according to intrinsical circumstances rules by which they have attempted to determine exactly and mechanically that nicest of all lines which discriminates courage from rashness form one of the strongest instances of the great difference between the ancient and modern methods and ideas of war in the ancient times a brave commander would have answered this threatening message in general terms of defiance but count tavenzien respected these imaginary laws he took care to prove that in defending the town he did not infringe them and spoke as laudohn had done in the character of a military jurisconsult as well as a soldier he gave for reply that the town of breslaw being surrounded with works and wet ditches was to be considered as a place of strength and not simply as a mercantile town that the austrians themselves defended it as such in      after the battle of lissa that the king had commanded him to defend it to the last extremity that therefore general laudohn might see it was not from humor he had refused to listen to his summons that he was not frighted with the generals threats to destroy the town for he was not entrusted with the care of the houses but the fortifications  laudohn had also sent in a memorial in the same menacing style where he thought it might have a greater effect to the civil magistrates hoping that the ruin with which the town was threatened might induce them join with the inhabitants to persuade the governor to a speedy surrender  all these menacing measures seemed to argue a fear in baron laudohn that the russians were not so near as he pretended and that the town might possibly be releived before their arrival however he showed them at nine of the very evening of the message that his threats were not vain by a terrible discharge of mortars and red hot balls that fell in an uninterrupted shower upon the city until midnight during this fierce bombardment that made a dreadful havoc in the town he attempted the outworks by assault his croats attacked the coveredway in many places at once with the usual impetuosity of those brave irregulars but they were received and repulsed with a resolution equal to their own and with more steadiness  this operation of this dreadful night having made no impression on the inflexible determination of the governor baron laudohn had once more recourse to negotiation he now changed his style and held out the most flattering propositions offering to grant him what capitulations he should think proper to ask and even to leave himself to draw up the articles the governor replied that the firing the town had made no change in his resolution and he would wait with firmness for the enemy upon the ramparts but that he could not help observing it was contrary to the laws of arms to begin the siege of a fortress by ruining its inhabitants the messenger made answer that the trenches would be soon opened the governor said it was what he had long expected  the austrians foiled in their hopes from treaty continued to batter the town and made several attacks upon the outworks for three days successively they found every post bravely defended the russian army did not appear but they now began to perceive the approach of another army less agreeable that of prince henry which having marched with the utmost diligence from great glogau now came fast upon him and on the  th of august reached within a few miles of the town  laudohn did not think it expedient to put the advantage he had gained and those which he had yet to expect from the management of time to the issue of a battle he therefore decamped and made his retreat in good order but with sufficient quickness having procured from this enterprise only the wretched satisfaction of reducing a great part of the city to a heap of rubbish and of having revenged upon breslaw some part of the sufferings of dresden  chap v cause of the slowness of the allies and french advantages on the side of the french differences between broglio and st germain marburg and dillenburg taken by the french battle of corbach hereditary prince wounded surprise and defeat of monsieur glaubitz at ermsdorf the allies change their camp action at warbourg  the french and allied armies had been reinforced in the manner we have already mentioned but the vigor of their operations did not altogether correspond with what might have been expected from their strength and mutual animosity the campaign at least in any effective manner opened late a country which had been so long the theater of so ruinous a war had been too much wasted to make the subsistence and consequently the free motion of the armies easy the winter had been severe and long and it was not until the green forage appeared plentifully above ground that those great bodies of cavalry which make so large a part in our modern armies were in a condition to act the sufferings of the english horse from a want of dry forage during a great part of the winter and the spring had been extreme this obliged them to fall much farther back from the french cantonments and to molest them less than they otherwise would have done it was besides a loss that at the opening of the campaign they had so extensive a tract between them and hanover which by an artful choice of posts might have been yielded step by step and the campaign so managed and spun out that the season of action must have expired before the french could have reaped any decisive advantage from their superiority  although the french were during the winter supplied far better than the allies with all necessaries by the command of the maine the moselle and the rhine and that the countries at their back had been much less consumed by the war yet the same difficulties embarrassed them as soon as they thought of taking the field and quitting their advantageous cantonment therefore there was a slowness in the principal armies upon both parts until the middle of summer  not however but that something was attempted in this interval by lesser parties on the side of the rhine some actions happened between the army of st germain and the corpse of general sporken who was posted at dulmen to observe the french in that quarter dulmen formed the right flank of the chain of cantonments made by the allied army which extended its left to the southeast frontiers of the country of hesse above an hundred and fifty miles distant the hereditary prince who was on that wing exerted as much as circumstances would permit his usual activity and enterprise he threw himself into the district of fulda he laid it under an heavy contribution and broke up several french corpse that were posted there  these actions decided nothing the french army superior in numbers and in situation advanced and the allies who seemed to have chosen the defensive gradually retired in effect if the french had pursued their original plan it would have proved almost impossible for the allied army to maintain its ground if st germain possessed of cleves wesel and dusseldorp had advanced on the side of munster and m broglio moving forward through the country of hesse had made a strong detachment to the eastward of the weser whilst with his main body he engaged the attention of prince ferdinand the allies would shortly have found themselves enclosed upon three sides and nothing could have extricated them but a capital victory obtained under every disadvantage  the french army was sufficiently numerous for these operations but it was suspected that the jealousy which subsisted between m de st germain and the duke of broglio prevented their being carried into execution this misunderstanding daily increased insomuch that m broglio thought fit to order the corpse of st germain to unite itself with the grand army the count who could not brook obedience to a younger officer and one besides with whom he was not on the best terms retired from the service  before this misunderstanding had produced these effects the affairs of the french went on with all imaginable prosperity the principal army not retarding itself by consideration of the places of strength which the allies possessed in their front the castles of marburg and dillenbourg pushed forward into the landgraviate of hesse leaving detachments to reduce those fortresses the first of which surrendered on the  0th of june the latter held out to the   th of july but the garrisons of both surrendered prisoners of war  in the mean time whilst m broglio advanced on the side of hesse  when he had begun the attack contrary to his expectation he found the enemy already formed but it was now impossible to recede the action grew every moment more furious and bloody the french stood their ground with firmness and the main army being extremely near instead of being wasted in the action they grew more numerous by the reinforcements that were continually sent  in this situation it was necessary that the prince should make as speedy a retreat as possible but the difficulty of drawing out of the field in the middle of the day before an enemy quite fresh and every instant reinforced may be easily imagined to complete this difficulty some bodies of the german troops both horse and foot fell into great confusion the enemy saw it at the first glance and to increase it to the utmost disorder pushed forward upon them with a numerous artillery and a large body of cavalry the allied army seemed to be in the way of inevitable ruin  in this exigence the hereditary prince as his last resource put himself at the head of a squadron of blands and howards regiments of dragroons by these the uncommon heroism of their young leader was perfectly seconded they charged the enemy with the utmost fury stopped their career of their victorious horse and enabled the alied battalions to make an undisturbed retreat  the hereditary prince was wounded in this action about  00 men were killed wounded or prisoners fifteen pieces of cannon the whole of the artillery was left to the enemy but still in their circumstances to have avoided a total defeat was in some sort victory the welltimed impetuosity of the hereditary prince and the spirit of the english horse could not be too highly praised the prince retired to the main army of the allies who had now possessed themselves of the strong post of saxenhausen whilst the french continued opposite to them in the no less strong post of corbach which they had acquired by their victory and here for some time they watched each other  the hereditary prince suffered more by this check than from the wounds he had received his mind forgetful of his pain and weakness only brooding over his defeat seeking out with anxiety an opportunity of revenging his loss by some bold signal and unexpected stroke against the enemy it was not long before an opportunity presented itself  advice had been received that among the detachments which the french employed to reduce those fortresses which the allies had garrisoned on their retreat there was one very considerable formed of french and saxon under mons glaubitz moving toward zigenhagen a place of importance in the landgrave of hesse the hereditary prince undertook to relieve it and for that purpose selected six battalions of the german troops  mons glaubitz remained in the most perfect security he was under no sort of apprehension of being molested by a detachment of an army sixty miles distance under the eye and as it were guard of a superior body which demanded all its attention  glaubitz had scarce time to form his troops and they were only formed to be immediately broken they retired with precipitation leaving their camp and all it contained to the enemy the prince had so disposed his cavalry as to cut off the retreat of some but the most considerable part gained ground upon him on this occasion he relied entirely on elliots horse as it was altogether impossible for the infantry already harassed by the action and a most fatiguing forced march of two days to follow them a the head of this horse he overtook the fugitives as they came out of a wood charged and broke them five different times separated a body of  00 from the rest surrounded them and obliged them to throw down their arms having routed this with the like rapidity he flew to another body who had taken post near a wood surrounded them in the same manner summoned and received them all prisoners of war a regiment of the enemys hussars was entirely cut to pieces nothing was wanting to complete his victory elliots light horse proud to be led on by the prince himself and worthy of that honor had the greatest share of the glory and sufferings of that day so young a corpse had never so eminently distinguished itself no more than    of the allies were killed in this action but of these    were of this single regiment  the numbers of the enemy killed is not known but for a time the slaughter was terrible general glaubitz himself was made prisoner together with the prince of anhalt there were besides     officers and      private men a greater number of prisoners could scarely be expected from a victory in a general engagement the trophies were nine pair of colors and six pieces of cannon in all the petite gurre of this campaign and the campaign between the french and the allies was almost wholly made up of such this was by far the most billiant action and alone might have established the reputation of the hereditary prince if any thing had been wanting to establish him the first man of his age in that species of war he returned to the camp of saxenhausen without molestation having fully revenged the affair of corbach  prince ferdinand did not remain long after this action in his camp at saxenhausen by so advanced a position the landgraviate and even hanover lay too open to the enemies incursions he therefore took his camp at a place called kalle in a situation nearer to cassel on this m broglio formed a plan which the greatness of his army in some sort enabled him to execute the chevalier de muy who commanded in the room of the count st germain was ordered to cross the dymel at statbergen with his reserve consisting of   000 men in order to cut off the allies from their communication with westphalia whilst the rest of the french dividing themselves into two bodies moved the main army under m broglio toward duke ferdinands camp at kalle the reserve under prince xavier of saxony toward cassel  these important movements obliged prince ferdinand to set himself also in motion and as he was not in a condition to make detachments of sufficient strength he crossed the dymel with his grand army in order to fight the chevalier de muy  his serene highness formed his main body on the heights of corbach  the french now saw themselves in the most imminent danger of being surrounded already their left attacked in flank and rear by the hereditary prince began to give way his fire became every moment superior and the earliest retreat was the safest  as soon as prince ferdinand perceived the enemy to tire he saw it absolutely in vain to think of bringing infantry upon their front the english cavalry also up which he chiefly confided was too distant to give al any hope that they could be made to act but the engl cavalry outdid his expectations and indeed all former amples they considered themselves as defrauded of the share of the glory of minden and they panted for an casion of signalizing their courage and their commande lord granby and mostyn forwarded their ardour knoing that great actions are commonly transgressions of ornary rules  they came up five miles on a full trot the germa called it a gallop without being blown without the le confusion or disorder and attacked the enemies cavalry  infantry several times the greatest part of the enem horse fell back and did not stand the charge the eng artillery were brought up with the same surprising quicness and employed with the same powerful effect capt phillips had done more with artillery than had been thoug possible at minden and he exceeded it at warbou the english foot vied with the cavalry and artillery a made such earnest efforts to come to action that in straing their passage through morassy ground and in burni weather several soldiers dropped down on their mar but they were too late to engage and probably in the wasted condition it was well that it so happened  the french made a precipitate retreat toward statber several were drowned in passing the dymel   00 were  on the field of battle as many were made prisoners t pieces of cannon were taken but they consoled themsel in having lost no colors the loss of the allied army general has not been that i can find published that the english in killed wounded

banks of that river in order to cut me off from westphalia whilst m de broglio was advancing with his main army toward my camp at alle and prince xavier with his reserve on our left toward cassel hereupon i determined to leave general kielmansegge with a body of troops at cassel for the protection of that city and o march myself with the army the night of the  0th in order to pass the dymel

and corbeke reconnitred he position of the chevalier de muy who from the  0th in the morning was in possession of a very advantageous camp between warbourg and ochsendorff it was agreed that the prince and m sporcke should turn the enemys left whilst i advanced with the army upon their front which was done with all possible success the enemy being attacked almost in the same instant by m sporcke and the hereditary prince in flank and in rear as the infantry of the army could not march fast enough to charge at the same time i ordered my lord granby to advance with the cavalry of the right the english artillery got up on a gallop and seconded the attack in a surprising manner all the troops have done well and particularly the english the french cavalry though very numerous retreated as soon as ours advanced to charge them excepting only three squadrons a squadron of french horse when complete is   0 men of dragoons   0  this serves to confirm what colonel sloper said on lord gss trial that had the front of the cavalry moved fast enough tb have obliged the regiment he commanded to have galloped it was his opinion it would have come up fit for business and would have beat any three french squadrons it could have met with  that kept their ground but were soon broke a part of the english cavalry then fell upon the enemys infantry which suffered extremely and particularly the regiment of lockmann swiss i ordered an attack to be made on the town of warbourg by the legion britannique and the enemy finding themselves thus attacked upon their two flanks in front and rear retired with the utmost precipitation and with the loss of many men as well from the fire of our artillery as from the attacks of the cavalry many were drowned in  dymel in attempting to ford it the enemys loss in men is  considerable i cannot exactly ascertain it but it is supposed t they have left fifteen hundred men upon the field of battle  the amount of the prisoners we have made probably exceeds  number we have taken ten pieces of cannon with some colo the loss on our side is very moderate and falls chiefly upon brave battalion of maxwells english grenadiers which did

in order to turn t enemys left flank which he did by marching to donhelb leaving kleineder on his left and forming in two lines with  left toward dossel and his right near grimbeck opposite to the left flank of the enemy whose position was with the left to the high hill near ossendorff and their right to warbourg into which place they had flung fischers corpse the hereditary prince immediately attacked the enemys flank and after a very sharp dispute obliged them to give way and by a continual fire kept forcing them to fall back upon warbourg the army was at this time marching with the greatest diligence to attack the enemy in front but the infantry could not get up in time general waldegrave at the head of the british pressed their march as much as possible no troops could show more eagerness to get up than they showed many of the men from the heat of the weather and overstraining themselves to get on through morassy and very difficult ground dropped down on their march

close on the heels of the ormer raised the reputation of the allied arms as coniderable an advantage might have well been expected from it but according to the usual play of fortune in this w the first account that followed the defeat of so large a p of the french army was that with a rapid and unresist tide of success they had reduced cassel eimbach and ziegenhayn by which they became masters of the whole landgraviate of hesse that they had pushed into the kings territories seized upon gottingen and munden and thretened hanover itself in short almost the worst conquences which could have arisen from a defeat followed victory and whilst in england we gave loose to our joy on the success of our arms the french were taking the most important places of our allies  the fact was that prince ferdinand must have been sensible that in quitting his camp at kalle and taking post to the northward of the dymel he in a great measure laid open cassel and the whole territory of hesse to the french nay that by this movement nothing was left to hinder their entering the hanoverian dominions on the right of the weser but notwithstanding these risques the step he took was prudent and even necessary had he suffe the progress of the chevalier de muy on the dymel h he permitted him to strengthen his posts upon that rive his communication with westphalia had been inevitably  off and of course his sphere of subsistence greatly streigtened it would have had a worse effect for he m have entirely lost the command of the weser without which he could not have stood his ground a moment a he would on that loss have found himself compelled to re into the heart of hanover where he must necessarily  streightened in his winter cantonments and where a blo of any consequence must be decisive against him  he therefore fought the battle of warbourg though  lost all hesse by his victory and he would not quit his po on the dymel though he saw gottingen and munden the hands of the french he was not to be frighted from his steady and well chosen plan by vain rumors or threaening appearances he was by no means in a condition make large detachments it was therefore necessary to scrifice something and he made the smallest sacrifice the circumstances would admit for he foresaw that the fren army whilst he kept his position on the dymel could  possibly take up their quarters in hanover or even act the in any considerable body and for any considerable tim without subjecting themselves to the same or greater incoveniencies than those to which he would have been hims liable had he in defending hesse suffered them to occu those critical posts on the dymel he knew farther the it would prove extremely dangerous for them to haza themselves beyond gottingen and that it would be mo difficult for the french army to support themselves in the advanced post than for him to annoy them there  it is possible that reasons somewhat like the foregoing together with others probably far more cogent might ha determined that great commander to this conduct b whilst he secured that middle communication and acted upon the defensive plan the troops were not idle his detachments acted in many parts with spirit and effect but w must defer for a while the narrative of these actions being called from this part of the theater to the eastern parts  germany where about this time scenes of greater ecl were opened  chap vi laudohn blocks up schweidnitz russians enter silesia march of the king of prussia from saxony to lignitz junction of the austrian armies in silesia the russians pass the oder plan of m daun laudohn defeated near lignitz daun forms the blockade of schweidnitz compelled to raise it action between general hulsen and the army of the empire intercepted letter from the king of prussia to the marquis of argens  from the time that the king of prussia found himself compelled to raise the siege of dresden it was evident that he could have no hopes of acting in saxony to any good purpose the busy part of the campaign came on fast though prince henry had obliged laudohn to retire from breslaw that general able and lately victorious was still formidable he kept neisse and schweidnitz blocked up and wanted to effect a junction with the russians by which he proposed to give the final blow to the kings power in silesia the russians had now actually arrived in the frontier parts of that province and wanted but a very few days easy march to complete that fatal and long dreaded junction at the same time another body of russians had penetrated into pomerania laid all the defenseless parts under contribution and threatened the siege of colberg the swedish army said to consist of   000 men commenced also though with less vigor their operations in all that country the king of prussia had not  000 men to oppose them  in these circumstances a plan of mere defense would have proved altogether without effect the king of prussia had but two armies and it was necessary that one of them at least should make the most rapid and sudden movements to oppose so many combinations on the side of silesia the danger seemed more pressing and accordingly he marched to its relief should pass the elbe the spree the neisse the queiss and the bober five considerable rivers that they should effect all this with one army of the enemy on one side of it flanks another behind and with a third in its front the actual position of the austrians in lusatia was an actio reserved for and only to be expected from the king  prussia the attempt itself could have been justified on by necessity and the necessity was urgent the russia approached m daun followed toward silesia and the king could hardly promise himself success but from march of such rapidity as might enable him to try his fotune with general laudohn before the triple junction  apprehended had made his enemies irresistible but nowithstanding the hopes conceived from this march before the king could come to an action three bodies of austria had joined laudohns dauns and lacys and extendin themselves along the katsbach a river which falls into the oder occupied all the ground from parchwitz to cossedau a space of little less than thirty english miles but this extent their posts were every where strong and the communications easy the kings camp was at lignit it was in vain that for several days he attempted by vario devices to detach one body of the enemy from the rest to turn their flanks and attack them at disadvantage the nature of the ground or the skill of the opposite gener always disappointed him  at length mr daun took himself the offensive party t advantage of his situation and the superiority of his numbers prevailed over his cautious nature to risque an atta it was therefore resolved after the situation of lignitz h been well reconnoitred all circumstances maturely weighe and the design communicated to the other generals to atempt the king of prussia in his camp with the unit strength of the three armies to ensure success beyond doubt it was determined that this attempt should be man by surprise and therefore in the night m daun remebered the bad guard which had been kept by the prussians and the advantage which in the year      he derived from a night attack at the battle of hochkirchen  in consequence of this plan the whole army as soon as should begin to grow dark was to march from their seven posts to such situation as were marked out for each corpse they were to strike their tents but yet to keep up the fir in their camps and to have the drums beat the tattoo as usual  some time after marshal daun had begun to move to his astonishment the patroles he had sent out returned with the account that they had met no outposts as soon as day broke and the army had advanced their apprehensions were confirmed they were disappointed in their design there was no enemy in the camp but when they cast their eyes from thence they could perceive at a distance the rising of a thick smoke which left them no room to doubt that their fortune was then on the point of decision by a part of their forces only and that the king and baron laudohn were at that moment hotly engaged daun could only look on and wait the event  on the   th of july the king was in his camp at lignitz when he received advice that the russian army of   000 men under count czernichew had thrown bridges over the oder at a place called auras and that they were to pass the river on that very day he suspected also that the enemy had formed the design of a general attack troops which have been a long time opposed to each other can reciprocally guess at each others designs the method used by the enemies generals grow familiar and the least motion they make discloses their designs  this is the account the prussians gave of the means by which they came to a knowledge of m dauns projects the austrians attributed this discovery not to the prussian sagacity but to intelligence given by deserters  whatever the means were by which the king of prussia became suspicious of this design it is certain that he took the most early the most vigorous and the most effective measures to defeat it he was thoroughly sensible of the danger he ran of being surrounded if he continued in his post at lignitz out of that very design which was calculated for his ruin his genius drew a new means of safety he saw at a glance that the plan which the enemy had formed to surround him at the same time necessarily divided their own armies and this division was the great object he had pursued so long and through such discouraging disappointments his only business was to prevent their reuniting in a general attack upon his quarters therefore in the very evening calculated for the attempt on his camp he quitted it with as much privacy as the enemy had proposed to attack it marched and took an advantageous post on the w through which laudohn was to pass  and now the decisive hour aproached in which he w to put to the risque as a great a stake as had been played for since the beginning of the war no vulgar advantag would suffice in his situation and that very situation in some sort disabled him from attaining a great one after for bloody campaigns and the vicissitudes of a success in all i changes exhausting his old corpse was nearly annihilate those who succeeded to their places had scarcely seen t brilliant times of the kings fortune and they inherite neither the severe discipline nor the undaunted spirit of the first companions of his hopes they were new to service yet dispirited with defeats the king himself gave life  the whole he alone was to rectify a thousand faults and  supply a thousand deficiencies  the post which he chose was such as whilst it stopp the progress of laudohn in front if daun should attemp his rear would from the nature of the ground lay him under great difficulties this rear he further strengthen with several batteries as soon as his army was drawn up he divided it leaving his right on the ground where it ha been formed to observe marshal daun and to maintain the post whilst with his left he turned in order to fall upon the corpse under laudohn no dispositions could have bee made with a more perfect skill  mean time laudohn was advancing fast to the snare which had been laid for him already he had passed the katbach and was moving toward lignitz full of the hope of no small share in the glory of giving the final blow t the king of prussia and had advanced as far as the villag of psaffendorf when by three in the morning the day light began to dawn a thick fog that had covered all the adjacent grounds suddenly cleared up and like the openin of a great scene disclosed at once the whole prussian army regularly embattled advantageously posted furnished wit a dreadful and wellplaced artillery  he was now come full upon his enemy  was impossible to recede way on either side until six the king of prussia exerted himself with incredible diligence to preserve an uniform strength in every part of his line and hazarded his own life with a daring which nothing but his situation could excuse from temerity his clothes were shot through in several places his horse was killed under him but all these troubles and dangers were fully compensated by the efforts of his troops who maintained so steady a fire and pushed the austrians with so much ardour that they at last gave ground and retreated with precipitation though not without some order toward the katsbach  the king pursued them to this river and no further his advantage as it was gained by the most vigorous steps so bounds were set to the ardour of improving it with the most guarded caution he feared if he pursued his success too far it might disjoin the part of the army engaged from that which he had left to observe m daun and perhaps give that general an opportunity of taking a severe revenge on the right for the successes of the left notwithstanding this reserve of the king a reserve the want of which was formerly the only failing in his military character but which his misfortunes had now perfectly taught him notwithstanding i say he did not push his good fortune against baron laudohn to the utmost the victory was complete glorious and adorned with all the trophies by their own confession the austrians lost upwards of  000 men killed wounded and prisoners the prussians made it amount and not without probability to  0000 among the prisoners were two generals and    officers    pieces of cannon and    pair of colors were taken on the side of the conquerors five hundred were killed and   00 wounded  with regard to silesia the victory near lignitz produced some most immediate and most useful effects although m daun not dispirited with his late misadventure and only sollicitous to repair his loss had detached a strong corpse under prince lowenstein and genesis beck to strengthen the russians and encourage them to advance count czernichew was so intimidated with the late defeat of the austrians that he repassed the oder by the same bridges on which he had lately crossed it  thus one great end of the king of prussias march was obtained he prevented the dreaded junction of those two powers in the other part of his design he did not s perfectly succeed m daun since the action of psaffendorf could indeed make no progress in silesia but on the othehand the king was not able entirely to drive him out o that province the austrians even after their defeat fa superior to the king had been besides largely reinforced the empress exerted all her power to remove the ill effec this late check might have had on the reputation of her arms at the same time that she augmented her troops she comforted and encouraged baron laudohn and by a very generous and gracious letter let him see that she was not a sovereign in whose mind a late misfortune cancels the memory o past services in the praises which this letter bestowed o laudohn several were of opinion was couched an indire censure on the conduct of count daun the slowness o whose temper so ill agreed with the ardour of her ambition and with these great hopes which the number of he forces and the strength of her alliance had encourage her to entertain  the king after this victory joined his brother prince henry at newmarcke one part of that princes army under general goltze had passed the oder to observe the russians who since the repassing that river seemed to direc their motions northward the king being strengthened by this junction and having his communication with bresla clear marched against daun who had begun to form the blockade of schweidnitz fell upon a corpse under general beck made two battalions of croats prisoners dispersed several squadrons and by this lively affair obliged the enemy grand army to raise the blockade and by a precipitate retreat to take refuge in the mountains of landshut  whilst his majesty was thus exerting the most heroic efforts in defense of silesia genesis hulsen who commanded for him in saxony seconded his endeavors in that quarter with uncommon bravery and success the army of the empire had formed a design of cutting him off from torgau to frustrate their intentions that general quitted his camp at meissen and marched to strehla the enemy divided into two bodies one attacked an advanced post about a cannon shot from his camp upon every side with the greatest fury from day break to six in the morning attempting any thing for the relief of the advanced post gen hulsen saw that unless he could speedily do something for its succor that body must inevitably perish he therefore in this exigency gave orders to his cavalry to make a circuit round an height and to charge if possible the enemies flank this order was executed with the utmost promptitude and spirit the imperialists were charged on their flanks their battalions and horse were thrown upon one another in confusion and    officers and   00 men were made prisoners the loss of the prussians was inconsiderable genesis hulsen by this advantage was enabled to encamp under togau while he retreated through an apprehension as the grand army of the imperialists was coming up that he might be cut off from his communication with the elbe this retreat made the austrians magnify the affair into a victory on their side but the circumstances render the prussian account much more probable  fortune seemed once more to have smiled after a long interval of gloom on the king of prussias affairs and the reputation of his arms began to revive but the victories he obtained though glorious were decisive of little more than the field upon which they were fought they were far from having lowered the power of the enemy to an equality with his and the movements he made to gain those advantages and to protect one part of his dominions necessarily exposed the rest the enemy was able to detach without end and whilst bodies of russians traversed the lower silesia several corpse of austrians scoured lusatia and thus together they broke off all regular communication between the kings army and his hereditary dominions and of course between him and his general hulsen who with very unequal forces was struggling to secure saxony a country in which there are towns indeed fortified but fortified for the greater part in such a manner as to be little more than snares for increasing the number of prisoners by betraying defenseless garrisons into the hands of an enemy superior in the field  in this situation the king is said to have wrote a letter to the celebrated author of the jewish spy etc and now resident at berlin marq dargens very pathetick and very descriptive of his condition and of his frame of mind under those pressures this letter is said to have been intercepted by a russian detachment and industriously spread about in order to disspirit his friends on that account some have suspected its authenticity but the letter is surely highly consonant to his circumstances and sufficiently agreeable to his general manner of writing so that we do not think ourselves dispensed with inserting it in this place  formerly my dear marquis the affair of the  th august would have decided a campaign at present tha action is no more than a scratch a great battle mu determine our fate we

enough to express our joy but till then let us not flatter ourselves for fear some unexpected bad news should detect us too much  i lead here the life of a millitary monk i have much to think off about my affairs and the rest of my time i devote to literature which is my consolation as it was of the consul the father of his country and of eloquence i know not if i shall survive this war but i am determined in case it should happen to pass the rest of my days in retirement in the bosom of philosophy and friendship  when our correspondence shall be more open you will oblige me by writing more frequently i know not where we shall have our winter quarters my houses at breslaw were destroyed by the bombardment our enemies envy us every thing even daylight and the air that we breathe they must however leave us some place and if it is safe it will be a treat to receive you there  well my dear marquis what is become of the peace with france your nation you see is more blind than you imagined those fools lose canada and pondicherry to please the queen and the czarina heaven grant that prince ferdinand may well reward them for their zeal the officers innocent of these evils and the soldiers will be made the victims and the illustrious offenders will suffer nothing  these are the subjects which offer themselves to me i was in a writing vein but i see that i must conclude lest i

excursions had perceiv that the french according to their usual negligence w not very exact in their outposts and patrols he had a received intelligence that they had thrown a corpse of h and foot consisting of something more than two thousa men into the town of zierenberg a place surround with some damaged walls  from these lights he resolved upon the surprise of the body and accordingly made his dispositions for this bo attempt in the manner following first he ordered a bo of his light troops to turn the town of zierenberg and take post between it and darienberg in order to interce any that should attempt passing to the camp of the enemy next he posted at proper distances eight squadrons of dgoons two battalions of grenadiers and one regiment of foot on the road between his own camp and the place which was to be attacked with a view to cover his retreat in case he should be repulsed and pursued with the rest of his foot consisting for the greater part of english he marched with the utmost caution and diligence toward the town  when they had arrived within two miles  the column of the english grenadiers having forced the gate advanced regularly with their bayonets fixed and without firing a musket by the two streets that led to the churchyard which being the only open part of the town served the french as a place of arms killing or taking a great number of those who ran from the houses toward this rendezvous and thus they advanced with the greatest order and the most profound silence until they reached the churchyard the night was so dark that they formed by the side of the french who for a while took them to be their own piquets that had assembled but they were soon undeceived a fierce encounter with bayonets ensued in which the french were quickly obliged to give way  two regiments of the enemies dragoons endeavored to fly to the gate that led to their camp but they found it occupied by  00 grenadiers who drove them back with their bayonets forced from hence they fled to another gate there they were repulsed with a sharp fire of small arms then they were compelled to separate and flying at random as fortune and the night directed made their escape at the several breaches of the wall the prince was mter of the place in about an hour but the nearness of  french camp and the approach of day prevented as long  continuance in the place as he wished for reaping the fruits of his victory therefore about three oclock he gan his retreat carrying off two pieces of cannon    ocers and between four and  00 private men the slaugter of the enemy was considerable the prince reached camp without the least molestation in his retreat  if we consider the difficulty of this attempt very  have been bolder if we examine the dispositions  could be conducted with greater wisdom if we attend the behavior of the troops we shall no where find a ample of more exact obedience discipline and coura to attack so large a body of the enemy so strongly po within a small league of their grand camp to march so fa that critical situation and in a very dark night to divide i so many parts yet to act with so much order and so en a concert was certainly an exploit of the very first ra and though not of any great importance in its consequence is so admirable in its conduct and execution that it  deserves to be told at the length we have given it  added greatly to the reputation of the british soldie troops and no less to their honor as men by the hunity they showed to their prisoners and the generous timents of the common sort with regard to money there were several noble instances that night of their resing to take any thing from their prisoners who had ofed them their purses they lost but ten men  from this time the operations of the two armies w for a time seemed to languish were renewed with fresh gour prince ferdinand perceived that whilst the fre communication with the rhine and with frankfort on  maine continued open it must prove to little purpose attempt any thing either for the relief of gottingen or sel their progress indeed into hanover had been cheed but whilst ever they continued in so advanced a pon it was evidently impossible to prevent their making ry ruinous inroads into that country to force them  battle against their inclination would be difficult and attempt itself dangerous there remained but one me which was to make frequent and strong detachments i the southern parts of hesse and wetteravia and thus der precarious the french communication with the rhine and maine from whence they drew the greatest part of their supplies of all kinds  with this intention he detached general bulow at the head of a strong corpse who pushed forward toward marpurg surprised the town destroyed the french ovens with several hundred wagons of flour and carried off a considerable quantity of clothing and military stores in the mean time his light troops scoured the country in such a manner as for a while answered the great end of the expedition in breaking the french communication with frankfort proceeding on this plan he made a further movement toward frankenau which at length necessitated the french general stainville who commanded in those parts to quit his position and endeavor to stop the progress of this detachment he came up with their rear as they were passing the river orche  it was to be apprehended that he might have pursued this advantage to the entire ruin of m bulows detachment if the hereditary prince by a forced march of five german miles had not arrived time enough to support him on the princes arrival m stainville fell back and took possession of a strong post in which it was in vain to attack him  whilst these measures were taking with mixed success for disquieting the french and interrupting their communication to the southward of their quarters like movements were made to the northward to oblige them if possible to relinquish their hold on gottingen but general wangenheim who with that design had crossed the weser and in the beginning had proceeded with no small expectations but at length he received a severe check which forced him to repass the river with some precipitation  but whilst the grand armies thus watched each other the eyes of europe were drawn to a different quarter by a movement equally astonishing for its rapidity and mysterious for its design the hereditary prince of brunswick whom we have seen but a few days before in the further part of hesse suddenly appeared on the frontiers of the united provinces with an army of twenty battalions and ten squadrons one detachment of his troops which ha proceeded on the side of dusseldorp passes the rhine above roeroot another which had marched through munster passes it nearly about the same time but a great distance below at rhees these two detachments moved t meet each other and as they proceed seize all the french posts along the rhine the enemys guards are every when taken or abandon their redoubts this puts into the possession a number of boats by which they are enable to transport all the rest of the troops which are intended t act upon the left of the rhine then they proceed without delay or opposition directly to cleves the garrison takes refuge in the castle  the secrecy and the rapidity of the march togethe with the vigor of the subsequent operations were such  might be expected from the character of the heredita prince but on what design this rapid march was mad and these vigorous steps taken at that particular time ga room for a great deal of reasoning during a good part  the summer very great preparations had been made i england for a conjunct expedition a powerful fleet was i readiness and they had embarked a large train of fi and battering artillery a considerable body of foot and regiment of light horse  as this armament was supposed in readiness to sail abo the time of the hereditary princes march to the rhine conjecture united these two designs together and suppose the fleet at portsmouth and the army in westphalia we to act on the same plan on this supposition it was judge that the storm would probably fall on the austrian netherlands and that ostend which the empress so unpolitically for herself and so ungratefully to her former friends had given into the hands of france would be the first object of those forces which were to unite from such a distance  this design of the expedition from portsmouth has we understand been formerly disavowed whether in strictness not being a principal in the war with her imperial majesty england ought to have made such an attempt though ostend was defended by a french garrison we shall not take upon us to determine but without the aid of such considerations it is evident there were sufficient objections to it from the side of mere prudence almost insuperable difficulties occurred in such a scheme and it would scarcely appear to most men advisable to add a flemish to our german war  but we think it possible to give some reasonable account of the expedition of the hereditary prince independent of any connection with the british armament for a considerable time the french had seemed resolved to resume their former plan of an army on the lower rhine such motions were made as strongly indicated that this design would shortly be put in execution and the allied army had every thing to fear from it for as the french were checked from proceeding to the complete conquest of the electorate by the allied army on the dymel if this army should itself be so checked by one of the enemy advancing from the lower rhine there would be then nothing to hinder m broglio from sending forward so strong a reserve as might finally reduce hanover in these circumstances nothing but a very decisive victory could possibly save the allied army thus surrounded and deprived of its subsistence from perishing in the most miserable or surrendering in the most shameful manner  there was one step only which might with certainty prevent this design and even in some measure turn it upon the enemy the taking cleves and wesel into the hands of the allies this would not only defeat the scheme of the french for acting on the lower rhine but greatly embarrass their operations in every other quarter even the attempt though it should not be attempted with success would necessarily draw the attention of the french that way and thus save hanover at least for one campaign this alone had been a sufficient reason for the march but had the british armament at the same time been intende for some part of the coast of france or had england politically kept up such a rumor when she had in reality  more remote object for her armament in either of these cases it would undoubtedly have cooperated with the hereditary princes designs by detaining a greater body o the french troops at home to defend their own coasts  we do not pretend to penetrate into all the motives but it is evident that in the german enterprise every thing depended on the celerity of the operations the siege o wesel was carried on with great vigor by that part o the princes army which was on the right of the rhine  whilst the prince covered it on the left but before the enemy could disturb him nature declared against his success by the fall of immense rains which swelled the rhine and lip to such a degree as greatly interrupted the progress of the siege having rendered the roads of westphalia impassable and therefore prevented the arrival of these reinforcements which were intended to push the siege with the greater effect these rains also made it very difficult for the prince to preserve his communication with the besiegers which however he made a shift to keep open by one bridge above and another below the town  in the mean time the french with all the expedition they could use had collected an army under m de castrie of thirty battalions and thirtyeight squadrons partly from the great army in hesse partly from the low countries this body advanced as far as rheinberg and after a strenuous resistance drove out a detachment of the allies which had been posted there from thence they marched by their left and encamped behind the convent of campen the hereditary prince now saw at the same time the season and a superior army acting against him to fight this enemy fully prepared to receive him with the troops which he could spare from the siege might be a desperate attempt to break up the siege would have of itself answered the intention of the enemies march there was no  medium but a surprise which was resolved and all the dispositions for it made with the judgment by which the great prince who commanded is distinguished upon such difficult occasions this attempt became the more necessary and the less time was to be lost in making it as intelligence had been received that the french army was shortly to be augmented by powerful reinforcements the prince began his march at ten in the evening  to reach the enemys camp it was necessary to dislodge fischers corpse of irregulars who had occupied the convent of campen in their front this produced some shot  on this occasion the english nation regretted the loss of one of its most shining ornaments in the death of lord down who whilst his grateful sovereign was distining him to higher honors received a mortal wound in this battle he was a person of free and pleasurable life but of an excellent understanding amiable manners and the most intrepid courage in the beginning of this war he had a considerable share in rousing a martial spirit amongst the young people of rank in england and having long showed them by a gallant example how to fight he at last by a melancholy one showed them how to die for their country  as the british troops had been the greatest sufferers in this as well as in most other actions of the campaign great murmers were raised against the commander of the allied army as if upon all occasions even the most trivial he had wantonly exposed the lives of the british in order to preserve those of the german soldiery some carried this complaint to a ridiculous length but could it with reason have been expected that where   000 english had served for a whole campaign were engaged in five sharp encounters some of them a sort of pitched battles in all which they acquired the whole glory that they should lose a sma number than     killed and   0 wounded which is whole of their loss in all the encounters of this campai it is true the life of a man is a sacred thing and of val his country but in some circumstances it is ridiculous a nation to think of sparing even a greater effusion of  to acquire reputation to their arms and experience to  troops and the officers the english desired the po honor with equal spirit and wisdom they were entitle it they had it and they purchased it more cheaply on the whole might have been expected neither their blood lavished on every trivial occasion as had  falsely suggested the only affairs in which they suff any thing worth notice were those of warbourg campen both actions of the highest consequence  after the disappointment and loss the hereditary p had suffered in the late engagement he was sensible the siege could no longer be carried on with any prospec success in sight of an army so much superior the r every day swelled more and more and his communica with the troops before wesel became every hour more ficult besides as the whole country was by this  overflowed his men must have been exposed to the grest hardships and the most fatal distempers these cderations determined to repass the rhine without  notwithstanding the extreme nearness of the french a the late repulse the prince had met and the great swel the waters such was the impression he had left on  enemy and the excellence of his dispositions that they not even attempt to distress his rear and he passed rhine without the least molestation not only under the but as it were within the grasp of a superior french a  from this the operations of the armies became grad more languid for as nothing decisive happened on e side during the whole campaign it was impossible to thin this advanced season of undertaking any very signal enterp as if by common consent they began to move tow winter quarters so that whatever happened after  was not connected with the general plan of the campai and were the sudden acts of detached parties who atte tempted some advantages of surprise of these we shall  some notice before we conclude but we pass them by present the attention of all men being at this time  engaged by an event of the greatest importance and which many were of opinion would make no small change in the nature of the war and above all in the general system of pacification this was the death of george ii king of great britain  he died suddenly in his palace at kensington in the   th year of his age and   d of his reign the immediate cause of his death was the rupture of the substance of the right ventricle of his heart by which the circulation was stopped in an instant this was preceded by no sort of apparent illness his majesty enjoyed an uncommon degree of health and strength for that age but it was believed that he had suffered by exposing himself too much to the cold in reviewing some troops that were to be embarked for the expedition he had been extremely solicitous about the fortune of this expedition he had been no less anxious for the fate of the enterprise under the hereditary prince an account of the ill success of which he had received though it was not at that time made public this was believed to have touched him deeply and to have been one of the causes of a death so afflicting to all his people  when future historians come to speak of his late majesty they will find both in his fortune and his virtue abundant matter for just and unsuspected panegyric none of his predessors in the throne of england lived to so great an age few of them enjoyed so long a reign and this long course was distinguished by circumstances of peculiar felicity whether we consider him in the public or the private character his subjects allowing for one short and as it were momentary cloud enjoyed perpetual peace at home and abroad on many occasions accquired great glory there was to the last a considerable increase in their agriculture their commerce and their manufactures which were daily improving under the internal tranquillity they enjoyed and the wise regulations that were made in every session of his parliaments by a wonderful happiness he left these emprovements no way checked but rather forwarded in one of the most general and wasteful wars that has raged in the world for many centuries  he lived entirely to extinguish party and the spirit of party in his kingdoms it was not till the close of his reign that his family might have been considered as firmly and immoveably seated on the throne but he having baffled all the private machinations of his enemies policy dued at length the utmost effort of their force and the  on that menacing occasion he experienced in the f measure the affection of his people yet the completion this great service to his family he owed solely to the  city and bravery of his own son  he lived with his queen in that kind of harmony confidence that is seen between the best suited couple private life he had a numerous issue in which he great cause of satisfaction and very little of disquiet what was the almost necessary consequence of a life tracted to a late period he survived seven of his child he had the satisfaction to see in his successor what is rare the most effectionate obedience the most dutiful quiescence in his will and what is no less rare cont to the fortune of most old kings he never possessed  perfectly the love of his subjects than in the last year his life and he died at the very point of time when  terror of his arms the power of his kingdoms and the dom of his government were all raised to almost as  a pitch as they could possibly arrive at they were in at that height of prosperity and glory as never had  exceeded in the reign of the most fortunate of his pcessors  his parts were not lively or brilliant but the whol his conduct demonstrates that he had a judgment both  lid and comprehensive he understood the interests of  other sovereigns of europe and was particularly ski in all the recesses of that political labyrinth the system  germany of the liberties of which he was through whole life a most zealous asserter in the year      took up arms and even risqued his own person when the projected dismemberment of the house of austria  were in danger of falling a sacrifice to a french fact he afterward resisted with equal firmness that very ho of austria which he had exposed his life to defend w the liberties of the empire were threatened from t quarter  the acquisitions of his father were by him confirm improved and enlarged he was enabled by his oecono always to keep up a considerable body of troops in haver by which means when the war broke out there  a disciplined force ready to oppose the common enem and we do not hazard any thing in asserting that if it had not been for the prudent foresight of that measure the army which has since been formed and the great things which have since been done could never have had existence so that if we only examine what he has done in germany when we reflect what enemies secret and declared he had at different times to manage and to fight in that country he must in every fair judgment be allowed the greatest prince of his family  he was in his temper sudden and violent but this though it influenced his behavior made no impression on his conduct which was always sufficiently deliberate and attentive to his own interests and those of his subjects  he was plain and direct in his intentions true to his word steady in his favor and protection to his servants and never changed them willingly this appeared clearly in those who served more immediately on his person whom he scarce ever removed but they grew old along with him or died in their places but having been in a sort compelled by a violent faction to relinquish a minister for whom he had great affection and in whom he reposed an unlimited confidence it afterward became a matter of more indifference to him by whom he was served in the affairs of his government  he was merciful in his disposition but not to such a degree as in any sort to encourage offenses against his government on the suppression of the rebellion in      he behaved without any remarkable display either of severity or clemency many were pardoned many punished and this perhaps is the most proper conduct on such occasions where offended majesty requires victims justice examples and humanity pardons but though the law in many instances had its free course the excesses committed in the rage of war were by him neither commanded nor approved after that rebellion had been suppressed he retained no bitter remembrance of it either to the country in which it unfortunately began or even to many of the persons who were actually concerned in it  as he came into england in a riper age and of consequence never had been able to attain a perfect knowledge of the force and beauties of our language he never showed a sufficient regard to the english literature which in his reign did not flourish and this must be considered as the greatest or rather the only blemish that lay upon his gvernment  he has been censured as a little too attentive to mone and perhaps in some minute things this censure was  wholly without foundation but there are two considertions which greatly enervate this objection to his charact first that this disposition never showed itself in one pacious act and  dly that it never influenced his cduct on any important occasion for it is now well kno that he showed no improper parsimony when this  broke out in fact he expended so much on that ocsion that on his decease his private wealth was found  be far inferior to what had commonly been imagined  though it is true that during his whole life he  shown a remarkable affection to his hanoverian subjec yet the last act of it demonstrated that they were  from engrossing the whole of his regard and that  reality his german possessions held no other place in  consideration than what their relative importance to t rest of his dominions naturally claimed for when t truly severe trial came in which the interests of engla and hanover were separated when a war began for an ject wholly foreign to that country a war in which haver must suffer much and could hope no advantage en there his majesty did not hesitate a moment to expose  german dominions to almost inevitable ruin rather the make or even propose the smallest abatement from the imensity of the english rights in america a conduct the more than wipes of every suspicion of an improper patiality and which surely ought never to be mention without the highest gratitude to the memory of that maanimous monarch  if the authors of these sheets were equal to such a design it would perhaps be impossible to exhibit a mo pleasing picture than that which might be formed from  just view of his late majestys conduct to these two  differently constituted parts of his dominions his virtu was proved by two of the greatest trials to which the nature of man is liable the trust of absolute and unbounded power and the most exalted station limited by the strictest laws for these two so very different situations very different and almost opposite tempers and talents have been always thought necessary but that king had a mind perfectly adapted to both for whilst in england he kept the liberties of his people inviolate and like a wise magistrate was satisfied to make his authority cooperate with law and his will freely subservient to the wisdom of ages in hanover like an indulgent father acting only from the sentiments of a paternal heart his affection and his equity supplied the want of law and constitution he has indeed left to his illustrious successor an admirable example which he not only promises to follow but in many respects to exceed and his subjects take the greater interest in his virtues as they look upon them as more peculiarly their own and they now boast of a prince who neither has nor can have any partiality but the best and who is in birth as well as inclination british  as soon as his present majesty came to the throne and had met his parliament  chap viii russians and austrians enter brandenburg general hulsen retreats from saxony to

chapter exhibited a true picture of that monarchs apprehensions the events which immediately followed proved that these apprehensions were but too well grounded the victory near lignitz indeed gave so relief to silesia but whilst the enemy had so many and  numerous armies in the field even shame independent  their interest exacted from them some stroke of coquence  the late maneuvers had necessarily drawn the king  prussia into the southern parts of silesia and consequen to a great distance from brandenburg with which coun his communication was much interrupted or rather who cut off

lately been sent into pomeran returned with incredible speed and joined the troops und hulsen but when they viewed their combined strengt they found it consisted of no more than    or   000 me a force far too weak to oppose to those powerful armi that were marching against them wholly unable to protect a place of such immense extent and such imperfect fortifications they saw that to attempt a defense would be only to involve the troops in the inevitable fate the waited the city without being able to add any thing effectual to its security therefore after having defended it against the advanced guard of the russians under tottleben who attacked the gates and bombarded the town when they found the grand armies advancing they made their retreat leaving only three weak battalions in the place to enable it to make some sort of capitulation with the enemy  berlin is composed of five towns which have stretched to each other and grown into one vast city upon the banks of the river spree it has been augmented to this grandeur by having long been the residence of the electors of brandenburg and kings of prussia who as they have enlarged their dominions by inheritance force or policy have all contributed something to the grandeur and magnificence of this their capital the situation of the town on so noble and navigable a river as the spree communicating on one side with the oder by a canal the most princely work of her sovereigns and on the other falling into the elbe has added not a little to its extent and opulence but that which has contributed most of all has been the reception of the french refugees to which this city has always been a most assured and favorable asylum as it has also been to those protestants who have been persecuted in any part of germany and the present king by enlarging his plan and imparting an extent of toleration unknown to his predecessors has also introduced roman catholics whom he has encouraged by suffering them to build a most magnificent church in the heart of berlin by this means he has brought the most opposite factions to concur in promoting the grandeur of his royal residence from these causes berlin is become one of the most considerable cities in europe vast in its extent considerable in its commerce and magnificent beyond most others in its public and private buildings and the regular distribution of the streets in the new town it had long been the seat of the greatest military arrangements in the world and it was made by the present king the seat of arts and sciences and the place of resort of ingenious men in every science in every art and from every quarter  such is berlin which at this time being deserted by the greatest part of its garrison was abandoned to the mercy of a mighty army of austrians russians saxons and imperialists animated by revenge exasperated by injuries and instigated by avarice nothing could exceed the terror and consternation of the inhabitants on this occasion they were acquainted with the savage character of one part of the enemy and with the violent animosity of the rest and they knew that they did not want pretenses for coloring their severities with the appearance of a just retaliation  in these dispositions of the inhabitants the enemy appoached the garrison immediately proposed to capitulate with respect to them the terms were short they were made prisoners of war but with regard to the inhabitants where the great danger lay the conditions were more tolerable than they expected they were promised the free exercise of their religion and an immunity violence to their goods and persons it was also agreed the russian irregulars should not enter the town and the kings palace should be inviolable these on the w were favorable terms and they were granted princip on the mediation of the foreign ministers residing berlin who interposed their good offices with great and humanity the difficulty was how to secure the servance of them  these conditions being made the army of allied powers entered the town  but though their behavior was tolerable with regard the private inhabitants there was something shocking a ungenerous in their treatment of the kings palaces  apartments of the royal castle of charlottenburgh w entirely plundered the precious furniture spoiled the ptures defaced without even sparing the antique sta collected

resembl him most and being informed desired that he might h leave to take it together with two german flutes which t king used to keep them he said in memory of his majest this was a sort of taking very different from pillage  they staid in the city four days but hearing that t king apprehensive of this stroke  was moving to the rel of his capital they quitted it on the   th of october and having wasted the whole country round for a vast extent and driven away all the cattle and horses they could find retreated by different routs out of brandenburgh leaving the people still trembling under the alarm and hardly yet certain of their safety  we do by no means undertake to authenticate the ravages which the prussian accounts charged upon the austrians and their allies in this incursion nor whether they may not have been in general much exaggerated or in some cases absolutely feigned we have abundant reason to suspect the exact veracity of many pieces of that nature which have been published on all sides and which are but too frequently a sort of state libels where the powers at war not content to destroy each other in the field pursue their adversaries reputation and endeavor mutually to paint each other as monsters equally devoid of justice and compassion indeed if we were to give credit to all the writings of this kind that have appeared it were hard to say which of the parties have by their conduct brought the greatest disgrace upon human nature it is however certain that the country of brandenburg suffered more severely on this occasion than the city of berlin an ill disciplined army is always most furious in its retreat and the country had made no conditions  chap ix imperialists make themselves masters of misnia m stainville enters halberstadt

whilst he was protected on every other quarter by ponds hills and woods it was impossible to choose a more advantageous situation in which above  0000 men were posted with every precaution that could

that wary commander from his post and yet he saw a necessity of fighting him even there the winter was now far advanced his troops were extremely harrassed by such long and rapid marches and he had no place for their winter quarters but his own country already wasted by the enemies incursions and here streightened for subsistence cut off from all power of recruiting he was to expect to be attacked as it were in a narrow corner by the combined force of so many powerful and exasperated enemies  in these circumstances he was resolved to come to a battle he caused his army to be informed that he was to lead them to a most desperate attempt that his affairs required it and that he was determined to conquer or die in the expected engagement they unanimously answered that they would die along with him  animated by this declaration he began his march  m daun as soon as he perceived that the king of prussia was serious in his resolution of fighting to prevent confusion sent all his baggage

enemys intrenchments and made way for a new attack their cavalry which broke in with irresistible impetuo upon the austrians and threw several bodies of them i irreparable disorder it was now about nine oclock t two armies were involved in a pitched darkness yet the continued without intermission and the battalions with blind rage discharged at each other without distinguishin friend or foe  m daun did every thing in the disposition and the action that became his high character but he was obliged t yield to the miraculous fortune of the king of prussia h received a dangerous wound on the thigh and was carri from the field which probably disheartened the troops a hastened the defeat the command then fell on the cour odonnel who finding a great part of his troops in disoder the night advanced and the enemy possessed of eminences which commanded his camp and of which it wa vain to think of dispossessing them ordered a retreat which was conducted in this darkness and across the elbe with wonderful order none were lost in passing the bridges and far the greater part of their artillery was preserved the prussians remained masters of this wellfought and bloody field the darkness hindered them from molesting the enemies retreat or improving their victory which they bought at the expense of ten thousand killed and wounded and about three thousand prisoners but even with this loss the advantage was well purchased it was a necessary and a glorious victory it reestablished the reputation of their arms it secured their winter quarters and gave them again the possession of a great part of saxony  probably of all the king of prussias battles this was the most important and it was that in the conduct of which he showed the greatest skill intrepidity and perseverance his troops behaved with a firmness which would have done honor to those which he formerly led into bohemia in this action where they were to surmount every obstacle and encounter every difficulty and danger in order to attack so great and excellent an army as the austrian under such an accomplished commander as m daun their number did not exceed fifty thousand men  the loss of the austrians was very great the number killed and wounded is not indeed accurately known probably it did not much if at all exceed the loss on the side of the victorious army but the prisoners were far more numerous two hundred and sixteen officers of the austrians were taken among whom were four generals together with eight thousand of the common sort the king in this battle in which he every moment exposed his life to the greatest dangers received a slight contusion in his breast by a musket shot  the austrians disputed the victory in the gazettes but the king of prussia reaped all the fruits of it he recovered all saxony except dresden it had been the extremity of rashness to have commenced the siege of that place in the depth of winter and in the sight of an army strongly posted and which though it had been beaten continued after its defeat more numerous than his own his troops had already sustained fatigues almost beyond human strength and the most prudent part now left was to permit them to enjoy a little repose and in the interval of action to prepare by employing the means his victory had put into his ha for the arduous work of the ensuing campaign  indeed the face of the prussian affairs had been prgiously changed since the day in which their enemies  entered berlin it was observed that the taking of that  had been before this ominous to the austrian cause that general haddicks expedition against it in       been followed by the victories of rosbach and lissa as irruption was by that of torgau there was some difence between the former victories and the latter but  prussians drew motives of consolation and hope from  coincidences there was also something solid in the advtages they had acquired after the king of prussias  had delivered berlin general werner marched into porania and on his approach together with that of wi the russians raised the siege of colberg which they  kept so long blocked up by sea and land and then  into poland not having been able to effect in pomerania the operations of the whole year more than the devastat of the open country then werner having freed  eastern flew to the relief of the western pomerania wh the success was as rapid and more brilliant he defea a body of swedes which was posted near passewalk cpelled them to retire with the loss of a thousand men  killed and prisoners and pursuing his advantage with  the swedes were at length compelled to evacuate the psian pomerania and to fall back upon stralsund  all the armies of the russians at length quitted the ki territories general laudohn abruptly raised the blockade  cosel and afterward abandoning landshut he retired i the austrian silesia and left all the prussian part in q m daun after the battle of torgau seeing the king  prussia attempt nothing against dresden placed one part  his army in that city and cantoned the rest in those stro posts which lie to the south and west of it by which  commanded the elbe and kept open his communication wi bohemia the army of the empire retired into franconi and placed its head quarters at bamberg  the king of prussia omitted nothing to reestablish  affairs and the recovery of saxony gave him great opportunities for that purpose we may judge of the importanc of that possession by the resources he was able to draw from it he demanded of the circle of leipsick for the contributions of the ensuing year two millions of crowns exclusive of the ordinary revenue together with a vast quantity of forage and provision from all the other parts of misnia which he held he exacted in the same proportion he compelled them also to supply a vast number of recruits his demand was twenty thousand and though it be certain that they could not supply so many yet he was enabled by the recruits furnished by saxony alone entirely to fill up the breaches which the battle of torgau had made in his battalions he drew also vast resources from the duchy of mecklenburgh which he taxed at some millions of crowns an immense quantity of provision and a great number of recruits these he insisted either on receiving immediately or that the duke should enter his troops into the prussian service it is said that his majesty then made some sort of treaty or composition with the duke whose condition has been from the beginuing of the war the worst that can be imagined for his situation is such just behind the prussian dominions and out of all possibility of communication with the grand armies of his allies that he cannot be benefited by any advantages which they acquire on the contrary he suffers almost equally whether the king of prussia be victorious or defeated and his dominions must furnish the means of improving the kings victories and repairing his losses if the king of prussia has made a treaty with this prince there is no doubt that it is almost wholly in his majestys favor and that he has taken care that he shall not draw much less profit from the duke of mecklenburgh as an ally than he had derived from him as an enemy  in short with regard to extent of possession the king of prussia is much in the same situation in which he was left at the closing the foregoing campaign but in all other respects his condition is infinitely preferable he had then indeed the same possessions in saxony but he closed that campaign with the loss of two battles destructive in themselves and disgraceful in their circumstances he closed this by a most beneficial and most glorious victory by which the reputation of his arms greatly tarnished was restored to its former brightness and which in its consequences has given him as fair a prospect of success as he can have whilst the alliance against him is not in the least degree weakened by the falling off of the most inconsiderable member or the abatement of the smallest degree of their animosity  chap x the allies raise the siege of gottingen winter qu and sufferings of the british troops popular debates england concerning the german war  the allied army in westphalia after their failure the lower rhine turned their attention to the ward of the wefer and made a vigorous attempt gottingen which from the   d of november until   th of the following month they kept blockaded the french made a brave defense and having taken a post of the allies in a sally they compelled them to raise blockade they were before heartily weary of it ha suffered incredible hardships both in this and all the services of the campaign in which they had so often versed that great tract of country which lies between maine the wefer and the rhine and though the w continued very temperate and open such unusual had fallen that the waters were every where out and roads so damaged that their provisions could scarcely a or their communication be preserved  at length therefore they submitted to go into quarters leaving the french in possession of hesse and whole country eastward of the wefer to the frontier the electorate by which they communicated with austrians and imperialists and prevented the fuccours which the king of prussia after the battle of torgau intended to reinforce the allied army the english were cantoned for the winter in the bishopric of p born and lord granby established his head quarter the city of that name but these quarters proved a indifferent place of repose for the british troops worn with the fatigues of so laborious a campaign partly the natural penury of the country and partly from vast numbers to be supported at a time when the sphere their subsistence was extremely streightened and even narrow sphere exhausted by having been four years the of war this scarcity was increased by the difficulty of roads and probably in some degree by the avarice of tractors over whom several were of opinion as watch had not been kept as is at all times necessary for sort of people  but whatever were the causes of this scarcity it was bitterly felt by the troops and was accompanied by diseases which thinned them extremely this raised a general discontent in the army which was speedily communicated to england where the people during the preceding year not having been struck with those brilliant advantages which distinguish an offensive campaign did not confine their complaints to the conduct of the war but began to fall into an almost general dislike of the very system upon which it was pursued  much of the old dispute between the naval and continental schemes was renewed and enforced with many additional topics the alliances of the war in gerrnany were severely criticized we are pursuing said they a system by which we must certainly lose all the advantages which we acquired for the short time we followed one that was more national and suitable to our circumstances a system of fall others the most absurd a system in which defeats are attended with their usual fatal effects and in which even victory itself cannot save us from ruin we will not enter said they into that long and vainly agitated question whether we ought to take any part in the differences which may arise between the powers on the continent this disquisition is foreign to the present purpose and it is beides of too vague and general a nature to admit any precise determination but this undoubtedly may be asserted that we never can consistently with common prudence engage n a continental war against france without a concurrence in our favor of the other powers on the continent this was the continental scheme of the great king william and his principle the foundation of the grand alliance which he projected and at the head of which in defense of the liberties of europe he made the most august appearance to which human nature can be raised it was on this principle that in conjunction with half europe we carried on the war with so much honor and success against france under the duke of marlborough but to engage in a continental war with that power not only unassisted but opposed by the greatest part of those states with whom we were then combined is an attempt never to be justified by any comparative calculation of the populousness the revenues or the general strength of the two nations it is a desperate struggle which must finally end in our ruin  but what is the scene which we have chosen for  struggle we have chosen germany the very spot of others which the french if they had their choice w have pointed out to us by making germany the the of war they see that country wasted and destroyed  strength of which has always proved the greatest bul against there overbearing ambition they see the sw of the germans from one end to the other of that vast  populous country turned against each other and they  with joy the english whose interest it is to save the  much as possible cooporating with her blood and sures to complete the disunion and consequently the solation of germany in a war in that country france  many advantages she supports her armies in a great de by pillaging those whom in every respect it is her intere weaken she is not very remote from her own from from whence she is easily provided easily recruited an means of which a great part of the public money is exped in the country where it is raised is she unsucce she is brought thereby but the nearer to her frontiers ports her troops with still the greater facility and exh still less the natural wealth of her people even sup the french army driven into france even then these vantages on her side are increased and very obvious cumstances render it impossible for the allied army to  their success on the german frontiers of france to any cisive consequence  but to the english every thing is unfavourable in  a war their greatest successes will only carry them  greater distance from their resources and every step their progress must make the transport of provision artill ammunition and the infinite impediments of a large a more difficult and in the end altogether impracticable  is not speculation the events which followed the battl crevelt have proved it prince ferdinand victoriou that action was obliged rather from the difficulty of sisting than the superiority of the enemy to repass  rhine and to bring back to germany that war with w he threatened france it is thus that upon this plan tory itself cannot save us and that all our successes serve  to accumulate new distresses new difficulties new cha whilst france who has only contracted her expenses the loss of her navy encourages us to enter deeper deeper into the inextricable toils of a german war in which we waste our strength only to entangle ourselves further she holds the strings and can never be tired out at this game from all this arises an expense unknown even in thought to our forefathers and which the single revenue of england is by no means able to bear the allies if they deserve the name supply not the smallest part of it the hanoverians and hessians contribute to our service only by enabling us to protract still longer our efforts in a system in which nothing can so effectually serve us as being defeated as early as possible  as to the king of prussia what we pay to that monarch may rather be considered as tribute than subsidy since we receive nothing in return and that far from being able to afford any relief to our armies he is scarcely in a condition to support himself so that this alliance is worse than the former as it is an heavy charge compensated not only with no real but even with no apparent or shewy advantage indeed he is an ally the last in the world we ought to have chosen on account of his long connection with our worst enemies the mean and the hostile sentiments he has always entertained toward us the injuries he has done us and the general lightness of his faith with regard to his former allies we regard him it is true as the protector of the protestant religion but how lightly he thinks of all religion his writings testify and what mischiefs he has done the protestant cause in particular this war will be a lasting memorial when he entered saxony a protestant country he found that religion no ways molested in those places where it had been established or tolerated by the treaty of westphalia even in the popish dominions the persecution began to lose something of its edge when he under the name of its protector brought upon it as great a calamity as its most determined enemies could have wished by dividing the reformed states of the empire and setting protestants to cut the throats of protestants whilst all the popish powers have been forced into a strict confederacy  had we kept ourselves clear of this runious system and instead of engaging france on her strong side attacked and vanquished her colonies one after another we might without exhausting our own strength have gradually wasted away the principal resources of her trade and whilst we continued this method have as little reason to grow tired of a war the whole funds of which would be spent at hom france has to grow weary in the present manner of ing it on if the powers on the continent were left  out our interposition to do their own business they w probably better understand and better defend  their rights at worst let france enter let them conque them possess hanover there is no mischief they can do country greater than it suffers by the present war an not exhausting ourselves by a fruitless defense should i end by the entire possession of the french colonies be  besides the security of our own just claims to restore hanoverian dominions to their lawful sovereign and to procure some indemnification for what they might suffered in our quarrel  this is pretty nearly the substance of what was  against the german system and the argument was ducted with great management and address and interspe with a number of topics well calculated to spread discon and to place in an odious light every step taken in tho liances and in that war many however strongly adh to that method and they answered that the best sons on the other side were more specious than solid that the chief writings against our german connections declamations rather than arguments that the compl of the expense of this war was in some measure just if the advantage was in any degree equivalent the expe was incurred to good purpose that france by enga so heartily as she has done in the german war has d away so much of her attention and her revenue from navy that it enabled us to give such a blow to her man strength as possibly she may never be able to recover  engagement in the german war has likewise drawn from the defense of her colonies by which means we h conquered some of the most considerable she possessed has withdrawn her from the protection of her trade  which it is entirely destroyed whilst that of england  never in the profoundest peace been in so flourishing a cdition so that by embarking in this german war fra has suffered herself to be undone so far as regards her pticular and immediate quarrel with england but has  had in germany such successes as will counterballance  loss far from it at this moment she is infinitely less vanced than she was the year she entered germany  aving spent such immense sums of money and lost by the word by disease and by desertion at least  00000 of her people  on the other hand the account stands thus with regard to england deeply embarked as she has been in this german war in her particular quarrel with france she has been carried along with an almost uninterrupted tide of success she has taken many of the french colonies she has destroyed their navy and their trade and having insulted the enemies coasts has ruined an harbor which might one day prove very obnoxious to us then how stands the account in germany the french have been there frequently defeated hanover has been recovered and protected the king of prussia has been preserved so long at least from the rage of his enemies and in general the liberty of germany has been hitherto secured so that if we have incurred a great expense we have done by it infinitely more than france has done at an expense much greater than ours for the advocates who declaim against the king of prussia seem to have forgot that the charge of the french army must exceed ours as the number of their troops to be paid exceeds the difference between french and english pay those on the english establishment in germany have at no time exceeded   000 and the rest of the confederates serve very nearly on the same terms with the french not to mention the subsidies so greatly superior to ours which that power pays to states from whom she has not a single regiment to augment her armies thus although by our victories france is relieved from the charge of her navy and that of the defense of some of her most considerable colonies the german war alone has brought her finances to a distress of which the whole world has been witness and nothing less could have happened the expense however contracted was still enormous and the resource of every war trade was almost wholly destroyed in england the expense was also undoubtedly great but then the old trade still remained to supply it and new channels were opened had we lain by and tamely beheld germany in part possessed and the rest compelled to receive laws from france the war there would soon have been brought to an end and france strengthened by victory by conquest and alliance would have the whole force and whole revenue of her mighty monarchy free to act against us alone  they argued further that common faith obliged us  an adherence to our engagements both with hanover  prussia and that the pleaded incapacity to assist them sing from the greatness of the charge could not excuse because the incapacity was not real and if the exp was inconvenient we ought to have looked to that w we contracted our engagements that it was nott that we received no advantage from our alliance with king of prussia for if it be once admitted that we tered with any reason into the german war which  supposed proved then the king of prussia has been  materially serviceable to us because it was his victor rosbach and the reinforcement from his troops w has enabled us to do all that has since been achieved  the like manner if the support of the protestant relig be any part of our care that religion must suffer eminly by the ruin of the king of prussia for though the tings attributed to his prussian majesty be such as if re his reflect on account of their impiety great disgrace  his character as a man yet as a king in his public and litical capacity he is the natural protector of the protes religion in germany and it will always be his interest defend it  we shall not presume to determine which party has  right side of this question it was once undoubtedly a qtion very fit to be discussed with great care but have chose our party it is at present little more than a m of political speculation

to take some notice of the atten of the celebrated thurot it happened much earlier in  year than the events which we have just related but to avoid breaking the thread of the more important events in germany we have reserved it for this place  the reader will remember that in the french scheme for invading these islands which was described as it then appeared to us in the  th chapter of the annals of      a small squadron was prepared at dunkirk under monsieur thurot the destination of which most people at that time imagined to have been for scotland but it has since appeared that this little squadron was intended to make a diversion on the north coast of ireland whilst the grand fleet under monsieur de conflans made the principal descent in some of the southern parts of that kingdom the manner in which the latter and principal part of this project failed has already been related among the transactions of that year it remains now to give some account of the part in which thurot was concerned  his squadron consisting of five frigates on board of which were    0 land soldiers sailed from the port of dunkirk on the  th of october      they had been blocked up until that time by an english fleet but under favor of an hazy night they put out to sea and arrived at gottenburg in sweden ten days after from thence they made to bergen in norway in these voyages the men were reduced by sickness and the vessels themselves had so suffered by storms that they were obliged to send one of the most considerable of them back to france it was not until the  th of december that they were able to sail directly for their place of destination but their old ill fortune pursued them with fresh disappointments for near three months they beat backward and forward amongst the western isles of scotland having in vain attempted a convenient landing near derry in this tedious interval they suffered every possible hardship their men were thinned and disheartened another of their ships was separated from them of which they never heard more the now remaining three were extremely shattered and their crews suffered extremely by famine this obliged them to put into the isle of ilay  here they heard for the first time of the defeat of cflans squadron this was a circumstance of great couragement but as thurot could not be sure that intelligence was not given to deceive him he persisted his resolution to sail for ireland indeed he had sca any other choice for he was so poorly victualled tha could not hope without some refreshment to get back france and he was further urged on by his love of gl no small share of which he was certain to add to his racter if he could strike a blow of never so little imtance on the coast of ireland for by this he might  some appearance of having revenged the many ins which had been offered to the coast of france  full of these ideas he arrived before the town of rickfergus on the   th of february and landed his tro now reduced to about  00

colonel jennings commanded al four companies in the town mostly of new raised men tremely ill provided with ammunition and no way prered for this attack which they had not the least re to expect however they shut the gates sent off french prisoners to belfast and took all the measures  circumstances would admit the enemy advanced  attacked the gates there was no cannon but the g were defended with effect by musket shot until the munition was spent then the garrison retired into  castle which having a breach in the wall near  0 fee extent was no ways tenable they therefore surrende prisoners of war with terms of safety for the town  thurot as soon as he was master of carrickfergus iss orders to belfast to send him a quantity of wine and pvisions he made the same demand to the magistrate carrickfergus which they having imprudently refused comply with the town was plundered thurot havi victualled and gained as much reputation by this action could be expected from a fleet which was no more tha sort of wreck of the grand enterprise set sail for fra but he had not left the bay of carrickfergus many hou when near the coast of the isle of man he perceived the sail that bore down upon him these were three eng frigates which happened to be in the harbor of kinsale when thurot made his descent the duke of bedford lord lieutenant dispatched orders to the commander of the frigates to go in quest of the french armament the english frigates were one of    guns commanded by capt elliott and two of     such was their diligence and success that they overtook thurots squadron before they could get out of the irish sea they were exactly three frigates to three the french ships were much the larger and their men much more numerous but both ships and men were in a bad condition a sharp and close engagement began none of the french could possibly escape and they must take or be taken thurot did all that could be expected from the intrepidity of his character he fought his ship until she had her hold almost filled with water and her decks covered with dead bodies at length he was killed the crew of his ship and by her example those of the other two dispirited by this blow and pressed with uncommon alacrity by the signal bravery of capt elliott and those who commanded under him struck and were carried into ramsay bay in the isle of man even this inconsiderable action added to the glory of the english arms none had been better conducted or fought with greater resolution this sole insult on our coasts was severely punished and not a vessel concerned in it escaped the public indeed lamented the death of the brave thurot who even whilst he commanded a privateer fought less for plunder than honor whose behavior was on all occasions full of humanity and generosity and whose undaunted courage raised him to rank and merited distinction his death secured the glory he always sought he did not live to be brought a prisoner into england or to

advantageous consequences vaudreuil he governor of canada after levy had been compelled o raise the siege of quebec fixed his headquarters at montreal to make if possible a last stand in that place or which purpose he carried in all his posts and here he ollected the whole regular force that remained in canada at the same time he sought to keep up the spirits of the people by various rumors and devices which he practiced on their credulity but monsieur vaudreuils greatest hope as not in his artifices nor his force but in the situation f canada which is much harder to be entered than when the enemy has entered it to be conquered on the ide where the most considerable part of the british force was to act it is covered with vast impenetrable woods orasses and mountains the only tolerable entrance for an rmy is by the river st laurence and the navigation of his river is rendered extremely difficult and hazardous by the number of shallows rifts and falls that lie between the discharge of ontario and the isle of montreal vaudreuil was in expectation that the preparations necessary for conducting an army through such a long and difficult way would necessarily consume so much of the summer as not to leave sufficient time for the operations absolutely necessary to reduce the remainder of canada he did not apprehend much danger from the garrison of quebec which had been weakened by its defeat in the spring these considerations gave him some confidence that he might protract the war somewhat longer and another year might possibly give fortune an opportunity to take some turn in his favor  but mr amherst whose calm and steady resolution no difficulties could overcome was taking the most effectual measures to defeat his expectations his plan was disposed in this manner brig genesis murray had orders to advance toward montreal on his side with all the troops which could be spared from the garrison of quebec colonel haviland sailed from crown point and took possession of the isle au noix which had been abandoned by the enemy on the   th of august and from thence had orders to proceed directly to the city of montreal his own army consisting of about  0000 men he proposed to transport by the way of lake ontario into the river st laurence thus he proposed entirely to surround the last place of importance which the enemy possessed and by the mo the three armies in three such different routs to re impossible for them to form an effectual opposition to  his corpse  having laid this general plan he left sherdy on the frontiers of new york  it was a matter of the greatest difficulty to transp numerous an army the whole of its artillery its amtion and all its provisions over the expanse of the lake in open boats and galleys it required the greate tion and the exactest order lest they should fall foul one another lest they should be driven out too far to the land on the first threatening of a storm or lest they  come too near the shore but all the dispositions made in the most admirable method and with that rity of military arrangement which makes so conside a part of the character of that able commander  the whole army embarked on the  0th of

were so disposed that the isle was completely invested the garrison was left no means of escape the ba were then raised and opened and after two sharp firing  this being a post of importance both to command  ontario and to cover our frontier the general spent days here in order to repair the fort and at the same  to fit out his vessels and to prepare all things for passin troops down the river the most dangerous part of  he was now to encounter as all the rapids lie betwee  of the town and fortifications of montreal in canada place and montreal but notwithstanding all precautions near  0 men were drowned in passing these dangerous falls and a great number of vessels broke to pieces this loss from so large an embarkation in such circumstances is to be regarded as very inconsiderable at length after a tedious fatiguing and dangerous voyage of two months and seventeen days since they left senectady the english saw to their great joy  they were immediately landed in the best order and all dispositions were made for attacking the place so excellently was this plan concerted and so faithfully executed that genesis murray landed from quebec that very day and col haviland with his army

plundered not one man was killed except in the attack of isleroyal none was more distinguished in this respect than sir william johnson he led into canada an army of  000 of the fiercest and most cruel savages which are bred in america without doing the least damage to the country or offering the slightest injury to the persons of the inhabitants to effect this he was obliged to exert the most unwearied endeavors and the whole of those uncommon talents which give him such power over the minds of all sorts of men the great victories by which he has advanced the interest of the nation have done him less honor than his conduct by which he has so greatly advanced its character for humanity and moderation it were to be wished that the same might be said of the army which marched from quebec who finding that the inhabitants in some parts were out in arms were under a necessity of setting fire to the villages the tenderness of genesis murrays nature revolted when the giving such orders became a necessary part of his duty in the course of this summer  before we take our leave of the american affairs of this year we ought to make some mention of a war with the savage indians which broke out on the back settlements of our southern colonies the cherokees one of the most numerous and powerful nations of these barbarians had in the beginning and during the greatest part of the progress of the war appeared to be heartily engaged in our interests at their desire a fort had been built in their country called fort london from the then commander in chief of the british forces in america some parties of them had peared in our favor on the last expedition against for quesne but it is thought that on that occasion they ceived some insults and had been treated in general w neglect which made the deepest impression on the min so vindictive a people these discontents were fome by the french who hoped to cause a diversion of a p our forces in this quarter at length they commenced tilities in their usual manner by cruel ravages and m on the frontier of their neighboring provinces and  was very great reason to apprehend that the same ar of the enemy and the same opinion of ill usage  draw the neighboring and powerful nation of the c into the like measures  mr lyttleton who was then governor of car having in vain endeavored to pacify them  the resolution of marching with all the force gular and provincial  the governor had all imaginable reason to be sati with the effect his expedition had produced and ha as every body believed effectually chastised the former lence of the enemy and secured the future traquillity the southern provinces he returned to charlestown  these perfidious barbarians equal regardless of their  and of the safety of their countrymen whose lives  pledged for their fidelity broke cut as soon as the  was removed into their former ravages blocked up  london which stands in the middle of their country made some attempts on fort edward which lies nearer to the settlements their total want of skill in carrying on sieges prevented them from any hope of mastering these places otherwise than by treachery or famine they failed in the first instance and the last required time  the imminent danger of two english garrisons and that whole tract of her colonies being made known to general amherst he detached colonel montgomery to their assistance with a regiment of highlanders a battalion of the royal americans a body of grenadiers and the provincial troops he marched into the enemies country he made war upon the indians after their own manner no other would have been effectual he burned estatoe the capital of the lower cherokees consisting of  00 houses an indian town of the very first magnitude and then proceeded to the same execution on all the towns and villages of that district of the cherokees which were numerous populous and wealthy the inhabitants generally fled on the approach of our troops some however were burned in their houses and some women and children were made prisoners  this universal destruction of the lower settlements being completed col montgomery passed on to the middle cherokees  though col montgomery was victorious on this occasion yet it was necessary to retreat on account of his wounded for whom he had no place of safety for if he should attempt to proceed he had to apprehend frequent skirmishes as he had advanced and the number of wounded together with the difficulty of his march would be hourly creased this retreat was certainly necessary but wh col montgomery had arrived at fort st george he covered part of his orders which threw the whole cou into consternation which was that when he had cha the enemy he was to return to new york with the tr under his command and rejoin the grand army the orders without delay he obeyed not however with  rigor but that the earnest entreaties of the province vailed on him to leave about four hundred men for the protection  carolina and the neighboring colonies were again exp to the fury of a savage enemy not so much weakened exasperated by their late sufferings the fate of the garri of fort loudon was but too certain for several mo they had suffered a close blockade at length seeing hope of relief their provisions being totally sumed and the enemy showing some pacific  positions  but the enemy equally regardless of faith and humty fell upon them in their march butchered all the cers but one killed several of the private soldiers and ried thee rest into an horrible captivity these outrage the southern colonies threw some damp on the joy wh was felt over the english america on the entire conq of canada  in europe the fortune of the campaign was nearly blanced in america except this inconsiderable savage w it was entirely triumphant in the east indies also  gained glory and new advantages after the raising  siege of fort st george in february       english army took the field under major breton which also the french were entirely driven by the heroic actions of col clive  encouraged by these successes a body of about   00 men europeans and seapoys under the command of major brereton advanced further and attempted to dislodge an army of french and their confederate indians encamped under the cannon of a fort of that country construction the acquisition of that place had been a valuable advantage sept  but here our army was obliged to retire with a loss of between   and  00 killed and wounded  genesis lally animated with this and some slighter advantages threatened the siege of trichenopoly and the french affairs seemed again to revive but it was only a momentary gleam to check his progress col coote at the head of the greatest body he could draw together on that coast invested wandewash took the place in three days and made the garrison prisoners of war  this progress alarmed genesis lally he called large detachments in from every side and knowing the importance of wandewash made all his efforts to recover it he pushed forward the siege with the utmost vigor hoping to take the town before col coote could arrive to its relief but the colonel marched with equal diligence and arrived about the time when the french had made a practicable breach  of the english in this action near  00 were killed and wounded in particular the death of the gallant major brereton was much regretted of the blacks about  0 wounded and slain  except the battle of paissy followed by the revol in bengal this action was the most considerable in its sequences of any in which our troops had ever been eged in india this was fought in part against euro troops headed by an able general the dispositions o battle and the conduct of col coote in the engage merit every honor  this victory was pursued with a spirit equal to the which it was won chittiput was taken in a few days  and the army allowing itself no repose marched di from thence to arcot the capital of this immense pro the siege was opened on the  th of february and t surrendered on the  0th near  00 europeans were  prisoners of war colonel air cootes letter to mr secretary pit dated village   th of february    0 sir i have the honor to acquaint you of the situation of our  on the coast of coromandel since my arrival and of our  successes soon after i arrived the governor and council dras being informed that genesis lally had sent a detach his army to the southward and that that party had taken ham and threatened trichenopoly with a siege it was thoug viseable that i should take the field with the army and by means endeavor to draw the enemy from the southward cordingly on the   th of november      i took the field on the   th invested wondiwash and erected batteries having made a breach by the  0th took the place and man garrison which consisted of five subaltern officers    primen and  00 seapoys prisoners of war there were  garrison    pieces of cannon and a great quantity of ammu december the  d i invested carangoly on the  th i open two gun battery and on the  th another and began to ca the approaches on the  0th being near the crest of the  and having dismounted all their guns but four col o who commanded sent out a flag of truce and on the ac of his gallant defense i granted him the following terms  the europeans should have leave to march out with their two rounds per man drums beating and six days provi the seapoys to be disarmed and turned about their bu the garrison consisted of  00 europeans officers included  00 seapoys and nine guns having intelligence that brig genesis bussy was arrived at arcot from the northward with  00 europeans and a large black army and that the army which lay at chittiput was to join him and that the force from the southward were on their march toward arcot i therefore thought it advisable to cross the palla and encamp the army opposite the arcot having the palla between us three thousand moratta horse about this time joined the enemy which put me to the greatest distress for want of provisions as they plundered all the country on the   th lieut genesis lally arrived at arcot and took the command january the  th the enemy were all in motion on the  0th genesis lally marched with all his army toward wondiwash and i moved with our army along the bank of the river in order to observe their motions and cover our own country on the   th i received a letter from the commanding officer at conjeveram that  00 of the enemys europeans and a large body of horse had entered the town and that the rest of their army lay at jangolam three miles distance from it i therefore put the army in motion and endeavored by a forced march to save that place which was very weak but of consequence to us and happily arrived there the   th before daylight the enemy quitted the place their army moved toward wondiwash the   th i crossed the palla with all the army and on the   th arrived at outremalour about fourteen miles from wondiwash which place i found m lally had invested and began to raise batteries the   st i went with all the cavalry to reconnoitre having received a letter from the commanding officer of the garrison that a breach was made i therefore determined to engage the enemy the next morning accordingly i sent orders back to the army to join me at irimborough nine miles from wondiwash where i had taken post with the cavalry on the   d the army marched at six oclock in the morning agreeable to the orders i had given out the day before for that purpose about   oclock our advanced guard of horse and that of the enemy began to fire at each other upon which i ordered captain baron de vasserot who commanded the cavalry to form them in order of battle he was supported by five companies of seapoys and at the same time i ordered up two pieces of cannon and advancing  with two companies of seapoys obliged the enemy to reti their main body of horse which consisted of  00 european  000 moratas on their left upon the whole of our ca advancing that of the enemy retired in pretty good orde our cannon began to play which was extremely well served obliged them to retire precipitately i then ordered the of brigade to the army which was about three quarters of  in the rear with orders for them to form the line of battle not to advance till i had joined them soon after having t possession of a tank which the enemys cavalry had occupi returned to the line which by that time was formed accordi my orders after reviewing the whole and finding the  great spirit and eager to engage i ordered the army to  forward  about nine oclock we arrived at the post we had drive enemy from which was about two miles from their camp halted in their view near half an hour during which t went very near to them and reconnoitred their situation  finding they were strongly posted and our flanks exposed to enemys cavalry which was vastly superior to ours i ord the army to march by the right in order to gain the advantag a hill three miles from us and about two miles from wondi fort and the horse which was then in the front to wheel to right and left and form behind the second line in order to  the rear guard and cover the baggage by this motion vered my right flank with the hill and had some villages i rear where i then ordered the baggage to this oblige enemy to alter their disposition during all this time we canded each other and skirmished with their advanced posts  mortta horse the latter disappeared about    oclock  enemy after making their second disposition moved toward about the distance of three quarters of a mile under cover bank the cannonading then began to be smart on both  and upon seeing the enemy coming briskly up i ordered the to march forward at    oclock the enemys european ca pushed with a great deal of resolution in order to force our  and come round upon our rear immediately i ordered up  companies of seapoys and two pieces of cannon which were sustain our cavalry who had been ordered to oppose them  on the cannon and seapoys flanking them they broke the cavalry then had orders to charge who drove them a mile from our left upon the rear of their own army we continued all this while advancing toward each other the enemys flank being very well covered by a tank it was one oclock when we arrived within reach of musquetry when a shot from us striking one of their tumbrils it blew up i then immediately ordered major brereon to wheel col drapers regiment to the left and charge their left flank which was executed with great order and much honor to that corpse seeing that regiment likely to suffer from a body of black troops together with their marines who were under cover and fired very briskly upon them and at the same time finding they had reinforced their left with a piquet from lallys regiment i ordered the grenadier company of drapers which was on the right of the second line to support their own regiment and having likewise two pieces of cannon playing upon the enemys flank completed the rout of that wing who abandoned their cannon and fell upon their own center which was by this time together with their right closely engaged with our left i then ordered up major monson with the rest of the second line and placed him so as to be able to support any part of our line at the same time flanking the enemy about two oclock their whole army gave way and ran toward their own camp but finding we pursued them quitted it and left us entire masters of the field together with all their cannon except three small pieces which they carried off the number of cannon taken is as follows one    one    three  0 two    one    two   and two  pounders iron three   four   one   and two

under the walls of chittiput about     from the field of battle and the next day marched into  our cavalry being greatly fatigued put it out of my power pursue the enemy as far as i could have wished during  whole engagement and ever since i have had the honor of manding the army the officers and men have shown the gre spirit nor can i say too much for the behavior of the tillery  the next day i sent out a detachment of cavalry to be the enemy january    finding that genesis lally had re with his broken troops to pondicherry i sent capt de vos with  000 horse and  00 seapoys toward pondicherry to stroy the french country and marched the army to besiege cput and on the   th at night erected a two gun battery  got in one    and one  0 pounder and played upon them fr  inch howitz the next day after making a breach le valier de tilly with his garrison surrendered prisoners of  the garrison consisted of four officers    private and  00 poys with    europeans wounded in the hospital i found in fort   guns and a good quantity of ammunition having intgence of a party of the enemy going from arcot to gingey  capt smith with a detachment to intercept them on the  marched the army toward arcot the capital of the province der to besiege it this day capt smith joined me having taken the party i had sent him after which consisted of  0 europeans  0 seapoys and two brass   pounders and soon after he took a captain of the lorrain regiment and three french commissaries  on the  st of february i set out from the army for arcot leaving orders with major monson to throw a few shells into timmery and to summon the garrison february   the army marched and encamped within two miles of arcot major monson reported to me this day that the garrison of timmery had surrendered prisoners of war there were in it six guns one sergeant  0 europeans and  0 seapoys february   i opened the batteries against the fort of arcot viz one of five   pounders and another of two    and one   pounders on the  th began to carry on approaches to the south west and west towers of the fort and having by the  0th got within  0 yards of the crest of the glacis the garrison surrendered prisoners of war it consisted of three captains eight subalterns     private and between   and  00 seapoys there were in it four mortars    pieces of cannon and a great quantity of all kinds of military stores we had during the siege seven noncommissioned and private killed and ensign mac mahon who acted as engineer and    wounded      at sea admiral pocock seconded the extraordinary efforts of col coote with his own usual skill and intrepidity french marine but though superior in the number of ships and more than in that proportion superior in guns men he was obliged after upwards of two hours severe bloody conflict to give way before admiral pocock and to take shelter under the forts of pondicherry during this engagement eight of the english ships stood the fire of the whole french fleet which consisted of    sail the  were greatly shattered   0 of our squadron were ki and wounded and on the side of the french the loss  not less than  000 admiral pocock immediately got himself again in a fighting condition and braved the french fleet before pondicherry who lay under their cannon and refused a new engagement  it has been observed that history can hardly produce an instance of two squadrons fighting three pitched battles under the same commanders in    months without the loss of a ship on either side after this engagement admiral cornish arrived on the coast of coromandel and joined pocock by which we attained so decided a superiority in strength as we had before in courage and ability that the french no longer appeared in those seas most of their ships went off as it was thought to mauritius then the french affairs went rapidly to ruin on the  th of april the important fortress of caracal surrendered to the sea and land forces under admiral cornish and major monkton by the taking of this and two other places of lesser consideration the french were actually reduced to the single port of pondicherry which was when these accounts  away closely blocked up by land and sea the stron hopes are conceived that this capital of the french  power and commerce will shortly be brought into our session and with these pleasing hopes we conclude the tory of the war of    0  the annual register or history of the war for the year      chap i preliminary remarks treaty proposed and entered into by the belligerent powers mr stanley sent to paris and mr bussy to london french machinations in spain difficulties in the negotiation design of the campaign in hesse and of the expedition to belleisle  after a general war of five years carried on with the greatest effusion of blood and the most extraordinary expense ever known to attend a war of that continuance it was hoped that if the animosity of the belligerent powers was not abated at least a great part of the fuel of discord had been consumed and that the time was arrived for giving peace to europe some propositions for that purpose had been made in the close of the year      those who rather wished for peace than very attentively considered the probability of effecting it seed to think it might then have been expected but w the public was flattered with these hopes the situatio affairs would not suffer us to believe that they had any  foundation we accordingly ventured to point out the ficulties which then obstructed any scheme for pea and as these difficulties were such as did not attend  particular conjuncture only but must subsist as long as fortune of war continued in the same train we were  the beginning apprehensive that the new negotiation  we have since seen opened and for some time carrie with such pleasing appearances might in the issue be tended with no better success  there are indeed but two situations in which peace be very rationally expected the first situation is the equality and this is either where nothing is gained oside so that when ever mutual weariness and unpble hostilities have calmed the ardor of the warring po no intricate points intervene to frustrate the first p disposition or it may be where the losses are so equal  exchanges may easily be made or the parties may rest tually satisfied with their advantage over each other  the second situation is that of necessity where o the parties is so entirely broken and reduced as to se to receive conditions on the footing of conquest a purchase repose by humiliating and enfeebling conce a peace upon this latter basis is always the grand po object in every war we flatter ourselves with the ho it against an experience almost uniform in fact it  the last degree difficult to reduce any of the great power europe to this disgraceful necessity for to reduce any of them to this state of submission you must in a man reduce all of them to it the war if it continues d state after state into its vortex until all europe is invol a sort of balance is then produced and the peace of cquest becomes impracticable  it would prove of the utmost moment to the tranq of mankind that this point was sufficiently regarded that they would willingly adopt that system of equality which sooner or later with more or fewer struggles are so often compelled to submit when seldom a  see history of the war    0 chap i p     is concluded on other terms as the king of prussia has found by severe experience and as we observed on a former occasion is only a short cessation and not a perfect peace but it must be acknowledged that this situation the most coincident with their true interest is at the same time the most contradictory to the passions and prejudices of nations it appears hard to loose upon every side every object of the war a peace on this foundation will be censured but it is the best on the same principle that the shortest follies are the best and that no injured pride is left to brood over a future war contrary to the opinion of the warm patriots on all sides we therefore imagined that the year seventeen hundred and fiftyeight in the close of the third campaign was the happy moment for negotiation at this time however no propositions had been made the propositions of seventeen hundred and fiftynine were but slightly regarded and obviously could end in nothing but in the beginning of the year of which we are now going to treat the scene of negotiation was opened with far greater solemnity and parade and as it was carried on with great diligence it necessarily makes a principal part of the history of this year it is indeed somewhat fortunate both for the writers and the readers of these events that this treaty has intervened the narative otherwise had proved extremely barren and unentertaining for though the animosity of the belligerent powers was not as we observed abated their efforts however had considerably slackened and their operations began gradually to degenerate into the petiteguerre those vast events that astonish the mind or hold it in a pleasing suspense those important battles and sieges those rapid and well conducted marches and those lively enterprises which distinguish the former years except in a very few instances scarce make any part of the history before us but though the operations of the field had fallen into a state of langour the cabinet became full of business and negotiation flourished in this situation candor obliges us to acquaint our readers that we are still more liable to mistakes than when we attempt to describe the transactions of the campaign it very frequently happens that the accounts of the military operations come authenticated from the hands of those great generals who have conducted them and when we have allowed for the partiality of the account there is nothing to be detracted from them for want of sufficient information even in the case of partiality we are often able to correc the misrepresentation or overcharge of one of the parties by that of the other these things are done in the eye of the world but the motives either to peace or war and the steps taken in a negotiation are all behind the curtain they do not appear for a long time and sometimes they never appear completely there is however an advantage in the present conjuncture for one of the powers at war in order to justify to its subjects and to the world its part in the continuance of a war so fatal to both has published an account of the late negotiation artful indeed and probably in some respects unfair but containing at the same time many valuable and illustrating pieces the authenticity of which is not disputed the point in such cases to be dreaded is not the publication of false pieces but the concealment of several that are real and important the public information is probably rather incomplete than untrue we wait with impatience for that full and authentic narrative of so important a negotiation which undoubtedly our court proposes to publish we have delayed the setting out our work the longer in hopes of its appearance by which we might have been able to perfect and correct our account of this transaction the account of the spanish negotiation has appeared late but we have not failed to make use of it at present we engage in our work under those difficulties which it is just the reader should know and allow for in the succeeding year we shall take care to profit of whatever further lights may be imparted  very early in this year      the courts of petersburgh vienna france sweden and poland agreed severally and jointly to offer proposals toward renewing that negotiation for peace which had abruptly been broken off in the close of the year      france was the principal and first mover for as it was her ambition which had made the war so general and her revenue which in a great measure supported it the former being now humbled by a series of unfortunate events and the latter reduced by most enormous expenses she began at length to relent and apparently to desire peace in earnest the other members of the grand alliance could not decently nor safely oppose these dispositions of france the court of sweden in particular was given to understand that the exhausted condition of france was the true motive of her moderation that in fact she was not able any longer to furnish the stipulated subsidies nor to adhere to the letter of her engagements with her allies these circumstances which she was neither able nor seemed disposed to conceal formed the surest guaranty of her sincerity  the five parties to the war on that side made as many declarations which were signed at paris on the   th of march and delivered at london on the   st of the same month the counter declaration of great britain and prussia appeared on the  d of april augsburg as the situation most commodious for the powers at war was appointed for the congress  lord egremont lord stormont ambassador in poland and general york our ambassador in holland were nominated as the english plenipotentiaries on the part of france the count de choisel was appointed augsburg now became the center of attention to all europe and each court prepared every thing toward this important meeting which it could furnish of splendour for the display of its dignity and of ability for the support of its interest the public conversation was for a while diverted from scenes of horror bloodshed and pillage and every mind was employed more agreeably on the public scene of magnificence and the private game of policy which was to ensue  in the first place it was unanimously agreed in order that a negotiation in itself sufficiently intricate should be the less embarrassed to admit to the treaty none but the parties principally concerned together with their allies  although this exclusion of the neutral interests tended greatly to disembarress and simplify the negotiation yet such was the variety of separate and independent matters which still remained to be discussed that it became advisable to make a further separation if they hoped to treat upon them with any tolerable ease or with any prospect of coming to a speedy decision  for this purpose it was necessary to bring back the motives to the war to their first principles and to disengage those several interests which originally and in their own nature had no connection from that mass in which mutual injuries and a common animosity had blended and confounded them this proposition came first from france and it was an early and happy omen of her inclination t peace  the war which was truly and originally german evidently had but a single though this a very difficult object to determine the fate of the king of prussia so many powers were concerned in this determination and the views of aggrandisement indemnification and revenge  various and difficult to be reconciled that this alone seemed matter enough for a separate and very arduous negotiation in effect all the powers of the north were concerned in it for this reason the other great object of the general war the limits of america which by that strange chain of hostile connections which even unites the various independent quarrels and enmities of europe had been mixed with the german disputes was again set upon its proper and peculiar basis and whilst the truly german interests were handled at augsburg it was proposed to treat on this head separately in london and in paris for this purpose ministers were mutually sent from those courts mr stanley on the part of england and mr bussy on that  france  this proposition was also exceedingly prudent for there is no doubt that if these potentates could settle their claims to their mutual satisfaction and should carry to augsburg the same candor and good faith and the same sincere desire of peace their influence must necessarily tend to inspire principles of moderation into the rest and must contribute largely to accelerate the great work of pacification  things were thus set upon the best footing possible and the negotiation seemed to be in the happiest train that could be wished but unfortunately the plan and disposition of the treaty were much more easily adjusted than the matter and the substance it was very obvious that france if she was willing even to pretend to a desire of peace could scarce avoid making concessions which to her were sufficiently mortifying the moment her proper quarrel came to be separated from the general cause she had every disadvantage in the negotiation because she had suffered every disaster in the war on the side of germany indeed she had acted with success but even there the advantages she had acquired were still precarious as the chance of war was still open no proposition for a cessation of arms having been admitted as she knew therefore that great sacrifices might be expected from her she did not so finally rest her hopes upon the negotiation as not to look out for another resource and this rendered on her part the whole proceeding less effective and less sincere  the resource she sought was in spain who she hoped could not look with indifference on the humiliation of the principal branch of the house of bourbon hitherto indeed the king of spain had observed a tolerable exact neutrality in his conduct and in his declarations had spared no expressions of good will and friendship to our court he seemed to be wholly intent on the internal economy of his dominions on the improvement of their long neglected police on the advancement of their commerce and the regulation of the finances but notwithstanding these domestic attentions the french ministry did not despair of drawing his regards abroad they thought that the offers which france in her present circumstances would find herself obliged to make must extremely alarm all good spaniards who could not see without the most serious apprehensions the french power wholly annihilated in america by this event their colonies though so much superior to all others in opulence and extent must in a manner be at the mercy of england no power being in any sort able to afford them assistance or to hold the balance between them and the power of england at this time indeed the french court had not absolutely succeeded in her designs at madrid but she was in hopes that every step she took in the treaty and every concession she should make would prove a fresh incentive to the jealousies and apprehensions of spain thus in effect all the motions which france seemingly made toward peace were in reality so many steps toward a new war and whilst at london she breathed nothing but moderation and the most earnest desire of putting a period to the calamities of europe at madrid she was taking the most vigorous measures for spreading them further and continuing them longer  on the side of england though there was far more good faith in the public procedure there were also it must be admitted many circumstances which cooperated to retard the peace the great and almost unparallelled success which attended our arms in this war had raised a proportionable expectation and inspired very high thoughts into the minds of the people they thought it unreasonable to make almost any concessions to a nation whose ambition and violence they had always found to correspond with its power and whom they now considered as lying at their mercy that this was the time for reducing france which if we let pass we could never hope again to recover in these sentiments it must have fared ill with that administration who should make a sacrifice of any of those objects on which the people had set their hearts  on the other hand it could not have escaped them that the situation of affairs in germany however they might be artificially separated in the discussion must necessarily have an influence on the final determination of the treaty they saw that after a severe struggle of five years the affairs of our nearest allies were only not ruined to say nothing of the condition of the king of prussia the whole country of hesse was in the actual possession of france they likewise held the county of hanau and by their occupation of gottingen the hanoverian territory lay open to their arms if this quarrel should be considered as a cause not strictly english though the french in their memorials contended it was yet certainly the hessians and principally the hanoverians were allies of so near a connection and had done and suffered so much in the common cause that it must have appeared shocking to all europe if solely attentive to our own peculiar advantages we should patch up a peace without any provision in their favor and it was very evident that this provision could not be made in the situation in which the last campaign had left them unless our government purchased it at a price that would be very grudgingly paid by the english subjects  the ministry perplexed between the natural expectations of their country and the reasonable expectations of their allies must have found it not a little difficult to know what party they ought to take in order to reconcile as much as possible these contradictory desires the only solution which could be found was to push the war with the utmost vigor and in the mean time not to hurry the negotiation in hopes that during its progress things might take such a turn as to enable them to purchase peace for their allies out of the acquisitions they should have made after the commencement of the treaty and without being obliged to have recourse to their conquests previous to that era on this footing they proposed to satisfy the demands of the public faith and at the same time to preserve the reputation which was so necessary to their affairs at home accordingly the duke of brunswick was to prosecute with the utmost vigor the operations which he had begun in the depth of winter and an expedition the object of which was then secret was prepared with equal diligence in england  in these equivocal dispositions and in this odd mixture of hostile and pacific measures began the year      a year more remarkable perhaps than any of those we have hitherto described for events which will be radically decisive of the future prosperity or misery of europe but less for those matters by which the imagination of the reader is commonly affected having in this chapter laid down as far as we can conjecture the political motives for the uncommon effort which was made in germany in our next chapter we shall give an account of the military plan of this effort the execution and the success of it  chap ii prince ferdinands plan allies enter into hesse and thuringia french retire hereditary prince repulsed at fritzlar fritzlar taken several magazines taken blockade of marpurg and ziegenhayn siege of cassel battle of langensaltze broglio reinforced from the lower rhine hereditary prince defeated at stangerode siege of cassel etc raised allies retire behind the dymel  at the close of the last campaign the french had the entire and undisturbed possession of the whole territory of hesse a country tolerably provided and which contains many tenable places some of these they had strengthened with additional works and they had amassed immense magazines in the most convenient situations this was their condition in the front of their winter cantonments on their left they had driven the allies from the lower rhine where they kept a considerable body of troops which streightened our quarters and checked our efforts on that side on their right they possessed the town of gottingen in which they had placed a very strong garrison and thus they shut us up on this quarter also whilst the kings german dominions lay entirely open to their enterprises  if we consider the situation of the french armies they will present us with the idea of an immense crescent the two advanced points of which were at gottingen and wes and the body extended in hesse so that being perfectly well provided with magazines and master of all the prope communications necessary for their current subsistence with strong places in their rear and in both their flanks in the next campaign they had only to advance their severa posts in a manner to enclose the allied army which without some signal success from their numbers and situation hardly to be expected would find itself entirely incapable o making any stand against them  prince ferdinand was very sensible of these inconveniences of his situation and of the advantages the enemy ha over him it was extremely difficult to settle a plan for action but no action could be attended with much wor consequences than inactivity in a bad condition he knew from experience that the french were ill qualified for winter operations in germany and that his own soldiers beside their superior hardiness and their being inured to the rigor of the climate could suffer but little more from field service especially if attended with success than they mu endure from the badness of their winter quarters it is tr that there was something discouraging in the attack of a very superior body of the enemy possessed of every advantage against him but it was clear that this superiority and these advantages would not lessen as the summer approached it was clear that every step the enemy gained on him would render his defense weaker and his resources mo scanty and that if the enemy found themselves in a condition to commence this campaign where they had conclude the last and that nothing should hinder their proceeding  the earliest season he could never reasonably hope to prtract the war to another year for to speak the truth th was the utmost which in his circumstances he could promise himself from the most judicious scheme of conduct  having therefore resolved to act he lost no time to a with vigor he appointed three places of rendezvous  the dymel the rhine and in saverland his army assembled on the  th of february without suffering the enemy to have any previous notice of their intentions the next day the troops halted and the duke communicated to his generals the disposition he had made for the motions of the whole  the center was led by his serene highness in person it penetrated directly into hesse and marching by zierenberg and durenberg made its way toward cassel the right and left of the army were each at a very considerable distance from this body but they were so disposed as fully to cooperate in the general plan of operation which was very extensive the hereditary prince commanded on the right he marched by stadbergen for mengeringhausen and leaving the country of hesse to the eastward as the alarm was to be as sudden and as widely diffused as possible he pushed forward with the utmost expedition into the heart of the french quarters general sporcken commanded a corpse at a greater distance to the left and penetrated into thuringia by duderstadt and heiligenstadt the design of this movement was to break the communication of the french with the army of the empire to open one for ourselves with the prussians and to cut off all intercourse between the grand army of the enemy and their garrison at gottingen  by this sudden extensive and vigorous attack the french were thrown into the utmost consternation they retreated or rather fled upon every side it could scarcely have been imagined that this was the same army which had but just closed the campaign with so much success such has been the sport of fortune in this war even beyond all former examples of her caprice that the instances are numerous of inferior and beaten armies without any apparent change in their circumstances driving the conquerors before them so remarkable was the revolution of fortune at this time that it is highly credible if the french had had their quarters in an open country their army had been totally destroyed but happily for them they had very sufficient means of securing their retreat for as the allies advanced they were obliged to leave cassel and gottingen at their backs into the former of which the enemy had thrown a garrison equal to a moderate army and in the latter they had   or  000 men beyond these again were fritzlar ziegenhayn and marpurg places of a tolerable degree of strength and well garrisoned besides some other inferior posts  the hereditary prince whose party was the most advanced struck the first blow by an attempt to surprise fritzlar he had received advice that it was not prepared to receive him he accordingly took only a few battalions and no cannon in hopes of being able to carry that place at once but unfortunately he was deceived in his intelligence the garrison was prepared and resolute and though the hereditary prince attacked it with his usual spirit he was obliged for that time to desist and to draw off with no inconsiderable loss  about this time marpurg was attempted in the same manner and with no better success genesis breidenback an hanoverian officer of great bravery experience and reputation who commanded there lost his life in the attack these two severe checks at the entrance into action did not however discourage either the parties that suffered them or the rest of the army they advanced as expeditiously and with more caution cannon and mortars were brought before fritzlar which after a defense that was rather made for the credit of the commander than from any hope of saving the place  notwithstanding this success in front it was not here the grand object of our operations lay cassel was to be reduced the french had in that town a garrison of    battalions besides some other corpse under the command of the count de broglio and there was no doubt that he would defend the place to the utmost the fortifications of cassel are mostly in the old manner they consist of very high but strong walls some works indeed had been newly added but the great hope of the enemy was in the strength of the garrison and the rigor of the season the siege of this place was not to be delayed however it was necessary previously to clear all the adjacent country of the enemy and to cut off the communication of the garrison with their grand army  therefore when marshal broglio had been driven quite out off hesse and had retreated toward frankfort prince ferdinand ceased to advance and having ordered two bodies to the blockade of marpurg and ziegenhayn which still obstinately held out he formed that part of the army which was with him into a chain of cantonments making a front toward the enemy which extended from the river lahn to the river ohm and from the ohm to the fulda thus he proposed to watch the motions of marshal broglios army to cover the siege of cassel and the blockades of the two fortresses just mentioned the siege of cassel was carried on by the count of lip schaumburg a sovereign prince of the empire reputed one of the ablest engineers in europe his management of the artillery at thornhausen was a principal cause in the acquisition of that great victory and it was not doubted that his abilities would be exerted as effectively at cassel trenches were opened on the first of march all eyes were now directed to this point for on the success of this stroke depended the whole fortune of the campaign it was very apparent that if cassel and its garrison should fall into the hands of the allies gottingen and the inferior places must inevitably fall along with it and this misfortune would be more than equivalent to the loss of a great battle  whilst the war was thus carried on in hesse m sporcken who commanded the detachment to the left on the side of saxony advanced with an intrepidity equal to the rest he was soon joined by a corpse of prussians and the united army lost no time to clear the werra and the unstrut of the bodies of french and saxons which occupied the most important post upon these rivers as these bodies were advantageously posted and could be supported on one side by the garrison of gottingen and on the other as they promised themselves by the army of the empire they maintained their ground and this soon brought on a sharp action  hitherto the affairs of the allies proceeded almost in an uninterrupted course of prosperity it was indeed a degree of prosperity altogether astonishing and which as at first it could scarcely have been expected so there was no reason to imagine it would have any long continuance for the allies on the side of saxony where m sporcken acted in proportion as their activity and success carried them forward left the countries on their rear more and more uncovered and exposed without any or with a very insufficient defense to the attempts of the powerful garrison of gottingen the count de vaux who commanded that garrison is a very able and enterprizing officer and he no sooner perceived that the allies were wholly intent upon driving their enemies from the werra and unstrut and on pushing the advantages they had acquired to the utmost then he marched out of gottingen with a strong detachment attacked and routed as hanoverian convoy fell upon the town of duderstadt with the utmost violence and though he failed in his first attempt he repeated it with so much spirit that at length he carried that town and afterward some of the most considerable places near it by these successes he prevented m de sporckens corpse from returning by the way they had advanced and indeed absolutely disqualified them from acting seperately from their main army to which soon after these events they were obliged to join themselves this junction now became necessary on another account  marshal broglio toward the close of the last campaign had been obliged by the enterprises of the hereditary prince to detach from his army in hesse a large body to the lower rhine he now found it equally proper to recall this body together with further reinforcements in order to maintain his ground in the country northward of the maine where he was closely pressed by the allies and which he must be compelled shamefully to relinquish if cassel was not relieved in time sensible of this with whatever difficulty he called in his most distant posts embodied his army inspired them with new spirits and made them capable by a more exact order in their discipline and a great superiority in their numbers of attempting something considerable  on the other hand the hopes of the allies depended on the effect of their first impression they were obliged to attempt too many objects at the same time and these too arduous for the number of which their army consisted for it was necessary that they should keep one army and that no small one employed on the siege of cassel another was occupied in the blockade of ziegenhayn a third was employed to the eastward of the fulda and still a fourth was necessary to cover and sustain all these various operations and to oppose itself to the attempts of marshal broglio it was but too plain that when the whole of the french force was collected in one point it could never be resisted by a part only of the allied army if they should attempt to draw away any of the separate corpse from the critical service upon which it was employed the entire purpose of their labors was given up in a word prince ferdinand had three strong posts of the enemy on his rear and their grand army now perfectly united on his front and his situation which was far from advantageous obliged him to call in m sporckens body which had effected its purpose and could best be spared however the prince kept his position as long as possible and the siege was carried on with as much vigor as a winter operation and the spirited defense of a great garrison ably commanded would admit  but marshal broglio as soon as he had collected his army advanced without delay he caused the troops under the hereditary prince to be attacked near the village of stangerode in the neighborhood of grunberg where he was advanced in front of the beforementioned line of the allied army the attack was made by the enemies dragoons the very first shock of which broke the whole foot consisting of nine regiments hanoverians hessians and brunswickers the french on this occasion made two thousand prisoners and possessed themselves of several trophies of victory few were killed or wounded on either side  after this blow the allied army could no longer think of making head against the french or of maintaining their ground in hesse they broke up the blockade of ziegenhayn and soon after raised the siege of cassel after twentyseven days open trenches they evacuated the whole country of hesse retired behind the dymel and falling back nearly to the quarters they possessed before this undertaking  thus ended an expedition which was carried on against many difficulties with much spirit and which at first excited great hopes it failed indeed in some of its objects but it produced its effect in the total of the operations of the year the french by the destruction or seizure of so many of their principal magazines were for a long time disabled from taking any advantage of their successes in the preceding campaign or from their late victory it was hot until the season was a good deal advanced that they were in a condition to act this cessation was not dearly bought even by the loss we sustained at stangerode and the extreme hardships the troops had endured during the whole service for circumstanced as both armies were at their quitting the field without this seasonable check it is probable we should have at this day no footing in germany both armies as it where by consent lay quiet in their winter quarters during their inaction the negotiation at london and paris whose commencement we have related in the first chapter was pursued without interruption  chap iii the negotiation continued propositions of uti possidetis debate concerning the periods belleisle described englise repulsed at lochmaria bay they make good their landing palais besieged town abandoned citadel capitulates  it must be observed that after the judicious seperations which had been made of the interests of the several powers at war there still remained a sufficient fund of intricacy and altercations in each particular discussion in order therefore to make the way to peace as smooth as possible it was resolved previously to establish some certain and simple points that might serve to direct and keep steady the whole negotiation these points were but two indeed they were so inseperably connected with each other that they seemed rather members of the same proposition than separate articles the first was that the two crowns should remain in possession of what they have conquered one from the other the second imported that the situation in which they shall stand at certain periods shall be the position to serve as a basis for the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers  as france was known to have had the worst in the war a proposition of statu quo coming from her must have appeared an instance of moderation altogether surprising to our ministers it is certain that had peace been concluded at that instant and upon the sole foundation of this article england would then have possessed all  conquests she had made every one of which was in a very high degree advantageous to her commerce and her power and none of which could be considered as a subject of future discussion on the other hand france continuing in possession of the places she had conquered would have acquired no advantage that could at all countervail the expense of keeping them at the same time that she would be exposed to endless altercations and would afford matter of the highest jealousy indignation and discontent even to her nearest allies this basis being therefore settled although it was evident that the treaty could not rest upon this basis solely england had certainly a great superiority in the negotiation and might rationally expect when they should come to talk of restitutions to purchase the evacuation of the french conquests in germany at a much smaller price than their apparent magnitude might seem to demand however these were still a matter of so much anxiety and the nature of the precise stipulations were still so uncertain that the negotiation though it proceeded with strong appearance of a desire for peace met with very frequent checks and delays both parties were indeed unanimous in the article of uti possidetis than which it must be admitted there could not be a better ground to treat upon but as the war still continued and whilst it continued might make a daily alteration in the fortune of the contracting powers it was necessary to fix upon some epochas to which this possessory article should refer  the french on this head proposed that the situation in which they shall stand on the first of september in the year      in the east indies on the first of july in the same year in the west indies and in africa and on the first of may following in europe should be the position which should serve as a basis to the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers they added further that as these epochas might seem too near or too distant for the interest of great britain they were extremely willing to enter into a negotiation upon that object  the english ministry received this proposition with less satisfaction than its apparent fairness deserved they entirely rejected the french epochas and declared that they could not admit without prejudice to themselves any other epochas than those which have reference to the day of signing the treaty of peace had this resolution been strictly adhered to it was evident that the negotiation was that moment at an end for though what was asserted in the french memorial in reply to this declaration that the basis of the proposition of uti possidetis was necessarily connected with the particular epochas proposed is by no means to be admitted it is on the other hand not easy to deny the validity of their subsequent assertion that if not these at least some certain periods during the war ought to be fixed and that the uti possidetis could not reasonably have reference only to the time of signing the treaty of peace for if the contrary principle was once admitted it would become difficult to know or even with probability to guess at the nature or the value of the possessions which by such an article should be mutually given away and if these difficulties occurred in the simplicity of a possessory article they must be increased tenfold upon every other and must come to such an height as to preclude all possibility of negotiation on things of so intricate a nature as exchanges and equivalents the french in their memorial insisted so strongly on the propriety of establishing these periods that they threatened to recall the whole proposition if they were not agreed to  it must doubtless appear at first view surprising to see france whose actual situation was very indifferent contending for a near period and england whose affairs were at that time apparently in a prosperous situation postponing the uti possidetis to one more remote but the truth is that in that particular neither party consulted their present condition they acted wholly on foresight for though the english on the   th of march when this proposition was made were carrying on the siege of cassel and the other strong places in hesse and the enemy had no army in that country to oppose them it was notwithstanding evident that from the slow progress of those sieges and from the alacrity of marshal broglio in collecting his troops they must be shortly obliged to abandon the enterprise it was evident that france must be reinstated in the absolute possession of her former conquests long before the epoch of the first of may the period which they fixed for europe both courts were fully apprized of this it was therefore the interest of france to offer and of england to reject this near period especially as the fate of the design on the coast of france was then depending and our administration seemed to have conceived no mean hopes of its success and no small opinion of its importance in the negotiation  the fleet employed in this expedition sailed from spithead on the   th of march and it was soon discovered that belleisle was the object  belleisle the largest of all the european islands belonging to the french king is between    and    leagues in circumference  the island originally belonged to the earl of cornouaille but has been since yielded to the king it contains only one little city called le palais three country towns  0  villages and about  000 inhabitants  the town of palais takes its name from a castle belonging to the duke de belleisle in its neighborhood which is now converted into a citadel which is a regular and strong fortification fronting the sea composed principally of hornwork and is provided with two dry ditches the one next the counterscarp and the other so contrived as to secure the interior fortifications this citadel is divided from the largest part of the town by an inlet of the sea over which there is a bridge of communication from the other part of the town and which is most inhabited it is only divided by its own fortifications and a glacis there are three nominal harbors in this island palais sauzon and goulfard every one of which labors under some capital defect either in being exposed shallow or dangerous at the entrance the only branch of trade carried on here is the curing pilchards  from this state of the island poor in itself capable of little improvement and so ill circumstanced in point of harbors a sort of a dislike to the expedition began to arise several did not see of what considerable service such a conquest could be of to england in time of peace or of what prejudice to the enemy in time of war they foresaw that it could not be taken without considerable loss or kept without considerable expense and on the whole they apprehended that when exchanges came to be made france would lay no great stress upon it on the other hand it was urged that though the harbors were bad yet small privateers might issue from thence greatly to the molestation of the french coasting trade and that the fleet of england might ride between it and the continent in a well protected road they imagined the possession of this island if not of great detriment to the interest of france would be a grievous wound to her pride and that those circumstances which had formerly induced her to expend money on the fortifications there and on the apprehension of an invasion to fill them with a powerful garrison would likewise persuade her to set a value on the place when it came to be estimated in the treaty  whilst they reasoned in this manner in england the fleet under the command of commodore keppel and the land forces under general hodgson arrived before belleisle on the  th of april and on the  th agreed to attempt a landing on the southeast of the island in a sandy bay near lochmaria point here the enemy were in possession of a little fort they had moreover entrenched themselves on an hill excessively steep and the foot of which was scraped away the attempt was made in three places with great resolution a few grenadiers got on shore and formed themselves but as they were not supported they were for the greater part made prisoners the rest of the army after several very brave and repeated efforts being wholly unable to force the enemies lines or make good their landing were obliged to retire with loss what added to the disaster was that several of the flat bottomed vessels were destroyed or damaged in an hard gale which followed on our retiring from the shore this made the prospect of any future attempt more unpleasing even than the first in this attack we lost in killed wounded and prisoners near five hundred men  neither commanders nor soldiers were however dispirited by this mortifying repulse they resolved if possible not to return without effect and then determined diligently to search the whole coast in order to find a place more favorable for another attack the view indeed was not encouraging the island is naturally a fortification and what nature had left undone to make it such had been amply supplied by art  it was a long time after this first failure before the weather would give our commanders an opportunity of a second trial however they persisted with the utmost steadiness and found at length a convenient situation not that it was a part of the coast less strong than the rest on the contrary they built their principal hopes on the excessive steepness and difficulty of the rocks which had rendered the enemy rather less attentive on this quarter this arduous attempt was made at a bold rocky shore near the abovementioned point of lockmaria besides the principle attack two feints were made at the same time to distract the enemy whilst the men of war directed their fire with great judgment and effect on the hills these maneuvers gave brigadier general lambert with an handful of men an opportunity of climbing up a very steep rock without molestation this little body having thus prosperously gained the top of the hill formed themselves in good order and without delay letters from major genesis hodgson and the hon coommodore keppel to the secretaries of state relative to their expedition against the island of belleisle on board the valiant off belleisle april         sir i have the honor to acquaint you that his majestys fleet under the command of com keppel and the transports with his mjestys forces on board came to an anchor in this road on tuesday the  th inst about twelve oclock soon after their arrival i went with the commodore to take a view of the coast and we agreed at our return that the port of st andro appeared to us to be the best place to make a descent and it was settled that sir thomas stanhope with some of his majestys ships and the transports with stuarts and grays battalions and marines on board should make a feint at sauzon at the same time that we made a real attack at st andro then it was too late in the day to do more than give the necessary orders for the troops destined to land first to be ready to embark early in the morning in the flat bottomed boats that i might attempt a landing as soon as the ships had silenced a four gunbattery which commanded the entrance of the bay this was soon done by the achilles after she took her station no time was then lost to go in with the boats with the grenadiers and the regiments ordered for this service but when we entered the bay we found the enemy so strongly entrenched on each side of the hill which was excessively steep and the foot of it scraped away that it was impossible to get up to the breastwork after several unsuccesful efforts seeing it was impracticable to force the enemy from their lines i thought it advisable to desist maj genesis crawford and brig carleton exerted themselves as much as possible on the occasion the latter is wounded in the thigh but in a good way of doing well the loss we suffered in our retreat was very inconsiderable as the fire of the ships covered it the weather has been so bad ever since the  th that i have not been able to get returns from the several corpse so i cannot ascertain our loss but i believe there are near  00 killed wounded and prisoners i shall desire mr keppel to go along with me to reconnoitre the island once more and if we can discover any part whereon an attempt can be made with the least probability of success we shall make a second trial i cannot help observing to you that the whole island is a fortification and that the little nature had left undone to make it such has been amply supplied by art the enemy having been at work upon it ever since sir edward hawke appeared before it last winter  i have the honor to inform you the greatest harmony has subsisted between the two services and i should not do justice to the commander and officers of his majestys fleet if i did not at the same time i inform you that they have assisted me to the utmost of my wishes in carrying on the operations pursuant to his majestys instructions  i have the honor to be etc shedholm hodgson   valiant in the great road of belleisle april         sir i had the honor of writing to you the   th of march when i left spithead it was from that time to the  th inst before the wind came to the westward to enable the fleet to steer in with the coast of france and that evening i detached six frigates in hopes they might in the night get so stationed as to cut off the enemys communication with the main land the next morning the fleet passed the south end of belleisle close along the shore and at one of the bays by point lomaria the general and myself thought a descent might be tried but as the wind was southerly it could not possibly be attempted at that time at twelve oclock the whole fleet anchored in the great road when immediately i went with genesis hodgson to the northern part of the island to be as well informed of the strength of the enemys works there as the time would admit and while we were upon this necessary service the ships of war in the road were preparing the flat boats for the reception of the troops but by the time we got back it was too late in the day to make any trial  the  th the wind northeasterly the boats being ready for the reception of the troops the signal was made very early in the morning for them to assemble at the rendezvous and three ships with two bombvessels were ordered to proceed round the point of lomaria at the s e part of the island and attack the fort and other works in the sandy bay round the beforementioned point the place the general and myself had agreed to have attacked  capt barrington in the achilles got placed first and soon silenced the fire from the fort and from the shore and then as he was directed made the signal of his having done so when the troops in the boats were pushed to the landing with great briskness and spirited behavior at three different places near to each other by capt barton whom i ordered to command the boats but the difficulty of getting footing and the enemy being strongly entrenched on the heights and in the little fort the troops soon met with such a repulse that it became necessary as well as prudent to desist from the attempt for the present and retire with the flat boats in which they were well covered by the ships and bombs  one of the flat boats landed sixty of erskines grenadiers who got up a very difficult place to the top of the hills where they formed with great skill but were so immediately routed by a much more numerous body of the enemy that all attempts to succor them was ineffectual any further than the boats bringing from the rocks about twenty of them  while all this was transacting sir thomas stanhope with four ships of war the battalions of grays and stuarts with  00 marines in transports were opposite sauzor at the northern part of the island these troops were embarked in the boats if possible to divert the enemy from the principal object  a gale of wind coming on very quick after the retiring from the shore has occasioned so much damage among the transports by the loss of anchors and flat boats that it takes up a very considerable time to put things in away to attempt what further may be thought practicable the loss of flat boats in the gale is twentytwo which will render the force of landing much inferior to what it was first attempted with  while the repairing and adjusting of these defects are in hand i hope some spot may be agreed upon where we may be more successful in the attempt than we were on the  th but if not so i hope his majesty will believe i have had nothing more at heart than the exerting the force entrusted to me in a manner most conducive to the honor of his arms  i have the honor to be etc a keppel   belleisle four oclock in the morning april         sir as i have just had a note from com keppel to inform me that a frigate will sail this day for england i have only time to acquaint you that his majestys troops under my command landed yesterday at five the enemys attention was so distracted with our attempts of landing at different places where there was the least appearance of our being able to succeed that it gave brig lambert an opportunity of climbing up a rock with a corpse i had left with him for that purpose if practicable the difficulty of mounting had made the enemy least attentive to that part beauclerks grenadiers with their captain patterson got up before they saw what was intended they immediately marched a body of  00 men to attack him the grenadiers maintained their ground till the rest of brig lamberts got up we took three brass fieldpieces and some wounded prisoners it is impossible for me sufficiently to commend mr lamberts conduct and gallant behavior on the occasion and take the liberty to beg you will permit me to request you will recommend him to the king as an officer deserving his majestys favor capt patterson has lost his arm i believe our loss is not above thirty killed i am afraid you will not be able to read this scrawl as i write it in the field the troops being on their march  i am etc s hodgson   valiant in the greatroad of belleisle april         sir i had the honor to send you a letter by the actoen frigate in which i gave you but little hopes since which time the general and i having considered that by attempting a place where the mounting the rocks was just possible and where the enemy were no otherwise prepared from the impracticable appearance it had to them than by a corpse of troops to annoy the boats in the attempt that it carried some degree of hopes with it and by making a disposition for the attack of their entrenched bays and at sauzon at the same time which the arrival of the transports with the light horse enabled me to do we might possibly gain a footing i have now the greatest pleasure in acquainting you that his majestys troops have made good a landing on the rocks near point lomaria and cannot sufficiently commend the spirit and good behavior of the troops in the attempt and the judgment with which sir thomas stanhope and the rest of the captains of the kings ships directed the fire upon the hills  capt barrington having been employed in many of the operations of this service i have sent him home with this letter and eg sir to refer you to him for the particulars  i have the honor to be etc a keppel      the landing of all the forces was made good in a short time after the loss in this daring and successful attempt was inconsiderable in one or two places the enemy seemed disposed to make some stand but the body of light horse which was embarked in this expedition soon drove them to the town and laid all quite open to the intrenchments before it the great difficulty now consisted in bringing forward the cannon which were first to be dragged up the rocks and afterward for two leagues along a very rugged and broken road this necessarily took up some time however the siege was commenced with vigor and the garrison commanded by the chevalier de st croix a brave and experienced officer threatened on their side a long and obstinate defense nothing in fact was deficient on either part the enemy made some sallies one of them with considerable effect major genesis crawford was made prisoner on this occasion but our troops were only animated by these checks a furious attack was made upon the enemies lines which covered the town and they were carried without much loss principally by the uncommon intrepidity of a company of marines which had been but newly raised no action of greater spirit and gallantry had been performed during the whole war  the town was now entirely abandoned and the defense confined to the citadel it was obvious that as our fleet prevented all communication with the continent and thereby cut off all hopes of relief the place must necessarily be reduced but the chevalier de st croix was resolved to provide for his own honor when he could not for the preservation of the place entrusted to him and since he could not maintain it to sell it as dear a possible accordingly there was no mention of yielding until the  th of june when there was no longer the slightest prospect of succor and the place was by no means safely tenable then he capitulated and the garrison marched out with the honors of war  thus was the island of belleisle reduced under the english government after a defense of two months in this expedition we had about eighteen hundred men killed and wounded the loss most regretted was that of sir william peer williams a young gentleman of great talents and expectations and who had made a distinguished figure in parliament he had but newly entered into the service he was shot in the night by having carelessly approached too near a sentinel of the enemy he was the third person of family whom in this war the love of enterprise had brought to an honorable death in these expeditions to the coast of france  whatever difference of opinion might have been entertained concerning the value of this conquest or the price which was paid for it the rejoicing in london was great and sincere the general and the land and sea officers employed in the expedition were the subject of very just applause who with so noble a perseverance had struggled with and had overcome such great difficulties and who had the spirit after such a disaster on their outset to renew an attack under circumstances nearly as unfavourable as those by which they had been at first foiled the city of london addressed the king on the occasion and it was generally expected that this new proof of our superiority must influence the negotiation in our favor some however were of opinion that it would rather exasperate the french and irritate their pride to renew these efforts which their misfortunes had slackened when they saw us in the midst of a treaty making attempts and carrying places in old france and as it were in the presence of that haughty court however as there was nothing done that was not strictly justifiable no complaint was made and the treaty proceeded to all appearance with as much good humor as before  chap iv england and france agree to treat of a separate peace epochas proposed by england court of vienna agrees objects of the negotiation proposals of france with regard to europe asia africa and america french memorial concerning spain indignation of the english minister english answer to the french memorial  it must be observed that though the courts of london and versailles treated seperately it was hitherto by no means proposed that this separate discussion should lead to a separate peace it was no more than a previous arrangement for the removal of those difficulties which might prevent the peace of france with england from being united with the general peace of europe but in proportion as the treaty advanced it became obvious that the settling of any terms which had no reference to the signature of something obligatory between the two crowns could at best be only void and illusory and might in the end even prove the source of dangerous and captious altercations the english minister therefore before he would agree to that definitively upon any point and particularly upon the epochas insisted upon two preliminary conditions  first that every thing which should be happily adjusted between the two crowns in relation to their particular war shall be made obligatory final and conclusive independent of the fate of the negotiation of augsburg  secondly that the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and france or preliminary articles to that end shall be signed and ratified between the date of that memorial and the first of the following august  if these conditions were accepted then england on her part consented to name determinate epochas to which the uti possidetis should refer the first of july for europe the first of september for africa and america and the first of november for the east indies the french ministry without contesting the epochas themselves complained of the conditions of the first because they said it departed from the letter and spirit of the memorial of the   th of march which was the foundation of the whole treaty of the second on account of the extreme shortness of the time allotted for the discussion of some difficult and momentous points and the adjustment of matters which regarded a war extended over the four quarters of the globe for the memorial which contained those conditions was dated on the   th and was not received at paris until the end of june so that little more than a month was left to obtain the consent of the court of vienna to a separate treaty to settle the terms of this treaty and finally to ratify it  if a very uncommon good understanding had not subsisted between her imperial majesty and the king of france it must have been very difficult to have received this consent but in fact it was immediately received and upon one very short and apparently reasonable condition that nothing might be stipulated to the prejudice of the house of austria but when this condition came to be explained as we shall see presently it was so far from faciliating that it created new obstacles to the peace however this acquiescence of the principal of her allies enabled france to accept of the first condition without reserve and to the last she verbally though not in the clearest terms agreed also  things seemed for the present in the best situation which in this stage of the treaty could be expected the basis of the negotiation was solidly established the article uti possidetis since the taking belleisle was a matter of less difficulty and the epochas were in general settled in such a manner as to coincide with the designs and desires of both parties the treaty was confined to the two powers and it was to be perfectly definitive as to them a time for concluding it was also in a great measure settled a circumstance which if it did not admit sufficient leisure for accurate discussion cut off however the opportunities of chicane and seemed to be the most suitable to a candid proceeding and a sincere desire of peace  the foundation being thus laid the superstructure was the next consideration this superstructure consisted in the adjustment of those compensations which were to be made for the reciprocal conquests and here the difficulty lay of the two powers a punctilio of honor might have intervened at the very first setting out extremely pernicious to the salutary work in hand from which party the first proposition should proceed but in this respect france gave way and that concession afforded no inconsiderable proof of her pacific intentions  we must apprize the reader that we do not mean to enter exactly into the whole detail of this negotiation nor undertake precisely to describe all the turns that were taken in it this we imagine would prove a tedious and unacceptable performance we shall attach ourselves to the capital objects which were contended for in this game of policy we shall endeavor to point out the matters which first obstructed and then finally broke off the treaty and we shall rest on these things in such a manner as seems to us fittest for marking out the true spirit of the negotiating powers our own observations shall be very sparingly interposed we are historians and not advocates  the uti possidetis being settled as the basis of the treaty nothing could reasonably be claimed by either party that was not to be counterpoised by some equivalent from the other and consequently it was necessary to adjust and value their several possessions pretensions and demands there were six principal objects in this negotiation first the limits of the two crowns in north america secondly the conquests of great britain in the west indies together with the neutral islands there thirdly our conquests in africa and in india fourthly the adjustment of the particular affair between the english and french in germany fifthly the conduct which the two crowns were to hold with regard to their respective allies in germany and lastly the restitution of the captures made by england previous to the declaration of war  on the first of these articles france proposed to cede and guaranty all canada to england stipulating only that the free and public exercises of the roman catholic religion should be permitted under the english government and that those of the old french colonists who chose to retire might have leave to transport themselves from thence and take away or dispose of their effects in compensation for this they required a confirmation of the privilege  what fishing they enjoyed on the coast of newfoundland under the treaty of utrecht and that this fishery might be carried on with advantage they likewise required the restitution of the isle of cape breton excluding themselves in return from erecting on that island any kind of fortification whatsoever  the affairs in the west indies which make the second capital object they proposed to settle in this manner they offered to exchange minorca for guadaloupe and marigalante and as to the four neutral islands they insisted that two of them dominica and st vincent were held by their natural inhabitants the carribees under the protection of france and that they ought still to remain in the same condition with regard to the two others they proposed to make a fair division that st lucia should remain to france and that england should enter into possession of tobago on this head it is sufficient to observe that in the opinion of some people our ministry did not in this treaty set the just value on the acquisition they had made when they looked upon canada as the great and leading object and only considered guadaloupe and marigalante in a secondary and subordinate light this is a question of difficulty and has been much agitated those who dread a fresh american war from the ambition of france and were struck with the idea of extended empire preferred the former conquest those who solely considered our interest as a commercial people were generally in favor of the latter  on the side of africa france satisfied herself with demanding either the settlement at senegal or the isle of goree for which together with the restoration of belleisle they consented to evacuate gottingen hesse and hanau and to draw off their army to the maine and the rhine this was certainly a full equivalent but with regard to the east indies they had no tolerable equivalent to offer they expatiated much in their memorial upon the disadvantages which must arise to the companies of the two nations from their entertaining views of conquest so contrary to the true spirit and the real interest of these trading establishments and they concluded by proposing the treaty formerly settled between the sieurs godcheau and saunders as a basis for the reestablishment of peace in asia it must be remarked that this treaty had been concluded at a time when the affairs of france in the east indies made a figure very different from their present situation and therefore it seemed unfair to make this treaty a standard under circumstances altogether inapplicable  the war which has been so long with so much bloodshed and so fruitlessly carried on in westphalia the french strenuously contended was from the time of what they called the breach of the capitulation of closterseven a war purely english and therefore that their conquests in that part of germany formed a proper compensation for the english conquests in the other quarters of the world our ministers did not attempt formally to refute this assertion they rather seemed to admit it and they agreed accordingly to receive the evacuation of these places as an equivalent for cessions to be made on the footing we have already mentioned on this point there was little difficulty  the intricate and knotty part was on what we have stated as the fifth object the conduct of the two crowns with regard to their allies here was a real a capital difficulty from the beginning of the negotiation england had declared that they would inviolably preserve their faith to the king of prussia and would act strenuously in his support this picqued the french ministers who in their turn thought themselves bound to make a declaration equally strong in favor of the empress and they had moreover recently conditioned with the court of vienna to admit nothing in the treaty to her disadvantage words of great latitude however in this difficulty they found out a solution which it must be confessed had a very fair and captivating appearance they proposed that both armies in germany should observe an exact neutrality and should be reciprocally bound to afford no sort of assistance nor to give no sort of offense to the allies of either of the parties and they proposed further that as armies in this state inert neutrality must be a dead and useless expense to the power who maintains them the french king from the time his britannic majesty recalled the english forces from germany would cause double the number of french forces from the armies of the upper and lower rhine to return into france and that no french troops should remain in germany but in proportion to those which the king  england should keep in his pay it might certainly be urged in confirmation of the propriety of this offer that is reality these armies whilst they continued in action though they worried each other abundantly afforded no kind of assistance to their allies and therefore when they came mutually to entertain pacific sentiments concerning their own particular quarrel and were to give an example of moderation to the rest of europe there seemed to be no reason why they should make efforts in favor of any ally which they had not made or been able to make in the hottest time of hostility  the last article had its difficulties also the french insisted as a point from which they were resolved never to recede upon the restitution of the captures made before the declaration of war this demand they were of opinion was grounded on the clearest principles of the law of nations and the most express stipulation of treaties without entering into these various arguments with which this position might be maintained and attacked it appeared to many that the honor of both nations was almost equally concerned the one to claim the other as resolutely to refuse this restitution  on the whole these proposals which the french sent to london in a memorial of the   th of july formed though in some respects undoubtedly exceptionable a very agreeable plan for a treaty of peace a better could not have been expected in the first project of an enemy and it might be hoped that a negotiation thus favorably begun could not fail of adjusting easily whatever appeared wrong or supplying whatever was defective in this first draught of the propositions but fatally for the repose of mankind in the very instant that this fair proposal was made at the very moment when these strong demonstrations were given an act was done which blew up at one explosion the whole basis of the treaty that had been long and carefully laying scattered the materials which had been so industriously collected and so cautiously arranged and instead of extinguishing spread the flames of war more widely and made them rage with new fury from this time forward all the transaction was full of animosity resentment and mistrust the reader has been apprized of the measures which france had been invariably pursuing at the court of madrid and the arguments she employed to infuse a jealousy into that court hitherto however there was no appearance that these measures had any effect but to the infinite surprise and indignation of the british minister together with the memorial which contained the above recited propositions mr bussy the french agent delivered a private memorial signifying that in order to establish the peace upon solid foundations not to be shaken by the contested interests of a third power the king of spain might be invited to accede to guaranty the treaty and that to prevent the differences which subsisted between great britain and this monarchy from being a means of producing a fresh war in europe with the consent and communication of his catholic majesty he proposes that in this negotiation the three points which had been disputed between the crowns of england and spain might be finally settled first the restitution of some captures made upon the spanish flag secondly the privilege of the spanish nation to fish on the banks of newfoundland thirdly the demolition of the english settlements made on the spanish territories in the bay of honduras  it may be easily imagined from the character of the then secretary of state in what manner he received these proposals he rejected with the utmost scorn the offer of negotiating through an enemy humbled and almost at his feet the disputes of his nation with a power actually in friendship with us he called upon the spanish minister to disavow the propositions which had been said to be made with the knowledge of his court he returned as wholly in admissible this offensive memorial declaring that it would be looked upon as an affront to the dignity of his master and incompatible with the sincerity of the negotiation to make any further mention of such a circumstance  and now he prepared without delay an answer to the principal memorial in a style rather dictated by the circumstances which accompanied that paper and which sufficiently indicated the designs of france than what the propositions themselves strictly deserved indeed as he had by this time conceived an incurable suspicion of the sincerity of france in the whole proceeding it would not have been prudent to have made those advances which on a supposition of good faith and pacific intentions might possibly have been advisable for though both powers had over and over declared that their respective propositions if the treaty should by any accident be broken off would be considered as retracted or never made yet it is certain tha things once settled and agreed to unavoidably stamp their own impression upon any future negotiation relative to the same subject  mr pitts answer which is dated on the   th of july agrees to the restitution of guadaloupe marigalante and belleisle on the compensations proposed by france it agrees also to receive canada but without any new limits or any exception whatsoever and it adds to the french offer of all canada its appurtenances it admits the proposal of the partition of the neutral islands it rejects the french demand of cape breton or of any other island in the gulf or river of st lawrence or of any power of fishing in that river in that gulf or on those coasts and it allows the privilege of fishing on the banks of newfoundland only on consideration of the demolition of dunkirk but the proposed restitution either of senegal or goree is utterly refused the german neutrality is rejected with disdain and it is declared that great britain is unalterably resolved to support the king of prussia with efficacy and good faith in addition to the offer made to evacuate hesse etc it is insisted that the french shall make a general evacuation of all her conquests in westphalia and all its countries including its conquests from the king of prussia on the rhine though france had before declared that they were conquered for the queen of hungary that they were actually governed in her name and that she could not consistently with good faith agree to deliver them to the king of prussia the treaty between saunders and godcheau was not admitted as a proper basis for a treaty relative to the east indies but it was agreed that the two companies should negotiate concerning their respective interests as the king of great britain could not dispose of the rights of the english east india company without their consent as to the restitution of the captures before the war this was most positively refused  in this period we leave the negotiation to follow the motions of the armies in germany it is certain that the dispositions of the two courts grew daily more unfavourable their confidence in each other and their mutual good will wore away and it was to be feared that this negotiation if it broke off in an unsatisfactory manner must leave impressions on the minds of the two nations of such a nature as might cause them to wish they had never engaged in it  chap v motions of the french and allied armies general sporcken attacked french pass the dymel skirmishes position of

destruction of schartsfeltscastle prince xavier of saxony takes wolfenbuttle and invests brunswick detachments from prince soubise take and abandon embden attempt on bremen sufferings of lower westphalia  although the great purpose of the early and strenuous effort made by the allies was not fully answered it nevertheless produced as we have before observed a very considerable and useful effect the destruction of the french magazines retarded their operations in such a manner that the greatest part of the month of june was spent before their armies found themselves in a condition to act but as soon as they had taken proper measures for their subsistence the prince of soubise caused his troops to pass the rhine and to advance on the side of munster not far from which city the hereditary prince of brunswick was posted to oppose him marshal broglio assembled the forces under his command at cassel and moved toward the dymel in order to effect a junction with the body under the prince of soubise they made no doubt that their conjoining strength would soon attain a decided superiority over the allies who had ended their late enterprise with a loss which was considerable and which in their circumstances they could not well bear nor easily supply  these hopes were supported by the success of their first encounter general sporcken with a strong detachment had been posted in an advantageous situation on the dymel and in the front of the allied army on the approach of marshal broglio he attempted to retire with all that expedition which his inferiority made necessary but the french came upon him with such rapidity  the allies however soon recovered their spirits and the main body of their army being well secured they sent out several detachments their small bodies were conducted by general luckner and other able partisans who undertook several bold and very distant enterprises attacked the enemy where they were least upon their guard routed their convoys destroyed several of their magazines carriages and horses and carried off their prey even from the gates of cassel these lively actions seemed a prelude to some more important and decisive attempt  the french became sensible that a stroke of some importance was expected from the greatness of their force and that it was not for the credit of their arms only but for their security from the minute but continual and galling attempts of parties from the allied army  for some time prince ferdinand had been posted to the south of the lip between ham and lipstadt this position he took in all probability because m broglio had by occupying the places on the dymel got between him and hanover therefore he judged it expedient for him in his turn to get between the prince de soubise and the rhine in this situation if the enemy attempted any movement toward the kings dominions he was ready to fall directly on the places they occupied by that river which in the present circumstances were full as important to them as the hanoverian territory was to us thus whilst he seemed to retire from that territory and in a manner to abandon it he in reality provided with the greater effect for its security  marshal broglio when he had resolved on the attack of the allied army united his troops to those of the prince de soubise at a place called soest between lipstadt and ham on the other hand as soon as the general of the allies was apprized of their intention he posted his army in a very strong and advantageous manner  the river aest runs for a considerable way almost parallel to the lip from which it is not distant in some places much more than half a mile the high road from lipstadt to ham passes between these rivers and it was of the utmost moment to prince ferdinand to secure that important communication by which alone he could hope an advantageous retreat or in any degree propose to command the adjacent country with a view therefore to protect that communication he established his left wing on the isthmus between the rivers the left extremity of that wing under general wutgenau leaning to the lip by which it was perfectly secured as the right was supported by the village of kirch denkern situated immediately on the aest the marquis of granby commanded in that wing with the assistance of lieutenant general howard and the prince of anhalt who were posted toward the abovementioned village  at that village another river called the saltzbach small but very deep joins the aest almost in a right angle behind this river on a considerable eminence was placed the center commanded by general conway and on the continuation of the same eminence the right wing under the hereditary prince stretched out toward the village of werle and it was well defended on the flank by rugged bushy and almost impracticable ground nothing could be more advantageous than this disposition of the army by which the whole center and right wing were covered in front by the river and the left supported by rivers on both its flanks in the left indeed was the strength and flower of the army the count of lip had placed also in this wing the greatest part of the artillery as he knew that it defended the most important situation was the most exposed in front and consequently would be the object of the enemys most considerable efforts  he was not mistaken in his conjecture on the   th of july in the evening a very furious attack was made on lord granbys posts which was sustained for a long time with all the intrepidity and firmness which british troops always exert and which that gallant officer knows so well how to inspire the disposition we have just mentioned was not then completed so that they had the whole torrent of that impetuosity which distinguishes the french in their first attacks to resist for some hours until wutgenau according to the plan originally projected arrived to their assistance and then with efforts united and redoubled in a long and obstinate combat which continued until it was quite dark they repulsed the french and drove them into the woods  by the next morning the disposition of the allies was perfected  this movement was decisive the enemy gave way fell into disorder and retired with precipitation their center and left which had not been able to pass the saltzbach after a long and effectual cannonade retired with the rest and covered their retreat so that favored by this circumstance and the closeness of the country which was full of hedges they marched off in tolerable order and were pursued but a little way however their loss was considerable the regiment of rouge consisting of four battalions with its cannon and colors was entirely taken by the single battalion of maxwell their whole loss in killed wounded and prisoners has been estimated at  000 the allies had about  00 killed  000 wounded and about  00 prisoners this action was the climax of the campaign of      prince ferdinand s letter to his majesty from the field of battle dated kirch denckern july         i have the honor to congratulate your majesty upon a very signal advantage which your majestys arms have this day gained it is impossible for me to set down every particular of this glorious day the bearer of this an officer of very distinguished merit and who has greatly contributed to the happy success of this day will give your majesty an exact account of it i have the honor to recommend him to your majestys royal favor  ferdinand duke of brunswick and lunebourg   what follows is the account given by major wedderbourne on the   th of july the french attacked the light troops in the front of lord granbys corpse which was encamped on the heights of kirch denckern his lordship ordered the regiments of cornwallis keith campbell and marsberg to the left to support the posts there was an uninterupted fire of cannon and small arms till nine at night when it ceased without any impression having been made by the enemy upon lord granbys left  in the morning of the   th about three oclock the cannonading began very briskly on both sides and continued till nine when the enemy gave way in great disorder his most serene highness the duke then ordered the corpse of the prince of anhalt lord granby and wutgenau to attack them on their retreat which they did with so much vigor that the enemy never attempted to form before them but threw down their arms and ran off in the utmost disorder  when major wedderbourn came away there were six colors already taken eleven or twelve pieces of cannon many officers amongst whom the comte de rouge and great part of the regiments of de rouge dauphin and provence to the amount of  000 men  after having pursued them about a league the duke ordered the troops to form upon the heights of kirch denckern the hereditary prince was still driving the enemy on their left prisoners and cannon were coming in every moment  it was said that the marshal duc de broglio commanded on the right of the french army opposite to the prince of anhalt lord granby and lieutenant general wutgenau where his serene hignness was in person  major wedderbourn adds that this great victory was obtained with scarce any loss on the part of the allied army     in westphalia it did the greatest honor to the wisdom of the accomplished commander in the disposition and to the bravery of the troops in the combat but it was far from decisive notwithstanding the loss the french suffered they were still much superior in their numbers on this misfortune the old ill understanding between soubise and broglio broke out with fresh animosity narratives memorials and replies conceived with great bitterness were mutually remitted from both marshals to their court marshal broglio alleged that his misfortune was owing to the prince de soubises delay who did not begin the attack till it was too late for him to continue it the prince de soubise on the other hand suggested that broglio began his attack earlier than the time that had been fixed in hopes of forcing the allies without soubises assistance and when he found that point lost obliged soubise to retreat that he might not have the honor of recovering it  the allies after this battle kept their ground for some time whilst the french retreated it is impossible regularly to account for all the unexpected turns which have happened perhaps more in this campaign than in any of the former it is enough to know that the original superiority of the french together with their opportunity of continual reinforcement may very tolerably explain the reason of the advantages which they so often obtained after very considerable defeats this is a point which it is necessary the reader should continually keep in his mind during the whole narration of this strange war after their late loss and retreat the french soon advanced again the party under the prince de soubise passed the lip and made dispositions for the siege of munster whilst marshal broglios army turned off on the other side crossed the weser and threatened to fall in upon hanover  this division of the enemy compelled prince ferdinand though little in a condition for it to divide his army also the hereditary prince posted himself to cover munster whilst prince ferdinand continued in the country toward the weser to observe the motions of marshal broglio  whilst these various positions were mutually taken as the armies were continually moving near each other a number of very sharp skirmishes ensued marshal broglio cautiously avoided a battle whenever he saw that the duke of brunswick by calling together his troops had prepared for and was desirous of it so that there was no way left but if possible to check his motions and wear down his force by reiterated lesser actions translation of prince ferdinands letter to the marquis of granby convent at bubren august        my lord i think it my duty to acquaint your lordship how much i admire the valiant and brave conduct of lord george lenox with the picquets and of major walsh with his battalions of grenadiers yesterday in the attack of the post and village of westen i beg your lordship will be pleased to signify to them my most grateful acknowledgements and that these two gentlemen would do the same to the brave troops who were led on by commanders of such distinguished valor  i have the honor to be with the most perfect respect my lord etc    these actions were almost always to the advantage of our troops in one of them however the young prince henry of brunswick was mortally wounded and the whole army saw with regret  on the side of westphalia the prince de soubise persevered notwithstanding some checks in his design of laying siege to munster there was great reason to apprehend that he might succeed in that enterprise as it was always in marshal broglios power by taking some steps on the side of hanover to make it necessary to draw away the greatest part of the force destined to the succor of munster he therefore began to make the previous arrangements at dorsten the hereditary prince who knew that he was continually liable to be called off took the first opportunity of attacking this place copy of the marquis of granbys leter to major walsh commanding the first battalion of british grenadiers camp at haarn august        sir you will perceive by the copy of the letter i have the pleasure to enclose to you how much his serene highness admired your behavior and that of the first battalion of grenadiers under your command at the attack of the post and village of westen on the  th  you will therefore according to his serene highnesss desire testify to the troops his extreme approbation of their distinguished bravery and firmness and likewise my thanks in the strongest manner  i am with the greatest regard sir etc granby    which were established here and by this means not only frustrated their design of besieging munster but compelled them for a time to retire from the lip  as to prince ferdinand he saw clearly that the intentions of marshal broglio were to make himself master of his majestys and the duke of brunswicks territories to attempt to follow him and to beat him from thence would only be irrecoverably to transfer the seat of war into those countries and wholly to abandon westphalia to the enemy diversion therefore and not direct opposition became his object he resolved that as often as he perceived marshal broglio making any progress on the suspected quarter he should throw himself as far into hesse as the enemy had advanced toward hanover and by stopping their subsistence oblige them to quit their enterprise this plan at first succeeded to his wishes and drew back marshal broglio into hesse upon whose approach prince ferdinand retired to his old quarters at paderborn and ready for a new movement as soon as broglio should return to the execution of his former design  accordingly he soon returned to the weser then the hereditary prince who had by this time rejoined the grand army advanced into hesse and pushed to the farthest extremities of that country even as far as fritzlar but though he succeeded so far in his attempts as to destroy all the lesser magazines which he found in the open country yet as all the fortresses were in the hands of the enemy as the garrisons had been newly reinforced and the grand magazines were well secured in those places he kept his ground in his advanced position  it was on this occasion principally that prince ferdinand found the disadvantage of not being able to form two armies which might act seperately for on one hand marshal broglio when he had perfectly secured his posts in hesse took a situation in which he watched all the motions of prince ferdinand and kept himself in readiness to fall back into hesse or to advance into hanover as might best agree with his designs from hence he sent out some powerful detachments which acted with great effect one of these detachments entered the hearts forest the remains of the great hercynian so famous among the ancients and besieged the strong castle of schartsfelts which they took and demolished then they laid the whole tract of country under severe contribution another and still more powerful detachment under prince xavier of saxony appeared before wolfenbuttle a considerable city and strongly situated  flushed with this success the french followed their blow and advanced keeping still the course of the ocker to brunswick and began also to invest that city the reigning prince unable to protect his subjects or to secure his person in his dominions fled to hamburgh where he met the landgrave of hesse whom the rage of war had in the same manner driven from his territories this free city now became a place of general refuge and enriched itself by the calamities as it had in better times done by the prosperity of germany it was lately computed that the strangers there had increased to  0000 amongst whom they could reckon two sovereign princes and several other persons of the first distinction  this rapid and unresisted progress of the french to the eastward of the weser was to the highest degree alarming prince ferdinand with all the expedition in his power detached the hereditary prince to the relief of brunswick this measure fortunately saved that very important place this active commander compelled the enemy not only to raise the siege of brunswick but to abandon wolfenbuttel and to make a precipitate retreat with the loss of some of their cannon and upwards of  000 men  whilst broglios detachments proceeded thus in distressing the country to the eastward of the weser the prince of soubise who by the removal of the hereditary prince of brunswick to another quarter saw no longer any thing capable of opposing him spread his army by detachments over all westphalia and ravaged it in the most cruel manner they took osnabrug and because the contributions were not immediately paid they gave up the place to be pillaged by their troops who rifled the miserable inhabitants without mercy another body pushed as far as embden this important town was immediately surrendered by the garrison two english companies of invalids at the desire of the timid inhabitants and the promise of a favorable treatment notwithstanding this capitulation and the merit of so easy a surrender the town as well as the whole country of eastfriesland was laid under a ruinous contribuon but their exorbitances grew to such an extremity that the boors were at length compelled to rise and with such arms as a sudden rage supplied them to drive these oppressors out of their country  a more considerable corpse commanded by the prince de conde laid siege to meppen a place on the ems of some consequence  the city of bremen was defended by a weak garrison this was a place of far greater moment than meppen the allies having amassed their immense magazines as it was a great and trading town advantageously situated on the river weser and the possession of this place must undoubtedly have given to the french the command of that river through which the allies derived all their subsistence if the english had lost bremen they must have seen themselves invested and locked up in a barren counrry in the heart of germany surrounded by their enemies and deprived of every resource fortunately the inhabitants of this city proved as brave as those of embden were timid they were exasperated by the example of the french rigor which they had seen on every side of them they therefore joined the garrison instead of discouraging them in the defense of the place the french were obliged to retire precipitately and a strong reinforcement was thrown into bremen to secure that very important city from the like enterprises for the future  whilst the two french armies in this manner ravaged all the country held by the allies prince ferdinand who saw the rage of war spread all around him with his usual firmness kept that central position which he had taken soon after the battle of kirch denkern no movements of the enemy could terrify or allure him from it he had settled his head quarters at buhne and his army extended from thence toward hammelen posted in this manner he secured the course of the weser by preventing the enemy from making themselves masters either of hammelen or minden he lay in the best situation in which it was possible to place a single army that was to act against two and knowing that he could not follow their movements with the body of his army without hazarding the kings electoral dominions and indeed every object of the war he contented himself with sending out such detachments as he could spare successively to the relief of the places which were attacked he saw that the winter approached which had always been a circumstance fayourable to him and it was evident that whilst he continued with his main body immoveably fixed as it was and his detachments active on every side it was impossible for the enemy to keep any of those places they had seized in their incursions  chap vi condition of the king of prussia his inaction

operations of the prussian armies took the lead in interest and importance before all the other events of the war the firmness and activity of their illustrious monarch the number and animosity of his enemies the blows that he gave and those that he suffered his distressing and terrible falls his amazing and almost miraculous recoveries kept all eyes fixed on his motions as the great center of public attention undoubtedly nothing that has ever been acted on the scene of human affairs attracted the minds of men to it with greater justice none perhaps afforded at once more entertainment to the imagination and furnished more copious materials for political and military instruction and probably therefore this part of all our modern history will be the most carefully studied by posterity when it comes to be properly known and worthily written  to judge of the importance of this branch of the general war it will be proper to recollect that besides a number of sieges which were prosecuted together with innumerable and bloody skirmishes no less than nineteen pitched battles or capital actions have been fought on his part since the close of the year      when the king of prussia first seized upon saxony and made an iruption into bohemia in eleven of these battles the king or his generals were defeated he was victorious only in eight ten of them were fought under his own command and seven out of the eight victories which were gained were obtained by himself in person of the eleven defeats he was present only at three  from these circumstances some judgment may be formed of the active and enterprizing character of this monarch and of the amazing resource he had prepared or formed or seized and in some instances one may say almost created we have observed that the last campaign had ended more to his advantage than the one preceding had done for those two great victories of lignitz and torgau with which he then ended his operations had not only rescued his affairs in silesia and saxony from impending destruction but had enlarged his field for recruiting and prepared him to all appearance for more early and vigorous action than could have been expected in most of the preceding campaigns but every one was surprised to observe that this year he had totally altered the system of his conduct an inactivity and languor was diffused over all his proceedings he seemed to have adopted the caution and slowness which had been so long opposed to his vivacity by m daun the summer was almost wholly spent and the king of prussia had scarcely been mentioned  it was not suspected that the proposed negotiation at augsburg could have had much if any influence upon his method of proceeding no particular proposals had been made concerning his affairs nor indeed any other marks of a pacific disposition toward him shown except what were contained in those general declarations which a regard to common decency had exacted it must have added to the anxiety of his situation that great britain and france were at that time engaged in a separate treaty in which the latter power was in a condition to make so many flattering offers in relation to germany that he might well have dreaded the withdrawing of that assistance which had hitherto been his great support against all attacks and his final resource in all his distresses perhaps he was well assured that the faith of great britain was proof against every offer however alluring in fact it proved to be so for in rejecting the german neutrality which the french proposed in the late negotiation our country afforded as convincing a proof of an unshaken public faith as any people had ever given to their allies  however whilst this point remained in any degree of suspense it would have appeared natural that the king of prussia should make some uncommon exertions to confirm the faith of his allies as well as to put himself upon a more respectable footing at the ensuing congress it is notwithstanding certain that he contented himself with acting wholly upon the defensive a conduct which perhaps his circumstances had rendered absolutely unavoidable prince henry commanded an army in saxony which entrenched itself strongly under leipsic m daun continued near dresden and these two armies did no more than watch each other during the campaign the king was also entrenched in a very strong position in upper silesia not far from schweidnitz whilst the fortresses in the lower part of that country were filled with such garrisons as put them out of the reach of any sudden insult  this position was pointed out by the motions and apparent designs of his enemies the russian army was this year as well as in the former divided into two strong bodies one of which led by tottleben directed its march toward pomerania and the other under m butterlin entered into the upper silesia advancing toward breslau baron laudohn entered that province in the part opposite to them and they proposed to unite their armies in order to attack the king or to take breslau or schweidnitz in his presence the remarkable drought in the beginning of the season which had greatly lowered the oder facilitated their junction the russians spread themselves over all the open country of silesia and exacted heavy contributions these attempts failing he turned off and made a feint as if he proposed to fall upon the lower silesia in hopes that he might at least oblige the king of prussia to detach and divide his forces but the king continued immovable in his post  whilst these various movements were making with little effect on the side of silesia the other grand division of the russians advanced without opposition into pomerania and it was expected that their proceedings would be attended with greater effect since the removal of tottleben and the appointment of general romanzow to the command tottleben had been long suspected and it is said at length convicted of a secret correspondence with the king of prussia the situation of this monarch obliged him to fight with every sort of weapon and tottleben a soldier of fortune without any national attachment or particular allegiance was a fit object for the king of prussias pecuniary stratagems he did not succeed so well in the attempts of the same kind which he is said to have made upon laudohn every circumstance concurred to render the method of corruption less successful in that quarter  colberg regularly besieged or closely streightened every campaign since the russians made themselves masters of the kingdom of prussia was now assaulted with greater and more determined force than ever a strong fleet consisting of forty sail of all kinds blockaded it by sea whilst the army of general romanzow formed the siege by land on the other hand the place threatened a defense worthy of its former efforts this city was from the beginning of the war of greater strength than it had commonly been represented every attempt of the russians by demonstrating where any weakness lay taught the prussians who were fully sensible of its importance in what part and in what manner it was necessary to add to its works and they had omitted no opportunity in addition to this defense the prince of wurtenburg was strongly entrenched under the cannon of the town with a body of six or seven thousand men  the king of prussia was extremely alarmed at the danger of this momentous post the key of his dominions to the north from the relief of which he was removed and as it were chained down at such an immense distance though laudohn and butterlin found abundant employment for his forces he resolved to send a considerable detachment under general platen to the assistance of colberg the fertility of his genius proposed two ends from this single expedient he ordered platen to direct his march through poland and to destroy the russian magazines which had been amassed on the frontiers of that kingdom and from which their army in silesia drew its whole subsistence this service might he hoped be performed without any considerable interruption to the progress of the detachment toward colberg the event was entirely answerable to his wishes general platen ruined three principal magazines of the enemy he attacked a great convoy of their wagons destroyed  00 and burned  dispersed the provisions they carried four thousand men who protected this convoy were for the greater part killed or made prisoners general platen after this useful and brilliant exploit pursued his march with the utmost diligence to pomerania  intelligence of this blow was no sooner received by the russians in silesia than they were struck with the utmost consternation they had lately effected one of their purposes by their junction with the austrians  so unfortunately circumstanced were the affairs of the king of prussia that his wisest schemes and happiest successes could hardly answer any other end than to vary the scene of his distress the storm which had been diverted from silesia by general platens expedition was only removed from thence to be discharged with irresistible fury on colberg the russians when they saw that the measures the king had taken rendered the completion of both their designs impracticable resolved at all adventures to secure one of them colberg was the object of their choice not only as the place furthest from succor but as the possession of it would be an advantage fittest for answering those ends which were more nearly and properly russian m butturlin therefore as soon as he had established his convoys directed his course toward pomerania and being master of lansperg he sent detachments from thence that cruelly wasted all the adjoining march of brandenburg without at the same time diverting himself by these ravages from his main intention  a force of russians was by this time assembled in pomerania to which it was impossible for the king of prussia to oppose any thing that was in any degree able to contend with them in the field of course he could not promise himself that immediate raising the siege could be the effect of these succors all he could do was to send another detachment to that part under general knoblock and hoped that by the union of these several small corpse and by their intercepting or at least distressing the russian convoys of provision the place might be enabled to hold out until the severe setting in of winter should render the operations of a siege impracticable  he was providing in this manner and studying new methods for the relief of colberg to the danger of which place his whole attention was drawn when an event happened just by him and as it were under his eye almost as distressing as the taking of colberg would have proved and so much the more distressing as it was entirely unexpected  on the retreat of the russians under butturlin the king of prussia imagined himself at liberty he found a want of provisions in his strong camp near schweidnitz and to be the more easily supplied he aproached nearer to the oder he was so little in fear of the enemy that on making this movement he drafted  000 men from the garrison of schwidnitz he thought that the preparations necessary to a siege would give him sufficient notice and sufficient leisure to provide for the safety of that important place from which after all he had removed but to a very small distance laudohn who through the whole campaign had watched the king with a most diligent and penetrating assiduity and hitherto had found no part open and unguarded thought in this instant he perceived an advantage it was indeed an advantage which would never have appeared as such but to a general as resolute as sagacious he resolved to attempt this strong place by a coup de main on the  st of october at three in the morning the assault began an attack was made at the same time on all the four outworks which the troops ordered on this important enterprise approached with so much precaution that they were not perceived by the garrison they scaled all the four at the same time and the troops which defended them had scarce time to fire a few cannon shot on the side of the assailants not a gun was discharged but in one of those outworks the fire of the small arms set fire to a powder magazine which blew up and on this occasion about  00 of the austrians and about the same number of the prussians were killed as soon at the outworks were carried they prepared to assault the body of the place which they entered by bursting open the gates and at daybreak they found themselvesmasters of the town after firing a few shot five battalions making about  000 men and lieutenant general zastrow governor of the fortress were made prisoners the conquerors found here a great number of cannon and a large magazine of meal their loss in the whole of this bold and fortunate undertaking amounted by their accounts to no more than  00 men  in a manner so unexpected and considering the nature of the fortifications so unprecedented schweidnitz fell for a second time in this war into the hands of the austrians and that city which in the year      had cost the prussians a blockade of some months and a siege of thirteen days open trenches to recover it was again lost in a few hours and with a very inconsiderable damage to those who undertook this daring enterprise  the king of prussia felt this grievous blow to the quick by their possession of schweidnitz he saw the austrians enabled to winter in silesia he saw that whilst they held this place he could possibly make no motion for the relief of any other part of his dominions without exposing breslau and along with it the whole of upper silesia to a certain and irrecoverable conquest in the first agitations produced by so extraordinary and affecting a disaster he was disposed to attribute this misfortune to the treachery of the governor but he was too generous to harbor such a suspicion for any time against an officer who had hitherto served him with fidelity and who might have been surprised with an attack of so uncommon a nature and which the king himself had as little suspected as the governor he immediately recovered his temper and said with a smile it is a fatal blow we must endeavor to remedy it he wrote to general zastrow who commanded there we may now say what francis i of france wrote to his mother after the battle of pavia we have lost all except our honor as i cannot comprehend what has happened to you i shall suspend my judgment the thing is very extraordinary  schweidnitz was lost suddenly but colberg made a most obstinate and noble defense at length however the garrison began to be sorely distressed for provisions general platen quitted the intrenchments which he had maintained in conjunction with the prince of wurtenburg in order to cover the reinforcements which the numerous and strong detachments of the russians who overspread the whole country had hitherto kept at a distance but he had the misfortune to meet an infinitely superior body of the enemy to be beaten and to lose part of his convoy and it was with difficulty he escaped with the remainder to stettin  the other general knoblock had established himself at treptow which was to serve as a resting place for the convoys but as general platen had been repulsed in the manner we have just seen romanzow advanced with a large force to treptow knoblock hopeless of assistance in a town which had scarcely any walls and invested by a body so vastly superior yet made a vigorous and gallant defense for five days he was at length compelled to surrender himself and his body of about  000 men prisoners of war  these successive disasters were occasioned by the necesssity there was for revictualling colberg cost what it would for that end of dispersing the prussian troops in the face of a russian army of  0000 men the revictualling in these circumstances could not be effected without a singular piece of good fortune and in order to get into the way of this good fortune every risque was to be run  these advantages over platen and knoblock raised the spirits of the russians and enabled them to contend with the extreme rigor of the season in that northern latitude they pushed the siege with redoubled efforts all hope of a supply from the land was absolutely at an end and though the russian fleet had been by a violent storm driven off the coast the succor from the sea was too precarious to be depended on in this desperate situation the prince of wurtenburg became apprehensive lest his army which had been unable to relieve the town by delaying any longer under its walls would only share its fate and that famine might also oblige him to surrender he therefore resolved whilst his men retained their vigor to break through a part of the russian army and to leave colberg to make the best terms its circumstances would admit this design he accomplished happily and with little or no loss  heyde who to this time had maintained it successfully against all the efforts of the russians during the war and as he was distinguished by the king his master for his merit in the successful defense of it he had likewise as full assurances of his favors after having on the late occasion conducted himself with his former bravery though it was not with the former good fortune  the loss of two such places as schweidnitz and colberg at the two extremities of his dominions was decisive against the king of prussia it was now impossible for him to make any movement by which the enemy could not profit to his almost certain destruction to form sieges with an army like his inferior in the field was impossible the russians by possessing colberg possessed every thing they were masters of the baltic and they now acquired a port by which their armies could be well provided without the necessity of tedious uncertain and expensive convoys from poland the road lay almost open into the heart of brandenburg stetin alone stood in their way but it was obvious that nothing but the advanced season could save stetin from the fate of colberg the russians now for the first time took up their winter quarters in pomerania  it is remarkable that this whole year passed without a regular battle between the king of prussia and any of his enemies yet none of the most unfortunate of his campaigns had been so ruinous to him he had suffered four terrible defeats without having balanced them with a single advantage of consequence in the campaign of      yet in these circumstances it is almost incredible how little he really lost he was able to take the field again the ensuing year in a very respectable manner and to make head against his enemies in that year he lost a whole army near landshut still he was far from being broken afterward in that same campaign he gave his enemies two signal defeats and ended his operations advantageously and with great glory but in the year of which we now write without suffering any considerable blow in the field without any striking efforts on any side his power has gradually crumbled away the most calamitous defeats could not sink him lower and in the situation in which he stood after the taking of colberg we may safely say that there was scarcely a possibility that he could be preserved from destruction by any thing that lay within the reach of human endeavors  chap vii the negotiation resumed french concessions difference concerning the german alliance difference concerning the captures antecedent to the declaration of war treaty breaks off messieurs stanley and bussy recalled  after having been so long detained on the theater of war it is time we should return to take a view of the negotiation for putting an end to the miseries it occasioned in reality the view even of this scene was very glooming and unpromising the confidence and good humor of the two courts being subverted all that followed was rather an altercation than a treaty it is true that papers passed backward and forward and the pretensions of each party the points they agreed to cede and those which they were determined to adhere to grew more distinct and explicit but all that cordiality was vanished which is so necessary toward smoothing and clearing a road which a long hostility had broken up and so many intricate topics had contributed to embarrass  without involving ourselves in the detail of the several memorials which were delivered in and without referring numerically to the several articles it will be sufficient that we briefly state those points which were or seemed to be in a fair way of adjustment between england and france and afterward those on which it should appear that the negotiation broke off  after some discussions concerning its proper limits it was agreed that all canada should be ceded to the english this cession comprehended on one side all the islands and countries adjoining to the gulf of st lawrence on the other it took in all the great lakes and the whole course of the ohio to its discharge into the missisippi a territory sufficient for the basis of a great empire  in drawing this line of division another question arose concerning the bounds of louisiana and the state of the intermediate indian nation between the lakes and the missisippi who inhabit or are rather scattered over an immense country that lies along the back of our colonies all the way from pensylvania to georgia it was therefore very proper that something definitive should be settled on this article as it might otherwise easily be made productive of a new war england proposed that all those nations should continue as she contended they had heretofore been under the protection of great britain without saying any thing precise as to the dominion of the soil  france controverted this proposition she on her part proposed to divide these nations that those to the northward of the line drawn to ascertain the limits of canada should be independent under the protection of england but that those which were to the southward should enjoy the same independence under the protection of france nothing was perfectly settled in relation to this point but it does not seem as if there could have been any material disagreement upon it had the other matters in debate been adjusted to their mutual satisfaction  the african contest seemed to have been attended with still less difficulty the french consented to give up both senegal and goree provided anamaboo and acra were guarantied to them  the momentous question of the fishery was likewise determined the french gave up their claim to cape breton and st johns and were satisfied to receive the little island of st pierre on the coast of newfoundland but even this they were to receive on conditions sufficiently humiliating they were to erect no sort of fortification nor to keep up any military establishment there an english commissary was to reside on the island in order to see that these stipulations were adhered to as to the rest the french were to have the same privileges on the coast of newfoundland checked with the same restrictions which before the war they had enjoyed under the   th article of the treaty of utrecht in conformity to another article of that treaty and in compensation for the privilege of the fishery they consented that dunkirk should be demolished  concerning the islands of guadaloupe marigalante minorca and belleisle no great controversy had subsisted from the beginning it had all along been agreed that these conquests should be reciprocally restored neither did the french scruple to adopt our proposal concerning the affairs of the east indies nor to make satisfactory declaration concerning ostend and nieuport  so many delicate and interesting points were settled that it does not first appear what it was that could have retarded the peace a discussion of the separate interests of two powers only that are in earnest to agree may be settled without any very considerable difficulty the hard and almost inextricable part of the knot is that wherein the cross concerns and interests of allies intervene there were two points upon which if we may form a judgment from appearances this negotiation unfortunately broke off the first was upon the manner in which england and france might be at liberty to assist their respective allies and on the restitution of wesel gueldres and such other places as the french had conquered from his prussian majesty  on the first member of this principal point the repeated proposals of france for a neutrality in germany had been uniformly and positively rejected by our administration they were considered as so many attacks upon national integrity this scheme therefore not being admitted they would or could come to no agreement and scarcely to an intelligible explanation either of the mode or the quantity of the assistance which they should be at liberty mutually to impart to their german allies or of the place in which such succors should be employed as to wesel and gueldres the french obstinately refused to restore those places they declared that such a cession would be directly against the faith by which they were bound to the empress queen of hungary for whom they insisted that these places had been conquered and in whose name alone they were governed though they had been reduced by the french arms and were at that moment held by french garrisons  as to the second point namely the restitution of captures made previous to the declaration of war the negotiating powers were equally positive the one to demand the other to refuse it the english argued that this claim had no sort of foundation in the law of nations neither was it grounded on any particular convention that the right of all hostile operations results not from a formal declaration of war but from the hostilities which the aggressor has first offered that the contrary of this proposition is at least extremely contestible and since it can by no means be clearly established it follows that the detainment of those captures must be considered on the side of england as part of the uti possidetis originally proposed as the basis of this treaty  france on the other hand seemed as fully convinced of the justice of her pretensions and she deemed the arguments with which she supported them to be so unanswerable that she offered to submit them to the justice of the english tribunals they urged that this claim of restitution was founded on the law of nations and upon particular convention by the   th article of the peace of utrecht and by the second article of the treaty of commerce and that this was strengthened by the third article of the treaty of aixlachappelle which renews and confirms those articles in the preceding treaties  by these articles a protection is allowed to the respective subjects who may have ships in the ports of either of the powers because having no opportunity of knowing that a rupture is fallen out they sailed under a security of peace and under the faith of treaties by a parity of reasoning the ships not actually in those ports ought to enjoy the same security else as they are included in the same parity of circumstances it would follow contrary to the principals of humanity and right reason that the sovereigns had provided for the preservation of one part of their subjects from the miseries of a sudden rupture to which they expose the rest the particular conventions of these treaties they said had their foundation in general equity and the law of nations since as it is impracticable for belligerent states to agree amongst themselves which is the agressor it is proper that the subjects should receive previous notice of the rupture in order that they may be able distinctly to know when they are or are not in security or when they may or may not rely on the treaties which subsist between their sovereigns  these topics were as usual bandied to and fro with great heat and little effect and as in such discussions the arguments on both sides are plausible and there can be no authorized judge the weight of the several pretensions commonly depends upon the power of the parties to enforce them on these two points therefore the renunciation of german alliances and the restitution of captures the negotiation from the beginning was at a stand and on these at length to all appearance it finally broke off  not but we are fully satisfied that the disagreement even on these points might have been only the ostensible cause of the rupture the true cause of the breach seems to have been the unseasonable interposition of the spanish claims for could france be supposed in good earnest to desire peace that is to desire such a reasonable peace as her circumstances might demand when she officiously mingled with our particular debate the affairs of a foreign and neutral power which had not the smallest connection with those that were at this time properly under deliberation it was ridiculous to urge that this was done from a prudent foresight and to prevent a future war which these disputes might possibly occasion the business was to put an end to the war which then actually subsisted and nothing could be farther from assisting this design than to increase the subjects of debate france must be sensible of the weight of this argument who herself proposed in the very beginning of this treaty as means almost necessary for carrying it on with effect that their particular dispute should be separated from those of their german allies with which it certainly had a more natural connection than with those that subsisted between england and spain as all the former parties were then engaged directly or indirectly in the war to which spain had then no manner of relation  the english ministry finding the french immovable on the two capital points above mentioned and having no opinion of the sincerity of their procedure sent directions to mr stanly to return to england and to desire that mr bussy should on the part of his court receive the same orders engaged or from extinguishing the old war that the parties separated with intention more hostile and opinions more adverse than ever and the war was soon spread to a much greater extent by the taking in of a new party and may possibly spread still more widely by laying open new sources of contention which may gradually draw in other powers and finally involve every part of europe it was also a means of producing changes in england which at a time of less tranquillity and in circumstances of less internal strength might have been productive of the most fatal consequences but these matters are reserved for the subject of the ensuing chapter  the leading negotiation in london and paris being thus broken off that which was proposed at augsburg never took place  chap viii conduct of spain during the negotiation spanish ministers memorial treaty between france and spain difference in the english ministry mr pit resigns mr pitts letter dispute concerning the resignation addresses parliament meets the german war continued  as nothing could have been more unprecedented so nothing was more alarming than the proceeding of the court of spain in the negotiation it was altogether extraordinary to see a proposal for accommodating disputes that subsisted between friends coming through the channel of an enemy it was extremely singular to see points of such consequence formally communicated and proposed for deliberation by a french agent commissioned only to negotiate a particular and distinct business when the spaniards had an ambassador residing in london from whom no sort of intimation had been previously received of such a design  that proposal not only marked out a want of sincerity on the part of france but it manifested so strange and irregular a partiality on the part of spain that it would very little have become the dignity of the king of great britain or his attention to the safety of his subjects to let it pass without a full and satisfactory explanation accordingly the spanish ambassador was called upon to disavow this irregular procedure but he returned a verbal and soon after was authorized by his court to return a written answer in which he openly avowed and justified the step taken by the french agent as entirely agreeable to the sentiments of his master he declared that the kings of france and spain were united not only by ties of blood but by a mutual interest he applauded the humanity and greatness of mind which his most christian majesty demonstrated in the proposition that was complained of he insisted much on the sincere desire of peace the only motive which influenced the conduct of the two monarchs and he added haughtily that if his master had been governed by any other principles his catholic majesty giving full scope to his greatness would have spoken from himself and as became his dignity  it appeared evidently from the whole of this paper that the court of spain was regularly as a fort of party apprised of every step that was taken in the negotiation that her judgment was appealed to upon every point and her authority called in aid to force the acceptance of the terms which were offered by france in a word that there was a perfect union of affections interests and councils between these two courts and the minister of the former so far from denying or palliating this conduct seemed to glory in it  mr pit who then took the lead in the ministry was fully satisfied the intentions of spain were by no means equivocal and that this partiality which they strongly avowed not only by declarations but by facts would drive them into all the measures of france that a war on that account was absolutely inevitable and if for the present moment the spaniards rather delayed their declaration of war than laid aside their hostile intentions it was in order to strike the blow at their own time and with the greater effect that therefore their reasons for delaying to act were the very motives which ought to induce us to act with the utmost speed and utmost vigor that we ought to consider the evasions of that court as a refusal of satisfaction and that refusal as a declaration of war that we ought from prudence as well as from spirit to secure ourselves the first blow and to be practically convinced that the early and effective measures which had so large a share in reducing france to this dependence upon spain would also be the fittest for deterring or disabling spain from affording any protection to france that to carry on this war with vigor it was only necessary to continue our present efforts no new armament would be necessary and that if any war could provide its own resources it must be a war with spain that their flota had not yet arrived and that the taking of it would at once disable theirs and strengthen our hands this procedure so suited to the dignity of the nation and the insults it had received would be a lesson to spain and to every other power how they should presume to dictate in our affairs and to intermeddle with a menacing mediation and an officiousness as insidious as it was audacious that he would allow our enemies whether secret or declared no time to think and recollect themselves  these sentiments so agreeable to the resolute and enterprising character of this minister appeared shocking to almost all the rest of his colleagues they admitted that we ought not to be terrified from the assertions of our just demands by the menaces of any power they owned that spain had taken a very extraordinary and very unjustifiable step but that we ought to admit and even to wish for an explanation this court upon a sober yet spirited remonstrance might recall that rash proposition into which they had been perhaps unwarily seduced by the artifices of france that to shun war upon a just occasion was cowardice but to provoke or court it was madness and if to court a war was not in general a very wise measure to desire it with spain if possibly it could be avoided was to overturn the most fundamental principles of the policy of both nations that this desire of adding war to war and enemy to enemy whilst we had our hands already as full as they could hold and whilst all our faculties were strained to the utmost pitch was ill to calculate the national strength of our country which however great had its limits and was not able to contend with all the world that whilst we were calling for new enemies no motion was made of new allies nor indeed of any new resource whatsoever to plunge into such measures in the manner proposed and upon no better grounds could not fail to scandalize and alarm all europe and we could possibly derive no advantage from this precipitate conduct which would not be more than counterbalanced by the jealousy and terror it would necessarily create in every nation near us as to the seizure of the flota it was not to be reckoned upon as at the very time of that deliberation it might be expected to be safe in its harbor and perhaps if we could succeed in seizing it we might perform a service not very agreeable to neutral nations and as little advantageous to our own commerce if spain blind to her true interests and misled by french councils should give in a more decisive manner into the designs of that court and obstinately refuse a reasonable satisfaction it would be then the true time to declare war when all the neighboring and impartial powers were convinced that we acted with as much temper as resolution and when every thinking man at home should be satisfied that he was not hurried into the hazards and expenses of war from an idea of chimerical heroism but from inevitable necessity and that in such a case we might depend upon the utmost support which the nation could give to an administration that depended upon its strength and yet dreaded to waste it wantonly or to employ it unjustly the minister warmed by this opposition declared that this was the time for humbling the whole house of bourbon that if this opportunity was let slip it might never be recovered and if he could not prevail in this instance he was resolved that this was the last time he would sit in that council he thanked the ministers of the late king for their support said he was himself called to the ministry by the voice of the people to whom he considered himself as accountable for his conduct and that he would no longer remain in a situation which made him responsible for measures he was no longer allowed to guide  the noble lord who precided in this council to whom years have added the wisdom of experience without abating the vigor and fire of youth and who was himself as bold a minister as ever directed the affairs of this nation made him this reply i find the gentleman is determined to leave us nor can i say i am sorry for it since he would otherwise have certainly compelled us to leave him but if he be resolved to assume the right of advising his majesty and directing the operations of the war to what purposes are we called to this council when he talks of being responsible to the people he talks the language of the house of commons and forgets that at this board he is only responsible to the king however though he may possibly have convinced himself of his infallibility still it remains that we should be equally convinced before we can resign our understanding to his direction or join with him in the measure be proposes this speech has been since discovered to be one amongst the number of contrivances that were formed and published by the opposite party to prejudice mr pit in the eyes of the public for after mr pit and lord temple had taken their leaves at the third and last council summoned to deliberate on the conduct of spain the late earl granville then lord president of the council rose up to speak expressing a very high opinion of mr pitts wisdom penetration abilities honor and integrity and in a very particular and emphatical manner spoke of the innumerable and almost insurmountable difficulties which mr pit and lord temple had to struggle with these he said were the sentiments he then delivered and in justice to himself several times declared that the speech sent abroad as spoke by him on that occasion was no other than a vile forgery calculated to serve a purpose as base as it was ungrateful it may not be improper to detect another instance of their base conduct propagated with no less avidity that mr pit in his heart was not an enemy to pensions witness his letter to a noble duke soliciting his graces interest with his late majesty for a pension by the noble duke is meant the duke of newcastle who on all occasions publicly declared he had never received any such letter  review of lord butes administration     on the division the minister himself and a noble lord closely connected with him were the only voices in favor of the immediate declaration of war the rest of the board were unanimously against it  the reader will observe that together with those matters which have been published relative to this very important deliberation with some appearance of authenticity we have added such arguments as have been agitated among the people a liberty necessary to place the matter in its full light  mr pit and lord temple adhering to their first opinion and having delivered their reasons in writing resigned their employments this resignation seemed equal to a revolution in the state an universal alarm was spread a thousand rumors flew abroad and the first suggestions were that this great minister endeavoring to avail himself by his firmness in negotiation of the advantages he had acquired by his vigor in war was opposed by the whole council who were resolved to have a peace at any rate and that this opposition had driven him to resign the seals but the true cause of the resignation very soon came out and on this point a violent conflict ensued in which the popular cause was worse sustained and the ministerial better that is with greater effect than is usual in such discussions some circumstances contributed not a little to this success  when mr pit resigned the seals the great person to whom they were delivered received them with ease and firmness without requesting that he should resume his office his majesty expressed his concern for the loss of so able a servant and to show the favorable sense he entertained of his services he made him a most gracious and unlimited offer of any rewards in the power of the crown to bestow his majesty at the same time expressed himself not only satisfied with the opinion of the majority of his council but declared he would have found himself under the greatest difficulty how to have acted had that council concurred as fully in supporting the measure proposed by mr pit as they had done in rejecting it a sentiment in the light in which his majesty considered this measure grounded upon the firmest principles of integrity and honor and which must raise the highest veneration for his royal character not only among his own subjects but amongst all nations when they see a power which has so little to fear from any human effort so very fearful of the least infringement of the strictest and most critical rules of justice  mr pit was sensibly touched with the grandeur and condescension of this proceeding i confess sir i had but too much reason to expect your majestys displeasure i did not come prepared for this exceeding goodness pardon me sir  it overpowers it oppresses me he burst into tears  we are far from an attempt to add any coloring to so exquisitely affecting a picture we are indeed far from being able to do justice to perhaps one of the most pathetic and elevated scenes which could possibly be displayed the parting of such a prince and such a minister  the next day a pension of three thousand pounds a year was settled on mr pit for three lives and at the same time a title was conferred upon his lady and her issue a pension the best bestowed and a nobility the most honorably acquired and most truly merited immediately the gazette gave notice to the public of all these transactions the resignation made the first article the honors and rewards the next and they were followed by a letter from our ambassador in spain containing an account of the favorable and pacific language of that court and of the strong assurances they gave of a desire to accommodate all differences in an amicable manner  it must be owned that this maneuver was very skilfully executed for it at once gave the people to understand the true motive to the resignation the insufficiency of that motive and the graciousness of the king notwithstanding the abrupt departure of his minister if after this the late minister should choose to enter into opposition he must go into it loaded and oppressed with the imputation of the blackest ingratitude if on the other hand he should retire from business or should concur in support of that administration which he had left because he disapproved its measures his acquiescence would be attributed by the multitude to a bargain for his forsaking the public and that the title and the pension were the considerations  these were the barriers that were opposed against that torrent of popular rage which it was apprehended would proceed from this resignation and the truth is they answered their end perfectly this torrent for some time was beaten back almost diverted into an opposite course and when afterward it returned to those objects against which it was originally directed and where it was most dreaded it was no longer that impetuous and irresistible tide which in the year      had borne down every thing before it it was weakened divided and ineffective  on this occasion the clamours and inferior members of each party went lengths which undoubtedly were neither authorized nor approved by their leaders the friends of mr pit raised the most violent clamours for displacing a minister whose measures had raised the nation from the most abject state to the highest pinnacle of glory they said that he was in fact displaced when he was compelled to resign by not being suffered to carry into execution those measures which he knew to be necessary to the honor and safety of his country that the check which this minister had received would most unseasonably revive the drooping hopes of france sunk by the vigor of our military operations and the firmness of our councils under his administration and would show spain with what impunity she might insult the honor of the british crown and violate the property of its subjects they reckoned up the disgraces which the nation had suffered before mr pit had entered into the management of affairs and the victories and conquests which were the fruit of his councils  in consequence of these reasonings addresses resolutions and instructions were set on foot in the great corporations and it was believed that the example would be followed as on a former occasion of the same kind by all the other cities and boroughs of the kingdom but the progress of this measure though commenced with much alacrity was slow and languid a few only of the corporations entered into it and some even of these few in a manner less warm than was expected a strenuous defense was made on the part of the remaining ministry  was it ever heard said they that a sovereign has been censured for listening to the whole body of his council in preference to the particular opinions of a single man on the contrary this uncontrouled sway of a single minister has been often thought dangerous and was always odious in our free constitution and is the more justly to be disliked as perhaps inconsistent with the true spirit either of absolute monarchy or of limited government let the merit of this minister be what it will shall his master therefore be forced to receive him upon any terms must his prince to gratify his ambitious views or if you please his virtuous intentions dismiss his whole council and annihilate his prerogative as a king his reason and judgment as a man was it ever heard before that a counselor has professed without any reserve or any mask that because he could not guide in government he would not cooperate this has unquestionably been the true motive for the conduct of many ministers but never was the avowed motive until this occasion mr pit has had the freest scope for the exertion of his genius he was perhaps the only english minister that never met with the slightest opposition he has had the treasures and the forces of the nation at his most absolute command let him in his turn do that justice that has been done to him let him if the favors of the crown constitute no obligation be bound at least by the rules of equity and if he will not partake in the conduct of the present most intricate and difficult business of administration let him not render it still more intricate and more difficult by his opposition and let him not study to find a justification of his measures from the ill success of those whom he has left when that ill sucess will be owing to his own devices  thus far the points seem to have been urged with propriety and weight a torrent however of low and illiberal abuse was also poured out on this occasion a letter from the right hon mr pit to a person of eminence in the city london october    dear sir finding to my great surprise that the cause and manner of my resigning the seals is grossly misrepresented in the city as well as that the most gracious and spontaneous marks of his majestys approbation of my services which marks followed my resignation have been infamously traduced as a bargain for my forsaking the public i am under a necessity of declaring the truth of both these facts in a manner which i am sure no gentleman will contradict a difference of opinion with regard to measures to be taken against spain of the highest importance to the honor of the crown and to the most essential national interests and this founded on what spain had already done not on what that court may farther intend to do was the cause of my resigning the seals lord temple and i submitted in writing and signed by us our most humble sentiments to his majesty which being overruled by the united opinion of all the rest of the kings servants i resigned the seals on monday the  th of this month in order not to remain responsible for measures which i was no longer allowed to guide most gracious public marks of his majestys approbation of my services followed my resignation they are unmerited and unsolicited and i shall ever he proud to have received them from the best of sovereigns  i will now only add my dear sir that i have explained these matters only for the honor of truth not in any view to court return of confidence from any man who with a credulity as weak as it is injurous has thought fit hastily to withdraw his good opinion from one who served his country with fidelity and success and who justly reveres the upright and candid judgment of it little solicitous about the censures of the capricious and ungenerous accept my sincerest acknowledgments for all your kind friendship and believe me ever with truth and esteem  my dear sir your faithful friend etc     his secretary pit portrait of secretary pit whole life public and private was scrutinized with the utmost malignity to furnish matter of calumny against him  the successes of his administration were depreciated his faults were monstrously exaggerated and the rewards and honors so justly conferred on him by his sovereign were by every trick of wit ridicule and buffoonery converted into matter of degradation and disgrace  without presuming to take any part in a controversy which however unequally divided the royal council or without entering into the sentiments of any faction which we have always shunned we may affirm with truth and impartiality that no man was ever better fitted than mr pit to be the minister in a great and powerful nation or better qualified to carry that power and greatness to their utmost limits there was in all his designs a magnitude and even a vastness which was not easily comprehended by every mind and which nothing but success could have made to appear reasonable if he was sometimes incorrect he was never vulgar  his power as it was not acquired so neither was exercised in an ordinary manner with very little parliamentary and with less court influence he swayed both at court and in parliament with an authority unknown before to the best supported ministers he was called to the ministry by the voice of the people and what is more rare he held it with that approbation and under him for the first time administration and popularity were seen united under him great britain carried on the most important war in which she ever was engaged alone and unassisted with greater splendor and with more success than she had ever enjoyed at the head of the most powerful alliances alone this island seemed to balance the rest of europe  in the conduct of the war he never suffered the enemy to breathe but overwhelmed them with reiterated blows and kept up the alarm in every quarter if one of his expeditions was not so well calculated or so successfully executed amends were made by another and by a third the spirit of the nation once roused was not suffered for a moment to subside and the french dazzled as it were by the multitude and celerity of his enterprises seemed to have lost all power of resistance in short he revived the military genius of our people he supported our allies he extended our trade he raised our reputation he augmented our dominions and on his departure from administration left the nation in no other danger than that which ever must attend exorbitant power and the temptation which may be to the invidious exertion of it happy it had been for him for his sovereign and his country if a temper less austere and a disposition more practicable more compliant and conciliating had been joined to his other great virtues the want of these qualities disabled him from acting any otherwise than alone it prevented our enjoying the joint fruit of the wisdom of many able men who might mutually have tempered and mutually forwarded each other and finally which was not the meanest loss it deprived us of his own immediate services  those who censured his political conduct the most severely could raise but few exceptions to it none of them singly and perhaps the whole united of no great weight against a person long engaged in so great a scene of action  whether the part which under his administration we rather continued to act than newly took with regard to the affairs of germany be for the real interest of great britain is a question of the utmost difficulty and which perhaps will never admit a satisfactory solution to condemn him on this head we must be sure of this solution it has been observed in favor of that contested measure that france demonstrated through the whole progress of the late treaty the most earnest desire that we should abandon the german connection no trifling argument that our enemy did not look upon it to be extremely prejudicial to our interests if he has carried on that war at a vast expense a prodigious stand has been made against the entire power of france had less been expended the whole expense might have been lost how far this part of his conduct was agreeable to his former declarations is a discussion which can avail but little he found the nation engaged in these affairs it was more easy to push them forward than to extricate himself from them as he proceeded he discovered by experience the advantages of that plan of action and his opinion was changed  but even admitting that to attain the ends of opposition he had once fallen upon popular topics which even then he knew were not tenable it can form but a very small blemish in a public character however wrong it may be by application to the strictest rules of morality ill would it fare with statesmen if this sort of consistency were to be expected from the most consistent of them  with regard to the pension and title it is a shame that any defense should be necessary what eye cannot distinguish at the first glance the difference between this and the exceptionable case of titles and pensions what briton with the smallest sense of honor and gratitude but must blush for his country if such a man retired unrewarded from the public service let the motives to that retirement be what they would it was not possible that his sovereign could let his eminent services pass unrequited the sum that was given was undoubtedly inadequate to his merits and the quantum was rather regulated by the moderation of the great mind that received it than by the liberality of that which bestowed it  the conduct of mr pit when the parliament met in which he made his own justification without impeaching the conduct of any of his colleagues or taking one measure that might seem to arise from disgust or opposition has set a seal upon his character  lord egremont was appointed to succeed him as secretary for the southern department  chap ix dispute with spain representation of the earl of bristol disposition of the court of madrid treaty between france and spain england desires a communication court of spain refuses the ministers mutually withdraw a rupture  the unfortunate intervention of spain in the late negotiation raised so many difficulties and created so much mischief both abroad and at home that it becomes an era in this history and it is necessary we should pursue that object from the point at which we left it to its final and fatal determination  the answer which had been received from the spanish minister in london was far from being satisfactory to our court orders were immediately given to the earl of bristol our ambassador in spain to remonstrate with energy and firmness on so extraordinary a proceeding to adhere to the negative put upon the spanish pretensions to fish at newfoundland to rest the article of disputed captures on the justice of our tribunals to continue the former professions of our desire of an amicable adjustment of the logwood dispute and of our willingness to cause the settlements on the coast of honduras to be evacuated as soon as ever his catholic majesty should suggest a method for our enjoyment of that traffic to which we had a right by treaty and which was further confirmed to us by repeated promises from that court  at the same time that the earl of bristol was authorized to proceed with that spirit which the offended dignity of our court required and to bring spain to a categorical and satisfactory declaration concerning her final intentions yet if he perceived on her part any intention to disavow or even to explain away this offensive transaction he was readily to accept it and to afford to that court as handsome a retreat as possible the letter which conveyed these instructions was written by mr pit and dated on the   th of july a few days after the fatal memorial had been delivered by mr bussy  the earl of bristol punctually obeyed those orders he found general wall the spanish minister much in cold blood and in very equivocal dispositions he heard with great patience the proper and energetic representation that had been very ably made by the earl of bristol he applauded the king of great britains magnanimity in not suffering france as a tribunal to be appealed to in his disputes with spain and declared that in the proposition which had been made with the consent of his court things were not considered in that light asked whether it could be imagined in england that the catholic king was seeking to provoke us in our present most flourishing and most exalted situation and after such a series of prosperous events as no single nation had ever met with he valued and reciprocally returned our frequent professions of friendship and our desire of amicable adjustment but these favorable demonstrations were accompanied with some circumstances that had a very menacing appearance for in the first place he declared that at that time the utmost harmony subsisted between the courts of france and spain that in consequence of their perfect agreement there was a mutual unreserved communication of every step taken in their several negotiations with england that france had even offered to assist spain in case the discussions she had with us should grow into a rupture and that this offer was considered in a friendly light such an intimate union of a third power with one of the parties at war forebodes no long duration to its friendship or even to its neutrality with the other if spain justified the proceedings of france and owned herself concerned in them it was but one and that a short step to a junction with her  as to the three matters in dispute the spanish minister resolutely adhered to them all and as to the last that of the logwood he observed that great britain had offered them nothing but what they had long since been tired of treaty and negotiation that this matter had been already fully discussed and that on this head spain had given the most convincing proofs of her desire to be on the best terms with england for in the beginning of this war before england had grown terrible by her successes when their american governors had endeavored to dislodge the english from some new establishments on the coast of honduras they had at the complaint of our court in order to take away all cause of mistrust ordered the governor to desist from so justifiable an enterprise that on the offer of england on this occasion to settle matters in an amicable manner they cheerfully agreed to that method but that six years had elapsed without their receiving the least satisfaction they even alleged that the english encroachments on their coasts in that time increased  in this manner the spaniards vindicated the form and the matter of their proceeding they showed no sort of disposition to relax from their claims but at the same time they no longer insisted on blending together the several discussions and they professed in general though not very warm terms a desire of continuing in amity with us with regard to the matter in dispute the pretensions of both powers stood in this posture throughout the whole discussion except that they were urged with more or less asperity according to the fluctuating disposition of the court of spain which seemed to rest upon no sure and settled principals there were probably two factions in her councils who as they alternately prevailed changed the language and countenance of the spanish minister however for some time the aspect of things continued on the whole to be rather favorable and even an express declaration was at length made that spain had been at no time more intent on cultivating a good correspondence with us but still the french interest silently gained ground at madrid the confidental communications of that court with spain her affected moderation in the treaty the dangerous greatness of england the common interest of the house of buorbon every part of which must suffer both in its dignity and safety by allowing the principal of its branches to be pruned to the quick these points were urged with continual solicitation and they assured the spaniards that even the signing an alliance between the sovereigns of the two nations would intimidate england already exhausted by the war and apprehensive of losing the valuable commerce she carried on with spain  these arguments and suggestions at length prevailed and a treaty was signed between the two courts the purpose of which was to preserve from oppression and to maintain the interests of the house of bourbon this alliance was of a nature the more dangerous as it turned upon family not national interest and because not stating exactly its objects it might be made just of what extent they pleased we make no mention of any other treaty than this of itself sufficiently alarming because whatever suspicions may be entertained there is no certainty that any other has been concluded between those powers  france had obtained in this treaty almost all that she aimed at by it she entered into the closest connection with spain this connection did not indeed seem directly of necessity to conclude a breach with england it led to it however almost inevitably at first the whole transaction was kept a profound secret the inferiority of the marine of spain and the precariousness of their supplies from america in case they came to a present rupture with england obliged them to this temporary reserve france took care that this treaty should not transpire until the negotiation was broken off and spain whilst she was under these apprehensions exhibited those occasional proofs of a pacific disposition which we have just now seen but as soon as france had lost all hopes of concluding the negotiation in the manner she had wished and had failed in the use she made of the intervention of the claims of spain she circulated with great industry a report that spain would immediately declare against great britain in consequence of a treaty lately concluded among the bourbon courts  england found that those boasts of the french were too confidently made and too generally believed to be altogether without foundation in consequence of these apprehensions orders were sent to spain to demand in the most moderate terms but in a manner not to be evaded a communication of this treaty or at least a disavowal that it contained any thing to the prejudice of great britain but before these orders could reach spain lord bristol had himself received intelligence of the treaty and of the hopes which the french made no secret of their deriving from that source he therefore thought himself under a necessity of desiring satisfaction from the spanish secretary of state concerning it  upon this application there appeared on a sudden such a change in the countenance language and sentiments of that minister as indicated but too fully the justness of the suspicions that were entertained the spanish flota was now safely arrived with a very rich cargo the french arms had made a considerable progress in the kings electoral dominions the success of the imperial arms was no less striking the reasons for their former show of moderation no longer existed they therefore gave a loose to those movements which they had hitherto concealed m wall evading a direct answer entered into a long and bitter complaint not only of the treatment which spain had received from us but of the haughtiness of our late proceedings with france that it was time for them to open their eyes and not to suffer a neighbor an ally a relation and a friend any longer to run the risque of receiving such rigid laws as were prescribed by an insulting conqueror that we were intoxicated with our successes and a continued series of victories had elated us so far as to make us reject the reasonable concession offered by france this refusal made it evident that our design in ruining the french power was the more easily to crush spain that we proposed entirely to chase the french from all their colonies in america to have the easier task in seizing on the spanish dominions in those parts thereby to satisfy to the utmost of our ambition and to gratify our boundless thirst of conquest therefore he would himself be the man to advise the king of spain that since his dominions were to be overwhelmed at least that they should be siezed with arms in his subjects hands and not to continue the passive victim he had hitherto appeared in the eyes of the world  the english ambassador though astonished at so extraordinary a change of style replied with coolness to the invectives and with firmness to the menaces of the spanish minister he obviated the objections which had been made and supported our pretensions after answering in the best manner to what m wall had urged he returned to his first demand an explanation concerning the treaty as often as a direct answer was evaded the same question was again put and at length the only reply was that the king of spain had thought proper to renew his family compact and then mr wall as if he was gone farther than he was authorized suddenly turned the discourse and no farther satisfaction could be obtained  this revolution in the appearances of things in spain was too interesting not to be immediately communicated our ministry saw evidently that the moderation they had hitherto displayed might be attributed to fear and that the language of the court of spain would permit no doubt of their hostile intensions orders were therefore given to the earl of bristol conformable to dignity of the nation and the justice of our claim he was ordered to renew his instances concerning the treaty to demand an explanation with a proper firmness but without the mixture of any thing which might irritate and to signify that a peremptory refusal to communicate the treaty or to disavow an intention to take part with our enemies would be considered as an aggression on the part of spain and an absolute declaration of war  things were now brought to a single and precise point the demand was made in the terms of the order then it was that the pride of spain entirely threw of the remainder of that mask which her policy had persuaded her to assume the secretary m wall replied that the spirit of haughtiness and of discord  the earl of bristol parted from madrid the   th of december and thus was brought on a rupture which has prodigiously extended the operations and consequently the miseries of war and threatens to protect them to a very long duration europe unfortunately found herself plunged into the gulf of a new war at the time she hoped to emerge from the old one and by the very means which were used to draw her out of it a point of honor alone seemed to have been the last and immediate cause of the breach but whoever has diligently attended to the spanish affairs from the memorial presented by bussy to the final answer delivered by wall will see that the motives were however ill understood of a much more serious and important nature  as the two powers had now come to extremities and the english ambassador had departed from madrid the spanish minister also quitted london but before his departure he left a paper in the nature of a manifesto of very little importance in point of argument but filled with invectives charging the war on the haughtiness of the late english minister and on the little respect with which his court had been treated both during the administration of that minister and since his resignation that had the purport of the treaty been desired in a manner less offensive to the dignity of his master it might as easily have been obtained as it could have been justified for the treaty which was believed to have been signed on the   th of august contained only a reciprocal guaranty of the dominions of the several branches of the house of bourbon but with this particular restriction that it should only extend to the dominions which shall remain to france after the present war  it must be remarked that this paper whilst it pretends to set forth the purport of a treaty dated the   th of august does not deny the existence of any other treaty which might more offensively concern the interest of great britain it was however answered in every article with the utmost moderation perspicuity and force in a memorial of loath egremont here we close the spanish transaction as the is the whole of what belongs properly to the year we trea of all that remains for us to do is to touch upon the affairs of the east indies and america  chap x blockade of pondicherry distress of the french

dominica taken by lord rollo and sir james douglas  after the defeat of the french near wandewash the taking of the city of arcot and the reduction of the fortresses of chitteput and carrical pondicherry wa the only space of consequence which remained to our enemies in india this town beautifully built strongly fortified and four leagues in circuit seemed rather the capital of a kingdom than a trading establishment it is situated on the coast of malabar about forty miles from our settlement at madrass which in the days of its prosperity it rivalled if not exceeded in trade opulence and splendour and it still remained the depository of whatever wealth was left to the french after the reverse of their fortune in war  as soon as the fortresses adjacent to this important place had been reduced and the inland country brought perfectly to our interests by the total expulsion of the french the blockade of pondicherry was commenced by the land forces under colonel coote and the marine under admiral stevens a regular siege was at that time impracticable on account of the periodical rains which were daily expected and even under more favorable circumstances it would have proved a task of infinite difficulty to attempt any army that could be supported in india the taking of a place so strongly fortified defended by a good garrison and by an officer able and resolute and whose pride and obstinacy so prejudicial on all other occasions would have made him as in effect they did make him persevere to the very last moment is the defense of the last stake which the french had left in india  the blockade being therefore chosen as the most eligible for the time was continued with the best dispositions and the most extraordinary patience on both sides for full seven months in this time the garrison and inhabitants suffered sorely by famine col coote in order to augment their distress erected batteries at a distance not with a view of ruining the walls but to harrass the enemy by an increase of garrison duty  at length when the weather appeared settled four batteries were raised at some distance to enfilade the streets of pondicherry whilst others were advanced nearer in order to play upon the works these operations though the siege was not yet formally undertaken commenced on the   th of november    0 but as the season of the rains and winds was not yet quite over much was suffered from storms which ruined the batteries and approaches they were however always repaired with the utmost alacrity and speed and the siege suffered no intermission so that the besieged who eagerly expected the arrival of their fleet to their relief were reduced to the most extreme distress they lived on camels elephants dogs and cats the extreme scarcity and dearness even of this wretched provision increased their misery sixteen roupies half crowns had been paid for the flesh of a dog  in the midst of this distress their hopes were suddenly revived and those of the besiegers notwithstanding the progress they had made almost totally depressed on the first of january      one of those terrible storms so frequent in the indian sea and so ruinous drove the english squadron from before pondicherry two ships of the line were wrecked and their crews with the exception of two or three men entirely perished two others of the same class were driven ashore and beat to pieces the men fortunately escaped the real damage which our fleet sustained on this occasion together with the idea of a far greater suggested by their own desires and justified by the violence of the storm elevated to the highest pitch the spirits of the garrison sunk by disease famine fatigue and an uninterrupted train of adverse fortune general lally seeing the port clear sent an express without delay to the french agent in the neighboring neutral settlements that this was the time to throw in succors he seemed sanguine and f of vigor the letter which was intercepted is printed below translation of an intercepted letter from general lally to  raymond the french resident at pullicat dated pondicherry the  d of january      mr raymond the english squadron is no more sir out of the twelve ships they had in our road seven are lost crews and all the four others dismasted and it appears there is no more than one frigate that has escaped therefore dont lose an instant to send us chelingoes upon chelingoes loaded with rice the da have nothing to fear now besides according to the law of nations they are only to send us no provisions themselves and we are no more blocked up by sea  the saving of pondicherry has been in your power once already if you miss the present opportunity it will be entirely your fault do not forget also some small chelingoes offer great rewards i expect seventeen thousand morattoes within these four days in short risque all attempt all force all and send us some rice should it be but half a garse at a time  signed lally     as it may tend to furnish some idea of the character of this singular man  but admiral stevens and those who commanded under him exerting themselves with unparalleled diligence and celerity appeared again before pondicherry in less than four days after the storm with eleven ships of the line and one frigate and the blockade was as complete as ever no succors had been thrown in and admiral stevens in order to prevent the ill impression which the late disaster might have occasioned sent a message to the neighboring dutch and danish settlements of the good condition and strength of the remainder of his fleet and assured them he would make prize of such vessels as he found infringing the neutrality by attempting to supply the enemy  notwithstanding this mortifying disappointment m lally made no proposal to surrender the siege was carried on with redoubled alacrity and at length a large battery being advanced within four hundred and fifty yards of the rampart a breach being effected and not more than one days provision of any kind remaining a signal was made for a cessation of arms the principal of the jesuits together with two civilians came out and offered terms of capitulation the governor preserving all his haughtiness which neither his errors nor misfortunes could in the least abate declined to offer any terms  nothing can be said too highly of the conduct perseverance and unanimity of the land and sea services during a tedious siege and blockade of eight months in a climate so unfavourable to all military operations colonel coote gave the final blow to the french power in india he was now indisputed master of the rich coast of coromandel the french power was wholly extirpated the neutral nations were contemptible the princes of the country considered us with an aweful regard and nothing but a little french settlement on the coast of malabar called mahie and which was soon after reduced opposed our commanding the whole trade of that vast peninsula of india from the ganges to the indies the most extensive and profitable sphere of commerce in the world  whilst every thing was giving way to our arms in the southern parts of this peninsula the affairs of france which in bengal had been to all appearance totally suppressed rose up again for a moment from a quarter and in a manner which was little expected after the taking of chandenagore by admiral watson in the year      mr law nephew to that law who had made himself so well known by the missisippi scheme put himself at the head of a party of french fugitives which was augmented from time to time to about two hundred men with this small party he threw himself into the heart of the country and joining himself sometimes to one sometimes to another of the native princes as his interest led him he rendered himself considerable by several striking services and supported the credit of his little corpse with a very high reputation  the great mogul having some time since been deposed by an irruption of the marrattas and dying soon after one of his sons sha zaddah assumed the title and was supported by some of the provinces of that extensive and disunited empire he was opposed by others and though he was at the head of a royal army of his native subjects such is the state of the military in that part of the world that he considered an handful of european fugitives as an acquisition of the greatest importance and such as might turn the balance against any weight of indians which might be thrown into the opposite scale in fact it was to mr law he attributed the reduction of several considerable provinces to his obedience  elated with these successes law persuaded him to turn his arms against bengal which had not acknowledged him it was a rich and flourishing country and the possession of it would undoubtedly contribute more than all the rest to set him on the throne of the moguls here unfortunately for him the evil genius of law impelled him to encounter again with those arms by which the interest of his country had been before ruined in this part of the world and which indeed were those only from which he had a great deal to fear sha zaddah entered the kingdom of bengal at the head of an army of  0000 indians and something more than  00 french  the french support was more prejudicial to his title in the eyes of the english than any other objection and as they were now become the arbiters of crowns in the east they joined the nabob of bengal to oppose his progress about  0000 blacks supported by  00 english soldiers formed the army against him a major major carnac commanded that body which engaged and totally routed an army of fourscore thousand men commanded by the mogul in person that prince was taken prisoner mr law was also taken and the party of french adventurers dispersed for ever it is not yet known with certainty in what manner they mean to dispose of their captive monarch it was some heightening to the satisfaction of this great event that it happened on the same day in which the french agreed to the surrender of pondicherry  a little before this jaffier ali cawn the nabob who in      had been placed in that dignity by general clive notwithstanding the terrifying example of his predecessor by his weakness and misgovernment drew on himself the hatred of his subjects and lost the protection of the english but as his ambition was the feeblest of his passions he consented quietly to quit the throne the revolution was effected without bloodshed his soninlaw was appointed in his room and as the whole transaction was with the consent and cooperation of the english governor vansittart the old privileges of the company were confirmed and new were acquired the english in bengal were become necessary to the government of that country and every change produced something to their advantage  it is certain that the period of this war in the east indies has been marked by as many striking events uncommon circumstances and singular reverses of fortune as any that have happened from the time of our knowledge of this part of the world  it can hardly be said that this series of prosperity was interrupted by the successful attempts of the count destaign this lively adventurer with the command of no more than two ordinary frigates had in october      taken and destroyed the english settlement of benderabassi on the persian gulf he then struck over to the island of sumatra where we carry on our most considerable commerce in pepper and before the end of the following april reduced bencoolen the principal settlement and all the rest of our forts and factories on that island which made a defense altogether as unworthy of the rest of our conduct in india as that of the count destaign was superior to the efforts of his countrymen in that quarter this bold adventurer however could not derive so much honor from the vigor of his enterprise as disgrace from having made them against the most sacred law of arms if what is said is true that he was at the very time a prisoner upon parole  in america the island of dominica one of those islands called neutral but which the french had fortified and settled was reduced by a small armament under lord rollo and sir james douglas north america was perfectly quieted by a peace with the cherokees colonel grant reduced them to this necessity by penetrating with great courage and perseverance into their country and destroying fifteen of their towns and almost their whole harvest  the annual register or history of the war for the year      chap i state of europe in the beginning of this year ill state of the british alliance condition of the northern powers war reaches to the southern family compact some articles from it observations upon them consequences of this treaty to europe war declared against spain state of spain and great britain at the beginning of the war between them advantages and disadvantages on each side  the close of the year      left the affairs of all europe both military and political in the most interesting situation in which they have stood at perhaps any period of our modern history the endeavors which had been made to bring about peace amongst the belligerent powers served only to increase their animosity and at the same time they brought into light and exertion those latent motives and dispositions to war which had long lurked in other powers under the veil of neutrality and had only been kept down sometimes by irresolution of temper in persons and sometimes by want of system in politics these ineffectual endeavors for peace produced also many occasions of quarrel and debate that were absolutely new  to the north there was no appearance of relenting in any one of the powers engaged it was not to be expected that the confederacy which had held together so long and under such difficulties and disappointments should now break to pieces just at the moment when the states which composed it seemed in a condition to reap the mature fruits of their unanimity and perseverance the king of prussia was not in a state either to allure or to intimidate great britain could not increase his subsidy nor reinforce his armies the allied army in westphalia played a defensive and on the whole of the campaign a losing game and there was nobody so sanguine as to think that great britain could increase her strength in germany where she paid already  00000 men and expended five millions annually  although nothing seems more certain in a general view of the political system than that the king of prussia is not the natural and necessary ally of this nation yet his fortune neither was since the beginning of the war nor is it now a matter of indifference to us  the late mr shippin was of opinion that the power of france was become an object of much less terror since the growth of the power of russia but he never imagined it possible that all the great continental powers of europe should ever be united with france and that they should conspire to load her scale instead of ballancing it he never could foresee what has actually happened in this war that this very power of russia could cooperate with france and even with sweden and what is full as extraordinary that both these latter could cooperate with austria to destroy in effect the system which had been established by the treaty of westphalia that system which it had been the great drift of policy and the great object of war to both france and sweden in the last century to establish and to confirm and to the house of austria constantly to oppose the destruction of the king of prussia seemed to include the destruction of the treaty of westphalia because he is the only power in the empire capable of asserting the independency of its members and supporting the declining credit of the protestant cause  the total ruin of saxony with such circumstances of unpardonable cruelty by that prince himself and the exhausted state of all the other protestant members of the empire have narrowed that interest more and more to the single object of prussia as this interest was first formed in the empire so its condition there cannot fail of having the most sensible influence on all the potentates of the same communion even in this light england had an interest that the king of prussia should not be entirely crushed by the prevalence of a combination composed in so extraordinary a manner that its success must necessarily produce a total revolution in the system of europe and draw on a series of consequences which though it is impossible to particularize must have undoubtedly been of the most important and alarming nature  but there was an interest yet nearer to us the fate of our own army in germany which could not survive the destruction of the king of prussia for an hour these circumstances rendered the prospect of the campaign in germany very gloomy as there was no sort of ground to suppose that this prince upon whose fate so many important interests immediately depended could hold out to the middle of summer besides denmark showed no favorable dispositions toward us and holland discovered evident marks of coldness if not of absolute alienation such was the disposition of the powers in the north  the southern powers of europe whose total inconnection with the causes and whose great remoteness from the seat of war might appear sufficient to ensure their tranquillity began to enter into action with a spirit equal to that of any of the parties who had from the beginning acted as principals new fuel was heaped upon the fire of contention which had wasted so many nations just as it seemed to be on the point of expiring  that alliance between the branches of the house of bourbon of which we have spoken last year and which is so well known by the name of the family compact is one of the most extraordinary transactions of this or perhaps of any time it has already produced some effects answerable to its design it may produce others still more important and on the whole must be considered as an event of the most extensive lasting and alarming influence  the treaty of vienna in      between france and austria has certainly contributed not a little to give that new turn to affairs by which almost all the discourses that have hitherto been written on the interests of princes are rendered erroneous and of little use in future speculations that treaty however though it seems entirely to have disjointed the ancient system of alliance by which france was formerly counterpoised may possibly not be so much a lasting change as a temporary and excentric deviation from the sphere in which the house of austria had formerly moved and into which it seems so sutiable to her natural and permanent interest to return the bourbon compact is of a different nature and it seems to have at length produced that entire union between the french and spanish monarchies which was so much dreaded on the death of charles ii and which it was the great purpose of the treaty of partition and the war of the grand alliance to prevent we have seen it take place in our days comparatively with very little notice so much greater is our present strength or so much greater was the apprehension in those days than the danger of the actual event in the present  it was a bold push in france to attempt and an uncommon success to procure toward the close of an unfortunate and disgraceful war an alliance of this kind france could not have expected from the most fortunate issue of her affairs an advantage so great as that which she derived from her uncommon distresses it is some time since the jealousy of her power has began to abate but in fact her security and probably too her power will be greatly increased by this very circumstance instead of forming such an object as alarmed mankind and against which all europe used to unite she is herself become the center of an alliance which extends from the northern to the southern extemity of europe and she was in this war actually united with russia sweden austria the empire spain and naples to say nothing of denmark with which she had also some connections  with other nations however her ties are comparatively slight but the engagements of the bourbon compact form rather an act of incorporation than an alliance it contains stipulations hitherto unheard of in any treaty by the   d and   th articles the subjects of the several branches of the house of bourbon are admitted to a mutual naturalization and to a participation of such privileges and immunities as if they were natural born subjects of the countries of their respective sovereigns the direct trade to america forms the only exception to this comprehensive communitive of interests the tenor of this article is of infinite consequence to the general trading interest of europe all the states of which by the   th article of the same alliance are excluded from any prospect of obtaining similar advantages  this forms a civil union in almost the strictest sense the political union is even more perfect by the  st and   th articles the two monarchs of france and spain agree to look upon every power as their enemy which becomes an enemy of the other that a war declared against either shall be regarded as personal by the other and that when they happen to be both engaged in a war against the same enemy or enemies they will wage it jointly with their whole forces and that their military operations shall proceed by common consent and with a perfect agreement  by the   th article they agree reciprocally to disclose to each other their alliances and negotiations  by the   th and   th they formally engage not to make or even to listen to any proposal of peace from their common enemies but by mutual consent being resolved in time of peace as well as in time of war each mutually to consider the interests of the allied crown as its own to compensate their several losses and advantages and to act as if the two monarchies formed only one and the same power the king of the sicilies and the infant duke of parma are comprehended in this treaty  here is the model of the most perfect confederacy there is but one restriction to the extent of this scheme but this particular restriction is a key to the whole treaty as it shows in the most satisfactory manner against what object it was principally directed for by the  th article it is provided that spain shall not be bound to succor france when she is engaged in a war in consequence of her engagements by the treaty of westphalia or other alliances with the princes and states of germany and the north unless some maritime power takes part in those wars or france be attacked by land in her own country this exception of the maritime powers indicates sufficiently that the tendency of this article is to affect england and serves to point out clearly though obliquely to the other powers of europe that their connection with england is the great circumstance which is to provoke the enmity of spain  it should seem that this treaty alone when once its true nature came to be discovered if no other cause existed would have been sufficient to justify great britain in a declaration of war against a monarchy which had united itself in so intimate a manner with her enemy that it was rendered impossible to distinguish the one from the other in this point however prudence was to interpose and circumstances to direct it was not therefore until every attempt to bring spain to a clear declaration of pacific intentions had been tried without success in the manner she have already seen that war was actually declared against her this declaration was made on our part in london the  d of january of the present year  since great britain was a kingdom she never was in such a doubtful and dangerous situation for at this time we was engaged directly or indirectly in a war not only with all the great continental powers but what is more material with the most considerable part of the maritime strength of europe according to the ordinary computations the navy of spain consisted of more than  00 men of war and though the french navy was greatly reduced it became of consideration when added to the spanish great efforts were made to render it respectable several communities in france engaged to fit out men of war at their own expense and in general that whole people felt after having been sunk under a long despondency a momentary glow of hope and animation from this alliance so powerful in its real strength and in its principals so flattering to the national vanity the glory of their royal house was on this occasion united with the safety of their country they were reinforced by the most cordial amity of a power untouched in its resources of men money and stores whilst great britain was exhausted of men by her many victories and her resources were sinking under a debt of more than one hundred millions  besides a rude shock had been lately given to the system of the english ministry which might be supposed in some degree likely to affect public credit the part which mr pit might finally take and the consequences which might result from his actions were extremely undetermined nor was it at all clear what degree of harmony and real confidence continued amongst the several parts of the subsisting administration all these considerations could not fail of inspiring france with great confidence  great britain under these circumstances had however some things in her favor the hope of plunder which always attends a spanish war disposed the minds of many toward the present and was sure to call forth a very vigorous exertion both of public and private strength this circumstance also insured the supplies  with regard to the administration their delay in entering into this spanish war contrary to the ideas of mr pit his resignation in consequence of this delay the necessity which so soon after appeared of engaging in hostilities and which to the bulk of the people seemed to justify the sentiments of that minister together with a recollection of the singular spirit with which the french war had been carried on must necessarily have excited them to the most strenous efforts and to every act of laudable emulation there was a necessity of showing that the spirit of the nation and the wisdom of its councils were not confined to a single man and it was shown effectually  we had also to balance the great strength derived from the extraordinary combination of our enemies that uniform tenor of success on our side which made our people believe themselves invincible this was not an ungrounded presumption or a dream of enthusiasm their just opinion of superior courage together with the solid experience derived from such a variety of services and so many sharp conflicts by sea and land all combined to make our forces seem and be almost irresistible  spain on the other hand had in the very constitution of her power an essential defect which exposed her on this as upon all other occasions her resources though very great are not within herself and consequently are not always at her command being subject not only to be intercepted by the operations of the war but to be destroyed or lost by the casualty of long voyages and in every event are liable to delay and disappointment  chap ii portugal threatened melancholy state of that kingdom arrogant proposition of the french and spanish ministers to the court of lisbon answer of that court several memorials resolution of the king of portugal french and spanish ministers depart war declared by those powers against portugal  such was our situation both at home and abroad at the breaking out of this new war something extraordinary was to be expected from the confederacy of the house of bourbon it was not however altogether certain where the storm that was gathering would fall there were apprehensions for the peace of italy holland had some cause of dread and menaces were used in that quarter but portugal seemed to be most endangered on account of her close and natural connection with great britain her internal weakness the ancient claims of the catholic king and the opportunity of invasion that kingdom being on all sides except to the sea in a manner enclosed by spain  public conjecture was not mistaken in fixing upon portugal no mention was made indeed of the spanish pretensions to that crown but a resolution was taken not only to oblige her to renounce all friendship but to violate her neutrality with great britain  no attempt was ever designed with less appearance of justice no proposition was ever made with more arrogance and despotism to an independent sovereign and no scheme seemed according to every human appearance so certain of success  the kingdom of portugal on the recovery of her liberty which happened in the year    0 found herself stripped of the greatest part of those acquisitions in both indies which had been the principal sources of her power and the great monuments of the captivity of her former kings and commanders during the interval of her subjection new commerical powers had risen some on the ruins of her fortune and others upon different but not less substantial foundations though the brazils were recovered and goa and some other places in india remained still to portugal her maritime power and the share of trade on which it depended were not recoverable contrary to the fate of other nations who have shaken off a foreign dominion she did not owe her liberty to great abilities whilst the united provinces were first freed and afterward aggrandized by the capacity of the princes of orange and whilst prussia from an inconsiderable and dependent principality grew into a formidable monarchy by the genuis of her sovereigns portugal continued to languish in a state of mediocrity without any symptoms of danger to her existence she suffered a gradual decay of her power and consideration the character of her government was narrow and biggoted and the whole system of her commerce preposterous if on the one hand a long peace added to the resources of her revenue it on the other absolutely annihilated her military and no country in the world had an army so complete in numbers so ill furnished with arms so deficient in discipline and so wholly unprovided of able and experienced officers  in this condition she suffered a fatal blow from the earthquake in      the wealthy and flourishing city of lisbon was laid level with the ground near  0000 of the inhabitants were buried in the ruins and those who remained with the court itself were reduced to the utmost distress and misery  as if this earthquake which overturned their capital had also shaken and destracted the frame of their government and the temper of their minds the most dreadful distempers broke out in the state a series of horrid crimes and of cruel punishments succeeded to this calamity the most noble and wealthy family of portugal having engaged itself in a sacrilegious attempt on the life of their sovereign was cut off at once with little distinction of sex or age by a bloody and dreadful exertion of justice many others who were accused or suspected suffered death or exile or imprisonment amongst these and from the same causes one of the most considerable religious orders for wealth influence and policy was stripped of its possessions and entirely driven out of the country  all these circumstances left this unhappy kingdom in the utmost weakness and confusion all those and they were not a few who were attached by connection of blood or interest to the nobles that had suffered or by religious prejudice to the jesuits who had been expelled could never be cordially relied upon by the crown and were probably as little inclined to any extraordinary efforts in favor of a government which their resentments must have represented to them as no better than a bloody tyranny  the bourbon confederacy had some ground to suppose that portugal in this situation would not have courage to withstand their menaces and much less ability for any long time to resist their efforts the spanish army overspread the frontiers of portugal the commerce of corn between the two kingdoms was prohibited and every thing threatened a sudden invasion in the midst of these hostile preparations  it was not easy to find very convincing arguments to induce portugal to adopt so extraordinary a change of system the united crowns in a memorial which was signed by the ambassadors of both insisted largely on the tyranny which great britain exerted upon all powers especially the maritime and upon portugal among the rest on the particular insult which had been offered to her jurisdiction by boscawens attack on de la clues squadron in a portuguese harbor on that affinity by which the two monarchs of spain and portugal are as closely connected by the ties of blood as all powers are by a common interest to oppose the ambitious designs of the english  whatever these arguments were deficient in reason was made up by a strong insinuation of force the memorial concluded with a declaration that as soon as his most faithful majesty had taken his resolution which they doubted not would prove favorable their army was ready to enter portugal and to garrison the principal ports of that kingdom in order to prevent the dangers to which they might be exposed from the attempts of the english  the two ministers added to this extraordinary memorial that they were ordered by their courts to demand a categorical answer in four days and that any delay beyond that time should be considered as a negative  the situation of portugal was at this time certainly worthy of compassion if contrary to her known interests contrary to her ancient connections and to the faith of treaties she should engage in this offensive alliance she must expect to see her territories and her colonies exposed to the formidable navies of england this however dangerous condescension was not to secure her by her own act she would have put herself bound hand and foot into the power of the bourbon alliance and having received foreign garrisons into all her places of strength would have reduced herself to the condition of a province to spain on the other hand if she adhered to her faith and attempted to maintain her independency an army of sixty thousand men was ready to enter her territories which contained no place of real strength and which had not twenty thousand troops and those ill armed and worse disciplined to defend it  in this emergency the firmness of the king of portugal was eminent and such as must deliver his name to posterity with the most distinguished advantage he resolved steadily to adhere to his ancient and natural alliance and to brave all dangers and difficulties that he might preserve his fidelity inviolable following that generous maxim of king john of france that if good faith were to be banished from all other parts of the world it ought to be found in the breast of sovereigns  his answer to this insulting proposition was humble and moderate but firm he observed that the ties which equally united him to great britain and the two crowns rendered him as proper a mediator to them all as they made it improper for him to declare himself an enemy to any of them that his alliance with england was ancient and therefore could give no offense at this conjuncture that it was purely defensive and therefore innocent in all its circumstances that the late sufferings of portugal disabled her in case she were willing from taking part in an offensive war into the calamities of which neither the love his faithful majesty bore to his subjects as a father nor the duty by which he was bound to them as a king could suffer him to plunge them finally he reminded the catholic king of his pacific dispositions by which on former occasions he had yielded so much to preserve peace between the two kingdoms  this reasonable and moderate answer drew on replies which more and more disclosed the true character and spirit of the bourbon confederacy they denied that the alliance with england was purely defensive or entirely innocent and for this unheard of reason that the defensive alliance is converted into an offensive one from the situation of the portuguese dominions and from the nature of the english power the english squadron said they cannot keep the sea in all seasons nor cruize on the principal coasts for cutting off the french and spanish navigation without the ports and the assistance of portugal that these islanders could not insult all maritime europe if all the riches of portugal did not pass into their hands that therefore portugal furnishes them with the means to make war and their alliance with the court of great britain is offensive  certainly the situation of a country was never before given as a reason however it might have served as a secret motive for declaring war against it nor was it before heard that the common advantages of trade derived from a neutral nation could be deemed an act of hostility these were rather insults than arguments and the whole proceedings of the united crowns were in the same strain they undertook to judge for portugal of the pretended yoke which was imposed upon her by england and which she could not herself discover to resent injuries for her for which she had received and accepted satisfaction and as if this had not been indignity sufficient they insultingly inform the king of portugal that he ought to be glad of the nececessity which they laid upon him to make use of his reason in order to take the road of his glory and the common interest this necessity was the immediate march of their army to take possession of his dominions  so extraordinary a treatment neither intimidated the king from the firmness of his resolution nor provoked him to change from the moderation of his language he maintained that the treaties of league and commerce which subsisted between portugal and great britain are such as the law of god of nature and of nations have always deemed innocent he entreated their most christian and catholic majestys to open their eyes to the crying injustice of pursuing against portugal the war kindled against great britain he desired them to consider that they were giving an example which would produce the destruction of mankind that there was an end of the public safety if neutral nations were to be attacked because they have defensive treaties with the belligerent powers that a maxim so destructive would occasion desolation in all europe the moment a war was kindled between any two states that therefore if their troops should enter his dominions he would in defense of his neutrality endeavor to repulse them with all his forces and those of his allies and he concluded with this magnanimous declaration that it would affect him less though reduced to the last extremity of which the great judge is the sole arbiter to let the last tile of his palace fall and to see his faithful subjects spill the last drop of their blood than to sacrifice together with the honor of his crown all that portugal holds most dear and to submit by such extraordinary means to become an unheard of example to all pacific powers who will no longer be able to enjoy the benefit of neutrality whenever a war shall be kindled between other powers with which the former are connected by defensive treaties when this final resolution was thus spiritedly declared passports were demanded for the ambassadors of the two crowns  we have dwelt some time upon this transaction we hope the reader will not think the narrative drawn into a blameable length the subject is interesting the procedure uncommon and the example alarming this war against portugal was the first fruit of the bourbon compact they showed very early to the world what it was to expect from the maturity of this league when they were so elevated by the superiority they imagined they had attained even in forming it that they thought themselves dispensed from those decorums and plausible appearances which the most ambitious princes commonly make use of in the execution of their most ambitious designs if they had invaded portugal without any declaration at all it might perhaps be considered as a piece of convenient injustice which they left to the previous necessity and subsequent success of their affairs to justify as they could but so many memorials and reasonings on the subject show that this oppression was deliberate and that they had not been driven to it by a sudden emergency but that it became a regular and avowed part of their political system  having laid open the manner in which the southern part of europe so surprisingly became engaged in this war it is now our business to relate in what manner some of the northern parts were as surprisingly extricated out of it  chap iii death of the empress elizabeth of russia her character state of the power of russia on her decease her nephew peter iii succeeds entire change of system peace with prussia peace between prussia and sweden prussian conquests restored the czar enters into an alliance with the king of prussia war with denmark threatened its cause extorted loan from hamburgh campaign between prussians and austrians opens prussians obtain advantages in saxony and silesia sudden revolution in russia  we have seen in the close of the last year that by the taking of colberg on one hand and schweidnitz on the other the king of prussias dominions were entirely at the mercy of his enemies his forces were worn away and even his efforts had gradually declined a complete victory though this was an event not at all probable could not save him the russians by wintering in pomerania and by the possession of colberg which insured them supplies by a safe and expeditious channel were in a condition to commence their operations much earlier than usual as well as to sustain them with more spirit and uniformity no resource of policy could be tried with the least expectation of success after such a resistance for five years of which the world never furnished another example the king of prussia had nothing left but such a conduct as might close the scene with glory since there was so little appearance of his concluding the war with safety  in the midst of these gloomy appearances his inveterate and inflexible enemy the empress of russia died in the sixtythird year of her age  this princess was second daughter to peter the great and a descendant not altogether unworthy of that illustrious founder of the russian empire from being little better than a prisoner she became in a moment a despotic sovereign at the accession of this princess the russian power so newly created seemed to be in danger of a decline from the many revolutions to which the empire had been subject and the institutions of peter the great by which that extensive part of the world was drawn out of barbarism began perceivably to decay until her accession to the throne when the former was put out of all question by the vigor of her government and the latter cherished and promoted by the encouragement which she gave to every valuable art and science the academy at petersburgh is at present one of the most flourishing in europe and has already enriched the learned world with considerable discoveries  in fact she governed the russian empire with more lenity than any of her predecessors and perhaps carried this amiable disposition to an impolitic access she regulated and increased her finances kept alive and even increased the discipline of her armies and in all her transactions with foreign states and in the various faces which her politics assumed she always supported the dignity and importance of her country at the highest point for her private pleasures indeed she has been much censured but as they were merely pleasures and of such a nature that sentiment had little share in them they had little influence on her public conduct which was always manly and firm  the part she took in this war though it might in some measure have been dictated by resentment was at the fame time the result of the soundest policy no power but that of the king of prussia was capable of checking hers he was not only from his strength and character but from the situation of his dominions the only prince in europe from whom it could be materially her interest to make conquests by the retention of prussia and by the dominion which in another name she held over the duchy of courland she possessed a very great share of the baltic coast and thereby possessed the means of becoming a maritime power of the first order with these advantages she might easily complete all that had been wanting toward establishing an uncontrollable power over poland by the same means she might entirely overawe denmark and sweden and also by her vicinity she would be enabled to interpose in the concerns of germany with much more authority than she had hitherto possessed although her intervention had always been of consequence  in reality the house of austria seemed to make far greater sacrifices of her interest to her resentment than russia did with whom those two principals went hand in hand and supported each other for nothing is more evident than that russia would set up for a defender of the liberties of germany if ever she got any footing in its neighborhood that she would animate the powers there to assert a greater degree of independence than they do at present that she would render by her machinations the empire in the austrian family very precarious and might even find means of setting some feeble prince on the imperial throne in order to embroil the whole germanic body and to keep it in entire dependence upon russia on the whole if the projects of austria had succeeded in their full extent she would have very soon found in russia a more powerful restraint than ever she had either in france or sweden even in the greatest heights of their power and credit in germany she would indeed have ruined the king of prussia but she would have purchased his ruin with her own independency  these were the prospects that lay before all political reasoners at the time of the death of the empress elizabeth charles peter ulric of the house of holstein who had been created grand duke of russia and appointed heir apparent to that vast empire by the late czarina succeeded under the name of peter iii none but those who were intimately acquainted with the character and disposition of the new czar could have any reason to imagine that he would abandon the system of his predecessor which was certainly founded on the true interest of the country he governed the king of prussia himself seemed for some time to have entertained no great hopes from this change the czar had however sometimes discovered marks of esteem for the character of this monarch he had the black eagle of which order the king of prussia is grand master but the king of prussia could place very little confidence in this however with that air of pleasantry which never entirely forsook him in all his misfortunes he said in a letter to mr mitchel the british minister at the russian court is not this a very extraordinary knight to feed  0000 men at my expense he is the only one of my knights that takes that liberty if every knight of the garter did the same your england england though it is would be devoured by them i beg you would endeavor to make my knight more tractable and tell him it is against the institutes of the order for a knight to eat up his grand master  the eyes of all europe were now fixed upon the steps which the czar might take with regard to the government of his country nothing could be more popular and auspicious than his first measures the earliest use he made of his absolute power was to set the russian nobility and gentry free and to put them on the same footing with those of their rank in the other more moderate governments of europe almost all the exiles were recalled to court and amongst the rest the unfortunate count biron who from a sovereign prince had been reduced to the most wretched condition in the most wretched country on the globe he had been many years a peasant of siberia and may very probably once more become a sovereign prince it is in those despotic governments we see the most striking excesses and dismal reverses of fortune in which one day a person is raised to something almost above man and the next is perhaps in a moment degraded to the lowest station of humanity  the new emperor proceeded in his reformation to abolish some severe and tyrannical jurisdictions and intending the same benign disposition to all degrees of his subjects he lessened the tax upon salt to the very great and universal relief of the poor  these beginnings gave the most favorable impressions of his domestic government but europe was principally concerned in his foreign politics it was not long before his dispositions to peace became apparent what astonished the world was the high rate at which he valued this blessing in a memorial which he caused to be delivered on the   d of february to the ministers of the allied courts he declared that in order to the establishment of peace he was ready to sacrifice all the conquests made by the arms of russia in this war in hopes that the allied courts will on their parts equally prefer the restoration of peace and tranquillity to the advantages which they might expect from the continuance of the war but which they cannot obtain but by a continuance of the effusion of human blood  the allies praised the disinterestedness spirit and humanity of this declaration but recommended to his attention the fidelity to treaties which constitutes a no less valuable part of the royal character and a no less considerable branch of the duty of a monarch to his subjects they showed a disposition to imitate his desire for peace but by no means to follow his example in purchasing it by a cession of all the advantages which they had acquired or hoped to acquire by the war  the czar having thus far complied with decency and being of a character little fitted to wait the slow procedure of a joint negotiation gave way to his ardent desires for peace and to the sentiments of that extravagant admiration which he had conceived for the king of prussia a suspension of hostilities was concluded between them on the   th of march and it was followed not long after by a treaty of peace and alliance  this was a miraculous revolution fortune who had so long abandoned the king of prussia to his genuis after having persecuted him for near five years and overpowered him with the whole weight of her anger at length made amends by a sudden turn and did for him at one stroke the only thing by which he could possibly be saved  sweden who since she has recovered her liberty has lost her political importance and for a long time acted entirely under the direction of russian councils followed on this as on all other occasions the example of the courts of petersburgh and signed a treaty of peace with the king of prussia on the   d of may  in order to account for whatever was not the result of mere personal character in this extraordinary revolution of politics in russia it will be necessary to remind the reader that the czar peter the third was duke of holstein and that the dukes of holstein had pretensions to the duchy of sleswick these pretensions were compromised by a treaty in      but as the cession made by the house of holstein in this treaty was the effect of necessity it had been always apprehended that she would make use of the first safe opportunity of reclaiming her ancient rights the czar seized eagerly on the great one which the possession of the whole russian power afforded him and he resolved to enter into an immediate war for this object to which his predilection for his native country gave in his eyes a far greater importance than to all the conquests of his predecessor as long as this war with the king of prussia subsisted it was impossible that his designs against denmark could be prosecuted with any hope of success wholly indifferent therefore to all others and passionately fond of this object as soon as he came to the throne without any dispute or negotiation he offered the king of prussia in his great distress every thing he could have hoped from a series of victories and whilst he joined his arms to those of that monarch in silesia he caused an army to march toward holstein  thus the peace with russia far from conducing to the general peace of europe did very little more than change the face of the war it brought in new subjects of dispute and new parties and by threatening denmark left not a single power in the north in a state of assured tranquillity  the king of denmark though threatened by so formidable a power engaged in pursuit of a favorite object was not terrified into any mean concessions he recruited his army repaired his fortifications and prepared for his defense with temper and magnanimty as money must be much wanting for the services of so important a war as his country could furnish no great supplies and the borrowings in every part of europe together with the sudden invasion of his dominions could enable him to form no sanguine hopes of public credit he turned his eyes toward the city of hamburgh which had enriched itself by its industry and neutrality during the whole war and by the number of wealthy persons who had fled there for refuge from the calamities which all the neighboring countries had suffered  his danish majesty had always kept alive a claim of sovereignty over that city which whoever founded he exercised whenever he found himself able he thought the present one of those conjunctures therefore without any previous notice he appears with a strong army before hamburg immediately submit to a loan of  000000 of rix dollars the magistrates of this trading city little prepared for or accustomed to war having no ally at hand and who would be equally endangered by the strength of any ally able to protect them prudently submitted and furnished the king with such a supply as his affairs required  the king of prussia lost no time to profit of this great and unexpected revolution in his favor the neutrality of the russians still left the austrians much superior to him their alliance brought him to an equality two austrian armies in silesia and one in saxony were prepared to act and it was not clear which side would begin to act on the offensive the austrian armies threatened glogau and breslaw with a siege and the king of prussias threatened schweidnitz  the active character of the king of prussia and the caution of marshal daun soon determined the part which the several armies were to take and the spirit of the several operations  by this signal advantage all the part of saxony possessed by the prussians was effectually secured and any attempt which might hereafter be thought proper for the recovery of dresden was much facilitated although the austrians sensible of the consequence of this loss and largely reinforceed from the armies in silesia attempted to recover these posts by several lively efforts they were repulsed with no small slaughter on both sides and prince henry remained so much master of saxony that it was necessary to keep a large army from the war in silesia to prevent if possible his making irruptions into the very heart of bohemia  his prussian majesty derived advantages from the conduct of his brother which he did not neglect to improve it was not until the latter end of june that he was joined by his new russian allies as soon as this junction was formed he resolved to make a trial of what these men could do in his favor who had acted so strenuously against him marshal dauns army occupied several strong but detached eminences which enabled him to communicate with and protect schweidnitz from all attempts of the enemy the king of prussia undertook to dislodge  this was no regular battle but the king of prussia though he did not succeed immediately in his attack yet by his judicious maneuvers he attained all the advantages he proposed from his enterprise for marshal daun apprehensive from the motions of his army that the king of prussia intended to seize upon his principal magazine and even cut off his communication with bohemia abandoned those important posts which he had hitherto maintained with success fell back to the extremities of silesia and left schweidnitz entirely uncovered  the king of prussia immediately prepared to invest that city whilst different detachments of prussians some on the side of saxony others on the side of silesia penetrated deep into bohemia laid many parts of the country under contribution and spread an universal alarm it was about five years since they had been driven from thence by the victorious arms of marshal daun who now found himself unable to protect that kingdom from their ravages a considerable body of russian irregulars also made an irruption into bohemia and began there to retaliate on the austrians those excesses which they had themselves so often before committed on the prussian dominions  whilst the king of prussia was thus playing with spirit the great game which fortune had put into his hands he was all at once threatened with a sudden reverse by another revolution in russia which bore all the appearance of being as unfavourable to him as the former had been beyond all hopes beneficial the variable political climate of russia under whose influence all his fortune decayed or flourished was covered with a sudden cloud by the deposition followed close by the death of his fast friend and faithful ally the czar of muscovy  chap iv causes of the revolution in russia czar irritates the clergy and soldiery differences with the czarina conspiracy against him czar deposed by the senate attempts an escape his imprisonment and death the czarina declared empress her politic conduct ingratiates herself with the people  from the moment of the late czars accession to the throne of the russias something extraordinary was expected his disposition seemed to lead him to make alterations in every thing and having set before himself two great examples that of the king of prussia and of his predecessor peter i it was expected that this vast empire was going once more almost within the life of a man to assume a new face a circumstance which could not fail of having a serious influence on the affairs of europe peter iii made more new regulations in russia in a few weeks than wise and cautious princes undertake in a long reign it was to be feared that his actions were rather guided by a rash and irregular turn of mind and the spirit of innovation than by any regular and well digested plan for the improvement of his extensive dominions  his first actions on coming to the throne it is true were laudable and seemed well calculated to acquire him the affections of his people but if in some instances he consulted their interests in many he shocked their prejudices and he lost thereby that opinion which is on all occasions necessary but is particularly so for carrying such uncommon designs as his into execution  the power of the czars though absolute and uncontrollable in its exercise is extremely weak in its foundation there is not perhaps in europe a government which depends so much on the good will and affection of those that are governed and which requires a greater degree of vigilance and a steadier hand the regular succession which has been so often broken and the great change of manners which in less than a century has been introduced have left in russia a weakness amidst all the appearance of strength and a great facility to sudden and dangerous revolutions  peter iii paid little attention to those difficulties which to him were the greater as he was a foreigner born they were augmented by the superior and invidious regard he seemed to pay to foreign interests and foreign persons the preference he so manifestly gave to the uncertain hope of inconsiderable conquest in holstein over the solid and valuable possessions which the fortune of his predecessor had left him must have disgusted all the politicians of his country his intimate connection with and boundless admiration of that prince with whom russia had been so lately and so long in a state of the most violent hostility could not add to the opinion of his prudence they did not think he sufficiently consulted his dignity in soliciting with great anxiety a command in the prussian service when he received it he dressed himself in the prussian uniform made a grand festival and displayed all the marks of an immoderate and puerile satisfaction he pushed his extravagance in this point so far that he made preparations in this immature state of his government to quit russia and to go into germany for the sake of an interview with that great monarch whose genius principles and fortune he so greatly admired  although this proceeding was almost in every respect extremely impolitic it did not threaten so dangerous consequences as the other steps which he took about the same time nothing requires so much judgment and so nice a hand as to effect a change in the settled establishments of any country above all there must be something favorable in the conjuncture or something so uncommon and overruling in the genius of the conductor of those changes as will render him superior to all difficulties this latter was the case of peter i who had indeed very little favorable in the conjuncture but he did every thing by his capacity courage and perseverance the soldiery and the ecclesiastics are the great supports of all absolute rule and they are certainly the last bodies upon which a prince of this kind would choose to exert any invidious act of authority but the czar was indiscreet enough very early in his reign highly to provoke both these bodies the soldiery by the manifest preference he gave to his holstein guards and to all officers of that nation and by the change he made in favor of the prussian uniform to the exclusion of that in which the russians believed they had so often asserted the honor of their country and gained many signal advantages over the troops distinguished by those regimentals which were now preferred  these trifles had very important consequences but what he did in matters of religion was still more dangerous this prince had been educated a luthern and though he conformed to the greek church in order to qualify himself for the succession he never showed much respect to that mode of religion to the rites and doctrines of which his subjects had been always extremely attached he seized upon the revenues of the clergy whether monks or seculars whether bishops or inferiors and for compensation allowed them some mean pensions in such a proportion as his fancy suggested his capricious order that the clergy should be no longer distinguished by beards was in itself of less moment but it was hardly less offensive he made also some regulations concerning the images and pictures in their churches which gave them reason to apprehend his intention of accomplishing a total change in the religion of the empire and introducing lutheranism  whilst he was taking these measures to alienate the minds of his people in general and especially of those bodies with whom it was the most his interest to be well he had not the good fortune to live in union with his own family he had long slighted his consort a princess of the house of anhalt zerbst a woman of a masculine understanding and by whose councils he might have profited he lived in a very public manner with the countess of woronzoff niece to the chancellor of that name and seemed devoted to her with so strong a passion that it was apprehended he had some thoughts of throwing his empress into a monastery and raising this lady to the throne of all the russias what seemed to confirm this opinion was his omitting formally to declare his son the grand duke paul petrowitz the successor this omission in a country where the succession is established and regular would have been of no consequence the punctual observance of such a ceremony would rather have betrayed some doubt of the title but the nature of this government as well as possitive constitutions had made it necessary in russia and the omission was certainly alarming  that unfortunate prince having in this manner affronted his army irritated his clergy offended his nobility and alienated his own family without having left himself any firm ground of authority in personal esteem or national prejudice proceeded with his usual precipitation to new changes in the mean time a most dangerous conspiracy was forming against him the cruel punishments inflicted in russia on state criminals have only an effect to harden the minds

grand duke paul marshal butterlin the chamberlain teplow the attorney general glebow baron orlow major of the guards and many others of the great officers and first nobility of the empire engaged in a conspiracy to dethrone the czar who was now universally hated and what was more fatal to him universally despised  they assured themselves that their actions could not be disagreeable to the empress whose conduct had always been the very reverse of that of her consort this princess finding that the affections of her husband were irrecoverably alienated endeavored to set up a separate and independent interest in her own favor and for asserting the rights of her son she therefore assiduously cultivated the affections of the russian nation and paid a respect to their manners and religion in the same degree that her husband seemed to cotemn them  so ill was the czar served that this conspiracy was grown general without his receiving the least notice of it and he remained in perfect security whilst the senate and the clergy were assembled to pass the sentence of his disposition  this prince was indulging himself in indolent amusements and lulled in the most profound security at a house of pleasure called oraniebaum on the sea shore when a soldier brought him an account that his kingdom was taken away from him  astonished and wholly unprepared for this event he was some time senseless and entirely at a loss what part to take when he was rouzed from this trance by the approaching danger his first suggestion was to defend the place with his holstein guards but though satisfied of their attachment he doubted their strength and he knew it was in vain to hope for any effort in his favor from the russians  nothing then remained but flight by which he might escape to holstein and wait some favorable turn of fortune this late lord of powerful fleets and armies embarked in a small vessel and with a few attendants rowed toward cronstadt but he had not proceeded very far when he was informed that this fortress was in the hands of his enemies and that every avenue for escape was shut against him dejected and desponding he returned to oraniebaum after some short and tumultuous deliberation he resolved to abandon all thoughts of defense and to throw himself on the compassion of the empress  on her march she met his messengers who brought letters containing a renunciation of the empire and stipulating no other terms than leave to return to holstein and the satisfaction of taking with him as the companion of his retreat the countess of woronzoff and one single friend  reasons of state could not permit the empress to consent to the first of those terms and the last could not be very flattering to her his terms were rejected and he was required to sign an unconditional resignation of his crown according to a form that was prepared for him not satisfied with depriving him of his crown it was thought fit to make him the murderer of his own reputation and this unfortunate prince moved with the vain hope of life signed a paper declaring his conviction of his inability to govern the empire either as a sovereign or in any other capacity and his sense of the distress in which his continuing at the head of affairs would inevitably involve it after he had signed this abdication he gave up his sword and was conducted to prison where in a short time  thus was a revolution of such immense importance effected in a single day and without shedding a single drop of blood the unfortunate emperor enjoyed the power of which he had made so imprudent and unpolitic an use no longer than six months his wife without any hereditary title is sovereign mistress of the russian empire and the most absolute power on earth is now held by an elective monarch  immediately on this revolution a number of manifestoes appeared in which the conduct of the late czar was severely condemned the weakness of his personal character exposed and designs of the blackest kind even that of murdering his consort attributed to him those manifestoes at the same time were filled with the strongest declarations of affection from the empress to the subjects of russia of regard to their interests and of attachment to their religion and they are all filled with such unaffected and fervent strains of piety as must needs prove extremely edifying to those who are acquainted with the sentiments of pure religion by which great princes are generally animated on occasions of this nature  nothing could be more able than the conduct of the empress since her accession to the throne in almost all respects it was the very reverse of that of her husband she dismissed all foreigners from her confidence and service she sent away the holstein guards and chose russian whose ancient uniform was revived with luster the empress herself frequently condescending to appear in it the clergy were restored to their possessions and their beards she conferred all the great posts of the empire on native russians and entirely threw herself on the affections of that people to whom she owed her elevation  chap v effect of the revolution in russia on the king of

hambourgh prince xavier of saxony defeated gottingen evacuated french army called from the lower rhine  this great change in the government of russia it was universally feared would be followed by a total change of system with regard to foreign affairs the peace and alliance with the king of prussia were very unpopular measures in muscovy it was not probable that the close and intimate connection which had subsisted between the king of prussia and the late czar could greatly recommend him to the successor and as it was imagined that this revolution must have been in a great degree owing to the machinations of those courts whom the czar had irritated by withdrawing from their alliance there was the greater reason to apprehend that the power which was now set up would be exerted in their favor  there were also great advantages on the side of russia if the empress should not hold the peace concluded by her late husband to be binding on her as none of the conquests were at this time evacuated every thing seemed to conspire toward plunging the king of prussia into the abyss of his former distresses after he had emerged from them only for such a time and in such a manner as to make them more bitter and insupportable  fortunately however for this wonderful man the empress who had come to the russian throne in the extraordinary manner that we have seen could not look upon herself as sufficiently secure to undertake again a war of so much importance as that which had been just concluded it was necessary for some time at least that she should confine her attention solely to her own safety therefore it was expedient to collect within itself all the force of the empire in order to oppose it to the designs of the many malcontents with which that empire always abounds and who though not attached to the interest of the late czar and little inclined to revenge his fate would find now both inducement and opportunity for raising troubles and attempting new changes very plausible pretenses for such attempts existed from the time of peter the great who whilst he improved and strengthened his kingdom left in it at the same time the seeds of civil wars and revolutions  these considerations whatever her desires might be induced the czarina to continue so much of the system of her predecessor as coincided with her situation she therefore declared to the king of prussias ministers that she was resolved to observe inviolably in all points the perpetual peace concluded under the preceding reign that nevertheless she had thought proper to bring back to russia by the nearest roads all her troops in silesia prussia and pomerania  it was not the critical situation alone of the czarina which produced this moderation the prudent behavior of his prussian majesty during the time of his connection with the late czar had a considerable share in reconciling the mind of this empress to him and of perpetuating something like the same friendship with interests so very different the russian senate flaming with resentment against this monarch and against their late sovereign and the empress full of suspicion that the conduct of the latter might have been influenced by the councils of the former searched eagerly amongst the papers of the late emperor for elucidation or proofs of this point they found indeed many letters from the king of prussia but in a strain absolutely different from what they apprehended the king of prussia had as far as prudence would admit kept a reserve and distance in regard to the rash advances of this unhappy ally too experienced to be carried away by his inconsiderate impetuosity he gave him much salutary though fruitless advice he counseled him to undertake nothing against the empress his consort to desist from the war with denmark to attempt no changes in the religion and fundamental laws of the country and not to think of coming into germany  on hearing these letters read the empress is said to have burst into tears of gratitude and made in consequence the strongest declarations in favor of this prince they were not without effect orders had been given with relation to prussia which threatened a renewal of hostilities they were soon suspended the army of the russians was indeed separated from that of prussia but all the important places which the russians had with so much bloodshed and through so many difficulties acquired and which gave them the command of every thing else that remained to the king were faithfully restored  this change from a strict alliance to a cold neutrality though it made no small difference in the prussian affairs yet all things considered must be regarded as an escape and as a deliverance almost as wonderful as his former however this circumstance could not fail of inspiring some degree of confidence into his enemies which the king of prussia endeavored above all things to prevent  on the   st of july the orders arrived at the allied camp from petersburg for the russians to separate themselves from his army and return without delay to their own country the king without being confounded by this sudden order and instead of slackening his efforts on account of this desertion resolved to fall with vigor and without delay upon marshal daun and to attack him before the news of this change could reach him since he could no longer profit by the arms of the russians he endeavored to profit at least by their appearance in his camp the very next day therefore he attacked the austrian army whose right wing occupied the heights of buckersdorff drove them from that eminence and from some villages where they were advantageously posted the success was not owing only to the spirit of the actual attack but to an apprehension of the austrians that the whole united army of the prussians and muscovites was on the point of engaging them the king of prussia made an use of those allies in the moment they deserted him  this lively attack was made with a loss only of three hundred men on the side of the prussians the number of the austrians killed is not known the prisoners amounted to one thousand and fourteen pieces of cannon were taken it was indeed no more than an affair of posts but its consequences were important for the communication of the imperialists with schweidnitz was now entirely and finally cut off they could not attempt any thing considerable for the relief of that place prince henry held them in continual alarm for bohemia and a great part of their attention and no small part of their forces were kept continually engaged upon that ide  the king of prussia having thus pushed back marshal daun invested schweidnitz and laid siege to that important fortress before his face this was the fourth time which that place had been besieged since the beginning of this war and this circumstance alone might suffice to show the many and extraordinary changes of fortune which distinguished these campaigns we apprehend no instance has happened before of any place like this of real strength being so often successively taken and retaken in the course of a single war  as schweidnitz is the key of silesia and though not quite a regular place is notwithstanding well situated and well fortified as the garrison amounted to nine thousand men commanded by a good officer and assisted by a very experienced engineer and as two great armies of the enemy observed all his motions it was necessary to make the dispositions for the siege with uncommon care his infantry were encamped on the heights behind schweidnitz his cavalry formed a chain in the plains of keintzerdorf to be nearer the camp of the prince of wirtemberg which was situated so as to prevent any enterprise from the county of glatz the prince of bevern commanded a strong corpse which posted itself advantageously near cosel one under general werner did the same at noissa  by these dispositions the prussian convoys were protected the principal places in silesia guarded the siege of schweidnitz covered and an easy communication preserved between all the detached corpse employed in these several services  the effects of this wise disposition were soon felt marshal daun despairing to succeed against the army which under the king in person covered the siege of schweidnitz endeavored to break this chain and by that means distress the prussians who were carrying on the siege laudohn was therefore detached with a very superior force to attack the prince of bevern and to drive him from the advantageous post he occupied this attack was made with all the celerity and resolution which distinguish the operations of this brave officer but the prince mindful of the disgrace he had formerly suffered in this province opposed him with such constancy and perseverance that the king of prussia had time to come to his relief the austrians were then put between two fires routed and pursued with a terrible slaughter  this attempt being defeated the king of prussia met with no disturbance in his preparations for the siege and the trenches were opened on the night of the  th of july  whilst the king of prussia was making this advantageous use of his fortune the armies of the french and the allies in westphalia were not inactive among the commanders of the former a great disunion had long prevailed the marshals de broglio and de soubise had mutually accused each other the camp and the court were for some time entirely distracted with the cabals of the partisans of these officers the result was not favorable to marshal broglio in him the french court was obliged to recall and in some measure to disgrace one of the very best of their officers a suspicion and that not weakly founded prevailed against this general that unable to bear a competitor in fame or an associate in command he had often in order to disgrace those with whom he was to act neglected to improve his favorable opportunities and that in some instances by his conduct he had purposely occasioned some failures and even defeats this was a fault which no great qualities in an officer could compensate he was therefore removed from his command and the conduct of the army left to the prince de soubise who was infinitely beloved by the soldiers for his generous and benevolent disposition and marshal detrees who has been so often mentioned in the course of this history was associated with him  the plan of the campaign on the part of the french did not differ much from that which had been formerly pursued they had as before two armies this under the prince de soubise and marshal detrees on the weser and another under the prince de conde on the lower rhine  the disposition of the allies was also but little varied the hereditary prince was posted in the bishopric of munster to watch the latter of these armies and prince ferdinand in person with the body of the army lay behind the dymel to make head against the former so little had the french profited by their superior numbers and superior resources in this continental war and so little decisive use had they made even of some advantages in the field that this campaign commenced very nearly in the same place and they contended for pretty much the same objects which they had struggled for in the two preceding years  so superior was the genius of prince ferdinand that under many disadvantages he was the first to commence offensive operations the stroke he struck on this occasion would suffice alone to rank him with the first commanders of his age his abilities throughout the war have never shone out with more luster than in this campaign which concluded it  the french army was most advantageously posted both for command of the country and for strength near a place called graebenstein in the frontiers of hesse their center occupied an advantageous eminence their left wing was almost inaccessible by several deep ravines and their right was covered by the village of graebenstein by several rivulets and a strong detached body under one of their best officers monsieur de castries  in this situation they imagined they had nothing to fear from the attempts of prince ferdinand whose army besides the inferiority of its numbers was separated in such a manner and in such distant places that they judged it impossible it could unite in any attack upon their camp but whilst they enjoyed themselves in full security the storm was preparing to fall upon them from all quarters  a considerable corpse of the allied army under general luckner was posted to the eastward of the weser near embecke on the leine he lay there to observe prince xavier of saxony who was encamped between the werra and gottingen but if he watched the prince the prince also watched him when therefore he had orders to quit this post that he might cooperate in the grand design he left a small party of his corpse in his station by which he deceived the prince of saxony and marching in the night with the utmost speed he crossed the weser turned the right of the french army and without being discovered placed himself upon their rear general sporcken at the same time placed himself so as to attack the same wing in flank prince ferdinand crossed the dymel in order to fall upon their center the attack on the enemys left was commanded by lord granby  these preparations were made with so much judgment celerity and good order that the french had not perceived the approach of the allies when they found themselves attacked with infinite impetuosity in front flank and rear  as the french placed all their hopes rather in retreat than combat an entire rout must have ensued if monsieur stainville who commanded on the left had not thrown himself with the flower of the french infantry into a wood which enabled him at the expense of the best part of it to cover the retreat of the army here this brave and accomplished officer made a resolute stand and for a long time sustained the whole weight of the allies his corpse was a devoted sacrifice all but two battalions were cut to pieces or made prisoners the other bodies covered by this resolute maneuver made a shift to cover themseles under the cannon of cassel or precipitately escaped to the other side of the fulda  thus did the french army by the virtue of monsieur de stainville escape a total defeat but the consequences of the action were not recovered during the whole campaign they lost much credit both in point of resolution and generalship their infantry in this engagement consisted of one hundred battalions when that of the allies was composed but of sixty the common men made prisoners by the allies on this occasion were two thousand seven hundred and fifty and no less than one hundred and sixtytwo officers were taken the english lost but a few men killed and no officer of rank but lieutenant colonel townshend this col townshend was second son to the hon thomas townshend esquire he had distinguished himself on several occasions guadaloupe he was pushed overboard in the landing of the troops but his black saved his life by jumping after him in the last campaign in germany he was shot through the arm and in this engagement he lost his life seeking the post of honor that his duty did not require  who fell with great glory to himself and to the regret of the whole army  every thing in the conduct of prince ferdinand appears the effect of a well digested plan and one great action completed always helps to disclose a series of bold masterly and connected designs  as soon as the enemy was disloged from their strong post use was made of this advantage whilst the french under the hurry and confusion of their late misfortunes were unable to provide against unexpected accidents to push forward a body of the english under lord granby and lord frederick cavendish the french could scarcely imagine that whilst they were in possession of so strong a place as cassel and commanded an army so superior in numbers to the allies that whilst prince ferdinand braved them in front they should find one of his detachments upwards of thirty miles behind them in this emergency monsieur de rochambeau perceiving their motions hastily collected some brigades of infantry and cavalry at hombourg  to the north of hesse also the allies were not less active nor less successful they obliged prince xavier with his saxon detachments to abandon his advanced post on the leine and unite himself to the grand army they got between him and gottingen by which the french garrison there was left without support this garrison seeing its communication interrupted blew up a part of the fortifications and attempted a retreat but finding no avenue open they were obliged to return in confusion despairing of their ability to hold this important place they thought themselves happy when at length with much management and difficulty  prince xavier after having as we said before quitted his advanced situation at morungen in the territories of hanover united himself to the right of the principal army which was posted to the eastward of the fulda not far from the place where that river forms an angle in its junction with the werra in this angle stands the town of munden a fortified place in which the french had a garrison full of confidence from this situation they were under no apprehension but the generals zastrow gilsac and waldhausen passed the fulda in their sight  the bold passage of the fulda and the judgment of the subsequent dispositions insured the victory prince xavier for a good while defended himself with an obstinate resolution but finding his flank gained he began to give way in this instant waldhausen who had hitherto only watched the issue of the engagement threw in his horse upon the rear and completed the defeat  general stainville who occupied a strong entrenched camp in the neighborhood seeing the party of the prince of saxony in danger of being totally cut to pieces quitted his intrenchments with his whole army of ten thousand men and hastened to their relief prince frederick of brunswick attentive to this movement with great quickness seized this critical opportunity entered their camp the moment they had left it and entirely destroyed all their works in this action   00 of the enemy were made prisoners  the french finding their communication destroyed their army surrounded and harrassed on every side and without intermission were neither able to advance with a prospect of success or to retreat with any hope of safety in this distress they had nothing left but to call their army from the lower rhine to their assistance no time was to be lost express after express was sent to hasten them in consequence of these dispatches the prince of conde advanced by forced marches the hereditary prince stuck close to him and kept himself in readiness to fall upon his corpse when a favorable opportunity should offer  in the mean time prince ferdinand pressed upon soubises army advantageously as they were situated he offered them battle for a whole day rather than risque an engagement they decamped in the night and quitted without an action those advantageous grounds called the heights of mulsingen where they could not be attempted without the greatest difficulty and hazard and the quitting of which gave prince ferdinand the most important advantages over them  never were military operations pushed with more vivacity whilst the negotiation for peace was in great forwardness the two great contending courts had opened conferences whilst their armies were cutting one another in pieces but prince ferdinand on that account rather strained than slackened his efforts he knew that the negotiation for peace is always much forwarded by the opperations of the campaign and that a successful action often hastens the decision of a contested article perhaps too he was willing to show in england that the necessity of making peace ought not to be attributed to the circumstances of that part of the war which had been committed to his care people imagined they could discern something like coldness toward this great commander in the new british ministry and that he on his side seemed rather to favor that party in england which was for prolonging the war  chap vi war in portugal plan of the campaign mirand

war in germany though its object was not more interesting than that in portugal seem to rank far before the actions of the latter in dignity and importance they naturally occupy the first place and justify a more minute detail in an history of military operations it is in germany that the great efforts of all the great powers in europe were made from the beginning here the most considerable armies were maintained here the great battles were fought and on this theater the great commanders gave a full scope to their genius germany seems as it were the natural soil of hostility but portugal which had long languished in a tranquil obscurity could scarce furnish out a faint image of war  of the state of the military in that country we have spoken in a preceding chapter the marine was not on a much more respectable footing about six or seven ships of the line and a very few frigates composed all the naval force of portugal that was fit for service of that portugal which had formerly been one of the first maritime powers in europe the fortifications in that kingdom had been also long neglected and scarce any of them were in a condition to sustain a regular siege  portugal however possessed some advantages but they were only such as she derived from her weakness the extreme barrenness and poverty of the country made it very difficult for an army either of friends or enemies to subsist in it the badness of the roads and the frequency and steepness of the mountains which occupy the greatest part of that kingdom made it no less difficult to advance with rapid marches and to improve the advantages of the campaign with proper expedition the nature of the country also rendered it not unfit for that species of defense which the best force it had was best qualified to make that is in the way of an irregular war by its armed peasantry for the defiles in many places are of such a nature as to be capable of being maintained by a small and undisciplined body against very numerous and very regular forces and the portuguese from the highest to the lowest were animated with such a sincere and inveterate hatred to the spanish name and were filled with so much terror at the prospect of falling a second time under the government of that nation that great hopes were entertained of their exerting themselves to the utmost on this occasion and of their rousing that natural courage in which the portuguese are not deficient  these advantages however did by no means balance the dangers to which that kingdom was exposed from the joint hostility of france and spain all the hope of portugal was centered in england for whose sake and in whose quarrel she had been drawn into this unequal contest the greater the weakness of portugal was the more conspicuous were the magnanimity and resources of great britain who made in the close of so expensive and ruinous a war such astonishing efforts and who was in a condition by her strength to prop up at least for a time so very feeble a system she sent to portugal officers troops artillery arms military stores provisions and money every thing which could enable the portuguese to exert their natural strength and every thing which could supply that strength where it was deficient  when the bourbon courts made war against portugal the declared object was to prevent great britain from the military and commercial use of the ports of that kingdom as it was impossible to attain this object by naval operations they attempted it by military ones and aimed their principal endeavors at the two great ports to which the english principally resort oporto and lisbon the possession of these two objects would probably have finished the war in their favor the possession of either of them would have given them the most decisive advantages in it  with this view three inroads were to be made one to the north another was proposed more to the south whilst the third was made in the middle provinces in order to sustain these two bodies and preserve the communication between them the reader must consider this as what appears from their designs and from the steps they took to execute them to have been their general plan not that it was ever perfectly executed in all its parts or at the same time  the first body which commenced hostilities was commanded by the marquis de sarria this army entered into the north east angle of portugal and marched toward miranda this town though in no good state of defense might have delayed them in their progress but a powder magazine having blown up by accident the fortifications were ruined and the spaniards before they had raised their first battery  animated by this easy and fortunate success they proceeded to braganza a considerable city from whence the royal family of portugal derived its ducal titles this town made no greater defense than miranda from thence a detachment marched to moncorvo every thing was cleared before them to the banks of the douro a party under count oreilly made a forced march of fourteen leagues in two days  the second body of the spaniards which we have mentioned as the connective link between the two others entered into the province of beira at the villages called val de mula and valde coelha they were joined by strong detachments amounting to almost the whole army in tralos montes and immediately laid siege to almeida which though in no good order was the strongest and best provided place upon the frontiers of portugal besides it was of the greatest importance from its middle situation as the possession of it would greatly facilitate the operations upon every side and would especially tend to forward an attempt upon lisbon which was the capital object toward which at this time all the endeavors of the spaniards seem to have been directed  almedia was defended with sufficient resolution but its fate was foreseen as soon as it was attempted there being no means of affording relief to any of the places besieged it surrendered however  the spaniards having made themselves masters of this place overspread the whole teriority of castle branco a principal district of the province of beira making their way to the southward until they approached the banks of the tagus during the whole of their progress and indeed during the whole campaign the allied troops of great britain and portugal had nothing that could be called a body of an army in the field and they could not think of opposing the enemy in a pitched battle all that could be done was by the defense of passes by skirmish and by surprise  by this time the count of la lip buckeburg had arrived in portugal lord tyrawly who had been sent at the desire of the court of lisbon thither before the breaking out of the war being disgusted by the behavior of some persons at court and much disappointed in his expectations of the exertion they had promised to make of their own force and even of the use they had made of the succors from england had been recalled very early in the campaign and probably not contrary to his own inclination  it is impossible to express the joy which filled the whole nation at the arrival of so celebrated an officer as the count la lip to their assistance more unanimity was now expected as the count had nothing to complain of and came an entire stranger to all the subjects of debate which had hitherto existed between the british general and the court of lisbon  that army which we have mentioned as the third corpse destined for the invasion of portugal assembled on the frontiers of estremadura with an intention of penetrating into the province of alentejo had this third body been joined to the others already in portugal it would probably have formed such an army as might in spite of any obstruction have forced its way to lisbon had it acted separately it might have greatly distracted the defense so as to enable some other body to penetrate to that city it was necessary to prevent if possible their entrance into portugal since their mere entrance would have been almost equal in its consequences to a victory on their side  the count la lip therefore formed a design of attacking an advanced body of the spaniards which lay on their frontiers in a town called valentia de alcantara as he heard that they had here amassed considerable magazines the conduct of this important enterprise was committed to brigadier general burgoyne  this gallant and able officer though at a distance of five days march and in spite of all the disappointments and obstructions to which services of this kind are so liable when they cannot be executed immediately yet effected a complete surprise on the town of valentia de alcantara took the general  although they were disappointed in their expectations of finding magagines in this place the effect of this wellconducted enterprise was not lost the taking of this general was probably the cause which prevented the spaniards from entering into the province of alentejo this seemed to have been for some time the destination not only of that particular body but also the great object of the spanish army which had hitherto acted in beira the former of these provinces is a plain open fertile country where their cavalry in which consisted the chief of their army and in which lay their most marked superiority might have acted and acted decisively whereas the latter was a rough mountainous region in which the horse were subsisted with difficulty and could be of little service to prevent therefore the entry of the bourbon army from any quarter into alentejo seemed to be the great and single object of the campaign on our side general burgoyne by his expedition into the spanish territories had already prevented it on one part and the vigilance and activity of the same officer had no small share in preventing it also on the other  that part of the bourbon army which acted in the territory of castle branco had made themselves masters of several important passes which they obliged some bodies of the portuguese to abandon they attacked the rear of the combined army which was passing the river alveito with the appearance of a retreat but in reality with a view to draw them insensibly into the mountainous tracts here they were repulsed with loss but still they continued masters of the country and nothing remained but the passage of the tagus to enable them to take up their quarters in alentejo  burgoyne who was posted with an intention to obstruct them in their passage lay in the neighborhood and within view of a detached camp composed of a considerable body of the enemys cavalry which lay near a village called villa velha as he observed that the enemy kept no very soldiery guard in this post and were uncovered both on their rear and their flanks he conceived a design of faling on them by surprise he confided the execution of this design to colonel lee who turned their camp fell upon their rear in the night  this advantage being obtained in a critical moment was attended with important consequences the season was now far advanced immense rains fell at this time the roads were destroyed the country became impracticable and the spaniards having seized no advanced posts in which they could maintain themselves during the winter and being especially unprovided with magazines for the support of their horse every where fell back to the frontiers of spain where their supplies were at hand and where they were not liable to be harrassed by the efforts of the combined army  in this manner portugal was saved at least for that campaign by the wise conduct of count la lip and the distinguished valor of the english commanders and soldiery all that was wanting toward their deliverance was accomplished by the success of the english army in more distant quarters and by the peace in which so valuable and so exposed an ally was not neglected there never was probably so heavy a storm of national calamity ready to fall upon an unprovided people so happily averted or so speedily blown over every thing at the beginning of this campaign bore the most louring and ominous aspect to the affairs of great britain as it advanced the sky continually cleared up and the fortune of no nation toward the close of it was enlivened with a more brilliant and more unclouded prosperity we shall now proceed in the relation of those successes and of the progress of the english arms in other parts of the world where new scenes of danger and honor were now opened to them  chap vii expedition against martinico forces sent thither troops land at cas navire nature of the country attack of the posts near fort royal fort royal surrendered st pierre and the whole island capitulate st lucie grenades and st vincent taken preparations for war against the spanish west indies  toward the close of the last year it was determined to resume the scheme of operations in the west indies where nothing had been attempted since the year      distressed as the french trade to their islands had been it still continued a resource to that nation on the other hand nothing could possibly furnish us with places of more importance either to retain or to exchange upon a peace than our success in this part of the world another consideration had probably no small share in directing our arms toward that quarter from the time that the dispositions of spain had become equivocal it was necessary to take such steps as would put us in a respectable situation in case a war with that kingdom should become unavoidable it was therefore very proper to have a strong armament in the west indies that side on which spain is most vulnerable and in which every wound affects a part of the quickest sensibility accordingly the force which was sent into the west indies on this occasion was very great and if we take the naval and military together it was such an armament as had never been before seen in that part of the world it was certainly very right to leave as little to hazard as possible and when in the most frugal method of proceeding a great many men must have been employed and a great deal of money spent it would have been an unpardonable error from a consideration of almost any saving to have left any thing imperfect especially at a time when the effect of every operation became almost hourly more and more critical and decisive  every thing which had been an object of war in north america was by tnis time completely acquired it was therefore easy to draw a very considerable part of the army from thence eleven battalions were drawn from new york a draught was also made from the garrison of belleisle these were reinforced by some troops which had been scattered among the leeward islands so that the whole land armament did not fall very short of twelve thousand men general monckton who had acquired so much reputation in north america and had received a very grievous wound at the taking of quebec commanded the land forces in this expedition the marine was under rearadmiral rodney  the failure in      did not discourage our administration from making martinico the object of another attempt the english fleet after having rendezvouzed at barbados came before this island on the  th of january      the troops landed at a creek called cas navire without the loss of a man the fleet having been disposed so properly and having directed their fire with such effect that the enemy was obliged in a short time to abandon the batteries they had erected to defend this inlet  when the landing was effected the difficulties were far from being at an end it is true that neither the number nor the quality of the enemys regular troops in the island were very formidable but the militia was numerous well armed and not unqualified for service in the only kind of war which could be carried on in their country besides the whole country was a natural fortification from the number of ravines with rivulets between them which lay from distance to distance wherever these grounds were practicable the french had posted guards and erected batteries it is easy from hence to discern what obstructions the progress of an army was liable to particularly with regard to its artillery these obstructions were no where greater than in the neighborhood of the place against which the first regular attack was proposed  this town and citadel is overlooked and commanded by two very considerable eminences called morn tortenson and morn garnier whilst the enemy kept possession of these eminences it was impossible to attack the town if they lost them it would prove impossible to defend it suitable to the importance of those situations were the measures taken to render them impregnable they were protected like the other high grounds in this island with very deep ravines and this great natural strength was improved by every contrivance of art the morn tortenson was first to be attacked to favor this operation a the honble robt monckton portrait of robert monckton body of regular troops and marines were ordered to advance on the right along the seaside toward the town in order to take the redoubts which lay in the lower grounds a thousand sailors in flatbottomed boats rowed close to the shore to assist them on the left toward the country a corpse of light infantry properly supported was to get round the enemys left whilst the attack in the center was made by the british grenadiers and the body of the army under the fire of batteries which had been erected on the opposite side with great labor and perseverance the cannon having been dragged upwards of three miles by the seamen  the dispositions for the attack of this difficult post having been made with so much judgment on the part of the commander it was executed with equal spirit and resolution by the soldiery the attack succeeded in every quarter with irresistible impetuosity the enemys works were successively carried they were driven from post to post until our troops after a sharp struggle remained masters of the whole morn some of the enemy fled precipitately into the town to the very entrance of which they were pursued others saved themselves on the morn garnier which was as strong and much higher than morn tortenson and overlooked and commanded it thus far had they proceeded with success but nothing decisive could be done without the possession of the other eminence our troops being much molested by the enemy from that superior situation  it was three days before proper dispositions could be made for driving them from this ground whilst these dispositions were making the enemys whole force descended from the hill sallied out of the town and attacked the english in their advanced posts but they were immediately repulsed and the ardour of the british troops hurrying them forward they improved a defensive advantage into an attack passed the ravines mingled with the enemy scaled the hill seized the batteries and posted themselves on the summit of morn garnier the french regular troops escaped into the town the militia dispersed themselves in the country  all the situations which commanded the town and citadel were now secured completed to capitulate and to surrender this important place the second in the island

instant anchored in st annes bay in this island the  th the ships of war having silenced some batteries which the enemy had erected there and where i was in hopes to have been able to have landed on the western side of the bay and to have crossed over to port royal bay but the difficulties that would have attended our being supplied with provisions and stores added to the scarcity of fresh water in that part made me desist i then thought that if i could get possession of pidgeon island a secure anchorage might be had for the fleet and transports in port royal harbor for this purpose i detached two brigades of the army under the command of brigadiers haviland and grant to ance darlet where they landed and marched to the ground opposite to the island but finding the road impassable for cannon which were necessary for the reduction of that island i judged it best for his majestys service to proceed having previously reconnoitred the shore and land near the case des navires which we effected on the   th without any molestation the ships of war having silenced the batteries above us i had forgot my lord to mention that with the above command were the light infantry under lieutenant colonel scott who were advanced the night the command remained there and were attacked in the night by three companies of grenadiers some freebooters negroes and mulattoes which the enemy had passed over from fort royal but they were so warmly received that they retreated precipitately leaving some dead and a sergeant and three of their grenadiers taken prisoners without any loss on our side  we are now encamped upon the heights above case des navires and i was in hopes before this time to have given your lordship more satisfactory accounts of our operations but the ravines or gullys we have to pass are of such depth and difficulty of access and that in the face of many batteries and redoubts with the whole country as well mulattoes and negroes as inhabitants in arms and without being able to procure any material intelligence that i do not think it prudent to expose his majestys troops until i can erect batteries to cover them which we are at work upon with the utmost expedition  however my lord i have the pleasure to acquaint you that the troops continue healthy although they have been necessarily exposed to laying on their arms and are in the highest spirits and i dont in the least doubt but that i shall be able to execute this principal object of his majestys commands of which i shall give your lordship the earliest notice  it gives me great pleasure to acquaint your lordship how much i am indebted to admiral rodney for the assistance received from the fleet under his command the utmost harmony has subsisted hitherto and i am persuaded will continue

had appointed under sir james douglas having silenced the forts of that coast in performing of which we had the misfortune to lose the raisonable as she was leading in for one of the enemys batteries owing to the pilots being ignorant of a little reef of rocks which took her up we have saved all her people all her stores and i hope soon to get all her guns  having by the motion of the fleet and army taken possession of an excellent harbor and secured a landing on the weathermost part of the island which might be made tenable at any time as likewise thereby greatly alarming the enemy  at general moncktons request i dispatched commodore swanton with a squadron of ships and two brigades to the bay of petite ace in order to take post there captain hervey of the dragon having silenced the battery of the grand ance landed his marines and seamen who attacked it also from the shore and took possession of the fort and on the   th i followed with the whole fleet and army after destroying the enemys batteries at st annes bay when having reconnoitred the coast with the general we came to a resolution to make an attempt between point negroe and the cas de pilotte which i ordered to be attacked on the   th and having very successively and with little loss silenced the batteries i landed general monckton with the greatest part of his forces by sunset and the whole army was on shore a little after daylight next morning without the loss of a man the boats being commanded by commodore wanton in the center capt shuldoam on the right wing and capt hervey on the left with such necessaries as they were most immediately in want of and had all the ships and transports anchored as much in safety as this coast will amit  i also landed two battalions of marines consisting of   0 men each  the army are now carrying on their approaches to the heights of ount grenie and mount townson which the enemy have made as strong as art can do and from whence the general proposes to lay siege to port royal  i have the happiness to add that the army and navy continue in perfect health and carry on the ervice with the greatest spirit and harmony   general moncktons second letter to the earl of egremont fort royal in martinico feb        my lord i had the honor of writing to your ordship the  0th of jnuary when i acquainted you that i intended to attack the enemy in the strong posts they occupied on the opposite heights and the morn tartenson leading to fort royal as soon as i had erected batteries which were thought necessary to assist us in the passing a very deep and wide ravine a large hollow made between two hills occasioned by a sudden current of water which is very frequent and rapid at the time of the equinox it is of a considerable depth and not less difficult to get into than to ascend as it is tufted with trees brushwood on every side and in many places covered over these the french lined with infantry but our forces resolute and determined to carry the batteries on the other side let each other down first slinging thelr muskets when they got to the other side clambered up as fast as possible formed and carried all before them some were let down precipitately b the banks giving way but they soon recovered themselves and joined their corpse  or gully which separated us from them  my disposition for the attack being made on the   th of january at break of day the troops advanced under a brisk fire of our batteries the grenadiers under brigadier grant first falling in with the enemys advanced posts began the attack brigadier rufane on the right with his brigade and the marines was to advance and attack the redoubts along the coast  000 seamen in the flatbottomed boats rowed us as he advanced lord rollos brigade supported the grenadiers brigadier walsh with his brigade supporting the light infantry under lieutenant colonel scott to attack the left of a plantation and to endeavor to get round the enemy the light infantry effected their attempt and while the grenadiers were driving the enemy from post to post they got upon their left which helped to complete the event of the day the enemys works were now successively attacked with the most irresistible impetuosity so that at nine oclock we were in the entire possession of all their works and the strong ground of morn tartenson consisting of many redoubts mounted with cannon and advantageously situated to assist the natural strength of the country the enemy retired in the greatest confusion to the town of fort royal and to morn garnier a still higher hill than the morn tartenson and separated from it by a deep ravine covered with a very thick brush and a rivulet at the bottom from whence they thought they were never to be dislodged both from its natural strength and the works and batteries they had on it the spirit of the grenadiers in this attack was such that some of them even pursued the enemy to the bridge of the town and brought off prisoners from thence  while this was doing on this side brigadier haviland with his brigade two battalions of highlanders and a corpse of light infantry which i had formed from the several regiments and given the command of to major leland had orders from the reported practicability of the passage to cross the ravine a good deal to the left and attack a body of the enemy who were posted on several heights opposite to him and to try to get into their left and by that means divide their force yet although they began their march at two oclock in the morning such was the difficulty of access though i am convinced every means were tried that it was late before they effected it  when i found that the enemy were giving way on all sides i ordered lieutenant colonel scotts light infantry brigadier walshs brigade and a division of the grenadiers to a plantation more to the left where brigadier haviland was to have come down they drove off some of the enemy posted there and the light infantry possessed themselves of a very advantageous post opposite to morn garnier to support them i ordered brigadier havilands corpse which now had passed to their right the division of grenadiers under brigadier grant and walshs brigade kept possession of the upper plantation and communicated with havilands corpse the marines which i had taken from brigadier rufane i posted to cover the road between the two plantations  on the   th we began to erect batteries on morn tartenson against the citadel of fort royal but were much annoyed on that and the following day by the enemy from morn garnier finding that it was absolute necessary to attack this place to the left where the corpse of light infantry and brigadier havilands brigade were posted i determined immediately to errect batteries against these of the enemy which annoyed us and which might also cover our passage of the ravine  on the   th about four oclock in the evening the enemy under cover of their batteries and with the greatest part of their force had the temerity to attack the two corpse of light infantry and brigadier havilands brigade in the posts they occupied but were received with such steadiness that they were immediately repulsed and such was the ardour of the troops that they passed the ravine with the enemy seized their batteries and took post there being reinforced by brigadier walshs brigade and the division of grenadiers under brigadier grant who immediately on the attack had marched to support them night was now come on but major leland moving on to the left with his light infantry and finding no opposition continued his rout toward the enemys redoubts which he soon came up to and took possession of the enemy except a few grenadiers who were prisoners having abandoned them their troops retired into the town and citadel and the militia dispersed in the country brigadiers walsh grant and haviland immediately moved up to support the light infantry so that at nine oclock at night his majestys troops were in possession of this very strong post which entirely commanded the citadel so precipitate was the enemys flight that they left a mortar loaded and   or   guns unspiked with a quantity of ammunition and provisions the cannon and mortar were turned against the citadel in the morning  having gained this advantageous post from which the enemy had so much annoyed us and having completed two batteries on morn tartenson consisting of fourteen guns and three mortars we opened them on the  0th but finding that the distance was too great and having now morn capuchine in our power not more than  00 yards distant from the fort as well as the possession of the town i immediately resolved to erect batteries at both these places the sooner to reduce the citadel but for the easier conveyance of our cannon by water i ordered major leland with his light infantry to take post on the river monsieur  the enemy perceiving our designs and for reasons best known to themselves on the evening of the  d instant beat the chamade in consequence of which the gate of the citadel was delivered up to his majestys troops the evening of the  th and at nine oclock next morning the garrison marched out on the terms of the capitulation it consisted of about  00 men grenadiers marines militia and freebooters about   0 of the garrison were killed and wounded in the siege the enemy might have kept us much longer as it would have been absolutely necessary to have made two or three breaches which must have taken some time  in the several attacks i am credibly informed that the enemy had not less than  000 men killed wounded and taken prisoners among the latter several of their principal officers of the militia taken the   th our loss your lordship will see by the return you have also my lord a return of the artillery and stores taken from the enemy on the   th and   th of january and in the citadel at its surrender on the  th instant  i cannot find words my lord to render that ample justice due to the true valor and persevering ardour of his majestys troops which i have the honor to command the difficulties they had to encounter in the attack of an enemy possessed of every advantage that art or nature could give them were great their perseverance in surmounting these obstacles furnishes a noble example of british spirit  the brigadiers haviland grant rufane lord rollo

being resolved not to make the least alteration the other quarters must accede to it  we hope both the capitulations will receive his majestys approbation as it has been our earnest study to obtain on

his majesty  on the  th instant capt ourry of his majestys ship the acteon cruizing off tobago fell in with and took a large spanish register ship laden with cannon powder small arms and ordinance stores bound to laquira   admiral rodneys fourth letter dated st pierres road martinico march        i have this moment received an express from captain hervey that the island of st lucia is surrendered at discretion      the capital of the island st pierre still remained to be reduced this is also a place of no contemptible strength and it was apprehended that the resistance here might be considerable if the strength of the garrison in any degree corresponded with that of the fortifications and with the natural advantages of the country our troops therefore were still under sorne anxiety for the final success of their work and feared if not disappointment at least delay but the reduction of fort royal had so greatly abated the enemys confidence that the militia despaired of making any effectual defense the planters also solicitous for their fortunes were apprehensive of having their estates ruined by a war too long continued or perhaps of losing all by passing the opportunity of a favorable capitulation influenced by these motives and disheartened by the train of misfortunes which had attended the french arms here and in all other parts of the world they resolved to hold out no longer and general monckton just as he was ready to embark sor the reduction of st pierre who came to capitulate for the surrender of that place and of the whole island  the surrender of martinico which was the seat of the superior government the principal mart of trade and the center of all the french force in the caribbees naturally drew on the surrender of all the dependent islands granada a fertile island and possessed of some good harbors was given up without opposition st lucia and st vincent the right to which had so long been objects of contention between the two nations followed its example the english were now the sole and undisturbed possessors of all the caribbees and held that chain of innumerable islands which forms an immense bow extending from the eastern point of hispaniola almost to the continent of south america and though some of these islands are barren none of them very large and not many of them well inhabited they boast more trade than falls to the lot of many respectable kingdoms  the time in which martinico was reduced was a circumstance of almost as much consequence as the reduction itself for the war against spain having been declared in the beginning of the year it became advisable to strike early such an effective blow against that nation as might incline them to a speedy peace or might influence the fortune of the whole war if contrary to our wishes the war should continue it was on this plan necessary to employ a very great force and of course to call away a very considerable part of that which had been employed at martinico whilst the season permitted them to act  when the british administration determined to transfer the war into the spanish west indies with great judgment they fixed they eyes at once upon the capital object as the merit of projecting this expedition has been variously related the following particulars may not be improperly given here  admiral knowles on his return from jamaica in      took an opportunity of visiting the havanna and inspecting its fortifications of which he made plans and other material observations these at the request of the duke of gumberland were laid before him for his inspection who knowing the merit of the admiral as an engineer consulted him on the most probable means of putting them into execution these his royal highness formed into a regular plan for execution which he sent to the ministry who held them under consideration for some time however this plan was disapproved of by lord anson then first lord of the admiralty who formed another which was carried into execution but as his royal highness had very early interested himself in the expedition the appointing of a commander of the landforce was left to him which naturally fell on the earl of albemarle whom he had in a manner tutored from his earliest years  and resolved to commence their operations where others of less ability would have chosen to conclude them in an attack upon subordinate places the conquest would not have been much more certain when obtained it would be far from decisive and a failure would have been fatal as it would include a loss of reputation the failure of an armament in a subordinate attack is a bad preparative for a greater attempt the plan therefore of the war of    0 in the spanish indies in which we began with porto bello and so proceeded to carthagena etc was mean because the success in one of these attempts did nothing toward insuring success in the other and if we had succeeded in both attempts our advantage would have had but little influence on a third but the plan of the war just now concluded was great and just because we began with the havannah in which the whole trade and navigation of the spanish west indies center and without which it cannot be carried on if we should acquiesce in this conquest this conquest alone would almost have finished the war because it would have utterly intercepted the enemys resources if we chose to pursue our advantage it exposed the whole spanish america  chap viii commanders in the expedition against the havannah fleet sails from portsmouth passage through the

english forces succors arrive from north america a sally the fort stormed operations against the town the havannah surrenders advantages of this acquisition  it being determined to commence with this enterprise such commanders were to be chosen as could be safely entrusted with the conduct of an undertaking so weighty and on the success of which so much depended lord albemarle the friend and disciple of the duke of cumberland commanded the land forces admiral pococke who having contributed by his valor toward that sovereignty which his country had obtained in the east indies was now chosen to extend its empire and its honor in the west  they sailed from portsmouth on the  th of march the day on which the grenades were surrendered a fleet had sailed from martinico under the command of that spirited and intelligent officer sir james douglas in order to reinforce them the squadrons very happily met without delay or dispersion at cape nichola the northwest point of hispaniola on the   th of may after this junction the armament amounted to nineteen ships of the line eighteen small vessels of war and near one hundred and fifty transports which conveyed about ten thousand land forces a supply of four thousand had been ordered from new york and was expected to join them very near as early as they could be supposed able to commence their operations  there were two choices before the admiral for his course to the havannah the first and most obvious was the common way to keep to the south of cuba and fall into the track of the galleons but this though by much the safest would prove by far the most tedious passage and delays above all things were to be avoided as the success of the whole enterprise would probably depend upon its being in forwardness before the hurricane season came on he therefore resolved to run along the northern shore of that island pursuing his career from east to west through a narrow passage not less than seven hundred miles in length called the old streights of bahama  this passage through almost the whole of its extent is bounded on the right and left by the most dangerous sands and shoals which render the navigation so hazardous that it has usually been avoided by single and small vessels there was no pilot in the fleet whose experience could be depended on to conduct them safely through it the admiral however determined on this passage and being provided with a good chart of lord ansons he resolved to trust to his own sagacity conduct and vigilance to carry safely through those streights a fleet of near two hundred sail so bold an attempt had never been made but every precaution was taken to guard this bodness from the imputation of temerity a vessel was sent to reconnoitre the passage and when returned was ordered to take the lead some frigates followed sloops and boats were stationed on the right and left on the shallows with well adapted signals both for the day and the night the fleet moved in seven divisions and being favored with pleasant weather and secured by the admirable dispositions which were made they without the smallest loss or interruption got clear through this perilous passage on the  th of june having entered it on the   th of may  the havannah the object of their long voyage and of so many anxious hopes and fears was now before them this place is not denominated the capital of cuba st jago situated at the southeast part of the island has that title but the havannah though the second in rank is the first in wealth size and importance the harbor upon which it stands is in every respect one of the best in the west indies and perhaps in the world it is entered by a narrow passage upwards of half a mile in length which afterward expands into a large basin forming three cul de saes deep bays and is sufficient in extent and depth to contain a thousand sail of the largest ships having almost throughout six fathom water and being perfectly covered from every wind in this bay the rich fleets from the several parts of the spanish west indies called the galleons and the flota assemble before they finally set out on their voyage for europe  this circumstance has rendered the havannah one of the most opulent flourishing and populous cities in this part of the world great care was taken to fortify and secure a place which by being the center of so rich a commerce would naturally become the fairest mark for the attempts of an enemy the narrow entrance into this harbor is secured on one side by a very strong fort called the moro c built upon a projecting point of land on the other it is defended by a fort called the puntal d which joins the town the town itself which is situated to the westward of the entrance of the harbor and opposite to the moro fort is surrounded by a good rampart aa flanked with bastions and covered with a ditch  the spaniards who had been for some time preparing for war had formed a considerable navy in the west indies this fleet q which was near twenty sail mostly of the line lay at this time in the basin of the havannah but they had not when our armament appeared before the port received it seems any authentic account from their court concerning the commencement of hostilities between the two nations  whether the spaniards were rendered inactive by the want of instructions whether all their ships were not in fighting condition or whatever else was the cause this fleet lay quiet in the harbor if some of the above reasons did not oppose it may be very rationally supposed that their best part would have been to come out and fight our squadron they were not very far from an equality and though the issue of a battle might have proved unfavourable to them yet a battle tolerably maintained would have much disabled our armament and perhaps have been a means of preventing the success of the whole enterprise the loss of their fleet in this way might possibly have saved the city but the city once taken nothing could possibly save the fleet it is true they much trusted and not wholly without reason to the strength of the place and to those astonishing difficulties which attend any military operation that is drawn out to length in this unhealthy climate in other respects they were very far from being deficient in proper measures for their defense they made a strong boom p across the mouth of the harbor and almost the only use they made of their shipping in the defense of the place was to sink three of them n behind this boom  when all things were in readiness for landing the admiral with a great part of the fleet bore away to the westward s in order to draw the enemys attention from the true object and made a feint as if he intended to land upon that side while commodore keppel and captain harvey commanding a detachment of the squadron approached the shore to the eastward t of the harbor and effected a landing there in the utmost order  the principal body of the army was destined to act upon this side it was divided into two corpse one of which was advanced a considerable way in the country toward the southeast of the harbor in order to cover the siege and to secure our parties employed in watering and procuring provisions this corpse was commanded by general elliot the other was immediately occupied in the attack on fort moro w to the reduction of which the efforts of the english were principally directed as the moro commanded the town and the entrance of the harbor this attack was conducted by general keppel to make a diversion in favor of this grand operation a detachment under colonel how was encamped to the westward of the town this body cut off the communication between the town and the country and kept the enemys attention

siege of the havana drawn by an officer   th august       map of havana  the hardships which the english army sustained in carrying on the siege of the moro are almost inexpressible the earth was every where so thin that it was with great difficulty they could cover themselves in their approaches there was no spring or river near them it was necessary to bring water from a great distance and so precarious and scanty was this supply that they were obliged to have recourse to water from the ships roads for communication were to be cut through thick woods the artillery was to be dragged for a vast way over a rough rocky shore several dropped down dead with heat thirst and fatigue but such was the resolution of our people such the happy and perfect unanimity which subsisted between the land and the sea services that no difficulties no hardships slackened for a moment the operations against this important strong and well defended place batteries were in spite of all difficulties raised against the moro and along the hill upon which this fort stands in order to drive the enemys ships deeper into the harbor and thus to prevent them from molesting our approaches  the enemys fire and that of the besiegers was for a long time pretty near on an equality and it was kept up with great vivacity on both sides the spaniards in the fort communicated with the town from which they were recruited and supplied they did not rely solely on their works  whilst these works were thus vigorously pushed on shore the navy not contented with the great assistance which they had before lent to every part of the land service resolved to try something further and which was more directly within their own province toward the reduction of the moro accordingly the day the batteries on shore were opened three of their greatest ships g the dragon the cambridge and the marlborough under the conduct of capt harvey laid their broadsides against the fort  this bold attempt though it had very little effect upon the works on that side of the fort which the ships attacked was nevertheless of considerable service the enemys attention being diverted to that side the other was a good deal neglected our fire was poured in the mean time with redoubled fury from the batteries it became much superior to that of the enemy and did no small damage to their works but the moment the spaniards were released from their attention to our men of war they returned again to the eastward face of the fort their defense was revived with as much vigor as before on both sides a constant unremitted fire was kept up with a fierce emulation for several days it now became evident that the reduction of this fortress was to be a work of time never from the beginning of the war had the english valor been so well matched here was at length an adversary worthy of our arms and our whole military skill and spirit was put to the severest trial  in the midst of this sharp and doubtful contention the capital battery against the fort unfortunately took fire  this was a mortifying stroke it was felt the more severely because the other hardships of the siege were become by this time almost insupportable the sickness something of which the troops had brought with them from martinico and which increased infinitely in this unwholesome country and rigorous service had reduced the army to half its number at the same time that it doubled the fatigue of those few who still preserved some remains of strength five thousand soldiers were at one time down in various distempers no less than three thousand of the seamen were in the same miserable condition a total want of good provisions exasperated the disease and retarded the recovery the deficiency of water was of all their grievances the greatest and extremely aggravated all the rest of their sufferings the procuring from a distance this wretched supply so unequal to their wants exhausted all their force besides as the season advanced the prospect of succeeding grew fainter the hearts of the most sanguine sunk within them whilst they beheld this gallant army wasting away by diseases and they could not avoid trembling for that noble fleet which had rid so long on an open shore and which must to all appearance be exposed to inevitable ruin if the hurricane season should come on before the reduction of the place a thousand languishing and impatient looks were cast out for the reinforcement from north america none however as yet appeared and the exhausted army was left to its own endeavors many fell into despair and died overcome with fatigue anguish and disappointment  but in the midst of these cruel delays and distresses the steadiness of the commanders infused life and activity into their troops and roused them to incredible exertions the rich prize which was before them the shame of returning home baffled and even the strenuous resistance which was made by the enemy all these motives called loudly on their interest their honor and their pride and obliged them to the exertion of every nerve nobody could imagine that it was this reduced and slender army by which these astonishing efforts were made and this extensive sphere of duty so perfectly filled new batteries arose in the place of the old the fire soon became equal and then superior to that of the enemy  these favorable events infused double life into their operations in this advanced state of the siege but a new and grand difficulty appeared just at the seeming accomplishment of their work an immense ditch yawned before them for the greater part cut in the solid rock eighty feet deep and forty feet wide to fill it up by any means appeared impossible difficult as the work of mining was in those circumstances it was the only expedient it might have been an impracticable one if fortunately a thin ridge of rock had not been left in order to cover the ditch toward the sea on this narrow ridge  it now became visible to the governor of the havannah that the fort must be speedily reduced if left to its own strength at all events something must be done in this exigence for its immediate relief accordingly before break of day a body of twelve hundred men  this was the last effort for the relief of the moro which abandoned as it was by the city and while an enemy was undermining its walls held out with a sullen resolution and made no sort of proposal to capitulate the mines at length did their business his sword to his conquerors the english wept with pity and admiration over that unfortunate valor which had occasioned them so many toilsome hours and cost them so many lives  thus the moro came into our possession after a vigorous struggle fortyfour days from the time the first operations had been begun against it no time was lost to profit of this great advantage notwithstanding that the sickness still raged like a pestilence and that many new and great works were to be undertaken not only the fire of the fort was turned against the town but a line of batteries l was erected along the hill of the cavannos on the extremity of which the fort stands by these batteries which mounted three and forty pieces of cannon and twelve mortars almost the whole eastern side of the city was commanded from one end to the other preparations for an attack were also made and batteries erected to the westward of the town which on that side had hitheto been only watched some time before a part of the second division of the troops from north america had arrived  when those preparations were perfectly ready to take effect  to convince the governor that the menaces employed were not an empty boast lord albemarle the very next morning ordered a general fire from the batteries which was poured from all sides with such continued and irresistible fury that in six hours almost all the enemys guns were silenced to the inexpressible joy of the fleet and army flags of truce appeared from every quarter of the town a capitulation ensued in which the established religion the former laws and private property were secured to the inhabitants the garrison which was reduced to about seven hundred men had the honors of war and were to be conveyed to spain a district of an hundred and eighty miles westward of the havannah was yielded along with the town the spaniards struggled a long time to save the men of war but this was a capital point and wholly inadmissible they also made some attempts to have the harbor declared neutral during the war but this was no less essential to the completeness of the conquest and was steadily refused after two days altercation they gave up these points and the english troops were put in possession of the havannah on the   th of august when they had been before it two months and eight days  although we have not pursued in exact order all the detail of the more minute operations of this memorable siege we have dwelt on it a longer time than we have on our plan generally allowed to such transactions because it was without question in itself the most considerable and in its consequences the most decisive conquest we have made since the beginning of the war and because in no operation were the courage steadiness and perseverance of the british troops and the conduct of their leaders more conspicious the acquisiton of this place united in itself all the advantages which can be acquired in war it was a military advantage of the highest class it was equal to the greatest naval victory by its effect on the enemys marine and in the plunder it equalled the produce of a national subsidy nine sail of the enemys ships of the line some of the finest vessels in the world were taken with four frigates three of their capital ships had been as already mentioned sunk by themselves at the beginning of the siege two more were in forwardness on the stocks and these were destroyed by the english the enemy on this occasion lost a whole fleet in ready money in the tobacco collected at the havannah on account of the king of spain and in other valuable merchandises the plunder did not perhaps fall short of three millions sterling letter from the earl of albemarle to the earl of egremont dated head quarters near the havannah august         my lord i have the honor of informing your lordship that the town of the havannah with all its dependencies and the men of war in the harbor surrendered to his majestys arms by capitulation on the   th instant  enclosed is a copy of the capitulation various returns and the chief engineers continuation of the journal of the siege of the m fort which was taken by storm on the  0th of last month so much to the honor and credit of his majestys troops and to major general keppel who commanded the attack that i should do them injustice if i did not mention them in a particular manner to your lordship our mines were sprung about one oclock and a breach made just practicable for a file of men in front the enemy was drawn up on the top of it in force with a seeming determination to defend it the attack was so vigorous and impetuous that the enemy was instantaneously drove from the breach and his majestys standard planted upon the bastion  i did not send a particular express with this good news to your lordship because i flattered myself that what has happened would soon be the consqeuence of our success at fort moro  n the   th in the morning by a signal from the fort we opened our batteries against the town and punta fort the guns and mortars were so well served by the artillery and sailors and their effect so great that in less than six hours all the guns in the fort and north bastion were silenced the governor hung out the white flag and beat a parley and at the same time sent out an officer to propose a cessation of arms for twentyfour hours in order to prepare the articles of capitulation  i sent on board the namur to the admiral to inform him of the governors proposals  sir george pocock immediately came to my quarters and we agreed to a suspension of hostilities to the   th at twelve oclock  i summoned the governor on the  0th his answer was very civil and proper at the same time said he would defend his town to the last extremity  the difficulties the officers and soldiers have met with and the fatigues they have so cheerfully and resolutely gone through since the army first landed on this island are not to be described they deserve from me the greatest commendations and i must entreat your lordship to take the first opportunity of informing his majesty how much i think myself obliged to lieut general elliot and the rest of the general officers under my command to every officer and soldier in the army and to the officers and sailors of his majestys fleet for the zealous manner with which they have carried on the service and for the great assistance i have received from them happy we shall all think ourselves if our conduct meets with his majestys approbation  sir george pocock and commodore keppel have exerted themselves in a most particular manner and i may venture to say that there never was a joint undertaking carried on with more harmony and zeal on both sides which greatly contributed to the success of it  capt nugent one of my aiddecamps who has the honor of delivering you my dispatches can inform your lordship of any particulars you are pleased to learn from him he has been very active and present at every material affair that has happened since the landing of the troops i must beg through your lordship to recommend him to his majesty as a very deserving young man he carries with him the spanish ensign taken at the moro  colonel carleton who has acted as brigadier since lord rollo left the army had the misfortune of being wounded on the   d of july when the enemy made a sortie he is at present in a fair way of doing well  i think it but justice to major fuller who is my elder aiddecamp to say that i should have sent him to england if i had not thought it would be more agreeable to his majesty to receive the news by one of his own servants  i am etc albemarle   letter from sir george pocock to mr cleveland dated off chorea river near the havannah the   th of august      sir i desire you will acquaint their lordships that it is with the greatest pleasure i now congratulate them on the great success of his majestys arms in the reduction of the havannah with all its dependencies  the moro fort was taken by storm on the  0th of last month after a siege of twentynine days during which time the enemy lost above a thousand men and a brave officer in don lewis de valasco captain of one of their men of war and governor in the moro mortally wounded in defending the colors sword in hand in the storm and on the   th instant the governor of the havannah desired to capitulate for the town which was granted the articles agreed to and signed a copy of which i enclose and we were put in possession of the punta and land gate the   th with this great and important acquisition to his majesty have also fallen twelve men of war of the line as per list three of which were sunk with a companys ship in the entrance of the harbor nine are fit for sea and two on the stocks a blow that i hope will prove the more capital to the enemy as they receive it so early in the war and i may venture to say will leave all their settlements in this part of the world exposed to any attempts that may be thought proper to be made on them but however trivial with the possession of the havannah it may appear yet i cannot help mentioning the discovery and possessing of the harbor of mariel about seven leagues to the leward of this and which we had made ourselves masters of though the enemy had endeavored to ruin it by sinking ships in the entrance and we had lately sent near one hundred transports with some men of war there for security against the season in which we are already advanced  it will be as needless as almost impossible for me to express or describe that perfect harmony that has uninterruptedly subsisted between the fleet and the army from our first setting out indeed it is doing injustice to both to mention them as two corpse since each has endeavored with the most constant and cheerful emulation to render it but one uniting in the same principles of honor and glory for their king and countrys service i am glad on this occasion to do justice to the distinguished merit of commodore keppel who executed the service under his direction on the coxmar side with the greatest spirit activity and diligence and i must repeat that the zeal of his majestys sea officers and seamen exerted in carrying on the services alloted to them is highly to be commended  i shall now beg leave to refer their lordships to capt harvey for all further particulars who i send with this letter and who has approved himself a brave and deserving officer in this expedition therefore think myself obliged to desire their lordships will recommend him to his majesty  i am sir your most obedient humble servant g pocock   a list of the ships of war that were in the harbor of the havannah under the command of the

which i hope we shall be able to dispatch in a few days  i have not been able to collect an account of the killed and wounded seamen belonging to the different ships since the beginning of the siege who were employed at the batteries on shore but it shall go by the first opportunity      spain now began very sensibly to feel the inconveniences and miseries she had voluntarily drawn on herself by entering into a war so fatal to her no sooner had the news of this important capture reached madrid than an universal dejection appeared in every countenance and the hightowering hopes they had formed at the beginning of the war entirely vanished the prodigious advantages they had vainly expected to flow from the family compact were now rendered abortive and grief and despair were the melancholy offspring of injustice and rashness  great britain on the contrary as prudent in the enjoyment of victory as brave in gaining it seemed not so elated with her good fortune as to make her indulge in the luxurious lap of indolence but determined by the prosecution of the war in the same able and vigorous manner to compel her enemies to sue for that peace they had when offered haughtily refused  to effect so great so desirable a work it was thought the reduction of the philippine islands would not a little contribute that enterprise was therefore formed and entrusted to the execution of two great men who had on many occasions before signalized themselves in the service of their country and approved themselves equal to the greatest things these were general draper and admiral cornish the troops allotted for the service were the   th regiment and a company of the royal artillery  0 of the artillery furnished by the gentlemen of madrass  00 seapoys a company of caffrees one of topazes and one of pioneers to which were added the precarious assistance of two companies of frenchmen enlisted in their service with some hundreds of unarmed lascars for the use of the engineers and park of artillery this little supply of men was farther reinforced with a fine battalion of   0 seamen and   0 good marines so that the whole force amounted to   00 men who with the necessary stores were embarked on board of his majestys squadron and two india ships employed as transports  as it may appear surprising so important a conquest should be attempted with so small a force when a greater might be employed it may not be amiss to observe that if more were drawn from the coasts the settlements would be in danger and therefore it may be thought advisable rather to attempt with a few brave men a place that was unprepared as imagined for such a visit than by employing a greater force to subject our own colonies to hostile attempts and perhaps to give the enemy time to be aware of our designs  on the first of august the forces set sail the seahorse capt grant having been previously dispatched through the streights of malacca to the entrance of the china sea to stop all vessels that might be bound to manila or sent from any of the neighboring settlements to give the spaniards intelligence of the design on the   d of the following month they anchored in manila bay and found that their visit was unexpected and the enemy unprepared to increase as much as possible their visible confusion and consternation it was determined to lose no time in the attack of the port of cavite as at first determined but proceed directly to the grand object the city of manila the general and admiral rightly judging that their conquest of that important place would of course occasion and draw after it the fall of cavite  in consequence of this resolution a summons was sent to the governor to surrender the town fire to the right and left to protect the flanks and disperse the enemy who were assembled in great numbers both horse and foot to oppose a descent it had the desired effect the spaniards retired and left a clear coast but a violent surf arising many boats were dashed to pieces the arms and ammunition much damaged but providentially no lives were lost the troops then formed upon the beach marched and took possession of the malatta fixed their outposts and passed the whole night under arms the spaniards in the mean time were employed in burning of their suburbs the next day a fort named the polverista which the enemy had abandoned was seized  on the   th the admiral sent on shore the battalions of seamen under the command of the captains collins of the weymouth pitchford of the america and george ourry from the panther the rest of the companys troops of all sorts were likewise landed and put under cover the spaniards advanced out of the garrison under the command of the chevalier fayet with  00 men and two field pieces and from a church about  00 yards to the right of st jagos church began a cannonade upon the right flank of the troops posted there some seapoys under ensign carty were sent to skirmish with them supported by three picquets of the   th regiment and  00 seamen all under the command of colonel monson who soon drove the enemy back into the town  the superior skill and bravery of the english troops were so evident from this affair that it occasioned a second summons to the governor but to no purpose the answer was much more spirited than their conduct had been the church from whence the spaniards had been driven colonel monson had orders to keep possession of if he found it tenable from the top of which a perfect view was had of the enemys works the front they were obliged to attack was defended by the bastions of st diego and st andrew with orillons and retired flanks a ravelin which covered the royal gate a wet ditch covered way and glacis but all these works were out of repair except the bastions which were in excellent order and lined with a great number of fine brass cannon it became absolutely necessary to sound the ditch and which might have proved a very perilous enterprise had the spaniards been careful in posting centries on the covered way but their omission and negligence made it the more easy it was therefore undertaken and effected by a small party of the   th regiment under captain fletcher with the loss only of three men  the city of manila being of great extent and the number of men employed to reduce it very small it became impossible to invest it on every side two sides therefore were constantly open to the enemy to introduce supplies of men and provisions and carry out their effects the garrison consisted of  00 men of the royal regiment under the command of the marquis of villa mediana brigadier general which was farther reinforced by a body of  0000 indians it is evident from hence that the disadvantages under which the english forces labored could not be remedied nor could there be any reasonable ground for success but in the prudence and wisdom of the general and the matchless intrepidity of the troops  the city continued thus invested and was cannonaded both by the batteries erected and the frigates which were brought up till the  d of october when a battery for twentyfour pounders was completed and a mortar battery for the heavy shells of ten and twelve inches which made a good parallel and communication from the church to the gun battery and established a spacious place of arms on the left of it near the sea these were greatly facilitated by the roaring of the waves it being very tempestuous weather and which prevented the spaniards from hearing the noise of the workmen who gave no sort of interruption but seemed to trust entirely to the elements in the mean time the governor who was an archbishop gave out that an angel from the lord was gone forth to destroy the english like the host of senacherib in the afternoon the seamen with great activity and indefatigable labor had brought up and mounted all the guns in the battery  a sally was made the  th by  000 of the indians who attacked the cantonment of the seamen but upon the alarm colonel monson and captain fletcher with the picquets being dispatched to their assistance the enemy was repulsed and forced to fly with the loss of  00 men had the skill and weapons of these indians who are a wild and barbarous people from the province of pampanga been equal to their strength and ferocity the dispersion of them might not have been so easy for though armed chiefly with bows arrows and lances they advanced up to the very muzzles of their enemys pieces repeated their assaults and died like wild beasts gnawing the bayonets in this skirmish captain porter a brave and experienced sea officer was slain scarce were the indians thus routed when another body of them with part of the spanish garrison attacked the church and forced the seapoys from their post in it nearest the town took possession of the top from whence they killed and wounded several of the english who were entirely exposed to all their weapons notwithstanding their disadvantageous situation the european soldiers maintained their post behind the church with great patience and firmness and at last dislodged the enemy with the loss of captain strahan of the   th regiment and  0 private men wounded or killed the spaniards left  0 dead behind them in and about the church this was their last effort all their indians excepting   00 discouraged by the loss returned home and the fire of the besiegers continuing with unremitted fury the next day a breach appeared practicable and it was thought the spaniards sensible of their danger would think of giving up the town but they were obstinate without bravery or any generous resolution of defending the breach  the next day at four in the morning in consequence of a resolution formed the preceding night the troops filed off from their quarters in small bodies to give the less suspicion to the enemy enemy might be lodged or entrenched at day break a large body of spaniards was discerned forming themselves on the bastion of st andrew but upon the explosion of some shells that were thrown among them they went off taking immediate advantage of this and by the signal of a general discharge of artillery and mortars the troops rushed on to the assault under cover of a thick smoke that blew directly upon the town sixty volunteers of different corpse under lieutenant russel of the   th led the way supported by the grenadiers of that regiment the engineers with the pioneers and other workmen to clear and enlarge the breach and make lodgments in case the enemy should have been too strongly entrenched in the gorge of the bastion followed col monson and major more were at the head of two grand divisions of the   th the battalion of seamen advanced next sustained by the other two divisions of the   th and the companys troops closed the rear they all mounted the breach with amazing spirit and rapidity and dispersed the spaniards with the greatest facility little resistance was given except at the royal gate and from the galleries of the lofty houses which surrounded the grand square in the guard house over the royal gate  00 of the spaniards and indians who would not surrender were put to the sword and according to the enemys own account  00 men were drowned in attempting to escape over the river which was very deep and rapid the governor and principal officers retired to the citadel and were glad to surrender as prisoners at discretion as that place was in no good posture of defense the marquis of villa mediana and the rest of the spanish officers were admitted as prisoners of war on their paroles of honor and to conciliate the affections of the natives all the indians taken prisoners were dismissed in safety  the joy on taking this important place was greatly clouded by the loss of major more who being transfixed with an arrow near the royal gate died immediately universally lamented for his good qualities a few officers only were wounded and no more than  0 private men killed or wounded in consequence of the terms given to the spaniards the port of cavite and the citadel with the islands and forts dependent on manila were given up to his britannic majesty and they were to pay four millions of dollars for the preservation of the town and their effects  such lucrative conquests as the havannah and the phillippine islands had never before been made brigadier genesis drapers letter to the earl of egremont dated manila november        my lord i do myself the honor of sending lieut col scott late adjutantgeneral to inform your lordship of the success of his majestys arms in the conquest of manila the surrender of the port of cavite and the cession of the phillippine islands  on the  th of october we took the capital by storm after    days operation which are detailed in my journal our loss upon this occasion would have been trifling but for the death of major more a valiant good officer and it is with particular satisfaction i can assure your lordship that the firm bravery and perseverance of the troops could only be equalled by their humanity after victory out of respect and deference to admiral cornish we waited till he came on shore and being desirous to save so fine a city from destruction we jointly dictated the annexed conditions to the governor general the archbishop and the chief magistrates who most readily embraced them  considering their critical situation and vast opulence the terms were as reasonable for them as beneficial to us we allow the india company a third part of the ransom the whole of which amounts to a million sterling and according to my instructions i have this day delivered up manila one of the richest cities and islands in this part of the world with the port of cavite to dawson drake esquire and the other gentlemen appointed to receive them on behalf of the company with all the artillery ammunition and warlike stores found therein agreeable to the enclosed inventories  i have appointed major fell of the   th regiment to be commandant of the garrison which must consist of all the troops brought from madrass as the great extent of the place its very numerous inhabitants and unsettled country with the importance of the cavite demand at least this force for an effectual security  the season of the year and condition of the squadron oblige us to defer the taking possession of the subordinate places ceded to the crown until the ships have had a sufficient repair and i have the pleasure to acquaint your lordship that the large quantity of naval stores taken in the royal magazines at cavite supply most excellent materials for this purpose in which the admiral is indefatigable whose zeal for his majestys service great cordiality and constant attention to us during the whole course of the expedition and fatiguing progress of the siege are beyond all praise the other officers of the fleet exerted themselves to the utmost upon every occasion as a small acknowledgment of our many obligations to mr kempenfelt the admirals captain i begged his acceptance of the government of the citadel and port of cavite till it was given up to the company his prudent and excellent regulations there were of infinite utility to the public service  the captains collins pitchford and george ourry who commanded the battalion of seamen behaved with great spirit and conduct and capt jocelyn who was entrusted with the care of the disembarkations gave us all the assistance that could be wished or expected from a diligent good officer the marine officers and corpse were of great service and the seamen astonished us with most extraordinary proofs of activity and valor particularly those who assisted at our batteries  the reduction of manila has been so much owing to the consummate skill and bravery of col monson that i fear my faint representations cannot do justice to his merit and i most humbly beg leave through your lordship to recommend him to his majesty together with the following officers viz lieut col scott major barker who commanded our artillery capt fletcher major of brigade the engineers captains stephenson and cotsford and ensign barnard the captains moore and pemble aidsdecamp who have all acted in their several departments with extraordinary merit and greatly facilitated my good fortune both the royal and the companys artillery with their other troops behaved very well in the last place may i presume to point out the services of the   th regiment which from the good conduct of their former and present fieldofficers has the peculiar merit of having first stopped the progress of the french in india and not a little contributed to the happiness and decision of that war under col coote and has since extended the glory of his majestys arms to the utmost verge of asia twentythree officers with upwards of  00 men have fallen in the cause of their country since the regiment left england numbers of the survivors are wounded your lordships goodness encourages me to mention them as objects of compassion and protection captain fletcher has nine colors to lay at his majestys feet  i have the honor to he etc william draper brigadier general and commander in chief   letter from vice admiral cornish to mr cleveland dated in the bay of manila the   st of october      it is with the greatest pleasure i have the honor to acquaint their lordships with the success of his majestys arms in the reduction of the city of manila which was taken by storm on the morning of the  th instant in my letters of the   d and   st of july i acquainted their lordships with my proceedings to that time after which i used every possible means at madras for dispatch the decline of the s w monsoon making it of the utmost importance to promote this end i completed the elizabeth grafton lenox weymouth and argo with such of the troops and military stores as they were to take on board and on the   th sent them away under the command of commodore tiddeman to proceed to malacca with a view that they might complete their water there by the time i should arrive with the remainder of the squadron  having accomplished the embarkation of every thing designed for the expedition with a dispatch much beyond my expectations as we had from the whole time of my being there a violent surf to contend with i sailed the first of august with the ships undermentioned viz norfolk panther america seaford south sea castle store ships admiral stevens storeship osterly companys ship leaving the falmouth at the request of the president and council to convoy the essex india ship who was not ready to sail having the treasure to take on board the china cargoes and to bring to manila such of the companys servants as were to be put in possession of that government if the expedition succeeded  the   th i arrived at mallacca and was disappointed in not finding mr tiddeman there who did not join me till the   st having met with long calms the difficulty of watering the squadron at this place made it the   th before i could leave the road  on the  d of september i arrived off pulo timean and was joined by capt grant in the seahorse whom i had detached upon my first arrival at madrass to cruize between this island and the straits of sincapore to stop any vessels he might suspect going to manila  on the   th i made the coast of luconia but was drove off again by a strong n e wind which separated some of the squadron the   d the gale broke up and the wind shifting to the s w the   d we recovered the land again the next day entered the bay of manila and in the close of the evening anchored off the port of cavite with the whole squadron except the south sea castle and admiral stevens the falmouth and essex having joined me off the coast in the night i sent the masters to sound about the fortifications of cavite and by their report found that it might be attacked by ships  the   th in the morning the wind not being favorable to attack the cavite i took two of the frigates and with general draper and some other officers reconnoitred the shore about manila and observed some churches and other buildings to stand near the works on the south side of the town particularly toward the s w bastion we had some design of attacking cavite first to have had the convenience of that port for the shipping but considered that though the attack should be attended with all the success we could hope yet it would cause a delay at least of two days before we could land at manila which time would afford opportunity to the enemy to demolish those buidings near the works and to prepare many obstacles to our landing and perhaps recover from that consternation our unexpected arrival had thrown them in and surther manila being the capital if that fell cavite would in consequence  from these considerations i joined in opinion with the general to take advantage of circumstances so favorable for a descent and land the troops with all dispatch and endeavor to get possession of some posts near their works which if effected would greatly facilitate the reduction of the city  in consequence of these resolutions i immediately made the signal on board the seahorse for the squadron to join me and for the troops to prepare to land about seven in the evening the  th regiment with the marines in the boats under the direction of the captains parker kempenfelt and brereton pushed for the shore and under the fire of the three frigates effected the landing at a church called the moratta about a mile and a half from the walls we had no opposition from the enemy but some difficulty from the surf which ran high and bilged all the long boats but happily lost no men  the next morning the general took an advanced post about  00 yards from the glacis and there under cover of a blind intended his battery against the face of the s w bastion the number of troops being small i landed a battalion of seamen consisting of about  00 men under the command of the captains collins pitchford and george ourry  the   th i dispatched three armed boats after a galley coming up the bay to manila they came up with her resolutely boarded her and took her notwithstanding she kept up a smart fire with patteraroes and muskets she mounted two carrig and seventeen brass swivel guns and had eighty men by letters found in her we discovered she was dispatched from the galleon st philippina from acapulca and whom she had left the  0th of september at cajayaan between the embocadr and cape spiitu santa upon this discovery i came to a resolution to send the panther and argo in quest of her but it was the  th of october before the weather permitted their sailing  the   th of september the general acquainted me that he was beginning to work on the battery and that if some ships could get near enough to throw shot on the works of the town opposite to it it might take off some of the enemys fire and attention and thereby facilitate its construction in consequence of this i ordered commodore iddeman with the elizabeth and falmouth toward the town as near as the depth of water would permit and to place the ships in such a position as would best answer the purpose intended which was accordingly done the next day and their fire had a very good effect  on the  0th the south sea castle arrived with stores which were much wanted particularly the entrenching tools for want of which the army had been so greatly distressed that i was obliged to employ all the forges in making spades pickaxes etc for them the first of october it began to blow fresh and in the night increased to a hard gale which drove the south sea castle ashore near the pulverista a little to the southward of our camp this accident however had some considerable advantages attending it as the situation she lay in made her cannon a protection for the rear of our camp it was likewise the means that all her military stores were got on board with safety and dispatch and the army supplied with the provisions she had on board both of which were articles they stood in immediate need of and which could not have been supplied by boats as it continued blowing weather for several days after and the surf breaking very high on the beach  this gale was from the w s w directly on the shore which gave me much concern for the safety of the squadron particularly for the elizabeth and falmouth who were only in four fathom water and as i have been since informed struck but the bottom being mud and soft to a considerable depth they received no damage on the  th in the morning the general opened the battery which was so well managed and seconded by the ships before the town that in four hours the defenses were taken off and the next day in the evening the breach was made practicable  on the  th at day light in the morning the generals regiment with the sea battalion mounted the breach made the attack and soon got possession of all the bastions which completed the conquest i immediately went on shore and with the general had a meeting with the spanish governor and some of the principal officers when a capitulation was agreed on that the town and port of cavite with the islands and forts dependent on manila should be given up to his britannick majesty and that they should pay four millions of dollars for the preservation of the town and their effects a copy of which capitulation i have enclosed  on the  0th i sent capt kempenfelt in the norfolk with the seaford and seahorse to take possession of cavite agreeable to the capitulation by this acquisition we are in possession of a very large quantity of naval stores and beside the advantage of almost every convenience for resisting a squadron the people are supplied with fresh meat and vegetables in great plenty  the siege though short was attended with many difficulties and great fatigue in which both the officers and men exerted themselves with the utmost cheerfulness we had constant fresh gales a lee shore and consequently a high surf to contend with which made it always difficult frequently hazardous and sometimes impossible to land with boats the rains fell very heavy and our little army were surrounded and harrassed by numerous bodies of indians who though undisciplined and armed only with lances bows and arrows yet by a daring resolution and contempt of death they became not only troublesome but formidable i have the satisfaction of acquainting their lordships that throughout the whole expedition the most perfect harmony and unanimity have subsisted between his majestys land and sea forces  you will receive with this an account of the number of officers and men both seamen and marines that were landed from the squadron as likewise of the killed and wounded in each corpse it is with concern i acquaint their lordships with the loss of commodore tiddeman who in attempting to enter the river in his barge the morning after the reduction of manila was drowned with five of his people by which unhappy accident his majesty has lost a brave and experienced officer  captain kempenfelt by whom i send this and will present to you for their lordships a plan of the town of manila and the port of cavite has been of the greatest assistance to me during the course of this enterprise he is very capable of furnishing their lordships with many particulars necessary for their information and his great merit makes it my duty to recommend him as a very able and good officer  i am etc s cornish   letter from vice admiral cornish to mr cleveland dated in the bay of manila nov  0      in my letter of the   st of october i acquainted you of my having sent captain parker with the panther and argo in quest of the galeon st philippina from acapulco bound to manila  the  th instant capt king in the argo returned with a letter from capt parker acquainting me that in consequence of my orders having the  0th of october got the length of the island capul near the entrance into the embocadera in pursuit of the st philippina where the argo had come to an anchor and which he intended to do for that night just as the day closed saw a sail and standing to the northward at eight in the evening he got sight of the chase about two leagues to leward but unluckily by the rapidity of a counter current to what the chase was in drove among the narrangos in the utmost danger of being lost and obliged to anchor the frigate having escaped the danger got up with the chase and engaged her near two hours but was so roughly handled that capt king was obliged to bring too to repair his damages by this time the current slackened which enabled capt parker to get under sail with the chase in sight about nine the next morning he came up with her and after battering her two hours within half musket shot she struck the enemy made but little resistance trusting to the immense thickness of the sides of their ship which the panthers shot was not able to penetrate except her upper works capt parker was no less disappointed than surprised when the general came on board to find that instead of the saint philippina he had engaged and taken the santissimo trinadad who departed from manila the first of august for acapulco and had got three hundred leagues to the eastward of the embocadero but meeting with a hard gale of wind was dismasted and put back to refit she had eight hundred men on board and pierced for sixty guns but when capt king engaged her had only six mounted and but thirteen when taken she draws thirtythree feet water and is a much larger ship than the panther i cannot ascertain the value of the cargo but there is to the amount of one million and a half of dollars registered and she is reputed so be worth three millions  capt king left the panther with her prize at anchor about three leagues south of the corrigedow at the mouth of this bay and as i have sent a reinforcement of men with launches and warps i hope very soon to have her in safety  i am etc s cornish officers killed and wounded etc belonging to the norfolk lieut peter porter and mr white surgeons second mate killed  lenox thomas spearing

off cavita oct         s cornish       but these immense captures though they enriched individuals contributed nothing directly to the public service however they might be said to contribute something to it indirectly by increasing the stock of the nation and supplying that prodigious drain of treasure which for several years had been made from this kingdom for foreign subsidies and for the maintenance of armies abroad if it had not been for such pecuniary supplies with which the uncommon successes of this war were attended it never could have been maintained in the extent to which it was carried notwithstanding the increase of trade which has been uniformly progressive for the last three years it has in a loose way been computed that the success of our arms in the east indies independently of the great increase of valuable merchandise which used to be formerly the sole produce and advantage of the east india commerce has brought into england during the war near six millions in treasure and jewels  the capture of the spanish register ship the hermione and that of the santissimo trinidad a manila ship must be added to these resources the first of these was worth little less than a million sterling and the other at least three millions of dollars the taking of these ships is not altogether unworthy a place in history because it had no small influence on the affairs of the bourbon alliance and considerably sunk those resources of money which were the principal objects to france when she formed that famous treaty all these advantages were without any considerable allay on the side of great britain they would have served to balance any possible success which the enemy might have had in portugal but their success in that quarter where they had entertained the most sanguine hopes was by no means considerable and very far from tending to any thing decisive these considerations helped to dispose the bourbon courts to peace almost as soon as they had jointly entered into the war and europe after having been deceived in the hopes of tranquillity which were entertained from the late negotiation and plunged apparently deeper than ever into war was in reality approaching fast to peace and the public repose was preparing when it seemed to be at the greatest distance  chap ix proposals for peace state of the ministry and parties dukes of

bucker muhl french take amonebourg cassel surrendered to the allies war in westphalia concluded  when france had found experimentally that the present at least was not the favorable time for drawing from her alliance all those advantages with which she flattered herself she inclined in good earnest to peace the sincerity of her procedure in the former negotiation might be justly questioned because she had prepared an after game in case of its breaking off and she so much relied on it that it is very possible the negotiation itself was but a feint made to cover and to prepare that project but finding that great britain was neither intimidated by the threats of that formidable alliance nor at all likely to be reduced by the exertion of its forces she came in good earnest into these pacific sentiments which formerly she had only counterfeited the slow progress of the bourbon troops in portugal the retrograde motion of the french army in germany the taking of martinico and its dependencies and the imminent danger in which they beheld the havannah all conspired to humble the pride and dash the hopes of the bourbon alliance  on the side of great britain likewise the dispositions to peace became much more cordial no people were ever less intoxicated with their successes victories were become familiar to us and made but little impression the marks of public joy on the most considerable conquests were become much slighter and colder than were showed at the beginning of the war upon very trivial advantages besides the nation had occasion for peace though her trade had been greatly augmented a circumstance without example favorable and though many of her conquests as we have seen were very far from unlucrative her supplies of money great as they were did not keep pace with her expenses the supply of men too which was necessary to furnish the waste of so extensive a war became sensibly diminished and the troops were not recruited but with some difficulty and at a heavy charge it was time to close the war when every end we could rationally propose to ourselves in carrying it on was answered we had enough in our hands to answer all our demands and almost all our expectations and as it is grown into a sort of maxim that nations greatly victorious must cede something on a peace the difficulty on our side was only what and how much we should retain not that there was a doubt but whatever choice of acquisition could be made upon any rational principles a great deal would still remain to give the fullest scope to every sentiment of equity and moderation  all these were sufficient inducements to peace but other things operated as causes an alteration in the system of the british ministry had begun this war another alteration put an end to it  the whole council had been almost unanimous to oppose mr pit in his scheme for precipitating the declaration of war against spain they thought his principles too violent and they did not perfectly like his person when he retired from public business it seemed as if they breathed more freely and had got rid of a burden that oppressed them but he was not long removed when it appeared that the remaining part of the system was framed upon principles so very discordant in themselves that it was by no means likely to stand  the duke of newcastle first lord of the treasury by his early zeal in favor of the protestant succession by the liberal and politic use he had made of a great fortune by the obligations which in a course of many years and in a succession of great employments he was enabled to confer on some of the most considerable people in the kingdom had attached a great number to his fortunes and formed an interest in the parliament and the nation which it was extremely difficult to overturn or even to shake he came to be considered as the head of the whigs and he was in reality well qualified in many respects for the chief of a party from his unbounded liberality from his affability magnificence and personal disinterestedness even the defects and faults which might have appeared in his character were rather of service to him as they often tended to soften resentments and helped to give that great power of which he was possessed an appearance less formidable  during a great part of the late kings reign his family had directed all things without control on the accession of his present majesty his situation seemed more doubtful but in a little time he appeared outwardly as well established as ever not only in his former high employments but in that share of influence which is commonly supposed to attend it there was however very little reality in this specious appearance for he did not possess the royal confidence upon which all the essential of power depends neither his age nor his situation in the former reign had allowed him the opportunity of cultivating an interest with the present king another noble person the earl of bute had been in an employment near his person and having formed his mind with much attention and success to those virtues which adorn his station deserved and obtained a very uncommon share of his confidence  this nobleman was first groom of the stole afterward taking a more open share in the conduct of affairs he accepted the seals as secretary of state on the removal of mr pit who preserved a sort of union in the administration by their common dread of him the only competition was between the duke of newcastle and lord bute the former could not well endure that decay of influence which on a thousand occasions he must have sensibly felt and which the great rank he held must have rendered only more painful lord bute on the other hand could not bear to see the treasury board which under whatever limitations was attended with so much power in the hands of his rival it is indeed a department the entire conduct of which is absolutely essential to the person who has any pretensions to be at the head of the british administration  these principles soon produced their natural effect in a short time the duke of newcastle thought himself obliged to resign  in this condition of parties a number of those called whigs who had lost their places being highly irritated at the late changes and even many of those who still continued in employments being supposed attached to the interest of the duke of newcastle and therefore not to be depended on by the new administration it became necessary to have recourse to those called tories or country gentlemen  from the beginning of this reign it had been professed with the general applause of all good men to abolish those odious party distinctions and to extend the royal favor and protection equally to all his majestys subjects the persons called tories had besides been before active in support of some of those who now clamoured at the very measures which they had themselves more than once adopted however occasion was taken from thence to endeavor at the revival of this almost exploded distinction there were great heats which were blown into a combustion by every art and every instrument of party that had ever proved effectual upon similar occasions  whilst the nation was thus distracted the conduct of a war became difficult its continuance unsafe and its supplies uncertain if the administration failed their failure would be construed into incapacity if they succeeded their success would be converted into an argument for such terms of peace as it would be impossible for them to procure above all the ancient and known connection between the chiefs of the moneyed interest and the principal persons in the opposition must have been a subject of great anxiety to the administration  these causes cooperated to render the intentions of the british ministry toward peace altogether cordial and sincere and they thought themselves abundantly justified in their wishes for it at this juncture both from the successes and the burdens of the nation from the flourishing state of some of their allies and the doubtful state of others and in general from those arguments of humanity which made it high time that europe should enjoy some interval of repose  both courts thus concurring in the same point all difficulties were speedily smoothed it is said that the first overtures were made under the mediation of his sardinian majesty as soon as terms were proposed in order to give a pledge to each other of their mutual sincerity it was agreed that this treaty should not be negotiated as the former had been by subordinate persons but that the two courts should reciprocally send to london and versailles a person of the first consequence and distinction in either kingdom accordingly the duke of bedford was sent to negotiate on the part of england and the duke de nivernois on that of france the great outlines of the treaty were very soon explained and adjusted the detail of some articles took up more time  during this mixed interval of war and treaty the french obtained a temporary advantage but which neither suspended nor influenced the negotiation it was the last offensive effort which they made and though this enterprise was attended with a temporary success in the execution it was in the design not superior to any of those that had failed monsieur de ternay with a squadron of four men of war and a bomb ketch and m d hausonville with a proportionable number of land forces arrived the   th of june at the bay of bulls in newfoundland and finding the island little prepared to resist them took without difficulty the forts of st john trinity and carbonear destroyed the two last and likewise the stages and implements of the fishery to a considerable value the immense extent of our military operations rendered it little wonderful or blameable that this particular part was found weak  the french presumed by far too much on the supineness of the nation when they hoped such an advantage could have any great effect on the negotiation in fact as soon as the news arrived in england a force was fitted out to retake those places but such was the vigilance and readiness of general amherst our commander in america that it superseded the necessity of this armament he detached colonel amherst with a body of forces and lord colville with a small but sufficient squadron to recover this valuable island the land forces attacked some detachments of the french advantageously posted in the neighborhood of st johns and prepared to attack st johns itself with so much vigor and activity that m dhausonville who had remained there as governor thought proper to deliver up that place and surrendered himself and garrison prisoners of war colonel amhersts letter to the earl of egremont

intelligence his lordship had received i was obliged to change my resolution of landing the troops at kitty vitty a narrow entrance close to the harbor of st johns the enemy having entirely stopped up the passage by sinking shallops in the channel  from the best information i could get it appeared that torbay about three leagues to the northward of st johns was the place to land the troops at within that district  lord colville sent the siren man of war into torbay with the transports and it was late at night on the   th before they all came to an anchor capt douglas of his majestys ship siren went with me to view the bay and we found a very good beach to land on it blew hard in the night and one of the transports with the provincial light infantry corpse on board was driven out to sea  i landed the troops early the next morning at the bottom of the bay from whence a path led to st johns a party of the enemy fired some shots at the boats as they rowed in the light infantry of the regulars landed first gave the enemy one fire and drove them toward st johns the battalions landed and we marched on the path for four miles very narrow through a thick wood and over very bad ground  capt mdonnells light infantry corpse in front came up with some of the party we drove from the landing place they had concealed themselves in the wood fired upon us and wounded three men a part of mdonnells corpse rushed in upon them took three prisoners and drove the rest off  the country opened afterward and we marched to the left of kitty vitty it was necessary to take possession of this pass to open a communication for the landing of artillery and stores it being impracticable to get them up the way we came  as soon as our right was close to kitty vitty river the enemy fired upon us from a hill on the opposite side i sent a party up a rock which commanded the passage over and under cover of their fire the light infantry companies of the royal and montgomerys supported by the grenadiers of the royal passed drove the enemy up the hill and pursued them on that side toward st johns when i perceived a body of the enemy coming to their support i immediately ordered over major sutherland with the remainder of the first battalion upon which they thought proper to retreat and we had just time before dark to take post  capt mackenzie who commanded montgomerys light infantry was dangerously wounded we took ten prisoners the troops lay this night on their arms  the next morning the   th we opened the channel where the enemy had sunk the shallops they had a breastwork which commanded the entrance and a battery not quite finished  lieut col tullikin who had met with an accident by a fall and was left on board joined me this day and capt ferguson commanding the artillery brought round some light artillery and stores from torbay in the shallops  the enemy had possession of two very high and steep hills one in the front of our advanced posts and the other nearer to st johns which two hills appeared to command the whole ground from kitty vitty to st johns it was necessary that we should proceed on this side to secure effectually the landing at the kitty vitty from the first hill the enemy fired upon our posts  on the   th just before daybreak i ordered capt mdonnells corpse of light infantry and the provincial light infantry supported by our advanced posts to march to surprise the enemy on this hill capt mdonnell passed their centries and advanced guards and was first discovered by their main body on the hill as he came climbing up the rocks near the summit which he gained receiving the enemys fire he threw in his fire and the enemy gave way  capt mdonnell was wounded lieut schuyler of his company killed with three or four men and eighteen wounded  the enemy had three companies of grenadiers and two picquets at this post commanded by lieut col belcombe second in command who was wounded a captain of grenadiers wounded and taken prisoner his lieut killed several men killed and wounded and    taken prisoners  the enemy had one mortar here with which they threw some shells at us in the night a sixpounder not mounted and two wall pieces  this hill with one adjoining commands the harbor  the   th we advanced to the hill nearer st johns which the enemy had quitted twentynine shallops came in to day with artillery and stores provision and camp equipage from torbay which we unloaded i moved the remainder of the troops forward leaving a post to guard the pass of kitty vitty on the other side last night the enemys fleet got out of the harbor this night we lay on our arms  the   th a mortar battery was completed and a battery begun for four   pounders and two   pounders about  00 yards from the fort made the road from the landing for the artillery and at night opened the mortar battery with one eight inch mortar and seven cohorns and six royals the enemy fired pretty briskly from the fort and threw some shells  the   th in the morning i received a letter from count de hassonville of which i do myself the honor to enclose to your lordship a copy as also of my answer with copies of other letters that passed and of the capitulation  as lord colville at this time was some distance off the coast and the wind not permitting his lordship to stand in to honor me with his concurrence in the terms to be given to the garrison i thought no time should be lost in so advanced a season and therefore took upon me to determine it hoping to meet with his lordships approbation and he has given me the greatest pleasure by entirely approving of everything i have done  i must beg leave to say my lord that every assistance we could possibly desire from the fleet has been given us lord colville upon the short notice he had of our joining him having labored to get together all the shallops he could and with which we were so amply supplied was a measure of essential service and without which our operations must have been considerably retarded  the indefatigable labor and persevering ardour of the troops i have the honor to command so necessary toward completing the conquest before the bad season set in did indeed exceed what i could have expected lieut col tullikin seconded me in every thing as i could wish  capt mdonnell of col frazers regiment having sir jeffery amhersts leave to go to england was to have delivered this to your lordship but his leg is broken by the wound he received which keeps him here may i humbly presume my lord to recommend this gentleman to your lordships protection as a real brave and good officer  lord colville intends sending his majestys ship siren immediately to england i send capt campbell of the   d regiment with these dispatches who will inform your lordship of any particulars you may desire to know  i do myself the honor to transmit to your lordship such returns as i can possibly get in time to show the true state of the french troops and garrison here  i am with the most profound respect my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant william amherst capt campbell has brought with him the french colors which were hoisted on the fort of st johns     lord colvilles letter to mr cleveland dated st johns newfoundland september  0      sir i had the honor of sending you an account of my proceedings until the   th of august by a vessel which sailed from placentia for england at that time and on the   d i sailed with his majestys ships the northumberland antelope gosport and siren and the king george belonging to the province of massachusetts bay on the   th we chased a schooner off st johns and took her close to the harbours mouth she had been an english privateer taken by the enemy had eight carriage guns mounted and was manned with thirty frenchmen commanded by an ensign de vaisseau  the enemy had sent away great part of the inhabitants of st johns men women and children by giving them vessels and provisions to carry them where they pleased two of these a sloop and a schooner we met with on the coast and took twentythree irishmen that were single men out of them to replace in part the marines of the squadron that were left in garrison at placentia and the isle of boys these irishmen said that if i would go into the bay of bulls numbers of their countrymen would resort to me and enter on board the squadron but during two days which i stayed in that bay not a man joined me the few inhabitants that remained there quietly followed their business of fishing and it is possible the enemy prevented any others at st johns from coming  mr garland and mr davis two of the principal inhabitants of harbor grace and carbonera in conception bay having acquainted me that a number of men in their neighborhood were willing to serve in the squadron during the present exigency i sent the armed schooner for them and she returned with fifty men which i have distributed among the ships and the same gentlemen representing that the enemy sometimes sends small parties by land to portugal cove which have threatened to molest them in shallops from that place desired in behalf of themselves and all their neighbors that the schooner might be stationed in conception bay for their protection and defense which request i complied with  the island of carbonera in conception bay has had no other garrison for many years but a few old men of the artillery to take care of the guns and ordnance stores had some of the inhabitants of the adjacent coast taken post here they might easily have defended it against any force except one narrow landing place and no safe road in the neighborhood for great ships but the enemy landed in boats and destroyed the whole without resistance and the isle of boys near ferryland would probably have shared the same fate had it not been possessed in due time by the syrens marines  in frequently passing the harbours mouth of st johns we could plainly see that the fort which fronts the entrance was fortifyed all round the new works and that a redoubt or something like one was raised at the little harbor of kitty vitty the old battery at the south side of the harbours mouth was repaired with additional works and a new one erected on the same side nearer the entrance all these were to be seen from the sea and i could not learn that the enemy intended any thing more than the finishing these works  on the  th of september i received by a sloop express from halifax letters from sir jeffery amherst at new york acquainting me that he had come to a resolution to send a body of troops in order to dislodge the enemy as soon as possible from st johns and that lieut col amherst was to command these troops the same conveyance brought me letters from col amherst acquainting me with his arrival at halifax on the   th of august his departure from thence on the first of september and with his intention to call at louisbourg for the troops there and then proceed round cape race to join me on this coast upon receipt of these letters i sent the soop which brought them to look out for col amherst and the transports off cape race and in order to join them the sooner to concert measures for the ensuing operations before the enemy could have notice of their arrival i dropped down with the squadron to cape broyle but mr gili of st johns who had been sent out of the town in a cartel schooner two days before sending off advice from ferryland that he was sure the enemy intended to sail in a very little time i returned with the squadron to our station off st johns  on the   th we were joined by col amherst with the troops in ten transport vessels and i proposed torbay as the properest place to land at it is to the northward of st johns about seven miles by land and the roads pretty good but the bay is not reckoned safe anchorage being open to the easterly winds which usually begin to prevail at this season by one of the transports from new york i received a duplicate the original not yet come to hand of their lordships order of the  th of june directing me to repair myself or send a sufficient force to enable capt graves of the antelope to defeat the designs of the squadron commanded by m de ternay  on the   th we proceeded to torbay i sent capt douglas in the siren to anchor with the transports accompanied by the boats of the squadron and a number of shallops or fishing boats which i had collected from different parts for the kings service with the rest of the ships i returned to my station close to st johns harbor next morning col amherst landed with the troops in the head of the bay having only four men wounded from a distant bushfiring of the enemy he marched directly to kitty vitty and made himself master of that important post in the evening without having a man killed and only two or three wounded every thing belonging to the army was carried from torbay to kitty vitty in shallops escorted by boats from the squadron and this service was conducted with diligence and care by mr dugdale my first lieutennant capt douglas having joined the squadron again the enemys fleet was to have sailed the morning i passed the harbor with the transports and  00 men only were to be left in st johns for the winter but upon seeing us they landed their grenadiers again  the   th it blew strong from e to e s e with thick rainy weather in the evening the wind shifted to the westward light breezes and thick fog at six next morning it being calm with a great swell we saw from the masthead but could bring them down no lower than half way the topmast shrouds four sail bearing s s e distant seven ieagues the mouth of st johns harbor at the same time bore w four leagues we lost sight of them about seven though very clear and some time after a small breeze springing up in the s w quarter i stood in toward torbay in order to cover the shallops that might by going from thence to kitty vitty  in the afternoon i received a note from col amherst acquainting me that the french fleet got out last night thus after being blocked up in st johns harbor for three weeks by a squadron of equal number but smaller ships with fewer guns and men did m ternay make his escape in the night by a shameful flight i beg leave to observe that not a man in the squadron imagined the four sail when we saw them where the enemy and the pilots were of opinion that they must have had the wind much stronger than with us to overcome the westerly swell in the harbours mouth i sent the king george round cape race as far as trepassy to bring me intelligence if the enemy should steer toward placentia and i directed capt douglas of the siren to get the transports moved from torbay as a very unsafe road to the bay of bulls  a bomb battery was opened against the fort in the night of the   th and next day it capitulated before any other battery began to play  the squadron got into the harbor yesterday morning and in the evening i received their lordships order of the  d of august sent me by capt palliser of the shrewsbury who with the superbe bedford and minerva had just arrived on the coast i have directed capt palliser with the other ships to come into the harbor as soon as a convenient opportunity offers for so doing  we have about eight hundred prisoners grenadiers picquets and some marines being a very fine body of men and nearly equal in number to the regulars of our army i am now preparing transports to carry them to breast  the enemy did not intend to leave so great a part of their force here their grenadiers were ready for embarking but m de ternay seemed determined at all events to grasp an opportunity which if once lost might never be regained therefore in the utmost confusion he left behind his grenadiers anchors and turned his boats a drift when they had towed him out the fog was so thick that lieut col tullikin who was posted on an eminence in the narrowest part of the harbours mouth could hear their noise but could not discern any of their ships the fog even altered the direction of the sound which seemed to come from another part of the harbor whilst they must have been directly under him  there is a considerable quantity of provisions and other goods at this place collected and tumbled promiscuously into different storehouses by the enemy many of the irish servants have also been robbing and plundering their masters to ascertain property in order to make restitution as far as can be and to restore regularity to a country so long distracted by being in the enemys possession will be the particular care of governor graves who in my opinion is well qualified for such an office and as he will stay here he will be able in a great measure to restore the affairs of this country  capt douglas of the siren has behaved with spirit and activity and exerted every talent of a good officer during this expedition and without adding any more officers to the corpse i am happy in the opportunity of sending him to wait on their lordships   the following letters having something in them very particular we shall subjoin them here leaving our readers to make such observations as may occur sir i now being under some doubt of st johns and placentia in newfoundland this summer as the squadron from breast is sailed i read in the newspapers whither can they go but to newfoundland and as a loyal subject to his majesty and a great friend to trade in which i have suffered much by being too enterprising i do therefore most humbly offer my thoughts for the good of my king and country that is i really think from my heart that said breast squadron is gone to newfoundland many of our newfoundland ships being taken the last year the common enemy must know the slender force of our newfoundland convoy in those parts and was a small squadron of his majestys ships to go soon to newfoundland and return again after examining into the safety of that valuable island and trade may likely save many of his majestys subjects from ruin and prevent the common enemy a ooting in the newfoundland fishery  you will please to communicate these my thoughts to their lordships which i humbly think with submission is worthy at this time of their consideration  i have by long experience some judgment in sea affairs as also a willingness to serve my king and country these will plead an excuse in my behalf to their lorships for this trouble  i am etc   to john cleveland esquire answer admiraltyoffice june   th      sir i have received and communicated to my lords commissioners of the admiralty your letter of the  th instant with respect to the apprehension you are under that the breast fleet is gone for newfoundland  your very humble servant j cleveland     before sept    lord colville could arrive from the place where the troops had been landed to cooperate with them m de ternay escaped with the fleet partly by having gained a considerable distance before they were discovered by means of a thick fog and partly because lord colville after their having been discovered did not apprehend that they really were the enemys ships  it was in germany that the greatest efforts were made even after the negotiations had been considerably advanced the military operations were in that country no way slackened the body under the marshal destrees and soubise being streightened in the manner we have seen by the incomparable judgment of prince ferdinands measures had been obliged to call that under the prince of conde from the lower rhine to their assistance in order to complete their junction with this corpse the grand army uncovered cassel quitted the banks of the fulda and fell back to a considerable distance the hereditary prince of brunswick who had attended this corpse all along thought at length a fair opportunity had occurred of striking a decisive blow against it which was posted at a place called the heights of johannisberg near the banks of the wetter at first his success was answerable to his own expectations and the courage of his troops he drove the enemy entirely from the high grounds into the plain but whilst he pursued his advantage the body he attacked was reinforced by the main army the action which began so favorable for the allies ended in a defeat they lost above three thousand men in killed wounded and prisoners the hereditary prince who had through the whole action made the most powerful efforts and exposed himself to the greatest dangers received a wound from a musketball in his hipbone from which his life was a long time doubtful and his recovery lingering and tedious whilst his life continued in danger the concern was unusual and common to both armies both taking an interest in the preservation of a prince as much endeared by his humanity as admired for his valor and military genuis  a victory of the greatest importance could not have more fully displayed the superiority of prince ferdinands capacity in the conduct of a war than his measures after this defeat the french were not suffered to derive the smallest advantage from their victory nor did the allies lose a foot of ground the communication with cassel was still at the mercy of the allies the french in their retreat had thrown a garrison of ten thousand men in that place and the prince made immediate and vigorous preparations to besiege it  when the prince had adjusted his army to cover the siege the french took advantage of his movement for that purpose to repass the lahan near giessen and advanced toward marpurg but as they advanced the prince drew his army from the siege and made such dispositions as enabled him to fall at once upon their flank and rear drove them from all their posts  after this successful affair the body of the army resumed their preparations for the siege of cassel which was now become the grand object of the campaign and the great purpose of the endeavors of both armies was of the one to open the communication with cassel of the other to cut it off  a number of skirmishes happened in these movements the most remarkable among them was the affair of bucker muhl the allied troops as they passed to and from the redoubt were for a length of four hundred paces exposed to all the enemys cannon loaded with grape shot  the situation of the french was nearly the same a dreadful fire was supported between these resolute bodies without a moments intermission or the least slackening on one side or the other for near fifteen hours from the dawn of day to dark night neither side gave way and this most bloody contest for a most trifling object in the end left the allies in the possession of their redoubt and the french of their mill the whole compass of military history furnishes no instance of so obstinate a dispute the allies lost six hundred men in killed and wounded toward the close of the day the dead bodies served to raise a parapet for the redoubt in the place of that which had been beat to pieces by the cannonade  the french are thought to have suffered more in this action than the allies however though they did not succeed in their attack upon the bridge they battered at the same time the castle of amonebourg with so much fury that in a short time they effected a breach and obliged the garrison to surrender by this advantage they gained a good deal of ground and even got on the rear of the allied army but with this advantage considerable as it was they were able to do nothing decisive they were able neither to raise nor materially to disturb the siege of cassel which went on without interruption nor where they able to throw the least relief into this place where their garrison already began to suffer for want of provisions  this capital of an unfortunate principality which has so often been taken and retaken during the course of this war dispairing of relief at length surrendered to the victorious arms of the allies without any difficulty but the signing of the preliminaries of peace  these preliminaries had very little to do toward completing the relief of our allies except that they set the seal on their good fortune and prevented their being exposed any longer to the chances of war this campaign though it was not distinguished by any great decisive victory was not the less honorable to the commander or the troops a connected series of judicious and spirited operations produced all the effects which could be proposed from a single and brilliant stroke at this period the french after having for six years exerted almost the whole undivided strength of their monarchy upon this single object were in the end very little more advanced than they were the day they first set their foot in germany the possession of three or four poor unimportant places was all they had purchased by many millions of treasure expended and possibly near two hundred thousand lives thrown away  the whole body of the allies acquired great and just glory in this war but the english had all along the post of honor and obtained the highest reputation as to their commander the duke of brunswick having begun his operations almost without an army having continued the war with an army always inferior in numbers having experienced every variety of fortune his capacity and his firmness carried him with credit through all and enabled him to conclude the war with a triumphant superiority he may now enjoy in the honorable repose which his exploits have purchased for himself and his country the best of rewards the consciousness of public service posterity will consider him as the deliverer of germany  the english troops after so many fatigues and dangers at length enjoyed the prospect of a speedy return to their country but a general damp was cast suddenly on their joy by the illness of lord granby who was attacked by a very dangerous and long continued fever the marquis of granbys letter of thanks to the british forces in germany dated munster jan        lord granby hoped to have had it in his power to have seen and taken his leave of the troops before their embarkation for england but a severe illness having detained him at warburg and his present state of health obliging him to take another route he could not leave this country without this public testimony of his entire approbation of their conduct since he has had the honor of commanding them  these sentiments naturally call for his utmost acknowledgments he therefore returns his warmest thanks to the generals officers and private men composing the whole british corpse for the bravery zeal discipline and good conduct he has constantly experienced from every individual and his most particular and personal thanks are due to them for their ready obedience upon all occasions to such orders as his station obliged him to give  his best endeavors have always been directed to their good by every means in his power and he has the satisfaction to think he has some reason to flatter himself of their being convinced if not of the efficacy at least of the sincerity of his intentions if he may judge by the noble return their behavior has made him a behavior that while it fills him with gratitude has endeared them to their king and country and has covered them with glory and honor  highly sensible of their merit he shall continue while he lives to look upon it as much his duty as it will for ever be his inclinations to give them every possible proof of his affection and esteem which he should be happy to make as apparent as their valor has been  exemplary to after ages    it is impossible to express the concern of the whole army during this anxious interval or the joy which enlivened every breast on his recovery no commander had ever been more distinguished for an enterprising and generous courage and none half so much for an unlimitted benevolence the sick and wounded soldier the officer whose income was unequal to his rank or his necessities in him found a never failing and never burdensome resource whatever could be done to animate the soldiery to make them cheerful in the service to alleviate the hardships of war was exerted beyond what could be thought possible in the limits of a private fortune and the satisfaction of the giver went always beyond the actual benefit because in his greatest liberality it was evident that he wished to do a thousand times more by his whole conduct he inspired foreigners with a favorable idea of the english nobility his character is indeed such as we are apt in romantic ideas fondly to conceive of our old english barons it is with pleasure we attempt however feebly to do justice to the merit of those men living or dead who in this memorable war have contributed to raise this country to a pitch of glory in which it has not been exceeded by any other in ancient or modern times future history will pay them a reward more adequate to their merits  chap x siege and surrender of schweidnitz war transferred to saxony austrians defeated at freyberg prussians ravage the empire preliminaries of peace between great britain and france disputes concerning them mr fox comes into administration preliminaries approved by parliament peace of hubertsbourg between austria and prussia conclusion  whilst the courts of london and versailles were making so considerable a progress toward peace those of vienna and berlin seemed to remit nothing of their ancient animosity the king of prussia deprived of the assistance but at the same time freed from the hostilities of the russians directed his whole force and attention toward the single object of driving the austrians out of silesia  prince henry who commanded in saxony contented himself with acting upon the defensive the king in person carried on the siege of schweidnitz almost in the presence of marshal daun who scarce made any attempts to relieve it but whatever deficiency there might have been in the spirit of the grand army of the austrians it was amply compensated by the obstinate bravery of the garrison which resisted all the attacks of the prussians for near two months from the opening of the trenches it is said that the attack was conducted and the defense made by two engineers who had written on the subject of the attack and defense of places and they were now practically engaged to prove the superiority of their several systems  however this may be schweidnitz cost the king of prussia a great deal of time many laborious efforts and a number of men the brave garrison to the number of eight thousand men prisoners were drowned at the mouth of the oder on their passage to their intended confinement at konigsberg only nine men of the whole number escaped  the king of prussia now master of schweidnitz and consequently of silesia turned his attention to saxony where he considerably reinforced his brothers army and made preparations which indicated a design of laying siege to dresden  in saxony also the austrians began to exert themselves with great spirit and made some progress under the generals stolberg and haddick they obtained considerable advantages in several encounters over the army of prince henry and even pushed them back to freyberg the possession of which place they prepared to dispute with the prussians  but here fortune which has seldom proved long constant to their arms entirely forsook them the united army of imperalists and austrians was attacked by prince henry  the austrians attributed this defeat to the treachery of one of their superior officers who was soon after taken into custody but whilst they were inquiring into the cause of their disaster and preparing to punish the author of it the prussians were pushing the advantages which their victory afforded them with all imaginable alacrity and this they were enabled to do with the greatest effect by means of a partial cessation of hostilities which the austrians were so imprudent as to conclude with the king of prussia for silesia and the electoral saxony only without foreseeing the danger or providing for the safety either of their own immediate dominions or of those members of the empire which were the most attached to their interests and which were now exposed to the attempts of a bold rapacious and exasperated enemy  one body of the prussian army broke into bohemia pushed on almost to the gates of prague and destroyed a capital magazine another fell upon the same country on another quarter and laid the town of egra almost in ashes by a bombardment and a cannonade of red hot bullets some extended themselves all over saxony others penetrated into the furthest parts of franconia and even as far as suabia ravaging the country exacting the most exorbitant contributions and spreading dismay and confusion upon every side the diet of the empire sitting at ratisbon did not think themselves in safety but were beginning to fly and preparing to remove their records  the free city of nuremberg so famous for the ingenious industry and pacific disposition of its inhabitants suffered the most by this invasion having been obliged to pay contribution to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds of our money it has been supposed that in this expedition the prussians raised a sum equal to the annual subsidy which had formerly been paid by great britain to their sovereign many of the states found themselves obbliged to sign a neutrality in order to save their territories from further ravages  and now a great part of the empire being already included in the peace between great britain and france and the rest tied down by this neutrality entirely disabled by the late defeat or exhausted by the subsequent incursions were no longer in a condition to furnish an army under the imperial name and authority after the whole alliance had been thus gradually dissolved the affair was at length left to be decided as it was begun by the single arms of austria and prussia so that there was great reason to hope as the war in germany had succeeded immediately to the rupture between great britain and france the peace between these powers would also lead to the speedy pacification of the empire  the preliminaries had been signed by the british and french ministers at fountainbleau on the third of november and it is necessary for the completion of our design that we should here give some account of the definitive treaty which was built upon them  the reader will recollect that in the negotiation of      it was laid down as a principal by the two courts that their respective propositions in case the treaty should by any accident be broken off were to be considered as retracted or never made at that time we remarked that these propositions would probably have their influence notwithstanding this provision because as we then observed things once settled and agreed to unavoidably stamp their own impression upon any future negotiation relative to the same subject it happened very nearly as was then foreseen for as far as we can judge the negotiation did not set out upon any new or peculiar principle of its own but seemed to assume as a basis those points which were nearest to an adjustment in the preceding treaty and to commence where that transaction concluded  the spirit of the two negotiations so far as regarded the peculiar interest of great britain seems to have been perfectly similar there was scarcely any other difference than that great britain in consequence of her successes since that time acquired more than she then demanded but still the general idea on which she acquired was nearly or altogether the same but with regard to some of our allies the principal was greatly varied and we imagine that this change was sufficiently justified by the alteration which happened in the affairs of germany during the interval between the two treaties those who conducted the negotiation in      were steady in rejecting every proposition in which they were not left at liberty to aid the king of prussia with the whole force of great britain those who concluded the peace in      paid less attention to the interests though they did not wholly neglect the safety of that monarch at the beginning of the year and before they had entered into the negotiation they refused to renew that article of the annual treaty by which our court had engaged to conclude no peace without the king of prussia though at the same time they declared themselves willing to assist him with the usual subsidy he on his part refused the subsidy unconnected with that article some coldness grew between the two courts from this time forward  the adjustment of affairs in the empire seemed to form no material impediment to the progress of the treaty both parties readily agreed to withdraw themselves totally from the german was they thought and rightly that nothing could tend so much to give peace to their respective allies as mutually to withdraw their assistance from them and to stop that current of english and french money which as long as it ran into germany would be sure to feed a perpetual war in that country  circumstanced as affairs then were this conduct on our side was as defensible as the conduct which we held in      at that time the affairs of the king of prussia were at the lowest ebb he was overpowered by the whole weight of austria of sweden of the empire and of russia as determined as ever in her enmity and then successful to say nothing of france neither generosity nor perhaps sound policy ought to have permitted us to desert him in that situation but when the last treaty was made the condition of his affairs was absolutely reversed he had got rid of the most powerful and one of the most implacable of his enemies he had concluded a peace with sweden the treaty itself freed him from all apprehensions of france he had then none to contend with but a nominal army of the empire and one of austria which though something more than nominal was wholly unable to oppose his progress his situation from being pitiable was become formidable it was good policy to prevent the balance of germany from being overturned to his prejudice it would have been the worst in the world to overturn it in his favor  these principles sufficiently explain and justify the different conduct of this nation at these two periods toward the king of prussia the demand of the evacuation of wesel cleves and gueldres which had been made in the first negotiation was then justly excepted to because we refused to put an end to the german war in this last the french agreed to it and with reason because we agreed in common with them to be neutral in the disputes of the empire and on these principles the peace of germany so far as it depended on great britain and france was restored the rest of europe was pacified by the stipulation for the evacuation of portugal this was indeed with regard to the contracting courts the primary object  what remained after the concerns of the allies were provided for was the adjustment of what related to the settlements and commerce of great britain and the bourbon courts the difficulty which prevented this adjustment in the preceding negotiation was the intervention of the claims of spain the attempts of the bourbon powers to intermix and confound their affairs in the preceding negotiation had a share in making the war more general on this occasion it had a contrary effect as the whole was negotiated together it facilitated the peace by affording easier methods of adjusting the system of compensation and furnishing more largely to the general fund of equavalents  the great object and the original cause of the war had been the settlement of limits in america this was therefore the first object to be attended to in the treaty and it must be observed that this point was much more accurately as well as beneficially settled than it promised to be in the negotiation of the foregoing year for the french not having ascertained the bounds between their own several possessions with great exactness than they had those between their possessions and ours it was not clear in ceding canada how much they ceded to us disputes might have arisen and did indeed immediately arise upon this subject besides the western limits of our southern continental colonies were not mentioned and those limits were extremely obscure and subject to many discussions such discussions contained in them the seeds of a new war in the last treaty it was agreed that a line drawn along the middle of the river missisippi from its source to the river iberville a small but navigable branch of the missisippi and thence along the middle of this river and the lakes of maurepas and pontchartrain which lakes communicate with both rivers to the sea should be the bounds of the two nations in north america  nothing could be more distinct than this boundary it gave us in addition to what was properly canada a very large tract of territory which the french used to include under the name of louisania to which our claims were never clearly ascertained and much less established by any possession the french have had for a long time forts and settlements in that country whereas the english never had either the one or the other and this is a consideration of no small moment in a contest concering rights in a country such as america  what added also to the rounding of our territories and cutting off the occasions of limitary disputes was the cession of florida on the part of spain this country indeed makes no great figure in the commercial world and cannot be therefore put in competition with the other conquests but from the situation of its harbors of pensacola and mobile it affords some advantages in the time of peace and very considerable ones in time of war by connecting our future settlements on the missisippi with those upon the atlantic ocean and by enabling us greatly to distress if not wholly to destroy the trade of the spaniards in case of a rupture with them the navigation of the missisippi was made common to both nations  by the treaty of utrecht which settled our northern limits and by this treaty which ascertained those to the west our possessions in america are as well defined as the nature of such a country can possibly admit they comprehend in their extent the foundation of a vast empire they have many advantages of soil and climate and many of intercourse and communication by the number of noble lakes and navigable rivers with which that part of the world abounds these circumstances afford though a distant a fair prospect of commerce to great britain when this immense country comes to be fully peopled and properly cultivated some advantages also we derive from this possession that are not only considerable but immediate among the principal of which must be reckoned the monopoly of the furr and peltry trade of north america much the greatest trade of that kind in the world and which is now we may say entirely in our hands besides the possession of canada enlarged the sphere of our fishery and took from the french an opportunity of trade which she might employ greatly to our detriment  such are the advantages fairly and without any exaggeration for which we are indebted to this part of the treaty in which the interests of great britain were well weighed and solidly provided for  the next point we shall consider is the arangement made concerning the newfoundland fishery this was a point of infinite importance and a subject of much controversy in a commercial view it is certainly of great estimation but it has been considered as even more material in a political light every body knows that these extensive fisheries are the life of many maritime places which would otherwise be of no sort of value that they are the great nurseries of seamen and consequently the great resources of the marine scarce any object could be of more importance to two nations who contended for a superiority in naval power  the more clearly therefore it was the interest of great britain to acquire the exclusive exercise of this fishery the more strongly and evidently it became the interest of france to oppose themselves to such a pretension not only a large part of her foreign trade depended on this fishery but a great part of her domestic supply besides every hope of the strength and almost of the existence of a naval power must vanish with the cession of this fishery  the english administration probably saw that france would rather run all the hazards of war than totally relinquish this object since therefore they despaired of driving the french entirely from the fishery they endeavored as much as possible to diminish its value to them in this respect they followed the plan of the former negotiation except that some improvements were added  in the first place that article of the treaty of utrecht was established by which the french were admitted to fish and to dry their fish on the northeast and northwest parts of newfoundland from cape bonavista to point biche and excluded from the rest of this island they were also permitted to fish within the gulf of st lawrence but with this limitation that they shall not approach within three leagues of any of the coasts belonging to england  this precaution was taken not only with a view of abridging the french fishery of dry cod but principally in order to prevent their landing and on that pretense forming settlements on those extensive deserts which surrounded the gulf of st lawrence otherwise this privilege might become a means of exciting new controversies between the two nations  in compensation for the cession of the isles of cape breton and st john to england we agreed to surrender to france the small island of st pierre and miquelon situated to the south of newfoundland the cession of the two former islands was unquestionably more than an equivalent for the two latter though the latter are by no means either incommodiously situated or ill circumstanced for carrying on the fishery the french stipulated to erect no fortifications on these islands nor to keep more than fifty soldiers to enforce the police in this instance the plan of the former negotiation was pursued the ideas of a resident commissary and the occasional visitation by a ship of war were omitted as regulations which were in truth more humiliating to france than in any respect advantageous to our interest  the fishery was as it had been at the treaty of utrecht divided between france and england but with less equality on this than on that occasion the french are not wholly deprived of their share but this share is considerably impaired their loss of cape breton does not appear to be fully supplied by st pierre and miquelon the considerable and growing fishery which the french had settled at gasp is taken away without hope of recovery on the whole we are thus circumstanced we have advantages in this fishery which we may certainly improve to a great superiority but we have still a rival which makes it necessary to exert ourselves with unremitting industry in order to secure it  with regard to spain she entirely desisted from the right she claimed of fishing on these coasts a more satisfactory expression could have been wished if it had been of great importance in what terms a right was renounced which for a long time had never been exercised  when the affairs of the west indies came to be settled though they caused great difference of opinion among the public they do not seem to have raised any great difficulty in the negotiation we had here made great conquests and here also we made great concessions we ceded the havannah with a considerable part of the island of cuba the islands of martinico gaudeloupe mariegalante desirade and santa lucia we retained in our hands the islands of tobago dominica st vincent and the grenades to the three former of which as well as to santa lucia which we surrendered we had an old claim the last only was a new acquisition and the three others are at present of small value  many censured with great vehemence and asperity this part of the treaty they insisted that in this treaty we had lost sight of that great fundamental principal that france is chiefly if not solely to be dreaded by us in the light of a maritime and commerical power that therefore we had by restoring to her all her valuable west india islands and by our concessions in the newfoundland fishery left in her hands the means of recovering her prodigious losses and of becoming once more formidable to us at sea that the fishery trained up an innumerable multitude of young seamen and that the west india trade employed them when they were trained that france had long since gained a decided superiority over us in this lucrative branch of commerce and supplied almost all europe with the rich commodities which are produced only in that part of the world by this commerce said they she enriched her merchants and augmented her finances whilst from a want of sugar land which has been long known and severely felt by england we at once lost the foreign trade and suffered all the inconveniences of a monopoly at home  that at the close of so expensive a war we might very reasonably demand something toward our indemnification as well as toward our security it is evident said they that our conquests in north america however they may provide for the one are altogether inadequate to the other of these ends the state of the existing trade of these conquests is extremely low the speculations of their future are precarious and the prospect at the very best very remote we stand in need of supplies which will have an effect certain speedy and considerable the retaining both or even one of the considerable french islands martinico or guadeloupe will and nothing else can effectually answer this tripple purpose the advantage is immediate it is a matter not of conjecture but of account the trade with these conquests is of the most lucrative nature and of the most considerable extent the number of ships employed by it are a great resource to our maritime power the monopoly at home is corrected and the foreign trade is recovered and what is of equal weight all that we gain on this system is made fourfold to us by the loss which ensues to france but our conquests in north america however advantageous they may prove to us in the idea of security for in that respect alone they are of any moment are of very little detriment to the commerce of france on the west india scheme of acquisition our gain and her loss go hand in hand  they insisted upon the obvious connection of this trade with that of our colonies in north america and with our commerce to the coast of africa the african trade said they will be augmented by the demand for slaves that of north america will all center in ourselves whereas if the islands are all restored a great part of the benefit of the northern colony trade must redound as it has hitherto done to those who were lately our enemies and will always be our rivals  they observed that there was nothing extravagant or overbearing in this demand that though we should retain either martinico or guadeloupe or even both these islands our conquests were such that there was still abundant matter left to display our moderation in the cession of the rest to say nothing of our many concessions in the fishery on the coast of africa and in the east indies from all which great provinces of commerce the french had been entirely driven this war and to a considerable share of which they were restored by the treaty but if further concessions must be made for which however they saw no necessity let the prodigious demand in north america be somewhat contracted by this method we loose nothing to our commerce and we do not hazard our security as we shall still be infinitely superior in strength and whenever a war breaks out that power will be most secure whose resources are most considerable  such are concisely and we flatter ourselves fairly the principal heads of argument brought by the best writers upon this side of the question they were replied to by the best writers on the other upon the following principles  that the original object of the war was the security of our colonies upon the continent that the danger to which these colonies were exposed and in consequence of that danger the immense waste of blood and treasure which ensued to great britain together with the calamities which were from the same source derived upon the four quarters of the world left no sort of doubt that it was not only our best but our only policy to guard against all possibility of the return of such evils experience has shown us that while france possesses any single place in america from whence she may molest our settlements they can never enjoy any repose and of course that we are never secure from being plunged again into those calamities from which we have at length and with so much difficulty happily emerged to remove france from our neighborhood in america or to contract her power within the narrowest limits possible is therefore the most capital advantage we can obtain and is worth purchasing by almost any concessions  they insisted that the absolute security derived from this plan included in itself an indemnification first by saving us more effectually than any other method could from the necessity of another war and consequently by giving us an opportunity of increasing our trade and lowering our debt secondly by permitting our colonies on he continent to extend themselves without danger or molestation they showed the great increase of poppulation in those colonies within a few years they showed that their trade with the mother country had uniformly increased with this population that being now freed from the molestation of enemies and the emulations of rivals unlimited in their possessions and safe in their persons our american planters would by the very course of their natural propogation in a very short time furnish out a demand of our manufactures as large as all the working hands of great britain could possibly supply that there was therefore no reason to dread that want of trade which their adversaries insinuated since north america alone would supply the deficiences of our trade in every other part of the world  they expatiated on the great variety of climates which that country contained and the vast resources which would thence arise to commerce that the value of our conquests thereby ought not to be estimated by the present produce but by their probable increase neither ought the value of any country to be solely tried on its commercial advantages that extent of territory and a number of subjects are matters of as much consideration to a state attentive to the sources of real grandeur as the mere advantages of traffic that such ideas are rather suitable to a limited and petty commonwealth like holland than to a great powerful and warlike nation that on these principles having made very large demands in north america it was necessary to relax in other parts that france would never be brought to any considerable cession in the west indies but that her power and increase there could never become formidable because the existence of her settlements depended upon ours in north america she not being any longer left a place from whence they can be supplied with provisions that in losing something of the sugar trade we lost very little else than a luxury as to the other produce of the west indies it might be in a great measure and in part already was supplied by our possessions on the continent which daily increased not only in the quantity but in the kind of its produce  we do not pretend to pass any judgment on the merits of the several sides of this question which is certainly a very difficult one we relate opinions as well as facts historically  the only point which remained to be adjusted in the west indies was the logwood trade spain consented not to disturb the english in their occupation of cutting logwood in the bay of honduras and to permit them to occupy such buildings as may be necessary for them in this occupation great britain on her side stipulated to destroy the fortifications which had been erected on that bay def tr art xvii   by this article the english acquired a solid right in this long contested trade but seemed at the same time to lose all the means of protecting it it is however difficult to point out a better method of adjusting a claim of such a peculiar nature the right we claimed was not a right to the territory nor directly to the produce but only a privilege of cutting and taking away this wood by indulgence to have insisted on the right of erecting fortifications would have been making the strongest claim to an absolute direct and exclusive dominion over the territory itself a point to which i do not find that our most extensive claims have ever been carried  in africa goree was restored to france and senegal remained to great britain def tr art x  this regulation seems to have divided the trade on this river and the adjacent coast between the two nations the english as they are now circumstanced on that part seem to be the most advantageously situated for the trade in time of peace and the french for carrying away the whole of it in time of war  with regard to the east indies all the french factories and settlements are restored to that nation in every part of india def tr art xi  although this must be regarded as a very great concession it does not however afford all those advantages to france which might be imagined at the first view first because the fortifications erected at such a vast expense in all those settlements have been totally destroyed and it cannot be expected in the present situation of the french company that they can in the course of many years if at all be restored to their former state in bengal including by an explanation annexed to the definitive treaty the kingdom of orixa they have engaged to erect no kind of fortification nor to keep any number of soldiers whatsoever secondly they have agreed to acknowledge the present reigning subas of bengal decan and the carnatick as the lawful sovereigns of these countries these princes are the greatest on the peninsula of india they are in our interest and most of them owe either the acquisition or depend for the preservation of their power upon our arms by which means our company is become in effect arbiter of the commerce and politics of that great and opulent coast extending from the ganges to cape comorin and in a great degree also of the other from the same cape to the mouth of the indus thirdly during the course of our successes the traders and the manufacturers have removed from the french to our settlements where they will have at least an equal market and a superior protection and it will be difficult if not impossible to bring them back  minorca and belleisle were to be restored to their former possessors def tr art viii and xii  the fortifications and harbor of dunkirk were to be demolished agreeable to the stipulations of former treaties def tr art xiii   this is the general outline of the late treaty the particulars given here will serve to point out the spirit and the general effect of that transaction which has been the subject of so much heat and controversy and which nothing but adulation will assert to be free from defect nor any thing but action can deny to be productive of many very great and essential advantages to this kingdom  this treaty while it remained in agitation formed a great crisis not only in the affairs of the nation but in the fortune of the new ministry toward the latter end of the summer mr fox was called in and engaged in their support though he continued in his old place of paymaster he undertook to conduct the affairs of government in the house of commons mr grenville whose employment would naturally have engaged him in that task resigned the seals of secretary of state and was appointed first lord of the admiralty the great experience and known parliamentary abilities of mr fox seemed to give new life to the affairs of the administration a more vigorous and determined conduct was from that time adopted many of those who were not perfectly attached to the new system were immediately removed from their employments and measures were taken to clear every department of every friend of the duke of newcastle  the spirit of these proceedings seemed to augment that of the opposition it was apprehended that the preliminaries would undergo a rigorous scrutiny and might possibly incur a heavy censure from parliament the terms of peace were criticized without mercy they were declared to be inglorious inadequate and insecure unequal to the great successes of the war and below the just expectations of the nation that our commerce was neglected and our allies abandoned public expectation was however entirely disappointed the preliminaries were approved without any qualification by both houses by the lords with out any division  many causes concurred to produce this moderate disposition first a very great number which included almost all the tories were engaged in the support of the administration the then chiefs of the opposition were not well agreed among themselves mr pit who was considered as a party in himself had not joined with the duke of newcastle nor seemed disposed to act with any particular body the same general plan of peace which many now in the opposition had formerly approved had been adopted in these preliminaries and evidently improved it is true it had been objected that our additional successes since that time gave us ground to expect better terms but it was answered that our national burdens and the extent of the war had increased in at least an equal proportion and that peace was become necessary to the nation  these arguments whatever weight they might have in themselves were strong against these upon whom they were rather retorted than for the first time levelled being altogether agreeable to the system which many now in opposition had always pursued and to the sentiments many of them had publicly avowed and perhaps still secretly retained on the whole it was evident that when the question came on the discontented party was found not very well united and absolutely unprovided of any regular scheme of opposition however though baffled on this occasion it has since begun to revive and to unite and though peace is happily restored with foreign powers our domestic quiet is still far from being securely established  with regard to the powers in germany the peace between england and france and the superiority of the king of prussia at the close of the campaign inspired at length though unwillingly a disposition to peace conferences were opened at hubertsberg and a treaty concluded between his prussian majesty and the empress queen as affairs in this treaty were speedily adjusted so they may be very concisely related the substance of it was no more than that a mutual restitution and oblivion should take place and each party sit down at the end of the war in the same situation in which they began it thus the king of prussia after having for six years contended against the efforts of almost all the great powers of europe by whose enmity he could be affected having stood proof against the most terrible blows of fortune enjoys at length the full reward of his uncommon magnanimity he retains his dominions in their utmost extent and having delivered his country by his incomparable talents for war he now enjoys leisure to recover it by his no less admirable talents for government scarcely was the war concluded when he began to display his attention to domestic policy and his care for the happiness of his people he imediately distributed lands to his disbanded soldiery and gave them the horses of his artillery to aid them in their cultivation  europe is new pacified and she begins to respire after a more general and a more bloody war than any the world had experienced since that which was concluded by the peace of westphalia as far as it is safe to judge concerning a system which is subject to so great and unforeseen variations and sometimes from very slight causes this peace promises a considerable duration the king of prussia will hardly again commit his affairs so miraculously retrieved to the chances of war he sees how dearly he has a second time purchased his conquest of silesia and he will hardly aim at new acquisitions the empress since she failed to reduce silesia or even to recover the smallest particle of her losses with such an exertion of her own strength and with such an alliance as never was seen united before and with which she can never flatter herself again must be convinced how vain it is to attempt any change in the present system in germany  whilst russia remained circumstanced as she seems to be at present there is a very good prospect for the tranquillity of the north  france has turned her thoughts to a much wanted economy and the reestablishment of her marine she has reduced her land forces by above one half england with out lessening the ordinary establishment of her navy has augmented her military in consequence of the extent of her conquests both nations seem sensible of the necessity of being prepared and yet quiet the bourbon courts are united but weakened the mutual jealousy of the nations which have been lately at war continues but their subjects of dispute and occasions of animosity are much lessened this is as good a situation as could reasonably be expected  we have thus accomplished our design of laying before the public a connected narrative of the events of the late most remarkable war which we have pursued from its commencement to its conclusion we have omitted no care to make it as perfect as the nature of such an undertaking would permit and we flatter ourselves that it will be thought as impartial and satisfactory as any work of the kind extant  ni
