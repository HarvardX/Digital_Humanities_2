nature and art  by mrs inchbald  the second edition  dublin  printed by william porter for p wogan p byrne j milliken j rice w jones j moore h colbert and g folingsby        nature and art chapter i at a time when the nobility of britain were said by the poet laureat to admire and protect the arts and were known by the whole nation to be the patrons of music  william and henry youths under twenty years of age brothers and the sons of a country shopkeeper who had lately died insolvent set out on foot for london in the hope of procuring by their industry a scanty subsistence  as they walked out of their native town each with a small bundle at his back each observed the other drop several tears but upon the sudden meeting of their eyes they both smiled with a degree of disdain at the weakness in which they had been caught  i am sure said william the elder i dont know why i cry  nor i neither said henry for though we may never see this town again yet we leave nothing behind us to give us cause to lament  no replied william nor any body who cares what becomes of us  but i was thinking said henry now weeping bitterly that if my poor father were alive he would care what was to become of us  he would not have suffered us to begin this long journey without a few shillings more in our pockets  at the end of this sentence william who had with some effort suppressed his tears while his brother spoke now uttered with a voice almost inarticulate  dont say any more dont talk any more about it my father used to tell us that when he was gone we must take care of ourselves and so we must i only wish continued he giving way to his grief that i had never done any thing to offend him while he was living  that is what i wish too cried henry if i had always been dutiful to him while he was alive i would not shed one tear for him now that he is gone but i would thank heaven that he had escaped from his creditors  in conversation such as this wherein their sorrow for their deceased parent seemed less for his death than because he had not been so happy when living as they ought to have made him and wherein their own outcast fortune was less the subject of their grief than the reflection what their father would have endured could he have beheld them in their present situation in conversation such as this they pursued their journey till they arrived at that metropolis which has received for centuries past from the provincial towns the bold adventurer of every denomination has stamped his character with experience and example and while it has bestowed on some coronets and mitres  on some the lasting fame of genius  to others has dealt beggary infamy and untimely death  chapter ii after a trial of three weeks passed in london a year followed during which william and henry never sat down to a dinner or went into a bed without hearts glowing with thankfulness to that providence which had bestowed on them such unexpected blessings for no longer did they presume to expect what still they presumed they deserved a secure pittance for themselves in this world of plenty their experience since they came to town had informed them that to obtain a permanent livelihood is the good fortune but of a part of those who are in want of it and the precarious earning of half a crown or a shilling in the neighborhood where they lodged by an errand or some such accidental means was the sole support which they at present enjoyed  they had sought for constant employment of various kinds and even for servants places but obstacles had always occurred to prevent their success if they applied for the situation of a clerk to a man of extensive concerns their qualifications were admitted but there must be security given for their fidelity they had friends who would give them a character but who would give them nothing else  if they endeavored for the place even of a menial servant they were too clownish and awkward for the presence of the lady of the house  and once when william who had been educated at the free grammar school of the town in which he was born and was an excellent scholar hoping to obtain the good opinion of a young clergyman whom he solicited for the favor of waiting upon him acquainted him that he understood greek and latin he was rejected by the divine because he could not dress hair  weary of repeating their mean accomplishments of honesty sobriety humility and on the precipice of reprobating such qualities  which however beneficial to the soul gave no hope of preservation to the body  they were prevented from this profanation by the fortunate remembrance of one qualification which henry the possessor in all his distress had never till then called to his recollection but which being once remembered and made known changed the whole prospect of wretchedness placed before the two brothers and they never knew want more  reader not to keep you in suspense concerning this attribute  henry could play upon the fiddle  chapter iii no sooner was it publicly known that henry could play most excellently upon the violin than he was invited into many companies where no other accomplishment could have introduced him his performance was so much admired that he had the honor of being admitted to several tavern feasts of which he had also the honor to partake without partaking of the expense he was soon addressed by persons of the very first rank and fashion and was once seen walking side by side with a peer  but yet in the midst of this powerful occasion for rejoicing henry whose heart was particularly affectionate had one grief that eclipsed all the happiness of his new life  his brother william could not play on the fiddle  consequently his brother william with whom he had shared so much ill could not share in his good fortune  one evening henry coming home from a dinner and concert at the crown and anchor found william in a very gloomy and peevish humor poring over de oratore of cicero henry asked him several times how he did and similar questions marks of his kind disposition toward his beloved brother but all his endeavors he perceived could not soothe or soften the sullen mind of william at length taking from his pocket a handful of almonds and some delicious fruit which he had purloined from the plenteous table where his brothers wants had never been absent from his thoughts and laying them down before him he exclaimed with a benevolent smile do william let me teach you to play upon the violin  william  full of the great orator whom he was then studying and still more alive to the impossibility that his ear attuned only to sense could ever descend from that elevation to learn mere unds  william caught up the tempting presents which henry had ventured his reputation to obtain for him and threw them all indignantly at the donors head  henry felt too powerfully his own superiority of fortune to resent this ingratitude he only picked up the repast and laying it again upon the table placed by its side a bottle of claret which he held fast by the neck while he assured his brother that although he had taken it while the waiters back was turned yet it might be drank with a safe conscience by them for he had not himself tasted one drop at the feast on purpose that he might enjoy a glass with his brother at home and without wronging the company who had invited him  the affection henry expressed as he said this  or the force of a bumper of wine which william had not seen since he left his fathers house  had such an effect in calming the displeasure he was cherishing that on his brothers offering him the glass he took it and he deigned even to eat of his present  henry to convince him that he had stinted himself to obtain for him this collation sat down and partook of it  after a few glasses had passed he again ventured to say do brother william let me teach you to play on the violin  again his offer was refused but though with less vehemence at length they both agreed the attempt could not prosper  then said henry william go down to oxford or to cambridge there no doubt they are as fond of learning as in this gay town they are of music you know you have as much talent for the one as i for the other do go to one of our universities and see what dinners what suppers and what friends you will find there  chapter iv william did go to one of those seats of learning and would have starved there but for the affectionate remittances of henry who shortly became so great a proficient in the art of music as to have it in his power not only to live in a very reputable manner himself but to send such supplies to his brother as to enable him to pursue his studies  with some the progress of fortune is rapid such is the case when either on merit or demerit great patronage is bestowed henrys violin had often charmed to a welcome forgetfulness of his insignificance an effeminate lord or warmed with ideas of honor the head of a duke whose heart could never be taught to feel its manly glow princes had flown to the arms of their favorite fairones with more rapturous delight softened by the masterly touches of his art and those elevated personages evergrateful to those from whom they derive benefits were competitors in the desire of heaping favors upon him but he in all his advantages never once lost from his thoughts the hope of some advantage for his brother william and when at any time he was pressed by a patron to demand a token of his regard he would constantly reply  i have a brother a very learned man if your lordship your grace or your royal highness would confer some small favor on him    his lordship would reply he was so teazed and harassed in his youth by learned men that he had ever since detested the whole fraternity  his grace would inquire if the learned man could play upon any instrument  and his highness would ask if he could sing  rebuffs such as these poor henry met with in all his applications for william till one fortunate evening at the conclusion of a concert a great man shook him by the hand and promised a living of five hundred a year the incumbent of which was upon his deathbed to his brother in return for the entertainment henry had just given him  henry wrote in haste to william and began his letter thus my dear brother i am not sorry you did not learn to play upon the fiddle  chapter v the incumbent of this living died  william was ordained and in a few weeks came to town to take possession of the gift which his brothers skill had acquired him  william had a steady countenance a stern brow and a majestic walk all of which this new accession this holy calling to religious vows rather increased than diminished in the early part of his life the violin of his brother had rather irritated than soothed the morose disposition of his nature and though since their departure from their native habitation it had frequently calmed the violent ragings of his hunger it had never been successful in appeasing the disturbed passions of a proud and a disdainful mind  as the painter views with delight and wonder the finished picture expressive testimony of his taste and genius as the physician beholds with pride and gladness the recovering invalid whom his art has snatched from the jaws of death as the father gazes with rapture on his first child the creature to whom he has given life  so did henry survey with transporting glory his brother dressed for the first time in his canonicals to preach at his parish church he viewed him from head to foot  smiled  viewed again  pulled one side of his gown a little this way one end of his band a little that way  then stole behind him pretending to place the curls of his hair but in reality to indulge and to conceal tears of fraternal pride and joy  william was not without joy neither was he wanting in love or gratitude to his brother  but his pride was not completely satisfied  i am eldest brother he thought to himself and a man of literature and yet am i obliged to my younger an illiterate man  here he suppressed every thought that could be a reproach to that brother but there remained an object of his former contempt now become even detestable to him  ungrateful man the very agent of his elevation was now so odious to him that he could not cast his eyes upon the friendly violin without instant emotions of disgust  in vain would henry at times endeavor to subdue his haughtiness by a tune on this wonderful machine  you know i have no ear william would sternly say in recompense for one of henrys best solos yet was william enraged at henrys answer when after taking him to hear him preach he asked him how he liked his sermon and henry replied merely with pleasantry and in the technical phrase of his profession you know brother i have no ear  henrys renown in his profession daily increased and with his fame his friends possessing the virtues of humility and charity far above william the professed teacher of those virtues his reverend brothers disrespect for his vocation never once made him relax for a moment in his anxiety to advance him in his  within a year or two he had the gratification of presenting him to a deanery and at once placed between them an insurmountable barrier to all friendship that was not the effect of condescension on the part of the dean  william would now begin seriously to remonstrate with his brother upon his useless occupation and would intimate the degradation it was to him to hear his frivolous talent spoken of in all companies henry believed his brother much wiser than himself and suffered shame that he was not more worthy of such a relation to console himself for the familiar friend whom he now perceived he had entirely lost he searched for one of a softer nature  he married  chapter vi as henry despaired of receiving his brothers approbation of his choice he never mentioned the event to him but william being told of it by a third person inquired of henry who confirmed the truth of the intelligence and acknowledged that in taking a wife his sole view had been to obtain a kind companion and friend who would bear with his failings and know how to esteem his few qualifications therefore he had chosen one of his own rank in life and who having a taste for music and as well as himself an obligation to the art   and is it possible cried the dean that what has been hinted to me is true is it possible that you have married a public finger  she is as good as myself returned henry i did not wish her to be better for fear she should despise me  as to despise answered the dean heaven forbid that we should despise any one  that would be acting unlike a christian  but do you imagine i can ever introduce her to my intended wife who is a woman of family  henry had received in his life many insults from his brother but as he was not a vain man he generally thought his brother in the right and consequently submitted with patience  but though he had little selflove he had for his wife an unbounded affection on the present occasion therefore he began to raise his voice and even in the coarse expression of clownish anger to lift his hand  but the sudden and affecting recollection of what he had done for the dean  of the pains the toils the hopes and the fears he had experienced when soliciting his preferment  this recollection overpowered his speech  weakened his arm  and deprived him of every active force but that of flying out of the deans house in which they then were as swift as lightning while the dean sat proudly contemplating  that he had done his duty  for several days henry did not call as was his custom to see his brother williams marriage drew near and he sent a formal card to invite him on that day but not having had the condescension to name his sisterinlaw in the invitation henry took no notice of it and the joyful event was celebrated without his presence but the ardour of the bridegroom was not so vehement as to overcome every other sensation  he missed his brother  that heartfelt cheerfulness with which henry had ever given him joy upon every happy occasion  even amidst all the politer congratulations of his other friends  seemed to the dean mournfully wanting this derogation from his felicity he was resolved to resent  and for a whole year these brothers whom adversity had entwined closely together prosperity separated  though henry on his marriage paid so much attention to his brothers prejudices as to take his wife from her public employment this had not so entirely removed the scruples of william as to permit him to think her a worthy companion for lady clementina the daughter of a poor scotch earl whom he had chosen merely that he might be proud of her family though in return he should suffer that family to be ashamed of his  if henrys wife was not fit company for lady clementina it is to be hoped she was company for angels  she died within the first year of her marriage a faithful an affectionate wife and a mother  when william heard of her death he felt a sudden shock  and a kind of fleeting thought glanced across his mind that  had he known she had been so near her dissolution she might have been introduced to lady clementina and he himself would have called her sister  that is if he had defined his fleeting idea they would have had no objection to have met this poor woman for the last time and would have descended to the familiarity of kindred in order to have wished her a good journey to the other world  or is there in death something that so raises the abjectness of the poor that on their approach to its sheltering abode the arrogant believer feels the equality he had before denied and trembles  chapter vii the wife of henry had been dead near six weeks before the dean heard the news a month then elapsed in thoughts by himself and consultations with lady clementina how he should conduct himself on this occurrence her advice was  that as henry was the youngest and by their stations in every sense the deans inferior he ought first to make overtures of reconciliation  the dean answered he had no doubt of his brothers good will to him but that he had reason to think from the knowledge of his temper he would be more likely to come to him upon an occasion to bestow comfort than to receive it for instance if i had suffered the misfortune of losing you my brother i have no doubt would have forgotten his resentment and    she was offended that the loss of the vulgar wife of henry should be compared to the loss of her  she lamented her indiscretion in forming an alliance with a family of no rank and implored the dean to wait till his brother should make some concession to him before he renewed the acquaintance  though lady clementina had mentioned on this occasion her indiscretion she was of a prudent age  she was near forty  yet possessing rather a handsome face and person she would not have impressed the spectator with an idea that she was near so old had she not constantly attempted to appear much younger her dress was fantastically fashionable her manners affected all the various passions of youth and her conversation was perpetually embellished with accusations upon her own heedlessness thoughtlessness carelessness and childishness  there is perhaps in every individual one parent motive to every action good or bad be that as it will it was evident that with lady clementina all she said or did all she thought or looked had but one foundation  vanity  if she was nice or if she was negligent vanity was the cause of both for she would contemplate with the highest degree of selfcomplacency what such a one would say of her elegant preciseness or what such a one would think of her interesting neglect  if she complained she was ill it was with the certainty that her languor would be admired if she boasted she was well it was that the spectator might admire her glowing health if she laughed it was because she thought it made her look pretty if she cried it was because she thought it made her look prettier still if she scolded her servants it was from vanity to show her superior knowledge to theirs and she was kind to them from the same vice that her benevolence might excite their admiration  forward and impertinent in the company of her equals from the vanity of supposing herself above them she was bashful even to shamefacedness in the presence of her superiors because her vanity told her she engrossed all their observation through vanity she had no memory for she constantly forgot every thing she heard others say from the minute attention which she paid to every thing she said herself  she had become an old maid from vanity believing no offer she received worthy of her deserts and when her power of farther conquest began to be doubted she married from vanity to repair the character of her fading charms in a word her vanity was of that magnitude that she had no idea but that she was humble in her own opinion and it would have been impossible to have convinced her that she thought well of herself because she thought so well as to be assured that her own thoughts undervalued her  chapter viii that which in a weak woman is called vanity in a man of sense is termed pride  make one a degree stronger or the other a degree weaker and the dean and his wife were infected with the selfsame folly yet do not let the reader suppose that this failing however despicable had erased from either bosom all traces of humanity they are human creatures who are meant to be pourtrayed in this little book and where is the human creature who has not some good qualities to soften if not counterbalance his bad ones  the dean with all his pride could not wholly forget his brother nor eradicate from his remembrance the friend he had been to him  he resolved therefore in spite of his wifes advice to make him some overture which he had no doubt but henrys good nature would instantly accept the more he became acquainted with all the vain and selfish propensities of lady clementina the more he felt a returning affection for his brother but little did he suspect how much he loved him till after sending to various places to enquire for him he learnt  that on his wifes decease unable to support her loss in the surrounding scene henry had taken the child she brought him in his arms shaken hands with all his former friends  passing over his brother in the number  and set sail in a vessel bound for africa with a party of portuguese and some few english adventurers to people there the uninhabited part of an extensive island  this was a resolution in henrys circumstances worthy a mind of singular sensibility but william had not discerned till then that every act of henrys was of the same description and more than all his every act toward him he staggered when he heard the tidings at first thought them untrue but quickly recollected that henry was capable of surprising deeds he recollected with a force that gave him torture the benevolence his brother had ever shown toward him  the favors he had heaped upon him  the insults he had patiently endured in requital  in the first emotion which this intelligence gave the dean he forgot the dignity of his walk and gesture  he ran with frantic enthusiasm to every corner of his house where the least vestige of what belonged to henry remained  he pressed close to his breast with tender agony a coat of his which by accident had been left there  he kissed and wept over a walkingstick which henry once had given him  he even took up a musicbook of his brothers with delight  nor would his poor violin had it been there have then excited anger  when his grief became more calm he sat in deep and melancholy meditation calling to mind when and where he saw his brother last the recollection gave him fresh cause of regret he remembered they had parted on his refusal to suffer lady clementina to admit the acquaintance of henrys wife  both henry and his wife he now contemplated beyond the reach of his pride and he felt the meanness of his triumph  to add to his selfreproaches he beheld in his tormented memory the countenance of his brother at their last interview as it changed while he censured his marriage and treated with disrespect the object of his conjugal affection he remembered the anger repressed the tear bursting forth and the last glimpse he had of him as he left his presence for ever  in vain he now wished that he had followed him to the door  that he had once shaken hands and owned his obligations to him before they had parted in vain he wished too that in this extreme agony of his mind he had such a friend to comfort him as henry had ever proved  chapter ix the avocations of an elevated life erase the deepest impressions  the dean in a few months recovered of those which his brothers departure first made upon him and would now at times even condemn in anger henrys having so hastily abandoned him and his native country in resentment as he conceived of a few misfortunes which his usual fortitude should have taught him to bear yet was he still desirous of his return and wrote two or three letters expressive of his wish which he anxiously endeavored should reach him but many years elapsing without any intelligence from him and a report having arrived that he and all the party with whom he went were slain by the savage inhabitants of the island williams despair of seeing his brother again caused the desire to diminish while attention and affection to a still nearer and dearer relation than henry ever was to him now chiefly engaged his mind  lady clementina had brought him a son on whom from his infancy he doated  and the boy in riper years possessing a handsome person and evincing a quickness of parts gratified the fathers darling passion pride as well as the mothers vanity  the dean had besides this child a domestic comfort highly gratifying to his ambition the bishop of  became intimately acquainted with him soon after his marriage and from his daily visits had become as it were a part of the family this was much honor to the dean not only as the bishop was his superior in the church but was of that part of the bench whose blood is ennobled by a race of ancestors and to which all wisdom on the plebeian side crouches in humble respect  year after year rolled on in pride and grandeur the bishop and the dean passing their time in attending levees and in talking politics lady clementina passing hers in attending routs and in talking of herself till the son arrived at the age of thirteen  young william passed his time from morning till night with persons who taught him to walk to ride to talk to think like a man  a foolish man instead of a wise child as nature designed him to be  this unfortunate youth was never permitted to have one conception of his own  all was taught him  he was never once asked what he thought but men were paid to tell him how to think he was taught to revere such and such persons however unworthy of his reverence to believe such and such things however unworthy of his credit and to act so and so on such and such occasions however unworthy of his feelings  such were the lessons of the tutors assigned him by his father  those masters whom his mother gave him did him less mischief for though they distorted his limbs and made his manners effeminate they did not interfere with the internal  mr norwynne the family name of his father and though but a schoolboy he was called mister could talk on history on politics and on religion surprisingly to all who never listened to a parrot or a magpie  for he merely repeated what he had heard without one reflection upon the sense or probability of his report he had been praised for his memory and to continue that praise he was so anxious to retain every sentence he had heard or he had read that the poor creature had no time for one native idea but only redelivered his tutors lessons to his father and his fathers to his tutors but whatever he said or did was the admiration of all who came to the house of the dean and who knew he was an only child  indeed considering the labor that was taken to spoil him he was rather a commendable youth for with the pedantic folly of his tutors the blind affection of his father and mother the obsequiousness of the servants and flattery of the visitors it was some credit to him that he was not an idiot or a brute  though when he imitated the manners of a man he had something of the latter in his appearance  for he would grin and bow to a lady catch her fan in haste if it fell and hand her to her coach as thoroughly void of all the sentiment which gives grace to such tricks as a monkey  chapter x one morning in winter just as the dean his wife and darling child had finished their breakfast at their house in london a servant brought in a letter to his master and said the man waited for an answer  who is the man cried the dean with all that terrifying dignity with which he never failed to address his inferiors especially such as waited on his person  the servant replied with a servility of tone equal to the haughty one of his master he did not know but that the man looked like a sailor and had a boy with him  a begging letter no doubt cried lady clementina  take it back said the dean and bid him send up word who he is or what is his errand  the servant went and returning said he comes from on board a ship his captain sent him and his errand is he believes to leave a boy he has brought with him  a boy cried the dean what have i to do with a boy i expect no boy what boy what age  he looks about twelve or thirteen replied the servant  he is mistaken in the house said the dean let me look at the letter again  he did look at it and saw it was directed plainly to himself  upon a second glance he had so perfect a recollection of the hand as to open it instantaneously and after ordering the servant to withdraw he read the following  zocotora island april  th my dear brother william it is a long time since we have seen one another but i hope not so long that you have quite forgotten the many happy days we once passed together  i did not take my leave of you when i left england because it would have been too much for me  i had met with a great many sorrows just at that time one of which was the misfortune of losing the use of my right hand by a fall from my horse which accident robbed me of most of my friends for i could no longer entertain them with my performance as i used to do and so i was ashamed to see them or you and that was the reason i came hither to try my fortune with some other adventurers  you have i suppose heard how the savages of the island put our whole party to death except myself i was heartbroken for my comrades but yet upon the whole i do not know that the savages were much to blame  we had no business to invade their territories and if they had invaded england we should have done the same by them  my life was spared because having gained some little strength in my hand during the voyage i pleased their king when i arrived there with playing on my violin  they spared my child too in pity to my lamentations when they were going to put him to death  now dear brother before i say any more concerning my child to you i will first ask your pardon for any offense i may have ever given you in all the time we lived so long together  i know you have often found fault with me and i dare say i have been to blame very often but i here solemnly declare that i never did any thing purposely to offend you but mostly all i could to oblige you  and i can safely declare that i never bore you above a quarter of an hours resentment for any thing you might say to me which i thought harsh  now dear william after being in this island eleven years the weakness in my hand has unfortunately returned and yet there being no appearance of complaint the uninformed islanders think it is all my obstinacy and that i will not entertain them with my music which makes me say that i cannot and they have imprisoned me and threaten to put my son to death if i persist in my stubbornness any longer  the anguish i feel in my mind takes away all hope of the recovery of strength in my hand and i have no doubt but that they intend in a few days to put their horrid threat into execution  therefore dear brother william hearing from my prison of a most uncommon circumstance which is that an english vessel is lying at a small distance from the island i have entrusted a faithful negro to take my child to the ship and deliver him to the captain with a request that he may be sent with this letter to you on the ships arrival in england  now my dear dear brother william in case the poor boy should live to come to you i have no doubt but you will receive him yet excuse a poor fond father if i say a word or two that i hope may prove in his favor  pray my dear brother do not think it the childs fault but mine that you will find him so ignorant  he has always shown a quickness and a willingness to learn and would i dare say if he had been brought up under your care have been by this time a greek scholar  but you know i am no scholar myself besides not having any books here i have only been able to teach my child by talking to him and in all my conversations with him i have never taken much pains to instruct him in the manners of my own country thinking that if ever he went over he would learn them soon enough and if he never did go over that it would be as well he knew nothing about them  i have kept him also from the knowledge of every thing which i have thought pernicious in the conduct of the savages except now and then pointing out a few of their faults in order to give him a true conception and a proper distaste of them at the same time i have taught him to love and to do good to his neighbor whoever that neighbor might be and whatever might be his failings falsehood of every kind i included in this precept as forbidden for no one can love his neighbor and deceive him  i have instructed him too to hold in contempt all frivolous vanity and all kinds of indulgences which he was never likely to obtain he has learnt all i have undertaken to teach him but i am afraid you will yet think he has learnt too little  your wife i fear will be offended at his want of politeness and perhaps want of proper respect for a person of her rank but indeed he is very tractable and can without severity be cured of all his faults and though you will find he has many yet pray my dear brother pray my dear brother william call to mind he has been a dutiful and an affectionate child to me and that had it pleased heaven we had lived together for many years to come i verily believe that i should never have experienced one mark of his disobedience  farewell for ever my dear dear brother william  and if my poor kind affectionate child should live to bring you this letter sometimes speak to him of me and let him know that for twelve years he was my sole comfort and that when i sent him from me in order to save his life i laid down my head upon the floor of the cell in which i was confined and prayed that heaven might end my days before the morning   this was the conclusion of the letter except four or five lines which with his name were so much blotted apparently with tears that they were illegible  chapter xi while the dean was reading to himself this letter his countenance frequently changed and once or twice the tears streamed from his eyes when it was finished he exclaimed  my brother has sent his child to me and i will be a parent to him he was going toward the door when lady clementina stopped him  is it proper do you think dean that all the servants in the house should be witnesses to your meeting with your brother and your nephew in the state in which they must be at present send for them into a private apartment  my brother cried the dean oh that it were my brother the man is merely a person from the ship who has conducted his child hither  the bell was rung money was sent to the man and orders given that the boy should be shown up immediately  while young henry was walking up the stairs the deans wife was weighing in her mind in what manner it would most redound to her honor to receive him for her vanity taught her to believe that the whole inquisitive world pried into her conduct even upon every family occurrence  young william was wondering to himself what kind of an unpolished monster his beggarly cousin would appear and was contemplating how much the poor youth would be surprised and awed by his superiority  the dean felt no other sensation than an impatient desire of beholding the child  the door opened  and the son of his brother henry of his benefactor entered  the habit he had on when he left his father being worn out by the length of the voyage he was in the dress of a sailorboy though about the same age with his cousin he was something taller and though a strong family resemblance appeared between the two youths he was handsomer than william and from a simplicity spread over his countenance a quick impatience in his eye which denoted anxious curiosity and childish surprise at every new object which presented itself he appeared younger than his informed and wellbred cousin  he walked into the room not with a dictated obeisance but with a hurrying step a half pleased yet a half frightened look an instantaneous survey of every person present not as demanding what they thought of him but expressing almost as plainly as in direct words what he thought of them for all alarm in respect to his safety and reception seemed now wholly forgotten in the curiosity which the sudden fight of strangers such as he had never seen in his life before excited and as to himself he did not appear to know there was such a person existing his whole faculties were absorbed in others  the deans reception of him did honor to his sensibility and his gratitude to his brother  after the first affectionate gaze he ran to him took him in his arms sat down drew him to him held him between his knees and repeatedly exclaimed i will repay to you all i owe to your father  the boy in return hugged the dean round the neck kissed him and cried  oh you are my father  you have just such eyes and such a forehead  indeed you would be almost the same as he if it were not for that great white thing which grows upon your head  let the reader understand that the dean fondly attached to every ornament of his dignified function was never seen unless caught in bed without an enormous wig  with this young henry was enormously struck having never seen so unbecoming a decoration either in the savage island from whence he came or on board of the vessel in which he sailed  do you imagine cried his uncle laying his hand gently on the reverend habiliment that this grows  what is on my head grows said young henry and so does what is upon my fathers  but now you are come to europe you will see many persons with such things as these which they put on and take off  why do you wear such things  as a distinction between us and inferior people they are worn to give an importance to the wearer  that is just as the savages do they stick brass nails wire buttons and entrails of beasts all over them to give them importance  the dean now led his nephew to lady clementina and told him that was his aunt to whom he must behave with the utmost respect  i will i will he replied for she i see is a person of importance too  she has very near such a white thing upon her head as you have  his aunt had not yet fixed in what manner it was best to behave whether with intimidating grandeur or with amiable tenderness while she was hesitating between the two she felt a kind of jealous apprehension that her son was not so engaging either in his person or address as his cousin and therefore she said  i hope dean the arrival of this child will give you a still higher sense of the happiness we enjoy in our own  what an instructive contrast between the manners of the one and of the other  it is not the childs fault returned the dean that he is not so elegant in his manners as his cousin  had william been bred in the same place he would have been as unpolished as this boy  i beg your pardon sir said young william with a formal bow and a sarcastic smile for i assure you that several of my tutors have told me that i appear to know many things by instinct  young henry fixed his eyes upon his cousin while with steady selfcomplacency he delivered this speech and no sooner was it concluded than henry cried out n a kind of wonder  a little man as i am alive a little man i did not know there were such ittle men in this country i never saw one in my life before  this is a boy said the dean a boy not older than yourself  he put their hands together and william gravely shook hands with his cousin  it is a man continued young henry  then stroked his cousins chin no no  do not know whether it is or not  i tell you again said the dean he is a boy of your own age  you and he are cousins for i am his father  how can that be said young henry he called you sir  in this country said the dean polite children do not call their parents father and mother  then dont they sometimes forget to love them as such asked henry  his uncle became now impatient to interrogate him in every particular concerning his fathers state  lady clementina felt equal impatience to know where the father was whether he was coming to live with them wanted any thing of them and every circumstance in which her vanity was interested explanations followed all these questions but which merely agreeing with what the elder henrys letter has related require n recital here  chapter xii that vanity which presided over every thought and deed of lady clementinas was the protector of young henry within her house it represented to her how amiable her conduct would appear in the eye of the world should she condescend to treat this destitute nephew as her own son it represented to her the envy such heroic virtue would excite in the hearts of her particular friends and what grief in the bosom of all those who did not like her  the dean was a man of acute penetration he understood the thoughts which upon this occasion passed in the mind of his wife and in order to insure her kind treatment of the boy instead of reproaching her for the cold manner in which she had at first received him he praised her tender and sympathetic heart for having shown him so much kindness and thus stimulated her vanity to be praised still more  william the mothers own son far from apprehending a rival in this savage boy was convinced of his own preeminence and felt an affection for him though rather as a foil than as a cousin he sported with his ignorance upon all occasions and even lay in wait for circumstances that might expose it while young henry strongly impressed with every thing that appeared new to him expressed without reserve the sensations which those novelties excited and felt little care what construction was put upon his observations  he never appeared offended or a bashed when laughed at but still pursued his questions and still discovered his wonder at many replies made to him though simpleton poor filly boy and idiot were vociferated around him from his cousin his aunt and their constant visitor the bishop  his uncle would frequently undertake to instruct him so indeed would the bishop but lady clementina her son and the greatest part of her companions found something so irresistibly ridiculous in his remarks that nothing but immoderate laughter followed they thought such folly had even merit in the way of entertainment and they wished him no wiser  having been told that every morning on first seeing his uncle he was to make a respectful bow and coming into the deans dressing room just as he was out of bed his wig lying on the table henry appeared at a loss which of the two he should bow to  at last he gave the preference to his uncle but afterward bowed reverently to the wig in this he did what he conceived was proper from the introduction which the dean on his first arrival had given him to this venerable stranger for in reality henry had a contempt for all finery and had called even his aunts jewels when they were first shown to him trumpery asking what they were good for but being corrected in this disrespect and informed of their high value he like a good convert gave up his reason to his faith and becoming like all converts over zealous he now believed there was great worth in glittering appearances and respected the earrings of lady clementina almost as much as he respected her  chapter xiii it was to be lamented that when young henry had been several months in england had been taught to read and had of course in the society in which he lived seen much of the enlightened world yet the natural expectation of his improvement was by no means answered  notwithstanding the sensibility which upon various occasions he manifested in the most captivating degree notwithstanding the seeming gentleness of his nature upon all occasions there now appeared in most of his enquiries and remarks a something which demonstrated either a stupid or troublesome disposition either dullness of conception or an obstinacy of perseverance in comments and in arguments that were glaringly false  observing his uncle one day offended with his coachman and hearing him say to him in a very angry tone you shall never drive me again  the moment the man quitted the room henry with his eyes fixed in the deepest contemplation repeated five or six times in a half whisper to himself  you shall never drive me again  you shall never drive me again  the dean at last asked what he meant by thus repeating his words  i am trying to find out what you meant said henry  what do not you know cried his enlightened cousin richard is turned away  he is never to get upon our coachbox again never to drive any of us any more  and was it pleasure to drive us cousin  i am sure i have often pitied him  it rained sometimes very hard when he was on the box  and sometimes lady clementina has kept him a whole hour at the door all in the cold and snow  was that pleasure  no replied young william  was it honor cousin  no exclaimed his cousin with a contemptuous smile  then why did my uncle say to him as a punishment he should never   come hither child said the dean and let me instruct you  your fathers negligence has been inexcusable  there are in society continued the dean rich and poor the poor are born to serve the rich  and what are the rich born for  to be served by the poor  but suppose the poor would not serve them  then they must starve  and so poor people are permitted to live only upon condition that they wait upon the rich  is that a hard condition or if it were they will be rewarded in a better world than this  is there a better world than this  is it possible you do not know there is  i heard my father once say something about a world to come but he stopped short and said i was too young to understand what he meant  the world to come returned the dean is where we shall go after death and there no distinction will be made between rich and poor  all persons there will be equal  aye now i see what makes it a better world than this but cannot this world try to be as good as that  in respect to placing all persons on a level it is utterly impossible  god has ordained it otherwise  how has god ordained a distinction to be made and will not make any himself  the dean did not proceed in his instructions he now began to think his brother in the right and that the boy was too young or too weak to comprehend the subject  chapter xiv in addition to his ignorant conversation upon many topics young henry had an incorrigible misconception and misapplication of many words  his father having had but few opportunities of discoursing with him upon account of his attendance at the court of the savages and not having books in the island he had consequently many words to learn of this countrys language when he arrived in england this task his retentive memory made easy to him but his childish inattention to their proper signification still made his want of education conspicuous  he would call compliments lies  reserve he would call pride  stateliness affectation  and for the monosyllable war he constantly substituted the word massacre  sir said william to his father one morning as he entered the room do you hear how the cannons are firing and the bells ringing  then i dare say cried henry there has been another massacre  the dean called to him in anger will you never learn the right use of words you mean to say a battle  then what is a massacre cried the frightened but still curious henry  a massacre replied his uncle is when a number of people are slain    i thought returned henry soldiers had been people  you interrupt me said the dean before i finished my sentence  certainly both soldiers and sailors are people but they engage to die by their own free will and consent  what all of them  most of them  but the rest are massacred  the dean answered the number that go to battle unwillingly and by force are few and for the others they have previously sold their lives to the state  for what  for soldiers and sailors pay  my father used to tell me we must not take away our own lives but he forgot to tell me we might sell them for others to take away  william said the dean to his son his patience tired with his nephews persevering nonsense explain to your cousin the difference between a battle and a massacre  a massacre said william rising from his seat and fixing his eyes alternately upon his father his mother and the bishop all of whom were present for their approbation rather than the persons to whom his instructions were to be addressed  a massacre said william is when human beings are slain who have it not in their power to defend themselves  dear cousin william said henry that must ever be the case with every one who is killed  after a short hesitation william replied in massacres people are put to death for no crime but merely because they are objects of suspicion  but in battle said henry the persons put to death are not even suspected  the bishop now condescended to end this disputation by saying emphatically  consider young savage that in battle neither the infant the aged the sick or infirm are involved but only those in the full prime of health and vigor  as this argument came from so great and reverend a man as the bishop henry was obliged by a frown from his uncle to submit as one refuted although he had an answer at the veriest tip of his tongue which it was torture to him not to utter what he wished to say must ever remain a secret the church has its terrors as well as the law and henry was awed by the deans tremendous wig as much as paternoster row is awed by the attorney general  chapter xv if the dean had loved his wife but moderately seeing all her faults clearly as he did he must frequently have quarrelled with her if he had loved her with tenderness he must have treated her with a degree of violence in the hope of amending her failings but having neither personal nor mental affection toward her sufficiently interesting to give himself the trouble to contradict her will in any thing he passed for one of the best husbands in the world lady clementina went out when she liked staid at home when she liked dressed as she liked and talked as she liked without a word of disapprobation from her husband and all  because he cared nothing about her  her vanity attributed this indulgence to inordinate affection and observers in general thought her happier in her marriage than the beloved wife who bathes her pillow with her tears by the side of an angry husband whose affection is so excessive that he unkindly upbraids her because she is  less than perfection  the deans wife was not so dispassionately considered by some of his acquaintance as by himself for they would now and then hint at her foibles but this great liberty she also conceived to be the effect of most violent love or most violent admiration and such would have been her construction had they commended her follies  had they totally slighted or had they beaten her  amongst those acquaintances the bishop of  by far the most frequent visitor did not come merely to lounge an idle hour but he had a more powerful motive the desire of fame and dread of being thought a man receiving large emolument for unimportant service  the dean if he did not procure him the renown he wished still preserved him from the apprehended censure  the elder william was to his negligent or ignorant superiors in the church such as an apt boy at school is to the rich dunces  william performed the prelates tasks for them and they rewarded him  not indeed with toys or money but with their countenance their company their praise  and scarcely was there a sermon preached from the patrician part of the bench that the dean did not fashion some periods blot out some uncouth phrases render some obscure sentiments intelligible and was the certain person when the work was printed to correct the press  the honorable and right reverend bishop of  delighted in printing and publishing his works or rather the entire works of the dean which passed for his  and so degradingly did william the shopkeepers son think of his own honest extraction that he was blinded even to the loss of honor by the luster of this noble acquaintance for though in other respects a man of integrity yet when the gratification of his friend was the concern he was a liar he not only disowned his giving him aid in any of his publications but he never published any thing in his own name without declaring to the world that he had been obliged for all the hints on the subject for many of the most judicious corrections and for those passages in page so and so naming the most eloquent part of the work to his noble and learned friend the bishop  the deans wife being a fine lady  while her husband and his friend pored over books or their own manuscripts at home she ran from house to house from public amusement to public amusement but much less for the pleasure of seeing than for that of being seen nor was it material to her enjoyment whether she was observed or welcome where she went as she never entertained the smallest doubt of either but rested assured that her presence roused curiosity and dispensed gladness all around  one morning she went forth to pay he visits all smiles such as she thought captivating she returned all tears such as she thought no less endearing  three ladies accompanied her home entreating her to be patient under a misfortune to which even kings are liable namely defamation  young henry struck with compassion at grief of which he knew not yet the cause begged to know what was the matter  inhuman monsters to treat a woman thus cried his aunt in fury  casting the corner of her eye into a lookingglass to see how rage became her  but comfort yourself said one of her companions few people will believe you merit the charge  but few if only one believe it i shall call my reputation lost and i will shut myself in some lonely hut and give up all that is dear to me for ever  what all your fine clothes said henry in amazement  of what importance will my best dreffes be when nobody would see them  you would see them yourself dear aunt and i am sure nobody admires them more  now you speak of that said she i do not think this gown i have on becoming  i am sure i look    the dean with the bishop to whom he had been reading a treatise just going to the press which was to be published in the name of the latter though written by the former now entered to enquire why they had been sent for in such haste  oh dean oh my lord she cried resuming that grief which the thoughts of her dress had for a time dispelled   my reputation is destroyed  a public print has accused me of playing deep at my own house and winning all the money  the world will never reform said the bishop all our labor my friend is thrown away  but is it possible cried the dean that any one has dared to say this of you  here it is in print said she holding out a newspaper  the dean read the paragraph and then exclaimed i can forgive a falsehood spoken  the warmth of conversation may excuse it  but to write and print an untruth is unpardonable  and i will prosecute this publisher  still the falsehood will go down to posterity said lady clementina and after ages will think i was a gambler  comfort yourself dear madam said young henry wishing to console her perhaps after ages may not hear of you nor even the present age think much about you  the bishop now exclaimed after having taken the paper from the dean and read the paragraph it is a libel a rank libel and the author must be punished  not only the author but the publisher said the dean  not only the publisher but the printer continued the bishop  and must my name be bandied about by lawyers in a common court of justice cried lady clementina how shocking to my delicacy  my lord it is a pity we cannot try them by the ecclesiastical court said the dean with a sigh  nor by the india delinquent bill said the bishop with vexation  so totally innocent as i am she vociferated with sobs every one knows i never touch a card at home and this libel charges me with playing at my own house  and though whenever i do play i own i am apt to win yet it is merely for my amusement  win or not win play or not play exclaimed both the churchmen this is a libel no doubt no doubt a libel  poor henrys confined knowledge of his native language tormented him so much with curiosity upon this occasion that he went softly up to his uncle and asked him in a whisper what was the meaning of the word libel  a libel replied the dean in a raised voice is that which one person publishes to the injury of another  and what can the injured person do asked henry if the accusation should chance to be true  prosecute replied the dean  but then what does he do if the accusation is false  prosecute likewise answered the dean  how uncle is it possible that the innocent behave just like the guilty  there is no other way to act  why then if i was the innocent i would do nothing at all sooner than i would act like the guilty i would not persecute    i said prosecute cried the dean in anger leave the room you have no comprehension  oh yes now i understand the difference of the two words  but they sound so alike i did not observe the distinction at first you said the innocent prosecute but the guilty persecute he bowed convinced as he thought and left the room  after this modern star chamber which was left sitting had agreed on its mode of vengeance and the writer of the libel was made acquainted with his danger he waited in all humility upon lady clementina and assured her with every appearance of sincerity   that she was not the person alluded to by the paragraph in question but that the initials which she had conceived to mark out her name were in fact meant to point out lady catharine newland  but sir cried lady clementina what could induce you to write such a paragraph upon lady catharine she never plays  we know that madam or we dared not have attacked her though we must circulate libels madam to gratify our numerous readers yet no people are more in fear of prosecutions than authors and editors therefore unless we are deceived in our information we always take care to libel the innocent  we apprehend nothing from them  their own characters support them  but the guilty are very tenacious and what they cannot secure by fair means they will employ force to accomplish dear madam be assured i have too much regard for a wife and seven small children who are maintained by my industry alone to have written any thing in the nature of a libel upon your ladyship  chapter xvi about this period the dean had just published a pamphlet in his own name and in which that of his friend the bishop was only mentioned with thanks for hints observations and condescending encouragement to the author  this pamphlet glowed with the deans love for his country and such a country as he described it was impossible not to love salubrious air fertile fields wood water corn grass sheep oxen fish fowl fruit and vegetables were dispersed with the most prodigal hand  valiant men pretty women statesmen wise and just tradesmen abounding in merchandise and money husbandmen possessing peace ease plenty and all ranks liberty  this brilliant description while the dean read the work to his family so charmed poor henry that he repeatedly cried out  i am glad i came to this country  but it so happened that a few days after lady clementina in order to render the delicacy of her taste admired could eat of no one dish upon the table but found fault with them all the dean at length said to her  indeed you are too nice  reflect upon the hundreds of poor creatures who have not a morsel or a drop of any thing to subsist upon except bread and water and even of the first a scanty allowance but for which they are obliged to toil six days in the week from sun to sun  pray uncle cried henry in what country do these poor people live  in this country replied the dean  henry rose from his chair ran to the chimneypiece took up his uncles pamphlet and said i dont remember your mentioning them here  perhaps i have not answered the dean coolly  still henry turned over each leaf of the book but he could meet only with luxurious details of the fruits of the earth the beasts of the field the birds of the air and the fishes of the sea  why here is provision enough for all the people said henry why should they want why do not they go and take some of these things  they must not said the dean unless they were their own  what uncle does no part of the earth nor any thing which the earth produces belong to the poor  certainly not  why did not you say so then in your pamphlet  because it is what every body knows  oh then what you have said in your pamphlet is only what  nobody knows  there appeared to the dean in the delivery of this sentence a satirical acrimony which his irritability as an author could but ill forgive  an author it is said has more acute feelings in respect to his works than any artist in the world besides  henry had some cause on the present occasion to think this observation just for no sooner had he spoken the foregoing words than his uncle took him by the hand out of the room and leading him to his study there he enumerated his various faults and having told him it was for all those too long permitted with impunity and not merely for the present impertinence that he meant to punish him ordered him to close confinement in his chamber for a week  in the mean time the deans pamphlet less hurt by henrys critique than he had been was proceeding to the tenth edition and the author acquiring literary reputation beyond what he had ever conferred on his friend the bishop  the style the energy the eloquence of the work was echoed by every reader who could afford to buy it  some few enlightened ones excepted who chiefly admired the authors invention  chapter xvii the dean in the good humor which the rapid sale of his book produced once more took his nephew to his bosom and although the ignorance of young henry upon the late occasions had offended him very highly yet that selfsame ignorance evinced a short time after upon a different subject struck his uncle as productive of a most rare and exalted virtue  henry had frequently in his conversation betrayed the total want of all knowledge in respect to religion or futurity and the dean for this reason delayed taking him to church till he had previously given him instructions wherefore he went  a leisure morning arrived on which he took his nephew to his study and implanted in his youthful mind the first unconfused idea of the creator of the universe  the dean was eloquent henry was all attention his understanding expanded by time to the conception of a god  and not warped by custom from the sensations which a just notion of that god inspires dwelt with delight and wonder on the information given him  lessons which instilled into the head of a senseless infant too often produce throughout his remaining life an impious indifference to the truths revealed  yet with all that astonished that respectful sensibility which henry showed on this great occasion he still expressed his opinion and put questions to the dean with his usual simplicity till he felt himself convinced  what cried he  after being informed of the attributes inseparable from the supreme being and having received the injunction to offer prayers to him night and morning what am i permitted to speak to power divine  at all times replied the dean  what whenever i like  whenever you like returned the dean  i durst not cried henry make so free with the bishop nor dare any of his attendants  the bishop said the dean is the servant of god and therefore must be treated with respect  with more respect than his master asked henry  the dean not replying immediately to this question henry in the rapidity of enquiry ran to another but what am i to say when i speak to the almighty  first thank him for the favors he has bestowed on you  what favors  you amaze me cried the dean by your question do not you live in ease in plenty and happiness  and do the poor and the unhappy thank him too uncle  no doubt  every human being glorifies him for having been made a rational creature  and does my aunt and all her card parties glorify him for that  the dean again made no reply  and henry went on to other questions till his uncle had fully instructed him as to the nature and the form of prayer  and now putting into his hands a book he pointed out to him a few short prayers which he wished him to address to heaven in his presence  whilst henry bent his knees as his uncle had directed he trembled  turned pale  and held for a slight support on the chair placed before him  his uncle went to him and asked him what was the matter  oh cried henry when i first came to your door with my poor fathers letter i shook for fear you would not look upon me  and i cannot help feeling even more now than i did then  the dean embraced him with warmth  gave him confidence  and retired to the other side of the study to observe his whole demeanor on this new occasion  as he beheld his features varying between the passions of humble fear and servent hope  his face sometimes glowing with the rapture of thanksgiving and sometimes with the blushes of contrition he thus exclaimed apart  this is the true education on which to found the principles of religion  the favor conferred by heaven in granting the freedom of petitions to its throne can never be conceived with proper force but by those whose most tedious moments during their infancy were not passed in prayer unthinking governors of childhood to insult the deity with a form of worship in which the mind has no share nay worse has repugnance and by the thoughtless habits of youth prevent even in age devotion  henrys attention was so firmly fixed that he forgot there was a spectator of his fervor nor did he hear young william enter the chamber and even speak to his father  at length closing his book and rising from his knees he approached his uncle and cousin with a sedateness in his air which gave the latter a very false opinion of the state of his youthful companions mind  so mr henry cried william you have been obliged to say your prayers at last  the dean informed his son that to henry it was no punishment to pray  he is the strangest boy i ever knew said william inadvertently  to be sure said henry i was frightened when i first knelt but when i came to the words father which art in heaven they gave me courage for i know how merciful and kind a father is beyond any one else  the dean again embraced his nephew let fall a tear to his poor brother henrys misfortunes and admonished the youth to show himself equally submissive to other instructions as he had done to those which inculcate piety  chapter xviii the interim between youth and manhood was passed by young william and young henry in studious application to literature some casual mistakes in our customs and manners on the part of henry some too close adherences to them on the side of william  their different characters when boys were preserved when they were men henry still retained that natural simplicity which his early destiny had given him he wondered still at many things he saw and heard and at times would venture to give his opinion contradict and even act in opposition to persons whom long experience and the approbation of the world had placed in situations that claimed his implicit reverence and submission  unchanged in all his boyish graces young william now a man was never known to infringe upon the statutes of goodbreeding even though sincerity his own free will duty to his neighbor with many other plebeian virtues and privileges were the sacrifice  william inherited all the pride and ambition of the dean  henry all his fathers humility and yet so various and extensive is the acceptance of the word pride that on some occasions henry was proud even beyond his cousin he thought it far beneath his dignity ever to honor or contemplate with awe any human being in whom he saw numerous failings nor would he to ingratiate himself into the favor of a man above him stoop to one servility such as the haughty william daily practiced  i know i am called proud one day said william to henry  dear cousin replied henry it must be only then by those who do not know you for to me you appear the humblest creature in the world  do you really think so  i am certain of it or would you always give up your opinion to that of persons in a superior state however inferior in their understanding would else their weak judgment immediately change yours though before you had been decided on the opposite side now indeed cousin i have more pride than you for i never will stoop to act or to speak contrary to my feelings  then you will never be a great man  nor ever desire it if i must first be a mean one  there was in the reputation of these two young men another mistake which the common retailers of character committed henry was said to be wholly negligent while william was reputed to be extremely fond of the other sex william indeed was gallant was amorous and indulged his inclination to the libertine society of women but henry it was who loved them he admired them at a reverential distance and felt so tender an affection for the virtuous part that it shocked him to behold much more to associate with the depraved and vicious  in the advantages of person henry was still superior to william and yet the latter had no common share of those attractions which captivate weak thoughtless or unskilful minds  chapter xix about the time that henry and william quitted college and had arrived at their twentieth year the dean made the purchase of a small estate in a village near to the country residence of lord and lady bendham and in the total want of society the deans family were frequently honored with invitations from the great house  lord bendham besides a good estate possessed the office of a lord of the bedchamber to his majesty historians do not ascribe much importance to the situation or to the talents of nobles in this department nor shall this little history a lord of the bedchamber is a personage well known in courts and in all capitals where courts reside with this advantage to the inquirer that in becoming acquainted with one of those noble characters you become acquainted with all the remainder not only with those of the same kingdom but those of foreign nations for in whatever land in whatever climate a lord of the bedchamber must necessarily be the selfsame creature one wholly made up of observance of obedience of dependence and of imitation  a borrowed character  a character formed by reflection  the wife of this illustrious peer as well as himself took her hue like the chameleon from surrounding objects her manners were not governed by her mind but were solely directed by external circumstances at court humble resigned patient attentive  at balls masquerades gamingtables and routs gay sprightly and flippant  at her country seat reserved austere arrogant and gloomy  though in town her timid eye in presence of certain persons would scarce uplift its trembling lid so much she felt her own insignificance yet in the country till lady clementina arrived there was not one being of consequence enough to share in her acquaintance and she paid back to her inferiors there all the humiliating slights and all the mortifications which in london she received from those to whom she was inferior  whether in town or country it is but justice to acknowledge that in her own person she was strictly chaste but in the country she extended that chastity even to the person of others and the young woman who lost her virtue in the village of anfield had better have lost her life some few were now and then found hanging or drowned while no other cause could be assigned for their despair than an imputation on their character and dread of the harsh purity of lady bendham she would remind the parish priest of the punishment ordained for female dishonor and by her influence had caused many an unhappy girl to do public penance in their own or the neighboring churches  but this country rigor in town she could dispense withal and like other ladies of virtue she there visited and received into her house the acknowledged mistresses of a man in elevated life it was not therefore the crime but the rank which the criminal held in society that drew down lady bendhams vengeance she even carried her distinction of classes in female error to such a very nice point that the adulterous concubine of an elder brother was her most intimate acquaintance while the less guilty unmarried mistress of the younger she would not fully her lips to exchange a word with  lord and lady bendhams birth education talents and propensities being much on the same scale of eminence they would have been a very happy pair had not one great misfortune intervened  the lady never bore her lord a child  while every cottage of the village was crammed with halfstarved children whose father from week to week from year to year exerted his manly youth and wasted his strength in vain to protect them from hunger whose mother mourned over her newborn infant as a little wretch sent into the world to deprive the rest of what already was too scanty for them in the castle that owned every cottage and all the surrounding land and where one single day of feasting would have nourished for a month all the poor inhabitants of the parish not one child was given to partake of the plenty the curse of barrenness was on the family of the lord of the manor  the curse of fruitfulness upon the famished poor  this lord and lady with an ample fortune both by inheritance and their sovereigns favor had never yet the economy to be exempt from debts still over their splendid their profuse table they could contrive and plan excellent schemes how the poor might live most comfortably with a little better management  the wages of a laboring man with a wife and half a dozen small children lady bendham thought quite sufficient if they would only learn a little economy  you know my lord those people never want to dress  shoes and stockings a coat and a waistcoat a gown and a cap a petticoat and a handkerchief is all they want  fire to be sure in winter  then all the rest is merely for provision  i will get a pen and ink said young henry one day when he had the honor of being at their table and see what the rest amounts to  no no accounts cried my lord no summing up but if you were to calculate you must add to the receipts of the poor my gift at christmas  last year during the frost no less than a hundred pounds  how benevolent exclaimed the dean  how prudent exclaimed henry  what do you mean by prudent asked lord bendham explain your meaning  no my lord replied the dean do not ask for an explanation this youth is wholly unacquainted with our customs and though a man in stature is but a child in intellects henry have not i often cautioned you    whatever his thoughts are upon this subject cried lord bendham i desire to know them  why then my lord answered henry i thought it was prudent in you to give a little lest the poor driven to despair should take all  and if they had they would have been hanged  hanging my lord our history or some tradition says was formerly adopted as a mild punishment in place of starving  i am sure cried lady bendham who seldom spoke directly to the argument before her i am sure they ought to think themselves much obliged to us  that is the greatest hardship of all cried henry  what sir exclaimed the earl  i beg your pardon  my uncle looks displeased  i am very ignorant  i did not receive my first education in this country  and i find i think so differently from every one else that i am ashamed to utter my sentiments  never mind young man answered lord bendham we shall excuse your ignorance for once only inform us what it was you just now called the greatest hardship of all  it was my lord that what the poor receive to keep them from perishing should pass under the name of gifts and bounty health strength and the will to earn a moderate subsistence ought to be every mans security from obligation  i think a hundred pounds a great deal of money cried lady bendham and i hope my lord will never give it again  and so do i cried henry for if my lord would only be so good as to speak a few words for the poor as a senator he might possibly for the future keep his hundred pounds and yet they never want it  lord bendham had the good nature only to smile at henrys simplicity whispering to himself i had rather keep my   his last word was lost in the whisper  chapter xx in the country  where the sensible heart is still more susceptible of impressions and where the unfeeling mind in the want of other wits to invent forms schemes for its own amusement  our youths both fell in love if passions that were pursued on the most opposite principles can receive the same appellation william well versed in all the licentious theory thought himself in love because he perceived a tumultuous impulse cause his heart to beat while his fancy fixed on a certain object whose presence agitated yet more his breast  henry thought himself not in love because while he listened to william on the subject he found their sensations did not in the least agree  william owned to henry that he loved hannah the daughter of a cottager in the village and hoped to make her his mistress  henry felt that his tender regard for rebecca the daughter of the curate of the parish did not inspire him even with the boldness to acquaint her with his sentiments much less to meditate one design that might tend to her dishonor  while william was cautiously planning how to meet in private and accomplish the seduction of the object of his passion henry was endeavoring to fortify the object of his choice with every virtue he never read a book from which he received improvement that he did not carry it to rebecca  never knew a circumstance that might assist toward her moral instruction that he did not haste to tell it her  and once when william boasted  he knew he was beloved by hannah  henry said with equal triumph he had not dared to take the means to learn nor had rebecca dared to give one instance of her partiality  rebecca was the youngest and by far the least handsome daughter of four to whom the reverend mr rymer a widower was father the other sisters were accounted beauties and she from her comparative want of personal charms having been less beloved by her parents and less caressed by those who visited them than the rest had for some time past sought other resources of happiness than the affection praise and indulgence of her fellow creatures she read  but more  she thought the choicest books from her fathers little library taught her to think and reflection fashioned her mind to bear the slights the mortifications of neglect with a patient dejection rather than with an indignant or a peevish spirit  this resignation to injury and contumely gave to her perfect symmetry of person a timid eye a retiring manner and spread upon her face a placid sweetness a pale serenity mixed with sense and taste that no wise connoisseur in female charms would have exchanged for all the sparkling eyes and florid tints of her vain and vulgar sisters  henrys soul was so much enamoured of her gentle deportment that in his sight she appeared beautiful while sue with an understanding competent to judge of his worth was so greatly surprised so prodigiously astonished at the distinction the attention the many offices of civility paid to her by him in preference to her idolized sisters that her gratitude for such unexpected favors had sometimes even in his presence and in that of her family nearly drowned her eyes with tears yet they were only trifles in which henry had the opportunity or the power to give her testimony of his regard  trifles often more grateful to the sensible mind than efforts of high importance and by which the artist in the human heart will accurately trace a passion wholly concealed from the dull eye of the unskilled observer  the first cause of amazement to rebecca in the manners of henry was that he talked with her as well as with her sisters no visitor else had done so in taking a mornings or an evenings walk he proposed her going with the rest no one had ever required her company before when he called and she was absent he asked where she was no one had ever missed her before  she thanked him from her very heart and soon perceived that at those times when he was present company was more pleasing even than books  her astonishment her gratitude did not stop here  henry proceeded in attention  he soon selected her from her sisters to tell the news of the day when he chanced to call answered her observations the first once gave her a sprig of myrtle from his bosom in preference to another who had praised its beauty and once  never to be forgotten kindness  sheltered her from a hasty shower with his parapluie while he lamented to her drenched companions  that he had but one to offer  from a man whose sense and person they admire how dear how impressive on the female heart is every trait of tenderness till now rebecca had experienced none not even of the parental kind and merely from the overflowings of a kind nature not in return for affection had she ever loved her father and her sisters sometimes repulsed by their severity she transferred the fullness of an affectionate heart upon animals but now her alienated mind was recalled and softened by a sensation that made her long to complain of the burden it imposed  those obligations which exact silence are a heavy weight to the grateful  rebecca longed to tell henry that her life would be too little to express the full sense she had of the respect he paid to her but as modesty forbade not only every kind of declaration but every insinuation purporting what she felt she wept through sleepless nights from a load of suppressed explanation yet still she would not have exchanged this trouble for all the beauty of her sisters  chapter xxi old john and hannah primrose a prudent hardy couple who by many years of peculiar labor and peculiar abstinence were the least poor of all the neighboring cottagers had an only child called after the mother hannah and this cottage girl was reckoned in spite of the beauty of the elder miss rymers by far the prettiest female in the village  reader of superior rank if the passions which rage in the bosom of the inferior class of human kind are beneath your sympathy throw aside this little history for rebecca rymer and hannah primrose are its heroines  but you unprejudiced reader whose liberal observations are not confined to stations but who consider all mankind alike deserving your investigation who believe that there exists in some knowledge without the advantage of instruction refinement of sentiment independent of elegant society honorable pride of heart without dignity of blood and genius destitute of art to render it conspicuous  you will perhaps venture to read on in hopes that the remainder of this story may deserve your attention just as the wild herb of the forest equally with the cultivated plant in the garden claims the attention of the botanist  when young william saw hannah he thought her even more beautiful than she was thought by others and on those days that he felt no inclination to ride to shoot or to hunt he would contrive by some secret device the means to meet with her alone and give her tokens if not of his love at least of his admiration of her beauty and of the pleasure he enjoyed in her company  hannah listened with a kind of delirious enchantment to all her elevated and eloquent admirer uttered and in return for his praises of her charms and his equivocal replies in respect to his designs toward her gave to him her most undisguised thoughts and her whole enraptured heart  this to her apparently harmless intercourse had not lasted many weeks before she loved him  she even confessed she did every time that any unwonted mark of attention from him struck with unexpected force her infatuated senses  it has been said by a celebrated writer upon the affection subsisting between the two sexes that there are many persons who if they had never heard of the passion of love would never have felt it might it not with equal truth be added that  there are many more who having heard of it and believing most firmly that they feel it are nevertheless mistaken neither of these cases was the lot of hannah she experienced the sentiment before she ever heard it named in that sense in which she felt it  and she felt it as genuine love alone exists  joined with numerous other sentiments for love however rated by many as the chief passion of the human heart is but a poor dependant a retainer upon other passions admiration gratitude respect esteem pride in the object  divest the boasted sensation of these and it is no more than the impression of a twelvemonth by courtesy or vulgar error termed love  hannah was formed by the rarest structure of the human frame and fated by the tenderest thrillings of the human soul to inspire and to experience real love  but her nice taste her delicate thoughts were so refined beyond the sphere of her own station in society that nature would have produced this prodigy of attraction in vain had not one of superior education and manners assailed her heart and had she been accustomed to the conversation of men in williams rank of life she had perhaps treated williams addresses with indifference but in comparing him with her familiar acquaintance he was a miracle his unremitted attention seemed the condescension of a superior being to whom she looked up with reverence with admiration with awe with pride with sense of obligation  and all those various passions which constitute true and never to be eradicated love  but in vain she felt and even avowed with her lips what every look every gesture had long denoted william with discontent sometimes with anger upbraided her for her false professions and vowed that while one tender proof which he fervently besought was wanting she did but aggravate his misery by lesser endearments  hannah had been taught the full estimation of female virtue and if her nature could have detested one being in a state of wretchedness it would have been the woman who had lost her honor yet for william what would not hannah forfeit the dignity the peace the serenity the innocence of her own mind love soon encouraged her to fancy she could easily forego  and this same overpowering influence at times so forcibly possessed her that she even felt a momentary transport in the idea of so precious a sacrifice to him  but then she loved her parents and their happiness she could not prevail on herself to barter even for his she wished he would demand some other pledge of her affection for there was none but this her ruin in no other shape that she would deny at his request while thus she deliberated she prepared for her fall  bred up with strict observance both to his moral and religious character william did not dare to tell an unequivocal lie even to his inferiors  he never promised hannah he would marry her nay even he paid so much respect to the forms of truth that no sooner was it evident that he had obtained her heart her whole soul entire  so that loss of innocence would be less terrifying than separation from him  no sooner did he perceive this than he heartily told her he could never make her his wife  at the same time he lamented the difference of their births and the duty he owed his parents hopes in terms so pathetic to her partial ear that she thought him a greater object of compassion in love even than herself and was now urged by pity to remove the cause of his complainings  one evening henry accidentally passed the lonely spot where william and she constantly met  he observed his cousins impassioned eye and her affectionate yet fearful glance william he saw took delight in the agitation of mind in the strong apprehension mixed with the love of hannah this convinced henry that either he or himself was not in love for his heart told him he would not have beheld such emotions of tenderness mingled with such marks of sorrow upon the countenance of rebecca for the wealth of the universe  the first time he was alone with william after this he mentioned his observation on hannahs apparent affliction and asked why her grief was the result of their stolen meetings  because replied william her professions are unlimited while her manners are reserved and i accuse her of loving me with unkind moderation while i love her to distraction  you design to marry her then  how can you degrade me by the supposition  would it degrade you more to marry her than to make her your companion to talk with her for hours in preference to all other company to wish to be endeared to her by still closer ties  but all this is not raising her to the rank of my wife  it is still raising her to that rank for which wives alone were allotted  you talk wildly  i tell you i love her but not enough i hope to marry her  but too much i hope to undo her  that must be her own free choice  i make use of no unwarrantable methods  what are the warrantable ones  i mean i have made her no false promises  offered no pretended settlement  vowed no eternal constancy  but you have told her you love her and from that confession has she not reason to expect every protection which even promises could secure  i cannot answer for her expectations  but i know if she should make me happy as i ask and i should then forsake her i shall not break my word  still she will be deceived for you will falsify your looks  do you think she depends on my looks  i have read in some book looks are the lovers sole dependence  i have no objection to her interpreting mine in her favor but then for the consequences she will have herself and only herself to blame  oh heaven  what makes you exclaim so vehemently  an idea of the bitterness of that calamity which inflicts selfreproach oh rather deceive her  leave her the consolation to reproach you rather than herself  my honor will not suffer me  exert your honor and never see her more  i cannot live without her  then live with her by the laws of your country and make her and yourself both happy  am i to make my father and my mother miserable they would disown me for such a step  your mother perhaps might be offended but your father could not remember the sermon he preached but last sunday upon  the shortness of this life contempt of all riches and worldly honors in balance with a quiet conscience  and the assurance he gave us  that the greatest happiness enjoyed upon earth was under an humble roof with heaven in prospect  my father is a very good man said william and yet instead of being satisfied with an humble roof he looks impatiently forward to a bishops palace  he is so very good then said henry that perhaps seeing the dangers to which men in exalted stations are exposed he has such extreme philanthropy and so little selflove he would rather that himself should brave those perils incidental to wealth and grandeur than any other person  you are not yet civilized said william and to argue with you is but to instruct without gaining instruction  i know sir replied henry that you are studying the law most assiduously and have vast prospects of rising to eminence in your profession but let me hint to you  that though you may be perfect in the knowledge how to administer the commandments of men unless you keep in view the precepts of god your judgment like mine will be fallible  chapter xxii the deans family passed this first summer at the newpurchased estate so pleasantly that they left it with regret when winter called them to their house in town  but if some felt concern on quitting the village of anfield some who were left behind felt the deepest anguish those were not the poor  for rigid attention to the morals of people in poverty and total neglect of their bodily wants was the deans practice he forced them to attend church on every sabbath but whether they had a dinner on their return was too gross and temporal an enquiry for his spiritual fervor good of the soul was all he aimed at and this pious undertaking besides his diligence as a pastor required all his exertion as a magistrate  for to be very poor and very honest very oppressed yet very thankful is a degree of sainted excellence not to be attained without the aid of zealous men to frighten into virtue  those then who alone felt sorrow at the deans departure were two young women whose parents exempt from indigence preserved them from suffering under his unpitying piety but whose discretion had not protected them from the bewitching smiles of his nephew and seducing wiles of his son  the first morning that rebecca rose and knew henry was gone till the following summer she wished she could have lain down again and slept away the whole long interval her sisters peevishness her fathers austerity she foresaw would be insupportable now that she had experienced henrys kindness and he was no longer near to fortify her patience she sighed  she wept  she was unhappy  but if rebecca awoke with a dejected mind and an a king heart what were the sorrows of hannah the only child of two doting parents she never had been taught the necessity of resignation  untutored unread unused to reflect but knowing how to feel what were her sufferings when on waking she called to mind that william was gone and with him gone all that excess of happiness which his presence had bestowed and for which she had exchanged her future tranquillity  loss of tranquillity even rebecca had to bemoan  hannah had still more  the loss of innocence  had william remained in the village shame even conscience perhaps had slept but separated from her betrayer parted from the joys of guilt and left only to its sorrows every sting which quick sensibility could sharpen was transfixed in her heart to torture her first came the recollection of a cold farewell from the man whose love she had hoped her yielding passion had for ever won  next flashed on her thoughts her violated person  next the crime incurred  next her cruelty to her tender parents  and last of all came the horrors of detection  she knew that as yet by wariness care and contrivance her meetings with william had been unsuspected but in this agony of mind her fears foreboded an informer who would defy all caution who would stigmatize her with a name  dear and desired by every virtuous female  abhorrent to the blushing harlot  the name of mother  that hannah thus impressed could rise from her bed meet her parents and her neighbors with her usual smile of vivacity and voice of mirth was impossible  to leave her bed at all to creep down stairs and reply in a faint broken voice to questions asked were in her state of mind mighty efforts and all to which her struggles could attain for many weeks  william had promised to write to her while he was away he kept his word but not till the end of two months she received a letter fears for his health apprehension of his death during this cruel interval caused an agony of suspense that by representing him to her distracted fancy in a state of suffering made him if possible still dearer to her in the excruciating anguish of uncertainty she walked with trembling steps through all weathers when she could steal half a day while her parents were employed in labor abroad to the post town at six miles distance to enquire for his long expected long wished for letter when at last it was given to her that moment of consolation seemed to repay her for the whole time of agonising terror she had endured he is alive she said and i have suffered nothing  she hastily put this token of his health and his remembrance of her into her bosom rich as an empress with a newacquired dominion the way from home which she had trod with heavy pace in the fear of renewed disappointment she skimmed along on her return swift as a do  the cold did not pierce neither did the rain wet her many a time she put her hand upon the prize she possessed to find if it were safe  once on the road she took it from her bosom curiously viewed the seal and the direction then replacing it did not move her fingers from their fast gripe till she arrived at home  her father and her mother were still absent she drew a chair and placing it near to the only window in the room seated herself with ceremonious order and then gently drew forth her treasure laid it on her knee and with a smile that almost amounted to a laugh of gladness once more inspected the outward part before she would trust herself with the excessive joy of looking within  at length the seal was broken  but the contents still a secret poor hannah had learned to write as some youths learn latin so short a time had been allowed for the acquirement and so little expert had been her master that it took her generally a week to write a letter of ten lines and a month to read one of twenty but this being a letter on which her mind was deeply engaged her whole imagination aided her slender literature and at the end of a fortnight she had made out every word  they were these  dr hannah i hope you have been well since we parted  i have been very well myself but i have been teazed with a great deal of business which has not given me time to write to you before  i have been called to the bar which engages every spare moment  but i hope it will not prevent my coming down to anfield with my father in the summer  i am dr hannah with gratitude for all the favors you have conferred on me yours etc w n   to have beheld the illiterate hannah try for two weeks day and night to find out the exact words of this letter it would have struck the spectator with amazement to have understood the right the delicate the nicely proper sensations with which she was affected by every sentence it contained  she wished it had been kinder even for his sake who wrote it  because she thought so well of him and desired still to think so well that she was sorry at any faults that rendered him less worthy of her good opinion the cold civility of his letter had this effect  her clear her acute judgment felt it a kind of prevarication to promise to write  and then write nothing that was hoped for but enthralled by the magic of her passion she shortly found excuses for the man she loved at the expense of her own condemnation  he has only the fault of inconstancy she cried and that has been caused by my change of conduct  had i been virtuous still he had still been affectionate bitter thought  yet there was a sentence in the letter that worse than all the tenderness left out wounded her sensibility  and she could not read the line gratitude for all the favors conferred on me without turning pale with horror then kindling with indignation at the commonplace thanks which insultingly reminded her of her innocence her peace of mind given in exchange for unmeaning acknowledgement  chapter xxiii absence is said to increase strong and virtuous love but to destroy that which is weak and sensual in the parallel between young william and young henry this was the case for henrys real love increased while williams turbulent passion declined in separation yet had the latter not so much abated that he did not perceive a sensation like a sudden shock of sorrow on a proposal made him by his father of entering the marriage state with a young woman the dependent niece of lady bendham who as the dean informed him had signified her lords and her own approbation of his becoming their nephew  at the first moment william received this intimation from his father his heart revolted with disgust from the object and he instantly thought upon hannah with more affection than he had done for many weeks before this was from the comparison between her and his proposed wife for he had frequently seen miss sedgeley at lord bendhams but had never seen in her whole person or manners the least attraction to excite his love he pictured to himself an unpleasant home with a companion so little suited to his taste and felt a pang of conscience as well as of attachment in the thought of giving up poor hannah  but these reflections these feelings lasted no longer than for the moment no sooner had the dean explained why the marriage was desirable recited what great connections and what great patronage it would confer upon their family than william listened with eagerness and both his love and his conscience were if not wholly quieted at least for the present hushed  immediately after the dean had expressed to lord and lady bendham his sons sense of the honor and the happiness conferred on him by their condescension in admitting him a member of their noble family  miss sedgeley received from her aunt nearly the same shock as william had done from his father for she had frequently seen the deans son at lord bendhams but had never seen in his whole person or manners the least attraction to excite her love  she pictured to herself an unpleasant home with a companion so little suited to her taste and at this moment she felt a more than usual partiality to the deans nephew finding the secret hope she had long indulged of winning his affections so near being thwarted  but miss sedgeley was too much subjected to the power of her uncle and aunt to have a will of her own at least to dare to utter it she received the commands of lady bendham with her accustomed submission while all the consolation for the grief they gave her was that she resolved to make a very bad wife  i shall not care a pin for my husband she said to herself and so i will dress and visit and do just as i like  he dares not be unkind because of my aunt besides now i think again it is not so disagreeable to marry him as if i were obliged to marry into any other family because i shall see his cousin henry as often if not oftener than ever  for miss sedgeley with a person he did not like and with a mind thus disposed william began to force himself to shake off every little remaining affection even all pity for the unfortunate the beautiful the sensible the doting hannah and determined to place in a situation to look down with scorn upon her sorrows this weak this unprincipled woman  connections interest honors were powerful advocates  his private happiness william deemed trivial compared to public opinion  and to be under obligations to a peer his wifes relation gave greater renown in his servile mind than all the advantages that might accrue from his own intrinsic independent worth  in the usual routine of pretended regard and real indifference sometimes disgust between parties allied by what is falsely termed prudence the intended union of mr norwynne with miss sedgeley proceeded in all due form and at their country seats at anfield during the summer their nuptials were appointed to be celebrated  william was now introduced into all lord bendhams courtly circles  his worldly soul was entranced in glare and show  he thought of nothing but places pensions titles retinues and steadfast alert unshaken in the pursuit of honors neglected not the lesser means of rising to preferment  his own endowments but in this round of attention to pleasures and to study he no more complained to hannah of excess of business cruel as she had once thought that letter in which he thus apologized for neglecting her she at last began to think it was wondrous kind for he never found time to send her another yet she had studied with all her most anxious care to write him an answer such a one as might not lessen her understanding which he had often praised in his esteem  ah william even with less anxiety your beating ambitious heart panted for the admiration of an attentive auditory when you first ventured to harangue in public  with far less hope and fear great as yours were did you first address a crowded court and thirst for its approbation on your efforts than hannah sighed for your approbation when she took a pen and awkwardly scrawled over a sheet of paper near twenty times she began  but to a gentleman  and one she loved like william  what could she dare to say yet she had enough to tell if shame had not interposed  or if remaining confidence in his affection had but encouraged her  overwhelmed by the first and deprived of the last her hand shook her head drooped and she dared not communicate what she knew must inevitably render her letter unpleasing and still more depreciate her in his regard as the occasion of encumbrance and of injury to his moral reputation  her free her liberal her venturous spirit subdued intimidated by the force of affection she only wrote   sir i am sorry you have so much to do and should be ashamed if you put it off to write to me i have not been at all well this winter  i never before passed such a one in all my life and i hope you will never know such a one yourself in regard to not being happy  i should be sorry if you did  think i would rather go through it again myself than you should i long for the summer the fields are so green and every thing so pleasant at that time of the year i always do long for the summer but i think never so much in my life as for this that is coming  though sometimes i wish that last summer had never come perhaps you wish so too  and that this summer would not come either  hope you will excuse all faults as i never learnt but one month  your obedient humble servant h p   chapter xxiv summer arrived  and lords and ladies who had partaken of all the dissipation of the town whom operahouses gaminghouses and various other houses had detained whole nights from their peaceful home were now poured forth from the metropolis to imbibe the wholesome air of the farmer and peasant and disseminate in return moral and religious principles  among the rest lord and lady bendham strenuous opposers of vice in the poor and gentle supporters of it in the rich never played at cards or had concerts on a sunday in the village where the poor were spies  he there never gamed or drank except in private  and she banished from her doors every female of sullied character yet poverty and idiotism are not the same  the poor can hear can talk sometimes can reflect  servants will tell their equals how they live in town  listeners will smile and shake their heads  and thus hypocrisy instead of cultivating destroys every seed of moral virtue  the arrival of lord bendhams family at anfield announced to the village that the deans would quickly follow rebeccas heart bounded with joy at the prospect  poor hannah felt a sinking a foreboding tremor that wholly interrupted the joy of her expectations  she had not heard from william for five tedious months  she did not know whether he loved or despised  whether he thought of or had forgotten her her reason argued against the hope that he loved her  yet hope still subsisted  she would not abandon herself to despair while there was doubt  she had frequently been deceived from the appearance of circumstances and perhaps he might come all kindness  perhaps  even not like her the less for that indisposition which had changed her bloom to paleness and the sparkling of her eyes to a pensive languor  henrys sensations on his return to anfield were the selfsame as rebeccas were sympathy in thought sympathy in affection sympathy in virtue made them so as he approached near the little village he felt more light than usual he had committed no trespass there dreaded no ones reproach or enquiries but his arrival might prove at least to one object the cause of rejoicing  williams sensations were the reverse of these in spite of his ambition and the flattering view of accomplishing all to which it aspired he often as they proceeded on their journey envied the gaiety of henry and felt an inward monitor that told him he must first act like henry to be as happy  his intended marriage was still to the families of both parties except to the heads of the houses a profound secret neither the servants nor even henry had received the slightest intimation of the designed alliance and this to william was matter of some comfort  when men submit to act in contradiction to their principles nothing is so precious as a secret in their estimation to have their conduct known is the essential mischief  while it is hid they fancy the sin but half committed and to the moiety of a crime they reconcile their feelings till in progression the whole when disclosed appears trivial he designed that hannah should receive the news from himself by degrees and in such a manner as to console her or at least to silence her complaints and with the wish to soften the something like regret which he still felt on the prudent necessity of yielding her up when his marriage should take place he promised to himself some intervening hours of private meetings which he hoped would produce satiety  while henry flew to mr rymers house with a conscience clear and a face enlightened with gladness while he met rebecca with openhearted friendship and frankness that charmed her foul to peaceful happiness william skulked around the cottage of hannah dreading detection and when toward midnight he found the means to obtain the company of the sad inhabitant he grew so impatient at her tears and sobs at the delicacy with which she withheld her caresses that he burst into bitter upbraidings at her coyness and at length without discovering the cause of her peculiar agitation and reserve abruptly left her vowing never to see her more  as he turned away his heart even congratulated him that he had made so discreet a use of his momentary disappointment as thus to shake her off at once without farther explanation or excuse  she ignorant and illiterate as she was knew enough of her own heart to judge of his and to know that such violent affections and expressions above all such a sudden heartbreaking manner of departure were not the effects of love not even of humanity she felt herself debased by a ruffian  yet still having loved him when she thought him otherwise the blackest proof of the deception could not erase a sentiment formed while she was deceived  she passed the remainder of the night in anguish  but with the cheerful morning some cheerly thoughts arose she thought perhaps william by this time had found himself to blame  had conceived the cause of her grief and her distant behavior and had pitied her  the next evening she waited with anxious heart for the signal that had called her out the foregoing night  in vain she watched counted the hours and the stars and listened to the nightly stillness of the fields around they were not disturbed by the tread of her lover  daylight came the sun rose in its splendor william had not been near her and it shone upon none so miserable as hannah  she now considered his word never to see her more as solemnly passed  she heard anew the impressive the implacable tone in which the sentence was pronounced and could look back on no late token of affection on which to found the slightest hope that he would recall it  still reluctant to despair  in the extremity of grief in the extremity of fear for an approaching crisis that must speedily arrive she after a few days had elapsed trusted a neighboring peasant with a letter to deliver to mr norwynne in private  this letter unlike the last was dictated without the hope to please  no pains were taken with the style no care in the formation of the letters  the words flowed from necessity strong necessity guided her hand  sir i beg your pardon  pray dont forsake me all at once  see me one time more  i have something to tell you  it is what i dare tell nobody else  and what i am ashamed to tell you  yet pray give me a word of advice  what to do i dont know  i then will part if you please never to trouble you never any more  but hope to part friends  pray do if you please  and see me one time more  your obedient h p   these incorrect inelegant lines produced this immediate reply  to hannah primrose i have often told you that my honor is as dear to me as my life  my word is a part of that honor  you heard me say i would never see you again  i shall keep my word     chapter xxv when the deans family had been at anfield about a month  one misty morning such as portends a sultry day as henry was walking swiftly through a thick wood on the skirts of the parish he suddenly started on hearing a distant groan expressive as he thought both of bodily and mental pain he stopped to hear it repeated that he might pursue the sound he heard it again and though now but in murmurs yet as the tone implied excessive grief he directed his course to that part of the wood from whence it came  as he advanced in spite of the thick fog he discerned the appearance of a female scudding away on his approach his eye was fixed on this object and regardless where he placed his feet soon he shrunk back with horror on perceiving they had nearly trod upon a newborn infant lying on the ground  a lovely male child entered on a world where not one preparation had been made to receive him  ah cried henry forgetting the person who had fled and with a smile of compassion on the helpless infant i am glad i have found you  you give more joy to me than you have done to your hapless parents poor dear continued he while he took off his coat to wrap it in i will take care of you while i live  i will beg for you rather than you shall want  but first i will carry you to those who at present can do more for you than myself  thus henry said and though while he enclosed the child carefully in his coat and took it in his arms but about to walk his way with it an unlucky query struck him where he should go  i must not take it to the deans he cried because lady clementina will suspect it is not nobly and my uncle will suspect it is not lawfully born nor must i take it to lord bendhams for the selfsame reason  though could it call lady bendham mother this whole village nay the whole country round would ring with rejoicings for its birth how strange continued he that we should make so little of human creatures that one sent among us wholly independent of his own high value becomes a curse instead of a blessing by the mere accident of worthless circumstances  he now after walking out of the wood peeped through the folds of his coat to look again at his charge  he started turned pale and trembled to behold what in the surprise of first seeing the child had escaped his observation around its little throat was a cord entwined by a slipping noose and drawn half way  as if the trembling hand of the murderer had revolted from its dreadful office and he or she had left the infant to pine away with nakedness and hunger rather than see it die  again henry wished himself joy of the treasure he had found and more servently than before for he had not only preserved one fellow creature from death but another from murder  once more he looked at his charge and was transported to observe upon its serene brow and sleepy eye no traces of the dangers it had passed  no trait of shame either for itself or its parents  no discomposure at the unwelcome reception it was likely to encounter from a proud world  he now slipped the fatal string from its neck and by this affectionate disturbance causing the child to cry he ran but he scarce knew whither to convey it to a better nurse  he at length found himself at the door of his dear rebecca  for so very happy henry felt at the good luck which had befallen him that he longed to bestow a part of the blessing upon her he loved  he sent for her privately out of the house to speak to him  when she came  rebecca said he looking around that no one observed him rebecca i have brought you something you will like  what is it she asked  you know rebecca that you love deserted birds strayed kittens and motherless lambs  i have brought something more pitiable than any of these go and get a cap and a little gown and then i will give it you  a gown exclaimed rebecca if you have brought me a monkey much as i should esteem any present from you indeed i cannot touch it  a monkey repeated henry almost in anger  then changing the tone of his voice exclaimed in triumph  it is a child  on this he gave it a gentle pinch that its cry might confirm the pleasing truth he spoke  a child repeated rebecca in amaze  yes and indeed i found it  found it  indeed i did the mother i fear had just forsaken it  inhuman creature  nay hold rebecca i am sure you will pity her when you see her child  you then will know she must have loved it  and will consider how much she certainly had suffered before she left it to perish in a wood  cruel once more exclaimed rebecca  oh rebecca perhaps had she possessed a home of her own she would have given it the best place in it  had she possessed money she would have dressed it with the nicest care  or had she been accustomed to disgrace she would have gloried in calling it hers but now as it is it is sent to us to you and me rebecca to take care of  rebecca soothed by henrys compassionate eloquence held out her arms and received the important parcel  and as she kindly looked in upon the little stranger  now are not you much obliged to me said henry for having brought it to you i know no one but yourself to whom i would have trusted it with pleasure  much obliged to you repeated rebecca with a very serious face if i did but know what to do with it  where to put it  where to hide it from my father and sisters  oh any where  returned henry it is very good  it will not cry  but if they should discover it they will take it from you prosecute the wretched mother and send the child to the workhouse  i will do all i can replied rebecca and i know i can take milk from the dairy and bread from the pantry without its being missed or my father much the poorer  but if it should cry    that instant they were interrupted by the appearance of the stern curate at a little distance  henry was obliged to run swiftly away while rebecca returned by stealth into the house with her innocent burden  chapter xxvi there is a word in the vocabulary more bitter more direful in its import than all the rest  reader if poverty if disgrace if bodily pain even if slighted love is your unhappy fate kneel and bless heaven for its beneficent influence so that you are not tortured with the anguish of  remorse  deep contrition for past offenses had long been the punishment of unhappy hannah but till the day she brought her child into the world remorse had been averted from that day life became an insupportable load for all reflection was torture to think  merely to think was to suffer excruciating agony  yet never before was thought so intrusive  it haunted her in every spot in all societies  sleep was no shelter  she never slept but her racking dreams told her  she had slain her infant  they presented to her view the naked innocent whom she had longed to press to her bosom while she lifted up her hand against its life  they laid before her the smiling babe whom her eye balls strained to behold once more while her feet hurried her away for ever  often had hannah by the winters fire listened to tales of ghosts  of the unceasing sting of a guilty conscience  often had she shuddered at the recital of murders  often had she wept over the story of the innocent put to death and stood aghast that the human mind could perpetrate the heinous crime of assassination  from the tenderest passion the most savage impulse may arise  in the deep recesses of fondness sometimes is implanted the root of cruelty  and from loving william with unbounded lawless affection she found herself depraved so as to become the very object that could most of all excite her own horror  still at delirious intervals that passion which like a fatal talisman had enchanted her whole soul held out the delusive prospect that  william might yet relent  for though she had for ever discarded the idea of peace she could not force herself to think but that again blessed with his society she should at least for the time that he was present taste the sweet cup of forgetfulness of the past for which she so ardently thirsted  should he return to me she thought in those paroxysms of delusion i would to him unbosom all my guilt and as a remote a kind of innocent accomplice in my crime his sense his arguments ever ready in making light of my sins might afford a respite to my troubled conscience  while thus she unwittingly thought and sometimes watched through the night starting with convulsed rapture at every sound because it might possibly be the harbinger of him he was busied in carefully looking over marriage articles fixing the place of residence with his destined bride or making love to her in formal process  yet hannah vaunt  he sometimes thought on thee  he could not witness the folly the weakness the vanity the selfishness of his future wife without frequently comparing her with thee when equivocal words and prevaricating sentences fell from her lips he remembered with a sigh thy candor  that open sincerity which dwelt upon thy tongue and seemed to vie with thy undisguised features to charm the listener even beyond the spectator while miss sedgeley eagerly grasped at all the presents he offered he could not but call to mind that hannahs declining hand was always closed and her looks forbidding every time he proffered such disrespectful tokens of his love he recollected the softness that beamed from hannahs eyes the blush on her face at his approach while he could never discern one glance of tenderness from the niece of lord bendham and the artificial bloom on her cheeks was nearly as disgusting as the illconducted artifice with which she attempted gentleness and love  but all these impediments were only observed as trials of his fortitude  his prudence could overcome his aversion and thus he valued himself upon his manly firmness  twas now that having rid himself by hannahs peevishness most honorably of all future ties to her and the day of his marriage with miss sedgeley being fixed that henry with the rest of the house learnt what to them was news  the first dart of henrys eye upon william when in his presence he was told of it caused a reddening on the face of the latter he always fancied henry saw his thoughts and he knew that henry in return would give him his on the present occasion no sooner were they alone and henry began to utter them than william charged him  not to dare to proceed for that too long accustomed to trifle the time was come when serious matters could alone employ his time and when men of approved sense must take place of friends and confidents like him  henry replied the love the sincerity of friends i thought were their best accomplishments those i possess  but you do not possess knowledge  if that is knowledge which has of late estranged you from all who bear you a sincere affection which imprints every day more and more upon your features the marks of gloomy inquietude am i not happier in my ignorance  do not torment me with your ineffectual reasoning  i called at the cottage of poor hannah the other day returned henry her father and mother were eating their homely meal alone and when i asked for their daughter they wept and said  hannah was not the girl she had been  william cast his eyes on the floor  henry proceeded  they said a sickness which they feared would bring her to the grave had preyed upon her for some time past they had procured a doctor but no remedy was found and they feared the worst  what worst cried william now recovered from the effect of the sudden intelligence and attempting a smile do they think she will die and do you think it will be for love we do not hear of these deaths often henry  and if she die who will hear of that no one but those interested to conceal the cause and thus it is that dying for love becomes a phenomenon  henry would have pursued the discourse farther but william impatient on all subjects except where his argument was the better retired from the controversy crying out i know my duty and want no instructor  it would be unjust to william to say he did not feel for hannahs reported illness  he felt during that whole evening and part of the next morning  but business pleasures new occupations and new schemes of future success crowded to dissipate all unwelcome reflections and he trusted in her youth her health her animal spirits and above all in the folly of the gossips story of dying for love as a surety for her life and a safeguard for his conscience  chapter xxvii the child of william and hannah was secreted by rebecca in her own chamber a garret and at some distance from where her sisters slept there she administered to all its wants viewed almost with the joy of a mother its health its promised life and in a short time found she loved her little gift better than any thing on earth except the giver  henry called the next day and the next and many succeeding times in hopes of an opportunity to speak alone with rebecca to enquire concerning her charge and consult when and how he could privately relieve her from her trust as he now meant to procure a nurse for wages in vain he called or lurked around the house  for near five weeks all the conversation he could obtain with her was in the company of her sisters who beginning to observe his preference his marked attention to her indulged their envy and resentment at the contempt shown to their charms by watching her steps when he was away and her every look and whisper while he was present  for five weeks then he was continually thwarted in his expectation of meeting her alone and at the end of that period the whole design he had to accomplish by such a meeting was rendered abortive  though rebecca had every day and night with strictest caution locked her bedchamber door and covered the crevices and every aperture of her room through which sound might more easily proceed though she had surrounded the infants head with pillows to obstruct all noise from his crying yet one unlucky night the strength of his voice increasing with his age he was heard by the maid who slept in the opposite garret  not meaning to injure her young mistress the servant next morning simply related to the family what sounds had struck her ear during the night but from what part of the house they came she would not undertake directly to say  at first she was ridiculed for supposing herself awake when in reality she must be dreaming but steadfastly persisting in what she had said and rebeccas confusion giving much color to the improbable tale her chamber was searched by her sisters the infant discovered and brought down to their father  that account which henry had given rebecca of his having found the child and which her own sincerity joined to the faith she had in his word made her receive as truth she now felt would be heard by the present auditors with contempt even with indignation as a falsehood  her affright is better to be conceived than described  dragged by her sisters along with the child before the curate his crimsoned face knit brow and thundering voice struck with terror her very soul  innocence is not always a protection against fear  sometimes less bold than guilt  in her father and sisters she saw she knew the suspicious partial cruel boisterous natures by whom she was to be judged and timid gentle oppressed she fell trembling on her knees and could only articulate  forgive me  the curate would not listen to this supplication till she had replied to his question  whose child is this  she replied i do not know  questioned louder and with more violence still how the child came there and whose it was she felt the improbability of the truth still more forcibly than before and dreaded some immediate peril from her fathers rage should she dare to relate an apparent lie  she paused to think upon a more probable tale than the real one  and as she hesitated shook in every limb  while her father exclaimed   i understand the cause of this terror  from your infancy i have predicted that some fatal catastrophe would befall you  i never loved you like my other children  i never had the cause  you were always unlike the rest  and i knew your sat would be calamitous  but the very worst of my forebodings did not come to this  so young so guilty and so artful  tell me this instant are you married  rebecca answered no  the sisters lifted up their hands  the father continued  vile prostitute i thought as much  still i will know the father of this child  she cast up her eyes to heaven and firmly vowed she did not know herself  nor who the mother was  this is not to be borne exclaimed the curate in fury persist in this and you never see my face again both your child and you i will turn out of my house instantly unless you confess your crime and own the father  curious to know this secret the sisters went up to rebecca with seeming kindness and  conjured her to spare her father still greater grief and her own and her childs public infamy by acknowledging herself its mother and naming the man who had seduced her  emboldened by this insult from her own sex rebecca now began to declare the simple truth  but no sooner had she said that  the child was the gift of a young man who had found it   than her sisters burst into laughter and her father into fresh fits of rage  once more the women offered their advice  to confess and be forgiven  once more the father raved  beguiled by solicitations and terrified by threats she at length felt inclined to take the mothers share of the infant but was at a loss to whom to give the fathers she thought that henry had entailed on himself the best right to the charge but she loved him and could not bear the idea of accusing him falsely  while with agitation in the extreme she thus deliberated the proposition again was put  whether she would trust to the mercy of her father by confessing or draw down his immediate vengeance by denying her guilt  she made choice of the former  and with tears and sobs owned herself the mother of the boy  but still  who is the father  again she shrunk from the question and fervently implored  to be spared on that point  her petition was rejected with vehemence and the curates rage increased till she acknowledged  henry was the father  i thought so exclaimed all her sisters at the same time  villain cried the curate the dean shall know before this hour is expired the baseness of the nephew whom he supports upon charity he shall know the misery the grief the shame he has brought upon me and know how unworthy he is of his protection  oh have mercy on him cried rebecca as she still knelt to her father do not ruin him with his uncle for he is the best of creatures  ay ay we always saw how much she loved him cried her sisters  wicked undone girl said the clergyman his rage now subsiding and tears supplying its place you have drawn a curse upon us all  your sisters reputation will be stamped with the color of yours  my good name will suffer  but that is trivial  your soul is lost to virtue to religion to shame    no indeed cried rebecca if you will but believe me  do not i believe you have not you confessed  you would not pretend to unsay what you have said cried her eldest sister that would be making things worse  go go out of my sight said her father take your child with you to your chamber and never let me see either of you again  i do not turn you out of my doors to day because i gave you my word i would not if you revealed your shame  but by tomorrow i will provide some place for your reception where neither i nor any of your relations shall ever see or hear of you more  rebecca made an effort to cling around her father and once more to declare her innocence but her sisters interposed and she was taken with her reputed son to the chamber where the curate had sentenced her to remain till she quitted his house for ever  chapter xxviii the curate in the soldier of his mind scarce felt the ground he trod as he hasted to the deans to complain of his wrongs his name procured him immediate admittance into the library  and the moment the dean appeared the curate burst into tears  the cause being required of such very singular marks of grief mr rymer described himself as having been a few months ago the happiest of parents but that his peace and that of his whole family had been destroyed by mr henry norwynne the deans nephew  he now entered into a minute recital of henrys frequent visits there and of all that had occurred in his house that morning from the suspicion that a child was concealed under his roof to the confession made by his youngest daughter of her fall from virtue and of her betrayers name  the dean was astonished shocked and rouzed to anger he vented reproaches and menaces on his nephew and blessing himself in a virtuous son whose wisdom and counsel were his only solace in every care sent for william to communicate with him on the unhappy subject  william came all obedience and heard with marks of amazement and indignation the account of such black villainy in perfect sympathy with mr rymor and his father he allowed no punishment could be too great for the seducer of innocence the selfish invader of a whole familys repose  nor did william here speak what he did not think  he merely forgot his own conduct or if he did recall it to his mind it was with some fair interpretation in his own behalf such as selflove ever supplies to those who wish to cheat their conscience  young henry being sent for to appear before this triumvirate he came with a light step and a cheerful face but on the charge against him being exhibited his countenance changed  yet only to the expression of surprise he boldly asserted his innocence plainly told the real fact and with a deportment so perfectly unembarrassed that nothing but the asseverations of the curate that his daughter had confessed the whole could have rendered the story henry told suspected although some of the incidents he related were of no common kind but mr rymers charge was an objection to his veracity too potent to be overcome and the dean exclaimed in rage   we want not your avowal of your guilt  the mothers evidence is testimony sufficient  the virtuous rebecca is not a mother said henry with firmness  william here like rebeccas sisters took henry aside and warned him not to add to his offense by denying what was proved against him  but henrys spirit was too manly his affection too sincere not to vindicate the chastity of her he loved even at his own peril he again and again protested she was virtuous  let her instantly be sent for said the dean and this madman confronted with her then adding that as he wished every thing might be conducted with secrecy he would not employ his clerk on the unhappy occasion he desired william to draw up the form of an oath which he would administer as soon as she arrived  a man and horse were immediately dispatched to bring rebecca william drew up an affidavit as his father had directed him  in rebeccas name solemnly protesting she was a mother and henry the father of her child  and now the dean suppressing till she came the warmth of his anger spoke thus calmly to henry  even supposing that your improbable tale of having found this child and all your declarations in respect to it were true still you would be greatly criminal what plea can you make for not having immediately revealed the circumstance to me or some other proper person that the real mother might be detected and punished for her design of murder  in that perhaps i was to blame returned henry but whoever the mother was i pitied her  compassion on such an occasion was ill placed said the dean  was i wrong sir to pity the child  no  then how could i feel for that and yet divest myself of all feeling for its mother  its mother exclaimed william in anger she ought to have been immediately pursued apprehended and committed to prison  it struck me cousin william replied henry that the father was most deserving a prison the poor woman had abandoned only one  the man in all likelihood had forsaken two  william was pouring execrations on the villain if such there could be when rebecca was announced  her eyes were halfclosed with weeping deep confusion overspread her face and her tottering limbs could hardly support her to the awful chamber where the dean her father and william sat in judgment whilst her beloved henry stood arraigned as a culprit by her false evidence  upon her entrance her father first addressed her and said in a stern threatening yet feeling tone unhappy girl answer me before all present  have you or have you not owned yourself a mother  she replied stealing a fearful look at henry  i have  and have you not asked the dean owned that henry norwynne is the father of your child  she seemed as if she wished to expostulate   the curate raised his voice  have you or have you not  i have she faintly replied  then here cried the dean to william read that paper to her and take the bible  william read the paper which in her name declared a momentous falsehood he then held the book in form while she looked like one distracted  wrung her hands and was near sinking to the earth  at the moment the book was lifted up to her lips to kiss henry rushed to her  stop he cried rebecca do not hurt your future peace do not be terrified into the commission of a crime which hereafter will distract your delicate conscience my confession will be a testimony equal to your oath  will render it needless  and here i acknowledge that all you have asserted is truth  surprising audacity  complicated villainy exclaimed the dean  then added henry norwynne your first guilt is so enormous your second in steadfastly denying it so base this last conduct so unaccountable that from the present hour you must never dare to call me relation or to consider my house as your home  william in unison with his father exclaimed indeed henry your actions merit this punishment  henry answered with firmness inflict what punishment you please  with the deans permission then said the curate you must marry my daughter  henry started  marry her marry rebecca do you pronounce that as a punishment it would be the greatest blessing providence could bestow  but how are we to live my uncle is too much offended ever to be my friend again and in this country people of a certain class are so educated they cannot exist without the assistance or what is called the patronage of others when that is withheld they steal or starve heaven protect rebecca from such misfortune  sir to the curate do you but consent to support her a year or two longer and in that time i will learn some occupation that shall raise me to the eminence of maintaining both her and myself without one obligation or one inconvenience to another  rebecca exclaimed oh you have saved me from such a weight of sin that my future life would be too happy passed as your slave  no my dear rebecca return to your fathers house return to slavery but for a few years more and the rest of your life i will make free  and can you forgive me  i can love you and in that is comprised every thing that is kind  the curate who bating a few passions and a few prejudices was a man of some worth and feeling had felt in the midst of her distress though the result of crimes that he loved this neglected daughter better than he had before conceived and he now agreed to take her home for a time provided she were relieved from the child and the matter so hushed up that it might draw no imputation upon the characters of his other daughters  the dean did not degrade his consequence by consultations of this nature but having penetrated as he imagined into the very bottom of this intricate story and issued his mandate against henry  as a mark that he took no farther concern in the matter he proudly walked out of the room without uttering another word  william as proudly and as silently followed  the curate was inclined to adopt the manners of such great examples  but selfinterest some affection to rebecca and concern for the character of his family made him wish to talk a little more with henry who now repeated what he had said respecting his marriage with rebecca and promised to come the very next day in secret and deliver her from the care of the infant and the suspicion that would attend her nursing it  but above all said the curate procure your uncles pardon for without that without his protection or the protection of some other rich man to marry to obey gods ordinance increase and multiply is to want food for yourself and your offspring  chapter xxix though this unfortunate occurrence in the curates family was according to his own phrase to be hushed up yet certain persons of his of the deans and of lord bendhams house immediately heard and talked of it among these lady bendham was most of all shocked and offended she never could bear to hear mr rymer either pray or preach again  he had not conducted himself with proper dignity either as a clergyman or a father  he should have imitated the deans example in respect to henry and have turned his daughter out of doors  lord bendham was less severe on the seduced but had no mercy on the seducer  a vicious youth without one accomplishment to endear vice  for vice lord bendham thought with some philosophers might be most exquisitely pleasing in a pleasing garb but this youth sinned without elegance without one particle of wit or an atom of good breeding  lady clementina would not permit the subject to be mentioned a second time in her hearing  extreme delicacy in woman she knew was bewitching and the delicacy she displayed on this occasion went so far that she could not even intercede with the dean to forgive his nephew because the topic was too gross for her lips to name even in the ear of her husband  miss sedgeley though on the very eve of her bridal day with william felt so tender a regard for henry that often she thought rebecca happier in disgrace and poverty blessed with the love of him than she was likely to be in the possession of friends and fortune with his cousin  had henry been of a nature to suspect others of evil or had he felt a confidence in his own worth such a passion as this young womans would soon have disclosed its existence but he regardless of any attractions of miss sedgeley equally supposed he had none in her eyes and thus fortunately for the peace of all parties this prepossession ever remained a secret except to herself  so little did william conceive that his clownish cousin could rival him in the affections of a woman of fashion that he even slightly solicited his father that henry might not be banished from the house at least till after the following day when the great festival of his marriage was to be celebrated  but the dean refused and reminded his son that he was bound both by his moral and religious character in the eyes of god and still more in the eyes of men to show lasting resentment of iniquity like his  william acquiesced and immediately delivered his cousin the deans wishes for his amendment and a letter of recommendation procured from lord bendham to introduce him on board a man of war where he was told he might hope to meet with preferment according to his merit as a sailor and a gentleman  henry pressed williams hand on parting  wished him happy in his marriage  and supplicated as the only favor he would implore an interview with his uncle  to thank him for all his former kindness and see him for the last time  william repeated this petition to his father but with so little energy that the dean did not grant it he felt himself compelled to resent that reprobate character in which henry had appeared and he feared  lest the remembrance of his last parting from his brother might on taking a formal leave of that brothers son reduce him to some tokens of weakness that would illbecome his dignity and just displeasure  he sent him his blessing with money to convey him to his ship  and henry quitted his uncles house in a flood of tears to seek first a new protectress for his little soundling and then to seek his fortune  chapter xxx the wedding day of mr william norwynne with miss caroline sedgeley arrived  and on that day the bells of every parish surrounding that in which they lived joined with their own in celebration of the blissful union flowers were strewed before the newmarried pair and favors and ale made many a heart more gladsome than that of either bridegroom or bride  upon this day of ringing and rejoicing the bells were not muffled nor was conversation on the subject withheld from the ear of hannah she heard like her neighbors and sitting on the side of her bed in her little chamber suffered under the cottage roof as much affliction as ever visited a palace  tyrants who have embrued their hands in the blood of myriads of their fellow creatures can call their murders religion justice attention to the good of mankind  poor hannah knew no sophistry to calm her conscience  she felt herself a harlot and a murderer  a slighted a deserted wretch bereft of all she loved in this world all she could hope for in the next  she complained bitterly of illness nor could the entreaties of her father and mother prevail on her to share in the sports of this general holiday  as none of her humble visitors suspected the cause of her more than ordinary indisposition they endeavored to divert it with an account of every thing they had seen at church  what the bride wore how joyful the bridegroom looked and all the little signs of that complete happiness which they conceived was for certain tasted  hannah who before this event had at moments suppressed the agonising sting of guilt in the faint prospect of her lover one day restored on this memorable occasion lost every glimpse of hope and was weighed to the earth with an accumulation of despair  where is the degree in which the sinner stops unhappy hannah the first time you permitted indecorous familiarity from a man who made you no promise who gave you no hope of becoming his wife who professed nothing beyond those fervent though slender affections which attach the rake to the wanton  the first time you interpreted his kind looks and ardent prayers into tenderness and constancy  the first time you descended from the character of purity you rushed imperceptibly on the blackest crimes the more sincerely you loved the more you plunged in danger  from one ungoverned passion proceeded a second and a third in the fervency of affection you yielded up your virtue  in the excess of fear you stained your conscience by the intended murder of your child  and now in the violence of grief you meditate  what  to put an end to your existence by your own hand  after casting her thoughts around anxious to find some little bud of comfort on which to fix her longing eye she beheld in the total loss of william nothing but a wide waste an extensive plain of anguish  how am i to be sustained through this dreary journey of life she exclaimed  upon this question she felt more poignantly than ever her loss of innocence  innocence would have been her support  but in place of this best prop to the afflicted guilt flashed on her memory every time she flew for aid to reflection  at length from horrible rumination a momentary alleviation came  but one more step in wickedness she triumphantly said and all my shame all my sufferings are over she congratulated herself upon the lucky thought  when but an instant after the tears trickled down her face for the sorrow her death her sinful death would bring to her poor and beloved parents  she then thought upon the probability of a sigh it might draw from william and the pride the pleasure of that little tribute counterpoised every struggle on the side of life  as she saw the sun decline when you rise again she thought when you peep bright tomorrow morning into this little room to call me up i shall not be here to open my eyes upon a hateful day  i shall no more regret that you have waked me  i shall be sound asleep never to wake again in this wretched world  not even the voice of william would then awake me  while she found herself resolved and evening just come on she hurried out of the house and hastened to the fatal wood the scene of her dishonor  the scene of meditated murder  and now the intended scene of suicide  as she walked along between the closeset trees she saw at a little distance the spot where william first made love to her and where at every appointment he used to wait her coming she darted her eye away from this place with horror  but after a few moments of emotion she walked slowly up to it  shed tears and pressed with her trembling lips that tree against which he was accustomed to lean while he talked to her  she felt an inclination to make this the spot to die in  but her preconcerted and the less frightful death of throwing herself into a pool on the other side of the wood induced her to go onwards  presently she came near the place where her child and williams was exposed to perish  here she started with a sense of the most atrocious guilt and her whole frame shook with the dread of an approaching an omnipotent judge to sentence her for murder  she halted appalled aghast undetermined whether to exist longer beneath the pressure of a criminal conscience or die that very hour and meet her final condemnation  she proceeded a few steps farther and beheld the very ivybush close to which her infant lay when she left him exposed  and now from this minute recollection all the mother rising in her soul she saw as it were her babe again in its deserted state and bursting into tears of bitterest contrition and compassion she cried  as i was merciless to thee my child thy father has been pitiless to me as i abandoned thee to die with cold and hunger he has forsaken and has driven me to die by selfmurder  she now fixed her eager eyes on the distant pond and walked more nimbly than before to rid herself of her agonising sense  just as she had nearly reached the wishedfor brink she heard a footstep and saw by the glimmering of a clouded moon a man approaching she turned out of her path for fear her intentions should be guessed at and thwarted but still as she walked another way her eye was wishfully bent toward the water that was to obliterate her love and her remorse  obliterate for ever william and his child  it was now that henry  who to prevent scandal had stolen at that still hour of night to rid the curate of the encumbrance so irksome to him and take the foundling to a woman whom he had hired for the charge  it was now that henry came up with the child of hannah in his arms carefully covered all over from nights dew  hannah is it you cried henry at a little distance where are you going thus late  home sir said she and rushed among the trees  stop hannah he cried i want to bid you farewell  tomorrow i am going to leave this part of the country for a long time  so god bless you hannah saying this he stretched out his arm to shake her by the hand  her poor heart trusting that his blessing for want of more potent offerings might perhaps at this tremendous crisis ascend to heaven in her behalf she stopped returned and put out her hand to take his  softly said he dont wake my child  this spot has been a place of danger for him  for underneath this very ivybush it was that i found him  found what cried hannah with a voice elevated to a tremulous scream  i will not tell you replied henry for no one i have ever yet told of it would believe me  i will believe you i will believe you she repeated with tones yet more impressive  why then said henry only five weeks ago    ah shrieked hannah  what do you mean said henry  go on she articulated in the same voice  why then as i was passing this very place i wish i may never speak truth again if i did not find  here he pulled aside the warm rug in which the infant was wrapped  this beautiful child  with a cord    a cord was round its neck  it is mine  the child is mine  it is mine  my child  i am the mother and the murderer  i fixed the cord while the ground shook under me  while flashes of fire darted before my eyes  while my heart was bursting with despair and horror  but i stopped short  i did not draw the noose  i had a moment of strength and i ran away i left him living  he is living now  escaped from my hands  and i am no longer ashamed but overcome with joy that he is mine i bless you my dear for saving his life  for giving him to me again  for preserving my life as well as my childs  here she took her infant pressed it to her lips and to her bosom then bent to the ground clasped henrys knees and wept upon his feet  he could not for a moment doubt the truth of what she said  her powerful yet broken accents her convulsive starts even more than her declaration convinced him  she now rose from the earth in haste and stealing quick on one side postponed farther gratitude to henry for the performance of the most endearing office of a mother the child greedily received from her bosom the food till then untasted  and on this feeling more exquisitely the tender the proud prerogative of a maternal parent she uttered with sighs of transport  now i am as rich as happy as your father  as blessed as his bride  for i experience the joy of a conscience relieved from a deadly weight  and i have something to love  something on which to pour that fund of affection which he rejects  good heaven cried henry and this is my cousin williams child  but your cousin does not know it said she i never told him  he was not kind enough to embolden me  therefore do not blame him for my sin  he did not know of my wicked designs  he did not encourage me    but he forsook you hannah  he never said he would not he always told me he could not marry me  did he tell you so at his first private meeting  no  nor at the second  no nor yet at the third  when was it he told you so  i forget the exact time  but i remember it was on that very evening when i confessed to him    what  that he had won my heart  why did you confess it  because he asked me and said it would make him happy if i would say so  cruel dishonorable  nay do not blame him  he cannot help not loving me no more than i can help loving him  henry rubbed his eyes  bless me you weep  i always heard that you were brought up in a savage country but i suppose it is a mistake it was your cousin william  will not you apply to him for the support of your child asked henry  if i thought he would not be angry  angry  i will write to him on the subject if you will give me leave  but do not say it is by my desire do not say i wish to trouble him  i would sooner beg than be a trouble to him  why are you so delicate  it is for my own sake  i wish him not to hate me  then thus you may secure his respect  i will write to him and let him know all the circumstances of your case i will plead for his compassion on his child but assure him that no conduct of his will ever induce you to declare except only to me who knew of your previous acquaintance who is the father  to this hannah consented but when henry offered to take from her the infant and carry him to the nurse he had engaged to this she would not consent  do you mean then to acknowledge him yours henry asked  nothing shall force me to part from him i will keep him and let my neighbors judge of me as they please  here henry caught at a hope he feared to name before you will then have no objection said he to clear an unhappy girl to a few friends with whom her character has suffered by becoming at my request his nurse  most gladly i will clear any one so that i do not accuse the father  you give me leave then in your name to tell the whole story to some particular friends my cousin williams part in it alone excepted  i do  henry now cried god bless you with greater fervor than when he spoke it before  and he hoped the nigt was nearly gone that the time might be so much the shorter before rebecca should be reinstated in the esteem of her father and of all those who had misjudged her  god bless you said hannah still more fervently as she walked with unguided steps toward her home for her eyes never wandered from the precious object that caused her unexpected return  chapter xxxi henry rose early in the morning and flew to the curates house with more than even his usual thirst of justice to clearinjured innocence to redeem from shame her whom he loved with eager haste he told  that he had sound the mother whose fall from virtue rebecca overcome by confusion and threats had taken on herself  rebecca rejoiced  but her sisters shook their heads  and even the father seemed to doubt  confident in the truth of his story henry persisted so boldly in his affirmations that if mr rymer did not entirely believe what he said he secretly hoped the dean and other people might therefore he began to imagine he could possibly shake from his family the present stigma whether or no it belonged to any other  no sooner was henry gone than mr rymer waited on the dean to report what he had heard and he frankly attributed his daughters false confession to the compulsive methods he had adopted in charging her with the offense upon this statement henrys love to her was also a solution of his inconsistent conduct on that singular occasion  the dean immediately said  he would put the matter beyond all doubt for he would that moment send for the present reputed mother and if she acknowledged the child he would instantly commit her to prison for the attempt of putting it to death  the curate applauded the deans sagacity a warrant was issued and hannah brought prisoner before the grandfather of her child  she appeared astonished at the peril in which she found herself confused also with a thousand inexpressible sensations which the deans presence inspired she seemed to prevaricate in all she uttered  accused of this she was still more disconcerted  said and unsaid  confessed herself the mother of the infant but declared she did not know  then owned she did know the name of the man who had undone her but would never utter it  at length she cast herself on her knees before the father of her betrayer and supplicated he would not punish her with severity as she most penitently confessed her fault so far as it related to herself  while mr and mrs norwynne just entered on the honeymoon were sitting side by side enjoying with peace and with honor conjugal society poor hannah threatened reviled and sinking to the dust was hearing from the mouth of williams father the enormity of those crimes to which his son had been accessory  she saw the mittimus written that was to convey her into a prison  saw herself delivered once more into the hands of constables before her resolution of concealing the name of william in her story left her  she now overcome with affright and thinking she should expose him still more in a public court if hereafter on her trial she should be obliged to name him  she now humbly asked the dean to hear a few words she had to say in private  where she promised she would speak nothing but the truth  this was impossible he said  no private confessions before a magistrate all must be done openly  she urged again and again the same request  it was denied more peremptorily than at first on which she said  then sir forgive me since you force me to it if i speak before mr rymer and those men what i would for ever have kept a secret if i could  one of your family is my childs father  any of my servants cried the dean  no  my nephew  no one who is nearer still  come this way said the dean i will speak to you in private  it was not that the dean as a magistrate distributed partial decrees of pretended justice  he was rigidly faithful to his trust  he would not inflict punishment on the innocent or let the guilty escape  but in all particulars of refined or coarse treatment he would alleviate or aggravate according to the rank of the offender he could not feel that a secret was of equal importance to a poor as to a rich person  and while hannah gave no intimation but that her delicacy rose from fears for herself she did not so forcibly impress the dean with an opinion that it was a case which had pressing cause for a private conference as when she boldly said a part of his family very near to him was concerned in her tale  the final result of their conversation in an adjoining room was  a charge from the dean in the words of mr rymer to hush the affair up and his promise that the infant should be immediately taken from her and she should have no more trouble with it  i have no trouble with it replied hannah it is now all my comfort and i cannot part from it  why you inconsistent woman did you not attempt to murder it  that was before i had suckled it  it is necessary you should give it up  it must be sent some miles off  and then the whole circumstance will be soon forgotten   i shall never forget it  no matter  you must give up the child  do not most of our first women of quality part with their children  women of quality have other things to love  i have nothing else  and would you occasion my son and his newmade bride the shame and the uneasiness    here hannah burst into a stood of tears and being angrily asked by the dean why she blubbered so   i  have had shame and uneasiness she replied wringing her hands  and you deserve them  they are the sure attendants of crimes such as yours  if you allured and entrapped a young man like my son    i am the youngest by five years said hannah  well well repent returned the dean repent and resign your child repent and you may yet marry an honest man who knows nothing of the matter  and repent too asked hannah  not the insufferable ignorance of young henry when he first came to england was more vexatious or provoking to the dean than the rustic folly of poor hannahs uncultured replies he at last in an offended and determined manner told her  that if she would resign the child and keep the fathers name a secret not only the child should be taken care of but she herself might perhaps receive some favors but if she persisted in her imprudent folly she must expect no consideration on her own account nor should she be allowed for the maintenance of the boy a sixpence beyond the stated sum for the poor mans unlawful offspring hannah resolving not to be separated from her infant bowed resignation to this last decree and terrified at the loud words and angry looks of the dean after being regularly discharged stole to her home where the smiles of her infant and the caresses she lavished on it repaid her for the sorrows she had just suffered for its sake  let it here be observed that the dean on suffering hannah to depart without putting in force the law against her as he had threatened did nothing as it were behind the curtain he openly and heartily owned to mr rymer his clerk and the two constables who were attending  that an affair of some little gallantry in which he was extremely sorry to say his son was rather too nearly involved required in consideration of his recent marriage and an excellent young womans his brides happiness that it should not be publicly talked of  therefore he had thought proper only to reprimand the hussy and sent her about her business  the curate assured the dean  that upon this and upon all other occasions which should would or could occur he owed to his judgment as his superior implicit obedience  the clerk and the two constables most properly said  his honor was a gentleman and of course must know better how to act than they  chapter xxxii it was not the pleasure of a mother that hannah experienced which could make her insensible to the sorrow of a daughter  her parents had received the stranger child along with a fabricated tale she told of its appertaining to another without the smallest suspicion but by the secret diligence of the curate and the nimble tongues of his elder daughters the report of all that had passed on the subject of this unfortunate infant soon circulated through the village and hannah in a few weeks had seen her parents pine away in grief and shame at her loss of virtue  she perceived the neighbors avoid or openly sneer at her  but that was little  she saw them slight her aged father and mother upon her account and she now took the resolution rather to perish for want in another part of the country than live where she was known and so entail a curse on all who loved her she slightly hoped too that by disappearing from the town and neighborhood some little reward might be allowed her for her banishment by the deans family in that she was deceived  no sooner was she gone indeed than her guilt was forgotten but with her guilt her wants the dean and his family rejoiced at her and her childs departure but as this mode she had chosen chanced to be no specified condition in the terms offered to her they did not think they were bound to pay her for it and while she was too fearful and bashful to solicit the dean too proud forlorn as she was to supplicate his son they both concluded she wanted for nothing for to be poor and too delicate to complain they deemed incompatible  to heighten the sense of her degraded friendless situation she knew that henry had not been unmindful of his promise to her but that he had applied to his cousin in her and his childs behalf for he had acquainted her that williams answer was  all obligations on his part were now undertaken by his father for hannah having chosen in a fit of malignity upon his marriage to apprise the dean of their former intercourse such conduct had for ever cancelled all attention due from him to her or to her child beyond what its bare maintenance exacted  in vain had henry explained to him the predicament in which poor hannah was involved before she consented to reveal her secret to his father william was happy in an excuse to rid himself of a burden and he seemed to believe what he wished were true  that she had forfeited all claim to his farther notice  henry informed hannah in as gentle terms as possible of this unkind reception of his efforts in her favor for she excited his deepest compassion  perhaps our own misfortunes are the cause of our pity for others even more than their ills and henrys present sorrows had softened his heart to peculiar sympathy in woe he had unhappily found that the ardour which had hurried him to vindicate the reputation of rebecca was likely to deprive him of the blessing of her ever becoming his wife for the dean chagrined that his son was at length proved an offender instead of his nephew submitted to the temptation of punishing the latter while he forgave the former he sent for henry and having coldly congratulated him on his and rebeccas innocence represented to him the impropriety of marrying the daughter of a poor curate and laid his commands on him never to harbor such an intention more henry found this restriction so severe that he would not promise obedience but on his next attempt to visit rebecca he met a positive repulse from her father who signified to him that the dean had forbid him to permit their farther acquaintance and the curate declared  that for his own part he had no will judgment or faculties but that he submitted in all things to the superior clergy  at the very time young henry had received the proposal from mr rymer of his immediate union with his daughter and the dean had made no objection henry waved the happiness for the time present and had given a reason why he wished it postponed the reason he then gave had its weight but he had another concealed of yet more import  much as he loved and looked forward with rapture to that time when every morning every evening and all the day he should have the delight of rebeccas society still there was one other wish nearer his heart than this  one desire which for years had been foremost in his thoughts and which not even love could cradicate he longed he pined to know what fate had befallen his father provided he were living he could conceive no joy so extreme as that of seeing him if he were dead he was anxious to pay the tribute of filial piety he owed by satisfying his affectionate curiosity in every circumstance of the sad event  while a boy he had frequently expressed these sentiments to both his uncle and his cousin sometimes they apprised him of the total improbability of accomplishing his wishes at other times when they saw the disappointment weigh heavy on his mind they bade him  wait till he was a man before he could hope to put his designs in execution he did wait but on the very day he arrived at the age of twentyone he made a vow  that to gain intelligence of his father should be the first act of his free will  previously to this time he had made all the enquiries possible whether any new adventure to that part of africa in which he was bred was likely to be undertaken of this there appeared to be no prospect till the intended expedition to sierra leone was announced which favored his hope of being able to procure a passage among those adventures so near to the island on which his father was or had been prisoner as to obtain an opportunity of visiting it by stealth  fearing contention or the being dissuaded from his plans if he communicated them he formed them in private kept them secretly and his imagination filled with the kindness the tenderness the excess of fondness he had experienced from his father beyond any other person in the world he had thought with delight on the separation from all his other kindred to pay his duty to him or to his revered memory of late indeed there had been an object introduced to his acquaintance from whom it was bitter to part but his designs had been planned and firmly fixed before he knew rebecca nor could he have tasted contentment even with her at the expense of his piety to his father  in the last interview he had with the dean henry  perceiving that his disposition toward him was not less severe than when a few days before he had ordered him on board a vessel  found this the proper time to declare his intentions of accompanying the sleet to sierra leone his uncle expressed surprise but immediately gave him a sum of money such as he thought might defray his expenses and as he gave it by his willingness his look and his accent seemed to say i foresee this is the last you will ever require  young william though a very dutiful son was amazed when he heard of henrys project as the serious and settled resolution of a man  lady clementina lord and lady bendham and twenty others wished him a successful voyage and thought no more about him  it was for rebecca alone to feel the loss of henry  it was for a mind like hers alone to know his worth  nor did this last proof of it the quitting her for one who claimed by every tie a preference lessen him in her esteem  when by a message from him she became acquainted with his design she valued him the more for this observance of his duty much as it interfered with her happiness  the more she regretted his loss and the more anxiously prayed for his return which in the following letter written just before his departure he taught her to hope for  my dear rebecca i do not tell you i am sorry to part from you  you know i am  and you know all i have suffered since your father denied me permission to see you  but perhaps you do not know the hopes i enjoy and which bestow on me a degree of peace  and those i am eager to tell you  i hope rebecca to see you again  i hope to return to england and overcome every obstacle to our marriage  and then in whatever station we are placed i shall consider myself as happy as it is possible to be in this world  i feel a conviction that you would be happy too  some persons i know estimate happiness by fine houses gardens and parks  others by pictures horses money and various things wholly remote from their own species  but when i wish to ascertain the real felicity of any rational man i always enquire whom he has to love if i find he has nobody  or does not love those he has  even in the midst of all his profusion of finery and grandeur i pronounce him a being in deep adversity in loving you i am happier than my cousin william even though i am obliged to leave you for a time  do not be afraid you should grow old before i return  age can never alter you in my regard it is your gentle nature your unaffected manners your easy cheerfulness your clear understanding the sincerity of all your words and actions that have gained my heart and while you preserve charms like these you will be dearer to me with white hairs and a wrinkled face than any of your sex who not possessing all these qualities possess the youth and bloom of perfect beauty  you will esteem me too i trust though i should return on crutches and with my poor father whom i may be obliged to maintain by daily labor  i will employ all my time during my absence in the study of some art that may enable me to support you both provided heaven will bestow two such blessings on me in the cheering thought that it will be so and in that only i have the courage my dear dear rebecca to say to you  farewell h norwynne   chapter xxxiii before henry could receive a reply to his letter the fleet in which he sailed put to sea on the voyage  by his absence not only rebecca was deprived of the friend she loved but poor hannah lost a kind and compassionate adviser her parents too both sickened and both died in a short time after  and now wholly friendless and in her little exile where she could only hope for toleration not being known she was contending with suspicion rebuffs disappointments and various other ills that might have made the most harsh of her anfield persecutors feel compassion for her could they have witnessed the throbs of her heart and have viewed the state of her agonising mind  still there are few persons whom providence afflicts beyond the limits of all consolation  few cast so low as not to feel pride on certain occasions  and hannah felt a comfort and a dignity in the thought  that she had both a mind and a body capable of sustaining every hardship her destiny might inflict rather than submit to the disgrace of soliciting williams charity a second time  this determination was put to a variety of trials  in vain she offered herself to the strangers of the village in which she was accidentally cast as a servant  her child her dejected looks her broken sentences a wildness in her eye a kind of bold despair that at times spread over her features her imperfect story who and what she was prejudiced all those to whom she applied and after thus traveling to several small towns and hamlets the only employer she could obtain was a farmer and the only employment to tend and feed his cattle while his men were in the harvest tilling the ground or at some other labor which required at that time peculiar expedition  though hannah was born of peasants yet having been an only child and of industrious parents she had been nursed with tenderness and delicacy ill suited to her present occupation  but she endured it with patience and the most laborious part would have seemed light to her could she have dismissed the reflection  what it was that had reduced her to it  soon her tender hands became hard and rough her fair skin burnt and yellow so that when on a sunday she has looked in the glass she has started back as if it were some other face she saw instead of her own but this loss of beauty gave her no regret  while william did not see her it was of little purport to her whether she were beautiful or hideous on the features of her child only she now looked with joy  there she fancied she saw william at every glance  and in the fond imagination felt at times every happiness short of seeing him  by herding solely with the brute creation she and her child were allowed to live together and this was a state she preferred to the society of human creatures who would have separated her from what she loved so tenderly  anxious to retain a place in which she possessed such a blessing care and attention to her humble office caused her master to prolong her stay through all the winter  then during the spring she attended his yeaning sheep  in the summer watched them as they grazed  and thus season after season passed till her young son could afford her assistance in her daily work  he now could charm her with his conversation as well as with his looks  a thousand times in the transports of parental love she has pressed him to her bosom and thought with an agony of horror  on her foul intent to destroy what was now so dear so necessary to her existence  still the boy grew more like his father  in one resemblance alone he failed  he loved hannah with an affection totally distinct from the pitiful and childish gratification of his own selflove  he never would quit her side for all the tempting offers of toys or money  never would eat of rarities given to him till hannah took a part  never crossed her will however contradictory to his own  never saw her smile that he did not laugh  nor did she ever weep but he wept too  chapter xxxiv from the mean subject of oxen sheep and peasants we return to personages  i e persons of rank and fortune the bishop who was introduced in the beginning of this work but who occupied very small space there is now mentioned here merely that the reader may know he is at present in the same state as his writings  dying and that his friend the dean is talked of as the most likely successor to his dignified office  the dean most assuredly had a strong friendship for the bishop and now most assuredly wished him to recover  and yet  when he reflected on the success of his pamphlet a few years back and of many which he had written since on the very same subject he could not but think that he had more righteous pretensions to fill the vacant seat of his much beloved and reverend friend should fate ordain it to be vacated than any other man and he knew that it would not take one moment from that friends remaining life should he exert himself and with all due management to obtain the elevated station when he should be no more  in presupposing the death of a friend the dean  like many other virtuous men  always supposed him going to a better place with perfect resignation therefore he waited whatever change might happen to the bishop ready to receive him with open arms if he recovered or equally ready in case of his dissolution to receive his dignities  lady clementina displayed her sensibility and feeling for the sick prelate by the disgusting extravagance of hysteric fits except at those times when she talked seriously with her husband upon the injustice which she thought would be done to him and to his many pamphlets and sermons if he did not immediately rise to the episcopal honor  surely dean said she should you be disappointed upon this occasion you will write no more books for the good of your country  yes i will he replied but the next book i write for the good of my country shall be very different nay the very reverse of those i have already written  how dean would you show yourself changed  no but i will show that my country is changed  what since you produced your last work only six weeks ago  great changes may occur in six days replied the dean with a threatening accent and if i find things have taken a new and improper turn i will be the first to expose it  but before you act in this manner my dear surely you will wait    i will wait till the sea is disposed of to another said he  he did wait  the bishop died  the dean was promoted to the sea of    and wrote a folio on the prosperity of our happy country  chapter xxxv while the bishop and his son were sailing before prosperous gales on the ocean of life young henry was contending with adverse winds and many other perils on the watery ocean  yet still his distresses and dangers were less than those which hannah had to encounter on land the sea threatens an untimely death the shore menaces calamities from which death is a refuge  the afflictions hannah had already experienced could just admit of aggravation  the addition occurred  had the good farmer who made her the companion of his flocks and herds lived till now till now she might have been secure from the annoyance of human kind but thrown once more upon society she was unfit to sustain the conflict of decorum against depravity  her master her patron her preserver was dead and hardly as she had earned the pittance she received from him she sound it surpassed all her power to obtain the like again her doubtful character her capacious mind her unmethodical manners were still ill suited to the nice precision of a country housewife and as the prudent mistress of a family sneered at her pretensions she in her turn scorned at the narrowminded mistress of a family  in her enquiries how to gain her bread free from the cutting reproaches of discretion she was informed that london was the only private corner where guilt could be secreted undisturbed  and the only public place where in open day it might triumphantly stalk attended by a train of audacious admirers  there was a charm to the ear of hannah in the name of london that thrilled through her soul  william lived in london  and she thought that while she retired to some dark cellar with her offenses he probably would ride in state with his and she at humble distance might sometimes catch a glance of him  as difficult as to eradicate infanity from a mind once possessed so difficult it is to erase from the lovers breast the deep impression of a real affection coercion may prevail for a short interval still love will rage again not all the ignominy hannah experienced in the place where she now was without a home  not the hunger which she at times suffered and even at times saw her child endure  not every inducement for going to london or motive for quitting her present desolate station had the weight to affect her choice so much as  in london she should live nearer william in the present spot she could never hope to see him again but there she might chance to pass him in the streets she might pass his door unobserved every day might enquire about him of his inferior neighbors who would be unsuspicious of the cause of her curiosity  for these gratifications she should breathe another air  for these she could bear all hardships which london threatened and for these she took a threeweeks journey to that perilous town on foot cheering as she walked along her innocent and wearied companion  william in your luxurious dwelling possessed of coffers filled with gold relations friends clients joyful around you delicious viands and rich wines upon your sumptuous board voluptuousness displayed in every apartment of your habitation  contemplate for a moment hannah your first love with her son your first and only child walking through frost and snow to london with a foreboding fear on the mother  that they both may perish for the want of a friend when arrived  but no sooner did hannah find herself within the smoke of the metropolis than the old charm was renewed and scarcely had she refreshed her child at the poor inn at which she stopped than she enquired  how far it was to that part of the town where she knew william resided  she received for answer about two miles  upon this information she thought that she would keep in reserve till some new sorrow befell her the consolation of passing his door perchance of seeing him which must ever be an alleviation of her grief it was not long before she had occasion for even more substantial comfort she soon found she was not likely to obtain a service here more than in the country some objected that she could not make caps and gowns some that she could not preserve and pickle some that she was too young some that she was too pretty and all declined accepting her till at last a citizens wife on condition of her receiving but half the wages usually given took her as a servant of all work  in romances and in some plays there are scenes of dark and unwholesome mines wherein the labourer works during the brightest day by the aid of artificial light there are in london kitchens equally dismal though not quite so much exposed to damp and noxious vapors in one of these under ground hid from the cheerful light of the sun poor hannah was doomed to toil from morning till night subjected to the command of a dissatisfied mistress who not estimating as she ought the misery incurred by serving her constantly threatened her servants with a dismission at which the unthinking wretches would tremble merely from the sound of the words  for to have reflected  to have considered what their purport was  to be released from a dungeon relieved from continual upbraidings and vile drudgery must have been a subject of rejoicing  and yet because these good tidings were delivered as a menace custom had made the poor creatures fearful of the consequence so death being described to children as a disaster even poverty and shame will start from it with affright when had it been pictured as it is a good it would be feared by few and many many would welcome it with gladness  all the care of hannah to please her fear of offending her toilsome days her patience her submission could not prevail on her mistress to retain her one hour after by chance she had heard that hannah was the mother of a child that she wished it should be kept a secret and that she stole out now and then to visit him  hannah with swimming eyes and an almost breaking heart left a place  where to have lived one hour would have plunged any fine lady in the deepest grief  chapter xxxvi hannah was driven from service to service  her deficiency in the knowledge of a mere drudge or her lost character pursued her wherever she went and at length becoming wholly destitute she gladly accepted a place where the latter misfortune was not the least objection  in one of those habitations where continual misery is dressed in continual smiles where extreme of poverty is concealed by extreme of show where wine dispenses mirth only by dispensing forgetfulness and where female beauty is so cheap so complying that while it inveigles it disgusts the man of pleasure  in one of those houses to attend upon its wretched inhabitants hannah was hired  her feelings of rectitude submitted to those of hunger  her principles of virtue which the loss of virtue had not destroyed received a shock when she engaged to be the abettor of vice from which her delicacy morality and religion shrunk but  persons of honor and of reputation would not employ her was she then to perish that perhaps was easy to resolve  but she had a child to leave behind a child from whom to part for a day was a torment  yet before she submitted herself to a situation that filled her mind with a kind of loathing horror often she paced up and down the street in which william lived looked wistfully at his house and sometimes lost to all her finer feelings of independent pride thought of sending a short petition to him  but at the idea of a repulse and of that frowning brow which she knew william could dart on her she preferred death or the most degrading life to the trial  it was long since that misfortune and dishonor had made her callous to the good or ill opinion of all the world except his and the fear of drawing upon her his increased contempt was still at the crisis of applying so powerful that she found she dared not even hazard a reproof from him in the person of his father whose rigor she had now more than once experienced in the frequent harsh messages conveyed to her with the poor stipend for her boy  awed by the rigid and pious character of the new bishop the rising honors and growing reputation of his son she mistook the appearance of moral experience for moral excellence itself and felt her own unworthiness even to become the supplicant of those great men  day after day she watched those parts of the town through which williams chariot was accustomed to drive  but to see the carriage was all to which she aspired  a feeling not to be described forced her to cast her eyes upon the earth as it drew near to her  and when it had passed she beat her breast and wept that she had not seen him  impressed with the superiority of others and her own abject and disgustful state she cried  let me herd with those who will not despise me  let me only see faces whereon i can look without confusion and terror  let me associate with wretches like myself rather than force my shame before those who are so good they can but scorn and mock at me  with a mind thus languishing for sympathy in disgrace she entered a servant in the house just now described there accomplishing the fatal proverb against  evil communications she had not the fortitude to be an exception to the general rule  that pliant disposition which had yielded to the licentious love of william stopped to still baser prostitution in company still more depraved  at first she shuddered at those practices that she saw at those conversations that she heard and blessed herself that poverty not inclination had caused her to be a witness of such things and had condemned her in the vile abode to be a servant rather than in the lower rank of mistress  use softened those horrors every day  at length selfdefence the fear of ridicule and the hope of favor induced her to adopt that very conduct from which her heart revolted  in her sorrowful countenance and fading charms there yet remained attraction for many visitors  and she now submitted to the mercenary profanations of love more odious as her mind had been subdued by its most sacred and endearing joys  while incessant regret whispered to her she ought to have endured every calamity rather than this she thus questioned her nice sense of wrong  why why respect myself while no other respects me why set a value on my own feelings when no one else does  degraded in her own judgment she doubted her own understanding when it sometimes told her she had deserved better treatment  for she felt herself a fool in comparison with her learned seducer and the rest who despised her and why she continued should i ungratefully persist to contemn women who alone are so kind as to accept me a companion why refuse conformity to their customs while none of my sex besides will admit me to their society a partaker of theirs  in speculation these arguments appeared reasonable and she pursued their dictates  but in the practice of the life in which she plunged she proved the fallacy of the system and at times tore her hair with frantic sorrow  that she did not continue in the midway of guilt and so preserve some little portion of selfapprobation to recompense her in a small degree for the total loss of the esteem of all the virtuous world  but she had now gone too far to recede could she have now recalled her innocence even that part she brought with her to london experience would have taught her to have given up her child and have lived once more with the brute creation and apart from him rather than to have mingled with her present society now alas the time for flying was past  all prudent choice was over  even all reflection was gone for ever  or only admitted on compulsion when it imperiously forced its way amidst the scenes of tumultuous mirth of licentious passion of distracted riot shameless effrontery and wild intoxication  when it would force its way  even through the walls of a brothel  chapter xxxvii is there a reader so little experienced in the human heart so forgetful of his own as not to feel the possibility of the following fact  a series of uncommon calamities had been for many years the lot of the elder henry  a succession of prosperous events had fallen to the share of his brother william  the one was the envy while the other had the compassion of all who thought about them for the last twenty years william had lived in affluence bordering upon splendor his friends his fame his fortune daily increasing while henry throughout that very period had by degrees lost all he loved on earth and was now existing apart from civilized society  and yet  during those twenty years where william knew one happy moment henry tasted hundreds  that the state of the mind and not outward circumstances is the nice point on which happiness depends is but a quaint remark but that intellectual power should have the force to render a man discontented in extraordinary prosperity such as that of the present bishop or contented in his brothers extreme of adversity requires illustration  the first great affliction to henry was his brothers ingratitude but reasoning on the frailty of mans nature and the power of mans temptations he found excuses for william which made him support the treatment he had received with more tranquillity than williams proud mind supported his brothers marriage  henrys indulgent disposition made him less angry with william than william was with him  the next affliction henry suffered was the loss of his beloved wife  that was a grief which time and change of objects gradually alleviated while williams wife was a permanent grief to him her puerile mind her talking vanity her affected virtues soured his domestic comfort and in time he had suffered more painful moments from her society than his brother had experienced even from the death of her he loved  in their children indeed william was the happiest  his son was a pride and pleasure to him while henry never thought upon his without lamenting his loss with bitter anguish but if the elder brother had in this instance the advantage still henry had a resource to overbalance this article henry as he lay imprisoned in his dungeon and when after his punishment was remitted he was again allowed to wander and seek his subsistence where he would in all his tedious walks and solitary restingplaces during all his lonely days and mournful nights had this resource to console him  i never did an injury to any one never was harsh severe unkind deceitful i did not merely confine myself to do my neighbor no harm i strove to serve him  this was the resource that cheered his sinking heart amidst gloomy deserts and a barbarous people lulled him to peaceful slumber in the hut of a savage hunter and in the sound of the lions roar at times impressed him with a sense of happiness and made him contemplate with a longing hope the retribution of a future world  the bishop with all his comforts had no comfort like this  he had his solitary reflections too but they were of a tendency the reverse of these  i used my brother ill was a secret thought of most powerful influence  it kept him waking upon his safe and commodious bed was sure to recur with every misfortune by which he was threatened to make his fears still stronger and came with invidious stabs upon every successful event to take from him a part of his joy  in a word it was conscience that made henrys years pass happier than williams  but though comparatively with his brother william was the less happy man yet his selfreproach was not of such magnitude for an offense of that atrocious nature as to banish a certain degree of happiness and a sensibility to the smiles of fortune from his breast  nor was henrys selfacquittal of such exquisite kind as to chase away the feeling of his desolate situation  as he fished or hunted for his daily dinner many a time in full view of his prey a sudden burst of sorrow at his fate a sudden longing for some dear society for some friend to share his thoughts for some kind shoulder on which to lean his head for some companion to partake of his repast would make him instantaneously desist from his pursuit cast him on the ground in a fit of anguish till a shower of tears and his conscience came to his relief  it was on a sultry morning when after pleasant dreams during the night he had walked with more than usual perception of his misery that sitting upon the bench his wishes and his looks all bent on the sea toward his native land he thought he saw a sail swelling before an unexpected breeze  sure i am dreaming still he cried this is the very vessel i saw last night in my sleep  oh what cruel mockery that my eyes should so deceive me  yet though he doubted he leaped upon his feet in transport  held up his hands stretched at their length in a kind of ecstatic joy  and as the glorious fight approached was near rushing into the sea to meet it  for a while hope and fear kept him in a state bordering on distraction  now he saw the ship making for the shore and tears flowed for the grateful prospect now it made for another point and he vented shrieks and groans from the disappointment  it was at those moments while hope and fear thus possessed him that the horrors of his abode appeared more than ever frightful  inevitable afflictions must be borne but that calamity which admits the expectation of relief that is afterward denied is insupportable  after a few minutes passed in dreadful uncertainty which enhanced the wishedfor happiness the ship evidently drew near the land  a boat was launched from her  and while henry now upon his knees wept and prayed fervently for the event a youth sprang from the barge on the strand rushed toward him and falling on his neck then at his feet exclaimed  my father oh my father  william dean bishop what are your honors what your riches what all your possessions compared to the happiness the transport bestowed by this one sentence on your poor brother henry  chapter xxxviii the crosses at land and the perilous events at sea had made it now several years since young henry first took the vow of a man no longer dependent on the will of another to seek his father his fatigues his dangers were well recompensed instead of weeping over a silent grave he had the inexpressible joy to receive a parents blessing for his labors yet the elder henry though living was so changed in person that his son would scarcely have known him in any other than the favorite spot which the younger keeping in memory every incident of his former life knew his father had always chosen for his morning contemplations and where previously to his coming to england he had many a time kept him company it was to that particular corner of the island that the captain of the ship had generously ordered they should steer out of the general route to gratify the filial tenderness he expressed but scarcely had the interview between the father and the son taken place than a band of natives whom the appearance of the vessel had called from the woods and hills came to attack the invaders the elder henry had no friend with whom he wished to shake hands at his departure the old negro servant who had assisted in young henrys escape was dead and he experienced the excessive joy of bidding adieu to a place without one regret for all he left behind  on the night of that day whose morning had been marked by peculiar sadness at the louring prospect of many exiled years to come he slept on board an english vessel with englishmen his companions and his son his beloved son  who was still more dear to him for that mind which had planned and executed his rescue  his attentive servant and most affectionate friend  though many a year passed and many a rough encounter was destined to the lot of the two henrys before they saw the shores of europe yet to them to live or to die together was happiness enough  even young henry for a time asked for no greater blessing  but the first glow of filial ardor over he called to mind rebecca lived in england and every exertion which love founded on the highest reverence and esteem could dictate he employed to expedite a voyage the end of which would be crowned by the sight of her  chapter xxxix the contrast of the state of happiness between the two brothers was nearly resembled by that of the two cousins  the riches of young william did not render him happy nor did the poverty of young henry doom him to misery his affectionate heart as he had described in his letter to rebecca loved persons rather than things and he would not have exchanged the society of his father or the prospect of her hand and heart for all the wealth and finery of which his cousin william was the master  he was right young william though he viewed with contempt henrys inferior state was far less happy than he  his marriage had been the very counterpart of his fathers and having no child to create affection to his home his study was the only relief from the domestic encumbrance his wife and though by unremitting application there joined to the influence of the potent relations of the woman he hated he at length arrived at the summit of his ambitious desires still they poorly repaid him for the sacrifice he had made in early life of every tender disposition  striding through a list of rapid advancements in the profession of the law at the age of thirtyeight he found himself raised to preferment such as rarely falls to the share of a man of his short experience  he found himself invested with a judges robe and gratified by the exalted office curbed more than ever that aversion which her want of charms or sympathy had produced against the partner of his honors  while william had thus been daily rising in fortunes favor poor hannah had been daily sinking deeper and deeper under fortunes frowns till at last she became a midnight wanderer through the streets of london soliciting or rudely demanding money of the passing stranger sometimes hunted by the watch she affrighted fled from street to street from portico to portico  and once unknowing in her fear which way she hurried she found her trembling knees had sunk and her wearied head was reclined against the pillars that guarded williams door  at the sudden recollection where she was a swell of passion composed of horror of despair and love gave reanimated strength to her failing limbs and regardless of her pursuers steps she ran to the center of the street and looking up to the windows of the house cried ah there he sleeps in quiet in peace in ease  he does not even dream of me  he does not care how the cold pierces or how the people persecute me  he does not thank me for all the lavish love i have borne him and his child  his heart is so hard he does not even recollect that it was he who brought me to ruin  had these miseries common to the unhappy prostitute been alone the punishment of hannah  had her crimes and sufferings ended in distress like this her story had not perhaps been selected for a public recital for it had been no other than the customary history of thousands of her sex but hannah had a destiny yet more severe  unhappily she was endowed with a mind so sensibly alive to every joy and every sorrow to every mark of kindness every token of severity so liable to excess in passion that once perverted there was no degree of error from which it would with firmness revolt  taught by the conversation of the dissolute poor with whom she now associated or by her own observation on the worldly reward of elevated villainy she began to suspect that dishonesty was only held a sin to secure the property of the rich and that to take from those who did not want by the art of stealing was less guilt than to take from those who did want by the power of the law  by false yet seducing opinions such as these her reason estranged from every moral and religious tie her necessities urgent the reluctantly aceepted the proposal to mix with a band of practiced sharpers and robbers and become an accomplice in negotiating bills forged on a country banker  but though ingenious in arguments to excuse the deed before its commission in the act she had the dread of some uncontrovertible statement on the other side of the question intimidated by this conviction she was the veriest bungler in her vile profession  and on the alarm of being detected while every one of her confederates escaped and absconded she alone was seized  was arrested for issuing notes they had fabricated and committed to the provincial jail about fifty miles from london where the crime was perpetrated to take her trial for  life or death  chapter xl the day at length is come on which hannah shall have a sight of her beloved william  she who has watched for hours near his door to procure a glimpse of him going out or returning home who has walked miles to see his chariot pass she now will behold him and he will see her by the command of the laws of their country  those laws that will deal with rigor toward her in this one instance are still indulgent  the time of the assizes at the countytown in which she is imprisoned is arrived  the prisoners are demanded at the shirehall  the jail doors are opened  they go in sad procession  the trumpet sounds  it speaks the arrival of the judge  and that judge is william  the day previous to her trial hannah had read in the printed calendar of the prisoners his name as the learned justice before whom she was to appear for a moment she forgot her perilous state in the excess of joy which the still unconquerable love she bore to him permitted her to taste even on the brink of the grave  afterreflection made her check those worldly transports as unfit for the present solemn occasion but alas to her earth and william were so closely united that till she forsook the one she could never cease to think without the contending passions of hope of fear of joy of love of shame and of despair on the other  now fear took place of her first immoderate joy  she feared that although much changed in person since he had seen her and her real name now added to many an alias  yet she feared that some wellknown glance of the eye turn of the action or accent of speech might recall her to his remembrance and at that idea shame overcame all her other sensations  for still she retained pride in respect to his opinion to wish him not to know hannah was that wretch she felt she was  once a ray of hope beamed on her that if he knew her if he recognized her he might possibly befriend her cause  and life bestowed through williams friendship seemed a precious object  but again that rigorous honor she had often heard him boast that firmness to his word of which she had fatal experience taught her to know he would not for any improper compassion any unmanly weakness forfeit his oath of impartial justice  in meditations such as these she passed the sleepless night  when in the morning she was brought to the bar and her guilty hand held up before the righteous judgment seat of william imagination could not form two figures or two situations more incompatible with the existence of former familiarity than the judge and the culprit  and yet these very persons had passed together the most blissful moments that either ever tasted  those hours of tender dalliance were now present to her mind  his thoughts were more nobly employed in his high office  nor could the haggard face hollow eye desponding countenance and meagre person of the poor prisoner once call to his memory though her name was uttered among a list of others that she had assumed his former youthful lovely hannah  she heard herself arraigned with trembling limbs and downcast looks  and many witnesses had appeared against her before she ventured to lift her eyes up to her awful judge she then gave one fearful glance and discovered william unpitying but beloved william in every feature it was a face she had been used to look on with delight and a kind of absent smile of gladness now beamed on her poor wan visage  when every witness on the part of the prosecutor had been examined the judge addressed himself to her  what defense have you to make  it was william spoke to hannah  the sound was sweet  the voice was mild was soft compassionate encouraging  it almost charmed her to a love of life  not such a voice as when william last addessed her when he left her undone and pregnant vowing never to see or speak to her more  she could have hung upon the present words for ever she did not call to mind that this gentleness was the effect of practice the art of his occupation which at times is but a copy by the unfeeling from his benevolent brothers of the bench in the present judge tenderness was not designed for the culprits consolation but for the approbation of the auditors  there were no spectators hannah by your side when last he parted from you  if there had the awful william had been awed to marks of pity  stunned with the enchantment of that wellknown tongue directed to her she stood like one just petrified  all vital power was suspended  again he put the question and with these additional sentences tenderly and emphatically delivered  recollect yourself  have you no witnesses no proof in your behalf  a dead silence followed these questions  he then mildly but forcibly added  what have you to say  here a flood of tears burst from her eyes which she fixed earnestly upon him as if pleading for mercy while she faintly articulated  nothing my lord  after a short pause he asked her in the same forcible but benevolent tone  have you no one to speak for your character  the prisoner answered  no  a second gush of tears followed this reply for she called to mind by whom her character had first been blasted  he summed up the evidence  and every time he was compelled to press hard upon the proofs against her she shrunk and seemed to stagger with the deadly blow  writhed under the weight of his minute justice more than from the prospect of a shameful death  the jury consulted but a few minutes  the verdict was   guilty  she heard it with composure  but when william placed the fatal velvet on his head and rose to pronounce her sentence  she started with a kind of convulsive motion  retreated a step or two back and lifting up her hands with a scream exclaimed   oh not from you  the piercing shriek which accompanied these words prevented their being heard by part of the audience and those who heard them thought little of their meaning more than that they expressed her fear of dying  serene and dignified as if no such exclamation had been uttered william delivered the fatal speech ending with  dead dead dead  she fainted as he closed the period and was carried back to prison in a swoon while he adjourned the court to go to dinner  chapter xli if unaffected by the scene he had witnessed william sat down to dinner with an appetite let not the reader conceive that the most distant idea had struck his mind  of his ever having seen much less familiarly known the poor offender whom he had just condemned still this forgetfulness did not proceed from the want of memory for hannah  in every peevish or heavy hour passed with his wife he was sure to think of her  yet it was selflove rather than love of her that gave rise to these thoughts  he felt the want of female sympathy and tenderness to soften the fatigue of studious labor to soothe a sullen a morose disposition  he felt he wanted comfort for himself but never once considered what hannahs wants were  in the chagrin of a barren bed he sometimes thought too even on the child that hannah bore him but whether it were male or female whether a beggar in the streets or dead  various and important public occupations forbade him to waste time to enquire yet the poor the widow and the orphan frequently shared williams ostentatious bounty he was the president of many excellent charities gave largely and sometimes instituted benevolent societies for the unhappy for he delighted to load the poor with obligations and the rich with praise  there are persons like him who love to do every good but that which their immediate duty requires  there are servants who will serve every one more cheerfully than their masters  there are men who will distribute money liberally to all except their creditors  and there are wives who will love any man better than their husbands  duty is a familiar word which has little effect upon an ordinary mind and as ordinary minds are in a vast majority we have acts of generosity valor selfdenial and bounty where smaller pains would constitute greater virtues  had william followed the common dictates of charity had he adopted private pity instead of public munificence had he cast an eye at home before he sought abroad for objects of compassion hannah had been preserved from an ignominious death and he had been preserved from  remorse  the tortures of which he for the first time proved on reading a printed sheet of paper thrown accidentally in his way a few days after he had left the town in which he had condemned her to die  march the    th      the last dying words speech and confession birth parentage and education life character and behavior of hannah primrose who was executed this morning between the hours of ten and twelve pursuant to the sentence passed upon her by the honorable justice norwynne  hannah primrose was born of honest parents in the village of anfield in the county of  william started at the name of the village and county but being led astray by the arts and flattery of seducing man she fell from the paths of virtue premeditated many horrid crimes and took to bad company which instilled into her young heart all their evil practices and at length brought her to this untimely end so she hopes her death will be a warning to all young persons of her own sex how they listen to the praises and courtship of young men especially of those who are their betters for they only court to deceive  but the said hannah freely forgives all persons who have done her injury or given her sorrow from the young man who first won her heart to the jury who found her guilty and the judge who condemned her to death  and she acknowledges the justice of her sentence not only in respect of the crime for which she suffers but in regard to many other heinous sins of which she has been guilty more especially that of once attempting to commit a murder upon her own helpless child for which guilt she now considers the vengeance of god has overtaken her to which she is patiently resigned and parts in peace and charity with all the world praying the lord to have mercy on her poor departing soul  postscript to the confession so great was this unhappy womans terror of death and the awful judgment that was to follow that when sentence was pronounced upon her she fell into a swoon from that into convulsions from which she never entirely recovered but was delirious to the time of her execution except that short interval in which she made her confession to the clergyman who attended her  she has left one child a youth about sixteen who has never forsaken his mother during all the time of her imprisonment but with true filial duty waited on her  and no sooner was her fatal sentence passed than he began to droop and now lies dangerously ill near the prison from which she is released by death  during the loss of her senses the said hannah raved continually on this child  and asking for pen ink and paper wrote an incoheret petition to the judge recommending the youth to his protection and mercy but notwithstanding this insanity she behaved with composure and resignation when the fatal period arrived that she was to be launched into eternity she prayed devoutly during the last hour and seemed to have her whole mind fixed on the world to which she was going  a crowd of spectators followed her to the fatal spot most of whom returned weeping at the recollection of the fervency with which she prayed and the impression which her dreadful state seemed to make upon her    no sooner had the name of anfield struck william than a thousand reflections and remembrances flashed on his mind to give him conviction whom he had judged and sentenced he recollected the sad remains of hannah such as he once had known her  and now he wondered how his thoughts could have been absent from an object so pitiable so worthy of his attention as not to give him even a suspicion who she was either from her name or from her person during the whole trial  but wonder astonishment horror and every other sensation was absorbed in  remorse  it wounded it stabbed it rent his hard heart as it would do a tender one  it havocked on his firm inflexible mind as it would on a weak and pliant brain  spirit of hannah look down and behold all your wrongs revenged william feels  remorse  chapter xlii a few momentary cessations from the pangs of a guilty conscience were given to william as soon as he had dispatched a messenger to the jail in which hannah had been confined to enquire after the son she had left behind and to give orders that immediate care should be taken of his health and safety  he likewise charged the messenger to convey back to him the petition she had addressed to him during her supposed insanity for it was now no trivial consolation to him that he might possibly have it in his power to grant a request from her  the messenger returned with the written paper which had been considered by the persons to whom she had entrusted it as the distracted sentences of an insane mind but to william they proved beyond a doubt that she was perfectly in her senses  to lord chief justice norwynne my lord i am hannah primrose the daughter of john and hannah primrose of anfield  my father and mother lived by the hill at the side of the little brook where you used to fish and where you first saw me  pray my lord have mercy on my sorrows pity me for the first time and spare my life i know i have done wrong  i know it is presumption in me to dare to apply to you such a wicked and mean wretch as i am but my lord you once condescended to take notice of me  and though i have been very wicked since that time yet if you would be so merciful as to spare my life i promise to amend it for the future but if you think it proper i should die i will be resigned but then i hope i beg i supplicate that you will grant my other petition  pray pray my lord if you cannot pardon me be merciful to the child i leave behind  what he will do when i am gone i dont know  for i have been the only friend he has had ever since he was born  he was born my lord about sixteen years ago at anfield one summers morning and carried by your cousin mr henry norwynne to mr rymers the curate there  and i swore whose child he was before the dean and i did not take a false oath indeed indeed my lord i did not  i will say no more for fear this should not come safe to your hand for the people treat me as if i were mad  so i will say no more only this that whether i live or die i forgive every body and i hope every body will forgive me  and i pray that god will take pity on my son if you refuse but i hope you will not refuse  hannah primrose   william rejoiced as he laid down the petition that she had asked a favor he could bestow and hoped by his protection of the son to redress in a degree the wrongs he had done the mother he instantly sent for the messenger into his apartment and impatiently asked if he had seen the boy and given proper directions for his care  i have given directions sir for his funeral  how cried william  he pined away ever since his mother was confined and died two days after her execution  robbed by this news of his only gleam of consolation  in the consciousness of having done a mortal injury for which he never now by any means could atone he saw all his honors all his riches all his proud selfish triumphs dance before him they seemed like airy nothings which in rapture he would exchange for the peace of a tranquil conscience  he envied hannah the death to which he exposed then condemned her  he envied her even the life she struggled through from his neglect  and felt that his future days would be far less happy than her former existence he calculated with precision  chapter xliii the progressive rise of william and fall of hannah had now occupied nearly the term of eighteen years  added to these another year elapsed before the younger henry completed the errand on which his heart was fixed shipwreck imprisonment and ills to which the poor and unfriended traveller is peculiarly exposed detained the father and son in various remote regions until the present period and for the last fifteen years denied them the means of all correspondence with their own country  the elder henry was now past sixty years of age and the younger almost beyond the prime of life still length of time had not diminished but rather had increased their anxious longings for their native home  the sorrows disappointments and fatigues that throughout these tedious years were endured by the two henrys are of that dull monotonous kind of suffering better omitted than described mere repetitions of the exiles woe that shall give place to the transporting joy of return from banishment  yet much as the younger had reckoned with impatient wishes the hours that were passed distant from her he loved no sooner was his disastrous voyage at an end and his feet trod upon the shores of england and a thousand wounding fears made him almost doubt whether it were happiness or misery he had obtained by his arrival if rebecca were living he knew it must be happiness  for his heart dwelt with confidence on her faith  her unchanging sentiments but death might possibly have ravished from his hopes what no mortal power could have done and thus the lover creates a rival in every ill rather than suffer his fears to remain inanimate  the elder henry had less to fear or to hope than his son  yet he both feared and hoped with a sensibility that gave him inexpressible anxiety he hoped his brother would receive him with kindness after his long absence and once more take his son cordially to his favor he longed impatiently to behold his brother to see his nephew nay in the ardour of the renewed affection he just now felt he thought even a distant view of lady clementina would be grateful to his sight but still well remembering the pomp the state the pride of william he could not rely on his affection so much he knew that it depended on external circumstances to excite or to extinguish his love not that he feared an absolute repulsion from his brother but he feared what to a delicate mind is still worse  reserved manners cold looks absent sentences and all the cruel retinue of indifference with which those who are beloved so often wound the bosom that adores them  by enquiring of their countrymen whom they met as they approached to the end of their voyage concerning their relation the dean the two henrys learned that he was well and had for some years past been exalted to the bishopric of    this news gave them joy while it increased their fear of not receiving a familiar welcome  the younger henry on his landing wrote immediately to his uncle acquainting him with his fathers arrival in the most abject state of poverty he addressed his letters to the bishops country residence where he knew as it was the summer season he would certainly be he and his father then set off on foot toward that residence  a palace  the bishops palace was not situated above fifty miles from the port where they had landed and at a small inn about three miles from the bishops they proposed as the letter to him intimated to wait for his answer before they intruded into his presence  at the town where they came on shore and as they walked on their journey though it was somewhat solitary that they knew no creature whom they met or saw yet it was no small consolation that no creature knew them  to be poor and ragged father the younger smilingly said is no disgrace no shame thank heaven where the object is not known  true my son replied henry and perhaps i feel myself much happier now unknowing and unknown to all but you than i shall in the presence of my fortunate brother and his family for there confusion at my ill success through life may give me greater pain than even my misfortunes have inflicted  after uttering this reflection that had preyed upon his mind he sat down on the road side to rest his discomfited limbs before he could proceed farther his son reasoned with him gave him courage and now his hopes preponderated till after two days journey on arriving at the inn where an answer from the bishop was expected no letter no message had been left  he means to renounce us said henry trembling and whispering to his son  without disclosing to the people of the house who they were or from whom the letter or the message they enquired for was to have cone they retired and consulted what steps they were now to pursue  previously to his writing to the bishop the younger henrys heart all his inclinations had swayed him toward a visit to the village in which was his uncles former country seat  the beloved village of anfield  but respect and duty to him had made him check those wishes  now they revived again  and with the image of rebecca before his eyes he warmly entreated his father to go with him to anfield at present only thirty miles distance and from thence write once more  then wait the will of his uncle  the father consented to this proposal even glad to postpone the visit to his dignified brother  after a scanty repast such as they had been long inured to they quitted the inn and took the road toward anfield  chapter xliv it was about five in the afternoon of a summers day that henry and his son left the sign of the mermaid and began their third days journey the young mans spirits elated with the prospect of the reception he should meet from rebecca the elder dejected at not receiving a welcome from his brother  the road which led to anfield necessarily took our travelers within sight of the bishops palace  the turrets appeared at a distance  and on the sudden turn round the corner of a large plantation the whole magnificent structure was at once exhibited before his brothers astonished eyes he was struck with the grandeur of the habitation  and totally forgetting all the unkind the contemptuous treatment he had ever received from its owner like the same henry in his earlier years smiled with a kind of transport that william was so great a man  after this first joyous sensation was over let us go a little nearer my son said he no one will see us i hope or if they should you can run and conceal yourself and not a creature will know me  even my brother would not know me thus altered  and i wish to take a little farther view of his fine house and all his pleasure grounds  young henry though impatient to be gone would not object to his fathers desire  they walked forward between a shady grove and a purling rivulet snuffed in odours from the jessamine banks and listened to the melody of an adjoining aviary  the allurements of the spot seemed to enchain the elder henry and he at length sauntered to the very avenue of the dwelling but just as he had set his daring yet trembling feet upon the turf that led to the palace gates he suddenly stopped on hearing as he thought the village clock strike seven which reminded him that evening drew on and it was time to go  he listened again  when he and his son both together said it is the toll of the bell before some funeral  the signals of death while they humble the rich inspire the poor with pride the passing bell gave henry a momentary sense of equality and he courageously stepped forward to the first winding of the avenue  he darted back at the sight which presented itself  a hearse  mourning coaches  mutes  plumed horses  with every other token of the persons importance who was going to be committed to the earth  scarce had his terrified eyes been thus unexpectedly struck  when a coffin borne by six men issued from the gates and was deposited in the waiting receptacle while gentlemen in mourning went into the different coaches  a standard bearer now appeared with an escutcheon on which the keys and mitre were displayed young henry upon this pathetically exclaimed  my uncle  it is my uncles funeral  henry his father burst into tears  the procession moved along  the two henrys the only real mourners in the train followed at a little distance  in rags but in tears  the elder henrys heart was nearly bursting  he longed to clasp the dead corpse of his brother without the dread of being spurned for his presumption  he now could no longer remember him either as the dean or bishop but leaping over that whole interval of pride and arrogance called only to his memory william such as he knew him when they lived at home together together walked to london and there together almost perished for want  they arrived at the church  and while the coffin was placing in the dreary vault henry crept slowly after to the hideous spot  his reflections now took a different point is this possible he said to himself is this the dean whom i ever feared is this the bishop of whom within the present hour i stood in awe is this william whose every glance struck me with his superiority alas my brother and is this horrid abode the return for all your aspiring efforts is this the only remains of your greatness which you exhibit to me on my return did you foresee an end like this while you treated me and many more of your youthful companions with haughtiness and contempt while you thought it becoming of your dignity to shun and despise us where is the difference now between my departed wife and you or if there be a difference she perchance has the advantage  ah my poor brother for distinction in the other world i trust some of your anxious labors have been employed for you are now of less importance in this than when you and i first left our native town and hoped for nothing greater than to be suffered to exist  on their quitting the church they enquired of the bystanders particulars of the bishops death and heard he had been suddenly carried off by a raging fever  young henry enquired if lady clementina was at the palace or mr norwynne  the latter is there  he was answered by a poor woman but lady clementina has been dead these four years  dead dead cried young henry that worldly woman quitted this world for ever  yes answered the stranger she caught cold by wearing a newfashioned dress that did not half cover her wasted all away and died the miserablest object you ever heard of  the person who gave this melancholy intelligence concluded it with a hearty laugh which would have surprised the two hearers if they had not before observed  that amongst all the village crowd that attended to see this solemn show not one afflicted countenance appeared not one dejected look not one watery eye the pastor was scarcely known to his flock  it was in london his meridian lay  at the levee of ministers  at the table of peers  at the drawingrooms of the great  and now his neglected parishioners paid his indifference in kind  the ceremony over and the mourningsuite departed the spectators dispersed with smiling faces from the sad spot while the henrys with heavy hearts retraced their steps back toward the palace  in their way at the crossing of a style they met a poor labourer returning from his days work who looking earnestly at the throng of persons who were leaving the churchyard said to the elder henry  pray master what are all them folk gathered together about what is the matter there  there has been a funeral replied henry  oh zooks what a burying  ay now i see it is  and i warrant of our old bishop  i heard he was main ill  it is he they have been putting into the ground is not it  yes said henry  why then so much the better  the better cried henry  yes master  though i should be loath to be where he is now  henry started  he was your pastor man  ha ha ha  i should be sorry that my masters sheep that are feeding yonder should have no better pastor  the fox would soon get them all  you surely did not know him  not much i cannot say i did  for he was above speaking to poor folks  unless they did any mischief and then he was sure to take notice of them  i believe he meant well said henry  as to what he meant god only knows  but i know what he did  and what did he  nothing at all for the poor  if any of them applied to him no doubt    oh they knew better than all that comes to  for if they asked for any thing he was sure to have them sent to bridewell or the workhouse  he used to say   the workhouse was a fine place for a poor man  the food good enough and enough of it   yet he kept a dainty table himself his dogs too fared better than we poor he was vastly tender and good to all his horses and dogs i will say that for him and to all brute beasts he would suffer them to be either starved or struck  but he had no compassion for his fellow creatures  i am sensible you do him wrong  that he is the best judge of by this time he has sent many a poor man to the house of correction  and now it is well if he has not got a place there himself ha ha ha  did he give nothing in charity  next to nothing a little weak broth that runs through ones stomach like mad  a working man master cannot live on such mess  and my wife wore out more shoeleather going after it and lost more time waiting at the door before his fat servants would bring it her than the thing was worth  however as we should not speak ill of the dead i say nothing against him so good night master  the man was walking away when henry called to him  pray can you tell me if the bishops son is at the palace  oh yes you will find master there treading in the the old mans shoes as proud as lucifer  has he any children  no please god there is been enough of the name  and after the son is gone i hope we shall have no more of the breed  is mrs norwynne the sons wife at the palace  what master did not you know what is become of her  any accident    ha ha ha  yes i cannot help laughing  why master she made a mistake and went to another mans bed  and so her husband and she were parted  and she has married the other man  indeed cried henry amazed  ay indeed  but if it had been my wife or yours the bishop would have made her do penance in a white sheet  but as it was a lady why it was all very well  and any one of us that had been known to talk about it would have been sent to bridewell straight  but we did talk notwithstanding  the malicious joy with which the peasant told this story made henry believe more than all the complaints the man uttered that there had been want of charity and christian deportment in the conduct of the bishops family he almost wished himself back on his savage island where brotherly love could not be less than it appeared to be in this civilized country  chapter xlv as henry and his son after parting from the poor labourer approached the late bishops palace all the charms of its magnificence its situation which but a few hours before had captivated the elder henrys mind was vanished  and from the mournful ceremony he had since been witness of he now viewed this noble edifice but as a heap of rubbish piled together to fascinate weak understandings and to make even the wise and religious man at times forget why he was sent into this world  instead of presenting themselves to their nephew and cousin they both felt an unconquerable reluctance to enter under the superb the melancholy roof  a bank a hedge a tree a hill seemed at this juncture a pleasanter shelter and each felt himself happy in being a harmless wanderer on the face of the earth rather than living in splendour while the wants the revilings of the hungry and the naked were crying to heaven for vengeance  they gave a heartfelt sigh to the vanity of the rich and the powerful and pursued a path where they hoped to meet with virtue and happiness  they arrived at anfield  possessed by apprehensions which his uncles funeral had served to increase young henry as he entered the wellknown village feared every sound he heard would convey intelligence of rebeccas death he saw the parsonage house at a distance but dreaded to approach it lest rebecca should no longer be an inhabitant  his father indulged him in the wish to take a short survey of the village and rather learn by indirect means by observation his fate than hear it all at once from the lips of some blunt relater  anfield had undergone great changes since henry left it  he found some cottages raised where formerly there were none and some were no more where he had frequently called and held short conversations with the poor who dwelt in them amongst the latter number was the house of hannahs parents  fallen to the ground he wondered to himself where that poor family had taken up their abode henry in a kinder world  he once again cast a look at the parsonage house  his inquisitive eye informed him there no alteration had taken place externally  but he feared what change might be within  at length he obtained the courage to enter the churchyard in his way to it  as he slowly and tremblingly moved along he stopped to read here and there a gravestone as mild instructive conveyers of intelligence to which he could attend with more resignation than to any o her reporter  the second stone he came to he found was erected to the memory of the reverend thomas rymer rebeccas father he instantly called to mind all that poor enrates quick sensibility of wrong toward himself his unbridled rage in consequence and smiled to think  how trivial now appeared all for which he gave way to such excess of passion  but shocked at the death of one so near to her he loved he now feared to read on and accidentally cast his eyes from the tombs to the church through the window of the chancel his sight was struck with a tall monument of large dimensions raised since his departure and adorned with the finest sculpture his curiosity was excited  he drew near and he could distinguish followed by elegant poetic praise  to the memory of john lord viscount bendham  notwithstanding the solemn melancholy anxious bent of henrys mind he could not read these words and behold his costly fabric without indulging a momentary fit of indignant laughter  are sculpture and poetry thus debased he cried to perpetuate the memory of a man whose best advantage is to be forgotten whose no one action merits record but as an example to be shunned  an elderly woman leaning on her stick now passed along the lane by the side of the church  the younger henry accosted her and ventured to enquire where the daughters of mr rymer since his death were gone to live  we live she returned in that small cottage across the clover field  henry looked again and thought he had mistaken the word we  for he felt assured that he had no knowledge of the person to whom he spoke  but she knew him and after a pause cried  ah mr henry you are welcome back i am heartily glad to see you  and my poor sister rebecca will go out of her wits with joy  is rebecca living and will be glad to see me he cagerly asked while tears of rapture trickled down his face father he continued in his ecstacy we are now come home to be completely happy  and i feel as if all the years i have been away were but a short week and as if all the dangers i have passed had been light as a feather  but is it possible he cried to his kind informer that you are one of rebeccas sisters  well might he ask for instead of the blooming woman of sevenandtwenty he had left her her color was gone her teeth impaired her voice broken she was near fifty  yes i am one of mr rymers daughters she replied  but which said henry  the eldest and once called the prettiest she returned though now people tell me i am altered  yet i cannot say i see it myself  and are you all living henry enquired  all but one she married and died the other three on my fathers death agreed to live together and knit or spin for our support so we took that small cottage and furnished it with some of the parsonage furniture as you shall see  and kindly welcome i am sure you will be to all it affords though that is but little  as she was saying this she led him through the clover field toward the cottage  his heart rebounded with joy that rebecca was there  yet as he walked he shuddered at the impression which he feared the first sight of her would make he feared what he imagined till he had seen this change in his sister he should never heed he feared rebecca would look no longer young he was not yet sufficient master over all his sensual propensities as when the trial came to think he could behold her look like her sister and not give some evidence of his disappointment  his fears were vain  on entering the gate of their little garden rebecca rushed from the house to meet them just the same rebecca as ever  it was her mind which beaming on her face and actuating her every motion had ever constituted all her charms it was her mind which had gained her henrys affection that mind had undergone no change and she was the selfsame woman he had left her  he was entranced with joy  chapter xlvi the fare which the henrys partook at the cottage of the female rymers was such as the sister had described mean and even scanty but this did not in the least diminish the happiness they received in meeting for the first time since their arrival in england human beings who were glad to see them  at a stinted repast of milk and vegetables a glimmering light by a little brushwood on the hearth they yet could feel themselves comparatively blessed while they listened to the recital of afflictions which had befallen persons around that very neighborhood for whom every delicious viand had been procured to gratify the taste every art devised to delight all the other senses  it was by the side of this glimmering fire that rebecca and her sisters told the story of poor hannahs fate and of the thorn it had for ever planted in williams bosom  of his reported sleepless perturbed nights and his gloomy or starting and halfdistracted days when in the fullness of remorse he has complained  of a guilty conscience of the weariness attached to continued prosperity the misery of wanting an object of affection  they told of lord bendhams death from the effects of intemperance from a mass of blood infected by high seasoned dishes mixed with copious draughts of wine  repletion of food and liquor not less fatal to the existence of the rich than the want of common sustenance to the lives of the poor  they told of lady bendhams ruin since her lords death by gaming  they told that now she suffered beyond the pain of common indigence by the cutting triumph of those whom she had formerly despised  they related what has been told before the divorce of william and the marriage of his wife with a libertine  the decease of lady clementina occasioned by that incorrigible vanity which even old age could not subdue  after numerous other examples had been recited of the dangers the evils that riches draw upon their owner the elder henry rose from his chair and embracing rebecca and his son said  how much indebted are we to providence my children who while it inflicts poverty bestows peace of mind and in return for the trivial grief we meet in this world holds out to our longing hopes the reward of the next  not only resigned but happy in their station with hearts made cheerful rather than dejected by attentive meditation henry and his son planned the means of their future support independent of their kinsman william  not only of him but of every person and thing but their own industry  while i have health and strength cried the old man and his sons looks acquiesced in all the father said i will not take from any one in affluence what only belongs to the widow the fatherless and the infirm for to such alone by christian laws  however custom may subvert them  the overplus of the rich is due  chapter xlvii by forming an humble scheme for their remaining life a scheme depending upon their own exertions alone on no light promises of pretended friends and on no sanguine hopes of certain success but with prudent apprehension with fortitude against disappointment henry his son and rebecca now his daughter found themselves at the end of one year in the enjoyment of every comfort which such distinguished minds knew how to taste  exempt both from patronage and from control  healthy alive to every fruition with which nature blesses the world dead to all out of their power to attain the works of art  susceptible of those passions which endear human creatures one to another insensible to those which separate man from man  they found themselves the thankful inhabitants of a small house or hut placed on the borders of the sea  each morning wakes the father and the son to cheerful labor in fishing or the tending of a garden the produce of which they carry with their fish to the next market town the evening sends them back to their home in joy where rebecca meets them at the door affectionately boasts of the warm meal that is ready and heightens the charms of conversation with her taste and judgment  it was after a supper of roots from their little garden poultry that rebeccas hand had reared and a jug brewed by young henry that the following discourse took place  my son said the elder henry where under the sky shall three persons be met together happy as we three are it is the want of industry or the want of reflection which makes the poor dissatisfied labor gives a value to rest which the idle can never taste and reflection gives to the mind content which the unthinking never can know  i once replied the younger henry considered poverty a curse  but after my thoughts became enlarged and i had associated for years with the rich and now mix with the poor my opinion has undergone a total change  for i have seen and have enjoyed more real pleasure at work with my fellow laborers and in this cottage than ever i beheld or experienced during my abode at my uncles during all my intercourse with the fashionable and the powerful of this world  the worst is said rebecca the poor have not always enough  who has enough asked her husband had my uncle no  he hoped for more  and in all his writings sacrificed his duty to his avarice had his son enough when he yielded up his honor his domestic peace to gratify his ambition had lady bendham enough when she staked all she had in the hope of becoming richer were we my rebecca of discontented minds we have now too little but conscious from observation and experience that the rich are not so happy as ourselves we rejoice in our lot  the tear of joy that stole from her eye expressed more than his words  a state of happiness  he continued i remember that when i first came a boy to england the poor excited my compassion but now that my judgment is matured i pity the rich i know that in this opulent kingdom there are near as many persons perishing through intemperance as starving with hunger  there are as many miserable in the lassitude of having nothing to do as there are bowed down to the earth with hard labor  there are more persons who draw upon themselves calamity by following their own will than there are who experience it by obeying the will of another add to this the rich fear dying so much they have no comfort in living  there the poor have another advantage said rebecca for they may defy not only death but every loss by sea or land for they have nothing to lose  besides added the elder henry there is a certain joy of the most gratifying kind that the human mind is capable of tasting peculiar to the poor and of which the rich can but seldom experience the delight  what can that be cried rebecca  a kind word a benevolent smile one token of esteem from the person whom we consider as our superior  to which rebecca replied and the rarity of obtaining such a token is what increases the honor  certainly returned young henry and yet those in poverty ungrateful as they are murmur against that government from which they receive the blessing and unlearned as they are would attempt to alter it  we leave to the physician the care of restoring our health we employ the soldier in fighting our battles and the lawyer in the defense of our fortunes without presuming to interrupt them in their vocations  then why not leave and without molestation those to govern a kingdom who have studied the science of politics for though a physician may not always be skilful a soldier may not always have courage a lawyer not always honesty or a minister always good fortune  yet we should consider that it is not upon earth we are to look for a state of perfection  it is only in heaven  and there we may rest assured that no practitioner in the professions i have named will ever be admitted to disturb our eternal felicity  the end
