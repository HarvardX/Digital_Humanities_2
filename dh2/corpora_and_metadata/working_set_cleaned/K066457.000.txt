amusement to the town and a satisfaction to their curiosity to collect all the papers the late theatrical squabbles have produced and you desire my leave to print them  you have it with all my heart you desire i would not take it ill that you publish among the rest that thing called a letter from ancient pistol to young pistol  i think i cannot better show my contempt of it than by desiring you not to omit it  were you printing a trial  to sink any evidence or pleadings on either side the question though ever so false so ridiculous or impertinent were an unfair treatment of the public if i knew the incomprehensible author of that extraordinary piece i should desire no other fling at him but to affix his name at length to his elaborate work who it is i neither know nor care nor am i anxious to be satisfied whether a certain person guessed by many was really the author or no i mean one who for his ill manners in disturbing a social company was not long since  quoited down stairs like a shuffleboard piece  though i am sensible many means have been used to depreciate me both as a man and an actor in the minds of people here i can but smile at such impotent malice and shall ever with grateful joy remember the gentlemen of this kingdom to their honor be it said would not suffer themselves to be misguided by pique or prejudice no they would judge for themselves  let my enemies call this boasting if they please i had rather run the hazard of that censure than be liable to the imputation of ingratitude and sure to be totally silent on this occasion were to be unworthy of their favors i have not words equal to my sentiments of my obligations to the town let me therefore ntreat their candor their humanity and better sense to supply my deficiency and think what ought to be said when i would declare how much and how sincerely  i am their most obliged most obedient and devoted very humble servant theophilus cibber p s i hope you will not omit in your collection that choice copy of verses addressed to mr sheridan printed in reilys newsletter tuesday august       the following paragraphs are extracted from the theater no   a paper published in london twice a week by sir richard steel under the name of sir john edgar in the year      let any man who understands conversation or business that lives amongst knowing men either in public or private life consider the diflidence we are usually under in executing any part that naturally is our duty and requires only acting in public what is demanded of us in our ordinary characters and functions i say let any one reflect on this and he will account for the concern and confusion in which an actor must behold an auditor stir up any new reflection or thought in his old adversaries the vulgar the unthinking and the boisterous who have it in their power by noise or clamor while he is to perform what is foreign to himself to disconcert and push him out of a personated character of liveliness and mirth into his private one of grief and dejection and yet perhaps in two minutes it shall be expected that he shall be enough himself to assume the person whom even to please his oppressors he is still obliged to represent this consideration is enough to gain him the favor and protection of reasonable men though perhaps it may require time to turn the edge of youths of false fire natural wickedness and warm blood so far as to look in upon themselves and see how much they have wanted and ought to learn humanity  the humor in which people go to plays is generally that of leisure and indolence and the entertainment gives them such a notion of levity and cheerfulness in the performers that they have not the same idea of their laborious life as they have of the application of other useful people whose business does not require half the sense and diligence to be masters of it they do not consider that readiness alacrity spirit and disengagement from themselves are in no one station of life so indispensably necessary as in the duty of an accomplished actor and if all these uncommon qualities are not summoned and about him at a certain hour his interest and reputation are lost at once for he cannot even subsist without being always in a readiness to place himself in his best appearance painful the task and incumbent only on the undervalud player  these were published july   th to mr george faulkner trinity college dublin july   th      sir in addressing you we are sensible we speak to the public and we are but too well acquainted with the deference owing to their judgment not to be desirous of their approbation with submission therefore to all those whose censure may deserve our regard we presume it will not be taken amiss that we are resolved to see justice done to injured merit  upon a strict and impartial enquiry into the reasons of mr sheridans not appearing thursday last in the character of cato we find them so strong and satisfactory that our resolution we hope will be favorably looked on of seeing him righted and the insolence of others properly chastised who either through envy or malice would remove the strongest inducement we have for frequenting the playhouse and consequently deprive us of the satisfaction we propose to ourselves from the most rational amusements and it is expected none will condemn us for frustrating the malicious contrivances of some sew designing wretches and by so doing convince them their envious but shallow practices shall always prove abortive whenever they tend to wrong or depress real merit  an apology of this nature we could not but judge absolutely necessary to prevent any misconstructions we might possibly expose ourselves to by our resentment to find one of the principal characters burlesqed by the presumption of one every way unequal to it   to mr sheridan trinitycollege july    sir the reasons you assign for not performing the part of cato last thursday are more than sufficient to justify you in the opinion of every unprejudiced person and though your resentment of the usage you received is equally just we hope it will not deprive us of the satisfaction we promise ourselves from so eminent a genius as the declarations of some malicious persons may possibly have made you apprehensive of being hereafter insulted we take this opportunity with the greatest deference to those whose judgment is to be regarded of publicly assuring you that the just sense we have of your merit and the ill usage you have met with has determined us not only to support you but frustrate any malicious schemes theatrical politicians may form to your disadvantage   these were stuck upon posts about town july   th cibbers warning piece now mourn immortal shakespeare grieve to hear thy tuneful muse offend each skilful ear now wonder why those bold majestic strains the toilsome task of years thy rich remains desist to ravish and thou great addison so much admired the theme of ages by the nine inspired how has thy sacred shade not wept and pined to see great cato and sir fopling joined to see a wretch designed for farce and pun presume to speak what daunted sh  n to see him lisp and amble strut and fleer and redicule thy morals with a sneer but should he which the gods forbid once dare to dance othello  by those gods i swear tumultuous peals of oranges shall fly like showers of hail srom an enraged sky therefore we charge you ophy c  r cease least we bestow you birch instead of bays to the ladies and gentlemen who were present at the play of cato last thursday i am extremely concerned for the occasion of my addressing you in this public manner but as the disappointment which you met with at my not being able to perform has given rise to several stories very little in my favor i think it my duty to clear up the matter and justify myself the fact is thus when i went to the playhouse i found every thing in great confusion the people not paid and clamouring for their money the music refusing to play unless their arrears were discharged and an account brought at the same time that mr philips the director and manager of the whole had absconded as i was dressing for my part i found the robe which i had before worn in cato was wanting upon enquiry i heard that mr philips had come two days before and taken it from the house i had some reason to believe that he had done it purely to prevent my playing that night the resentment i conceived at such treatment the concern i was under lest the audience should be disappointed some other ill usage i received and several other incidents concurring a detail of which would take up too much time disordered me so much that it not only rendered me incapable of doing justice to the character i was to play but like wise almost took away my voice you yourselves were witnesses of this when i endeavored to make an apology and could not be heard and indeed i was in such confusion that had i been heard i should not have been understood i appeal to any reasonable person then present whether it were better in these circumstances to dismiss the house which was my intention or to keep them purely to convince them that it was not in my power to get through one speech of the part it has been said that the want of a robe was a trifling thing and that the audience would have been content to have received me in any dress they must have but little skill in theatrical affairs who think a proper habit is not absolutely neceslary or that a person can perform a part well with a consciousness about him that he looks it ill this was more particularly my case in this character as it is one for which i am naturally very unfit in my person and in which nothing could have made my appearance supportable but a large robe to cover my defects and give a gravity and dignity to my person which i wanted and which are so absolutely necessary to the character i know when an audience is disappointed they often make but little allowances for the actor they feel nothing of the concern and anxiety of mind he labors under when he has acquired a reputation by performing a character one night and sees himself about to lose it in another but it was not that nor the ill treatment i had received which hindered my playing it was the effect which all this had on me i had so much deference for the audience and so much gratitude nay it was so much my duty that i should have sacrificed all regard to character and every other consideration to have done my utmost to have pleased them even in the meanest dress had i not found that my voice was quite gone and that it was not in my power to go through with one scene i was then reduced to this difficulty either to detain them when i found i was not only incapable of giving them the satisfaction they might expect but must have given them the highest disgust in my performance or else fairly to tell them that it was not in my power to play i chose the latter if it was an error it is one i have paid dearly for since to that principle i sacrificed above sixty pounds which i absolutely lost by not playing such persons as have assigned any other cause for my not performing if they can suppose me either vain or ungrateful or even impudent enough to disappoint an audience merely out of whim or humor i hope will not think me fool enough to stand to such a loss  and now though i have already trespassed too much on your patience i must beg your indulgence a little farther as i perhaps shall not have another opportunity of doing it in permitting me to return you and all the ladies and gentlemen of this kingdom who have honored the plays in which i performed with their presence my sincere and hearty thanks for all your favors the success i have met with has been an additional pleasure to me as by this means you have convinced the world how false that opinion is which has prevailed amongst some that the people of ireland are kinder to strangers than to their own for your great indulgence to me is a manifest proof how willing you are to encourage the least dawn of merit in one of your country yet i am sorry to say it your great favor and the prodigious success i have met with have i find raised me many enemies there are some people who can not behold the prosperity of others in any way of life without envy and as i am conscious to myself that i have by no action of mine deserved the hatred of any person i must believe i have no enemies but such as my success has made so that i have some is manifest from the industry with which some people spread reports to my disadvantage and the readiness with which others believe them my gratitude to the public the friendship i have experienced in private and the love i have for my country would have detained me here much longer if i could in the least have contributed to the public entertainment in spite of any advantages i could have proprosd to myself in another kingdom i should be sorry a few snakes in the grass should drive me from so fair a field but it is a misfortune in our way of life that a few malicious people can do a person more injury in one night than the friendship of the public in general can repair  i sincerely wish that the success i have met with may be a means of raising up some genius more worthy to entertain you but this i will venture to say that you will never find any who has studied to do it with more zeal and industry or who has a more grateful sense of the many obligations you have conferred  on your most obliged and devoted humble servant thomas sheridan july   th an epistle from mr theophilus cibber comedian to mr thomas sheridan tragedian it is a kind of slander to trust to rumor b johnson  bella horrida bella the scene often rallies ollies of the age laugh in your turn at ollies of the stage anon stephensgreen tuesday afternoon july         mr sheridan your injudicious disappointment of the company last thursday who expected to see you in the character of cato and your indiscreet attempt to dismiss the audience having as you confess become a towntalk and given rise to many idle falsehoods merely calculated to injure the innocent you must excuse me if i relate the fact strictly adhering to truth there were many witnesses of what i am about to declare and i know none except yourself whose memory is weak enough to forget it or will be hardy enough to deny it  when it drew near the time proper to begin the play mr giffard and myself were alarmed in the dressing room with a report that you declared you would not play because you had not the same robe you wore in that character before and that you said the audience must be dismissed this reason for dismissing an audience proposed by you who had no right to dismiss them appeared to me so weak i could not believe it till you came into the room and swore unless you had that robe you would not act this declaration i looked upon as a rash expression the mere effect of your then rufled temper but could not yet suppose you would proceed so idly as you did you were then completely dressed from head to foot as well as ever the character was dressed in any theater in ireland or england all but the robe  upon enquiry it appeared the robes worn by cato juba and sempronius the first night were borrowed by philips of some gentlewoman in this town who bought them in an auction at london some time since but were by no means the property of the managers or any one belonging to the theater nor were to be got that night so all the heroes were equally disappointed of those trappings your impatience increased and though another robe was brought you the same robe that was made new this year for mr husband in the character of julius caesar you persisted in having the other uncomeatable robe or you positively would undress and was determined not to play to every bodys surprise you did undress and in spite of the most friendly remonstrances to the contrary you made a broken kind of speech to the audience with which they were so dissatisfied they could not help showing it  before you went on i entreated you on the mere exchange of a robe not to do so unpolitic a thing i might add unpolite as to think of disappointing the town of their diversion you replied the vexation had deprived you of your voice and rendered you incapable of performing i desired you to consider the first act was of such a considerable length you might have time enough to recover your temper and your voice would probably return with it or if the defect lasted your attempting to perform would appear so obliging the audience would readily make any allowances when they knew you had been ruffled etc but to think of giving them no play at all was what i could not but conceive would offend them  to repeat all was said to you on this occasion would add to the tediousness of this recital but as near as i can remember nothing was omitted in the most friendly manner to dissuade you from your mistaken purpose  i am informed you stayed afterward just long enough to hear the extraordinary indulgent reception the audience were pleased to bestow on my proposing with their leave to give them the play in the best manner we could since it was not in our power to give it them so well as we would you then ran hastily out of the house and sent a message afterward to the theater that you would not by any means have your name delivered out for another play for you would positively act no more  i should not mr sheridan have given you or my self this trouble but for the many reports that fly about of which it is said you are the author and since i have advanced so far i must go a little farther and make a few honest queries then giving you a little advice shall submit to the determination of the public whether i as it has been insinuated ever intended you the least prejudice or on the contrary have not always acted toward you with good manners and good nature  first then  have i not your letter by me sent to me when in england wherein you express yourself very desirous of my acting in the same theater with you and are solicitous for my coming over  and do you not know your particular application since my arrival was one of my strongest motives for playing in smockalley where i am likely to have a lawsuit for my right with the managers though i was offered the same terms from aungierstreet playhouse where my agreement would have been signed by a gentleman of honor whose pay is as good as the bank  have i not on your return to the stage this season in compliment to you played some inferior characters which it is well known i had a long time resigned to younger actors in england  did i omit any care or grudge any pains to keep the audience in temper when your sudden indisposition prevented your playing the first intended night of king lear or could i for a brother have been more active to silence the reports then made to your prejudice  sed tu brute  have not i desired you though our remaining nights of playing were few and we had large sums at stake to fix the plays to your own mind  have not you been paid a large part of that fresh agreement you made but did not complete while we are unpaid our agreements though we have it is notorious often solicited the managers to release us if they found the emptiness of the town would not answer their contining our performance  but we could get neither our liberty nor our money  have not you often been an earwitness of these proposals and as often declared we behaved with the greatest lenity and strictest honor  did not your sudden breaking off from playing leave us in a displeasing dilemma and was it not reasonable for us to propose acting such pieces as might excite the greatest curiosity in the town whereby the managers might be enabled to pay us and the rest of the company  did i not decline till your positive declaration that you would play no more this season appearing in any character you had performed and did you not express yourself as obliged to me on making you that compliment as you were pleased to term it  how comes it then mr sheridan reported that mr giffard and myself have intended you any injury or from whence is it said that we ridiculous as false locked up your clothes and did all we could to prevent your playing this sir has been so frequently asserted as a fact related by you that you ought as a friend to truth to have fully answered such monstrous falsehoods or may we not reasonably suppose you did spread such reports if you can be the author of such tales what language is fit to paint you  the letters i read this day in the dublin journal if not ipso facto yours are yet so worded an impartial reader cannot but see they were at least the work of some mistaken friend whose good nature you had imposed on by false relations from whom but you could come the satisfactory reasons not one of which are mentioned for your not performing or the poor low invectives and mean inuendoes therein contained  whom do you mean by designing wrelches and theatrical politicians or what can you intend but to insinuate you have been artfully drove from the stage when you know your absence from thence is absolutely your own act and deed  fie fie stick to truth or be ashamed of such public addresses or to show your pace after them  may not one suppose master sheridan the kind and civil intention of these two letters is to ereate a disturbance in the future audiences  but let me inform you when a rebuff to an actor appears premeditated and bespoke from prejudice such treatment may put a poor player out of humor but sure it ought not to put him out of countenance  if you withdraw yourself from the theater for a time must all diversion stop till your return if a vintner has not ortelans or any other extraordinary dainties in the larder will his guests think it impertinent if they are entreated to take such homely entertainment as the house affords  and if the defects of others serve as a foil to the brilliancy of your performance why should you be angry at what if you would keep your temper might prove so consolable to you  dear tommy dont prove such a dog in a manger if you dont choose oats why should you starve the rest of the theatrical cattle have more compassion on your fellow creatures or fellow comedians  but master tommy may we not shrewdly suspect though your performances have been hitherto mostly tragical you have given your mind a little bent toward comedy and in those studies have taken a hint from congreves petulant who to keep up an extraordinary reputation was notorious under a disguise for calling for himself at a coffee house where he would sometimes in a mask send in for himself wait for himself nay and not finding himself would frequently leave a letter for himself  faith you are highly in luck in improving a hint i sind  but let me ask you a home question  has not a great deal of that fuss of mind you have lately shown been mre owing to your disappointment that the audience would not depart when you declared your high and mighty displeasure because you had not the selfsame gew gaw tinsel train more than from any fears you had of having displeased them or was it naugry because any one was permitted under great disadvantages merely to attempt what they had never in their lives a thought of performing why this is the passionate extravaganza of your brother pistol who scorning all contradiction or competition bounces about in his boots kicks his heels with fury against the stage and swelled with swaggering rage and nonsense cries shall dunghill curs confront with helicon etc  shall packhorses and hollow pampered jades of asia that cannot travel thirty miles a day compare with caesar and with cannibals and with trojan greeks etc etc but as our friend concludes shall we fall foul for toys   though i dont think there is any thing personally terrible about you yet i own you a gentleman of great formidability who have the power if you say true and you know you have talked at that pawpaw rate of calling down the barracks on any one you condescend to be displeased with pray do you mean the stone buildings for i cannot suppose you presume to have any command over the gentlemen there as i never heard of any commission the king had yet honored you with and i believe there is hardly any there will think it worth their while to attend the call of your whistle to a silly riot i am rather inclinable to think the gallant spirits there are more impatient to attend the call of a trumpet at this glorious juncture and be in actions worthy of them  and for the gentlemen of the college sir no insinuation shall make me dread ill usage from those whose birth and education will never suffer em to hurt the innocent nor can i affront em with so ungenteel a thought that they will be the tools of your wrongplacd resentment  mr sheridan your behavior has extorted this from me and as your conscience must tell you i never meant you the least injury should you by any little art aim through pique or passion unhospitably to hurt a stranger it would be an act that wants a name and require such language to answer as would but ill become the mouth of a gentleman or be sitting for the ears of the public  as my stay here will be short i but desire what i will not doubt meeting with a candid reception for the few nights i have to play from the goodnaturd town whose past favors i am proud of to confess them is an act of gratitude nor will i therefore think my self liable to the imputation of a boasting vanity  let me mr sheridan give you this friendly caution  do not run into an error most young men in our business have been too guilty of who think their merits are but barely paid when their reception is most favorable and take that as their due which is mostly the effect of a generous disposition in the town to encourage and support a rising genius whenever it appears  though people may be as fond of such for a while as gallants are of a new mistress yet if vanity and caprice prevail in such performer grown wild and wanton with success they know when to withdraw their favors nor is it easy to regain them  if i ever see you in england i will be most unmercifully revenged of you for your mistakes toward me and will absolutely endeavor to make your reception there as pleasing to you as you may have wished mine should have been here displeasing to me but let us now mind our business and no more trouble the public with our theatricalimportantnothings  they will but laugh at us for our pains  i am yours etc t c  a postscript added to a new edition of the foregoing epistle occasioned by the disturbance at the theater on thursday july the   st bella geri placuit nullos habitura triumphos lucan ne pueri ne tanta animis assuescite bella neu patriae validas in vicera verlite vires virg friday morning july   d as there were many witnesses of the tumultuous riot which you occasioned last night at the theater for which the town are highly obliged to you i shall make no reflections on it but leave the relation thereof to the impartial and unprejudiced  i say you occasioned for the pretense of the college being offended is a mere pretense they are men of reason and will not resent without a cause nor is it a reflection on the society that a few may be misled by their mistaken partiality to you that ought no more to bring an odium on such a large and worthy body than that you were once an unworthy member thereof which the majority by this time probably wish you never had been  your behavior friend thomas has been so bad i doubt if the smallest or lowest body of people would choose you to mingle with em i searce believe the most indifferent troop of stroling players would choose to rank with you yet it is methinks a pity you should not be quite lost to the stage since though you are not equal to all parts there are two i will venture to say you will always make an extraordinary figure in i mean the characters of maskwell and scrub you seem to have studied and practiced them thoroughly  i cannot suppose my frankness toward you can have offended any set of gentlemen are you not free to answer for yourself in any manner you think proper and as to the gentlemen of the college i here solemnly declare i am not conscious of having designed the least offense to em in word in deed or even in thought  would any friendly monitor convince me how it is possible for me to have said or done ought to the offense of any one in this kingdom you master tommy excepted i should be ashamed not to acknowledge my error and would readily as i ought ask their pardon  but why should i wonder at your unhospitable attempts toward a stranger when you could so unmercifully threaten even a brother with being ill used if he presumed to play any part of yours this is a fact naughtypaughty tommy too well known by many for you to deny  but pray sir by what act of parliament do you lay this monopolizing claim that even during your absence from the stage no one must presume to appear in any part you please to call yours  thou dear mockmonarch have copper crowns and tinselld robes so elated thee as to think thy commands are absolute  i wonder you have not published your royal mandate to all the theaters in his majestys dominions that none shall dare attempt any character you have but thought of  thou really seem to be such a choice sort of a monarch as your brother tommy thumbs king arthur why while the stage looks gloomy from your absence do you not cry out with him let nothing but a face of grief appear the man that smiles this day shall ose his head that he may have no head to smile withal   but pray sweet meager sir where did you prudentially retire during this noble riot were you solacing your cale carcass and keeping up your poor spirits with punch or claret and smiling at the clangor of the distant war  mr pope has a line draws thy picture strongly in such circumstances a fiend in glee ridiculously grim  really lovely youth i am no quixote to fight windmills nor yet a drawcansir to encounter multitudes nor an jago to attack men in the dark  but there is no terror in master sheridan alone nor can he wear any shape himself will ever make me alter an honest purpose or prevent my telling him any necessary truth in short use no fallacies to betray mistaken numbers into your cause and i shall but despise you  approach thou like the rugged russian bear the armed rhinoceros or hyrcaman tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or revive a while and dare me to the desert with thy sword if any sinew shrink proclaim me then the baby of a girl  hence horrid shadow shakes this was in reillys paper of july   d mr sheridan at the general desire of all his friends will perform the character of cato on thursday next at the theater royal in aungierstreet being positively the last time of his performing this season with several entertainments of dancing by monsieur mullement trinity college july    as our just indignation against mr cibber and the method which we took to show it has unexpectedly brought mr sheridan under the censure of some people we think ourselves bound in regard to truth and that innocence should not suffer to declare that mr sheridan was in no wise privy to the advertisements which we put in the journal and was indeed hardly personally known to any of us who drew it up that when he had seen it in the papers he came to us and requested in the most earnest manner that not one of us should go near the playhouse on thursday night out of regard to him we complied and determined not to go after we had made this promise came out mr cibbers letter in which to leave mr sheridan entirely out of the question we ourselves were attacked by the manner in which he treated our advertisement such insolence from a person of his character though it deserved the highest punishment yet should we not have carried matters so far had we not heard and the event justified it that mr cibber had a party of ruffians and other desperate fellows to oppose us notwithstanding all this series of provocations we are willing to suffer him to play for his own benefit or any other characters that are sit for him provided he behaves himself well mr sheridan having earnestly entreated us that we might  as there were some of distinction and merit then present who might have taken exceptions to our behavior that night we publicly disclaim any design of offending them which we should have done at that time could we have been heard  a letter from one to another containing arguments pro and con relating to the dispute between mr cibber and mr sheridan sir the present contest between mr cibber and mr sheridan having without my concurrence or that of any one of my kindred revived the animosity which so long held us at variance i cannot forbear expostulating with you on so unhappy an occurrence more especially when for this considerable time past nothing has been more commonly the towntalk than that all differences were made up between one and another and that they were at present in perfect unity which i assure you gave every one great satisfaction let another take it as he would for my own particular part it pleased me because every one was weary of the perpetual noise and scandalous reports that were raised concerning squabbles between one and another i cannot but assume to myself some merit in as much as one alone has ever been willing as i now am of making an overture of reconcilement between one and another though at the same time i have all mankind on my side who at all times declare their opinion in the most public manner and from which no one ever did dissent that no one ever differed with a friend or acquaintance but by means of another was ever any mortal accused of any ofrence or crime how heinous soever but he though personally convicted of it laid the fault on another and at the very worst when no excuse can be had to palliate what is laid to his charge will he not say that another tempted him nine out of ten that ever were laid in prison have they not said it was because they were bound for another nay if any person should be occasionally complimented perhaps for the only good action of his life will he not say that it was done in service of another to whom he never was obliged and who after showed him ingratitude i speak of this merely as the common opinion which you well know to be such and i might add to this the great superiority which i bear over you in the esteem of the world in all perfections whatsoever if for instance in conversation any present should extol another for any good quality either for integrity valor or wit nay even money which is the foundation of all things esteemed reputable i say for instance supposing there were twenty gentlemen present was it ever known that the remaining nineteen would not aloud or as the reigning fashion is among wellbred people in saying their prayers mentally tell him he must except one was it ever said in duelling the singular and proper entertainment of the beau mond whenever any of this distinguishable part of the human species being set together by the ears by another and do really and actually behave not as rational creatures but to show they have some pretentions of what kind soever to manhood will it not be universally said that one has wounded or perhaps killed another in disputes at law either they their heirs executors administrators and so forth one ever obtains judgments or decrees commonly both against another and though either should appeal to the house of lords of england it is always allowed to be for one against another this i defy you to deny for you cannot but know that i can prove it upon record which though it should be expensive yet as you have some cause of knowledge of my temper you must be convinced that there is no one who would not hazard his soul which you may maliciously allege no one makes much account of but that which ought to be dear to every gentleman his reputation to have revenge against another but as to life or fortune you know there is no one who is really a gentleman but disposes of both on very slight occasions happy would it be for the world as well as for themselves that such should punctually dispose of both together which though indeed seldom yet sometimes happens and often more by good luck than by good guiding in short sir to end this argument which i believe you scarcely will presume to controvert since the world was one however endeavored to get a superiority over another and ever has succeeded excepting some few instances as when one has had all advantages of a war another has had all the advantages of a peace but this is an affair of such a nature that through a multiplicity of affairs one is excusable in having overlooked it besides it is of so little importance that it is scarce worth the attention of any one neither need he be solicitous to court the embraces even of the lovely willing nymph occasion whatever advances she may make him and in whose power alone it is to remedy such an oversight but let the affairs of this world be conducted as they may the wise acknowledge that it is all one or at least it will be so some time about one hundred years hence as such of them as are skilled in astrology have often assured me by word of mouth nay went so far as to say that they would give it me under their hands or to any one they having a great esteem for my family annexed to a proper scheme of calculation on which they would depend their whole reputation that no one now alive should ever complain that they were thereby deceived and all this gratis  writing in any ones commendation i know is irksome and tedious to another because the animosity between us is such i must say the fault is yours that you cannot be brought to believe any thing favorable of me more than i can of you but admitting this as a truth i would with all the moderation i have ever been master of recommend to your serious and deliberate thought whether any variance or animosity of what kind soever should come between one and another by any dispute which might arise between mr cibber and mr sheridan for my part i speak only as one another may take it as he pleaes that the matter in contest between those two gentlemen in my humble opinion very little if at all concerns either one or another but the attention of all europe being happily awaked by this and some other matters of importance as every one wishes his own ease and never enjoys satisfaction till he finds it is impossible to obtain it i would i confess for my own sake make any decent or gentlemanlike advances toward an entire peace and will fully acknowledge all wherein i am conscious i ever gave you offense hoping you will take it well that i use a little asperity which you cannot but indulge me in you being an author and of consequence dealt in satyr toward which your own conduct could not fail to furnish you with a great deal of though possibly not sufficient materials for a livelihood all writers of every class not excepting such as were never in a class at all many of which being supported by the printer for abusing themselves in the most outrageous manner in suffering the press to groan with their labors and bring forth brats to public view when all endeavors of their friends to procure abortion proved abortive  i first therefore admit that many a one has wilfully abused and slandered another yet notwithstanding this the partiality of the world toward me is such that the entire blame has ever been laid on another one i confess has often defrauded another but is it not most certain that another has been equally culpable and moreover in the opinion of the world another is a greater rogue than any one one may have betrayed another but is that any excuse for another who has often done the like both to one and another which circumstance doubtless aggravates the offense in the opinion both of one and another  these few instances many more the like i could produce but as every one abhors prolixity and tedious recitals i shall restrain my hand especially what more i might say being equally known both by one and another and proceed more directly to the matter occasioning the present difference between one and another  it is a surprising thing to me that mr sheridans not thinking himself fine enough should ever be a cause of contest between one and another and unhappily at a time when every one wished to be reconciled with another to do both one and another justice i must confess that on a late occasion when one refused to do his duty another endeavored to do it for him but can that in any manner justify another for busying himself in an affair where neither one nor another had any manner of concern if the spoils of julius caesar were offered unto cato as the historian titus livius in his decade xii relates and that highspirited stoic philosopher as mr cibber in his letter page      affirms cast them aside with indignation of what great importance is that either to one or to another especially that unhappy incident having happened at a time when our very grandfathers were scarcely thought of it is true it may cast some reflection on the wisdom for which cato is so celebrated by all the ancients to a man and is celebrated for it by our own countryman mr joseph addison though he has thought fit to put it in the mouth of an enemy in the following words viz cato the world talks loudly of your wisdom  we might indeed amuse ourselves in discourse on so odd and out of the way an occurrence and console ourselves with the reflection which naturally occurs from thence that wisest men have ever had their blind sides not excepting even solomon the magnificent emperor of the turks so renowned for his adage but why should another take upon him to ill treat any one on account of a blemish in the character of so great a man as cato by what appears to me this is wholly calculated and intended on set purpose to revive the usual feuds between one and another and as far as any forecast one can be supposed to have which another may equally attribute to himself this affair must terminate in a paper war in which you cannot but know one is as well able and willing to undertake as another which if not speedily prevented shall be prosecuted with the utmost vigor of one as well as another mean time i beg leave to subscribe myself  yours etc dublin july the   d      p s your speedy answer may prevent much mischief    mr sheridans address to the town i was in hopes i should not have had occasion to trouble the public any more but farther misfortunes falling on me and farther crimes laid to my charge have put me under the necessity of vindicating myself  it has been said that i spirited up the scholars to prevent mr cibbers preforming last thursday  in answer to this i most solemnly declare that upon reading the advertisement which they had put in faulkners journal without my knowledge out of zeal to my interest i made it my business to find out the gentlemen who had drawn it up and by all the arguments i was master of drew a promise from them that they would not go to the playhouse the above night for the truth of this i appeal to themselves they have already published an advertisement in reillys paper of last saturday in which they have entirely cleared me and given reasons why they altered their resolution most of these gentlemen i was hardly known to if i had had a design to have formed a party in the college i think it was most probable that i should have applied to such as i had the pleasure of knowing i appeal to them then or any of them whether i ever spoke to them on that head unless it was to use their endeavors to prevent any such resolution being entered into  though the public may have but little regard to my bare word on this occasion yet if they consider that after so solemn a declaration if what i say be false i put it in the power of any one of these gentlemen at any time to prove me a scoundrel if they consider how low i must fall even in their opinions should i give what they know to be a lie under my hand in a public manner i hope no one will think that i would with my eyes open commit such a piece of folly  i well knew the fatal consequences of forming a party and too well foresaw the use my enemies would make of it to my disadvantage for indeed what could i propose to myself by it but to bring the hatred of the public upon me and what end would it answer i never looked on mr cibber as an antagonist of mine i always had so mean an opinion of him in his characters in tragedy that i would not even wish that he should have the reputation of being such by any opposition made on my part i hope the public will readily believe that i had no cause to be afraid of his appearing in any character of mine  as to the impudent and scurrilous epistle which mr cibber published i was determined to take no notice of it for i thought him in every respect beneath my lowest resentment i did not care to wrestle with a sweepchimney but as i find there are a few who do not know the man led away by his false representations and as he has endeavored to abuse that noble principle for which this kingdom is so justly famed and which i hope we shall never lose i mean that generous spirit of hospitality derived to us from our forefathers to his own wicked ends and purposes i think it necessary for my own sake and for the sake of the public to unmask this jago and lay him open to the world in order to do this i shall beg leave to state one fact  the night that i was to have performed cato an unfortunate night for me when a thousand unforeseen accidents had thrown me into such a disordered state of mind as i had never known before i found of a sudden mr cibbers behavior which before was very complaisant or rather meanly submissive was totally changed instead of trying all methods to appease a person beside himself with passion he did all he could to aggravate matters when i asked him what i should do in this exigence for want of a robe he answered somewhat shortly play without a robe when upon that i laid open to him what a despicable figure i should make he turned upon his heel and said d  n me if i care what you do the play shall not stand still for you and immediately went and ordered the prompter to draw up the curtain when i heard this i was stunned at the insolence of the fellow who neither had any right to command in that house nor was in any shape interested in the event of that night it put me past all patience and the terror i was under lest the curtain should be drawn up before i had time to make an apology at a time that i found myself incapable of playing made me rush like a madman precipitately on the stage before i had considered what i should say to the audience mr cibber to my great surprise came on immediately after me and very officiously to give it no harsher term offered to read the part of cato at the same time that he was to play syphax i say officiously for if i can make it appear that he was no way concerned either in point of interest or money the world will judge so too  mr cibber knows that the actors had determined to seize on the receipts of that night and all the succeeding ones except the next the entire receipts of which were to have been mine to pay themselves their salaries of which they had been defrauded by the roguery of some of the managers he knows that the reason of his continuing to play on afterward was only to fulfill his agreement that he might have an opportunity of suing the persons he contracted with for the sum stipulated he knows notwithstanding his plausible pretense in his epistle for choosing the characters which he gave out that he intended to perform in these words and was it not reasonable for us to propose acting such pieces as might excite the greatest curiosity in the town whereby the managers might be enabled to pay us and the rest of the company i say he knows that not a shilling of this was either to go to the managers or to them he knows that he had a lawyers opinion that it was not necessary for him to perform the number of nights mentioned tn their agreement it was sufficient if he was ready io perform them in the limited time he knows that he reckoned into one of the number the play of the rehearsal which was dismissed the night before what then could prompt mr cibber to make such an extravagant and impudent proposal to the audience as that of reading the character of cato when at the same time he was to play syphax i say what could prompt him to give himself so much unnecessary trouble if he was no way obliged to it either in point of duty interest or money it was a malicious and wicked scheme which he had long had in agitation and which my misfortune that night first gave him an opportunity of putting in practice it was a design of building his fame upon my ruin  in order to prove this i shall first of all give a short account of my behavior to mr cibber since his arrival in this kingdom to proceed in his own method i shall beg leave to ask him a few questions  is he not conscious that had it not been for me he could not have set his foot on any stage in this kingdom  did i not quash a cartel which was signed by the managers of both companies under severe penalties to exclude him from acting on either stage  did i not as a stranger treat him with all civility though the unhappy character he labored under prevented my having any friendship with him  was i not a principal means of preventing the trial between mr sloper and him and the letters which passed between him and his wife from being reprinted here soon after his arrival and did i not commission a friend to offer the expense of the impression out of my own pocket rather than a stranger should be hurt  did i not promise him to study any new character for his second benefit a favor which i had refused to others much more worthy of it  did i not when i found mr philips trifling with him and refusing to perform the contract before his face declare that i never would in any shape be concerned with mr philips hereafter if he did not pay him nay more offered to play with mr cibber in the other house to try by that means to make up his loss  did not mr cibber say on that occasion that i behaved with such honor and laid him under such obligations that he only wished for an opportunity to return them  the first he had was the above mentioned unhappy night might not one reasonably expect after all this that mr cibber would not try to injure me if i did nothing to injure him but he had worn the mask too long he found an opportunity of throwing it off and leaped at it with the greatest eagerness notwithstanding the many obligations i had laid him under to me he could not forgive me that my name brought full houses when he was obliged to dismiss or to play to empty benches his envy spleen and malice which long lay smothered in his breast now burst forth into a blaze he saw me under the necessity of disappointing an audience and consequently disobliging them he contributed as far as in him lay to the one and was determined to improve the other  i have already shown that he was not obliged by any principle of duty or profit to this work of supererogation it must be then from some other motive complaisance to the audience perhaps  impudent as he is he cannot think that the doing so unprecedented a thing as that of reading a capital part and playing another at the same time could give them any pleasure an attempt which no one but himself could ever have thought of and which even his own hardiness must have been shocked at had he not had the blackest malice in his heart to prompt him to it he saw the audience greatly offended at the disappointment they met with in my not being able to perform and very justly too fince it was not in my power to give them the reasons which prevented it he laid hold of this opportunity at once to run me down in the opinion of the world and ingratiate himself by the appearance of an officious zeal to do every thing that might give pleasure to the public he hoped by this means to drive me out of the kingdom and to establish himself here for the next winter as he knows it is impossible for him to return to london this is the more probable as i had often declared in confidence to him that i should never be able to stand the shock of any party formed against me his subsequent behavior is a manifest proof of his design for after i had left the playhouse and sent word in the heat of passion that i should never play there again mr cibber for fear i should cool upon it or try to reconcile the favor of the town to me again in a violent hurry gave out three plays together a most unusual thing unless in case of benefits in two of which he was to appear in characters of mine by this means let me have been ever so innocent had not the other company been in town i must have quit the field to him and left him triumphant  this was not all   when i endeavored to vindicate myself to the public and make an apology for not performing mr cibber undertook to answer me what right or what color like to right had he to undertake it i made no mention of him in the paper which i published though i had a just reason to do it because i did not care to be embroiled with a man of his trouble some temper who has always kept every theater in which he was engaged in hot water i had hitherto had no quarrel to him i had done him some favors should he not if he had the least humanity to leave gratitude out of the question have endeavored rather to clear me in the opinion of the town than endeavor to hurt me i cannot find that he himself has given any tolerable color for his entering so eavalierly a volunteer in the cause his setting out where certainly he ought to have given some reason for his undertaking such a part is no more than this mr sheridan your injudicious disappointment of the company last thursday who expected to see you in the character of cato and your indiscreet attempt to dismiss the audience having as you confess become a towntalk and given rise to many idle falsehoods merely calculated to injure the innocent you must excuse me if i relate the fact strictly adhering to truth so that here he does not pretend to give any reason only you must excuse me  here and through the whole epistle you may observe by his illnatured and bitter expressions his personal pique and spleen to me who never had injured him mr cibber mentions in the course of his letter that he heard i had spread about several reports to his disadvantage but why did mr cibber whose motto to this epistle is it is a kind of slander to trust to rumor so readily believe those reports of one with whom he had hitherto lived on a good footing mr giffard had heard the same thing in regard to himself but he like a gentleman came and asked me the truth of it and i satisfied him why did not mr cibber if he had the least of a gentleman about him behave in the same manner before he ventured to publish them to the world and draw conclusions from them as truths to my disadvantage no mr cibber neither wanted nor wished that i should justify myself his affairs were grown so desperate that he had no hope left but by a train of villainous calumnies and a prosusion of scurrilous language to try to make me do something monstrous to plunge me still deeper in the displeasure of the town at least he had hopes that this conduct might rouse perhaps the indiscreet zeal of some of my friends or wellwishers to attempt something against him which he would be sure to lay at my door unhappily for me the latter part succeeded to his wish  to prove that this was his principle i shall only make use of one argument i shall not pretend to justify or condemn the gentlemen of the college it is not my business and the world may easily see how ticklish a point that would be for me to handle all i shall endeavor to do is to prove that mr cibber knowingly and willingly brought it upon himself he treated the advertisement which they had put into the journal in a contemptuous and insolent way on a supposition that they were mine but no one shall make me believe that any man of common sense as i will allow mr cibber to be could suppose me either foolish enough or base enough to do it had i wrote such an advertisement in the name of the gentlemen of the college was it not natural for them to enquire who it was that dared to make use of their name and had i done it what punishment would have been too great for my presumption  mr cibber might easily have known of mr faulkner whether they had left it there or no upon this probability then that he must have known it was theirs what could mr cibber expect from a set of young gentlemen who are through their youth warm what could he hope for but that they would show their resentment for this contemptuous manner of treating what they had wrote nay must he not expect that probably they would think themselves bound in honor to take some public method of convincing him that they had wrote it lest the calumny which he had cast upon me through their silence should be fixed upon me people may wonder that mr cibber should run such a risque from such a motive but he has been so accustomed to things of this nature that they appear to him but as common matters the pleasure he proposed to himself in having an opportunity of displaying his eloquence the next day of throwing at the feet of the public an unfortunate stranger unhospitably used and above all the joyful hope of being able to fix this disturbance upon me as it is author would he thought more than compensate for any thing he could suffer  mr cibber is the more inexcusable as i took all pains to prevent his doing any rash thing which might draw more odium on him from the gentlemen of the college i told mr wright and several others of the players that it might reach his ears that i had been with the gentlemen of the college to prevent any mischief not for mr cibbers sake for i owed him no favor but my own that i had laid open to them the ill consequences that would attend me should any disturbance happen at the theater that upon this they had all promised in a solemn manner not to go and i bid them assure mr cibber that he need not fear any interruption notwithstanding this he published his epistle afterward wherein the gentlemen of the college thought themselves personally illtreated and were roused into such a rage as no endeavors of mine or all mankind could have appeased  does not this conduct of his evidently prove that he shut his eyes to conviction that he was determined at all events to pursue the scheme he had laid down it either must be owing to this or to the strangest infatuation that ever possessed man as to mr cibbers postscript i read it without any emotion and heartily thank him for it he has there painted himself in stronger colors than either i could or my humanity would suffer me to do his ridiculous challenge in the true style of an ancient pistol sent to me by all the newsboys in town i despise he has put himself by his behavior far beneath the footing of a gentleman i shall go about my business as usual if i am attacked i shall endeavor to defend myself nor shall i ever be afraid of any who dare do wrong and now i have done with him  i am sorry i have been compelled to show any man in so bad a light but the world must do me the justice to own he has forced me to do it in my own defense i shall trouble my head no farther with him but leave him to heaven and to the thorns which in his bosom lodge to goad and sting him   it is now time i should address myself to the public there are two things laid to my charge one is that i spirited up the gentlemen of the college to raise a disturbance in the theater  a heavy charge indeed if true i have done all that is in the power of man to clear myself of it and i hope there is none of the least humanity but will acquit me the other is that i willingly disobliged the public in not playing the part of cato  i published an apology not without consulting a gentleman of great knowledge and experience in the world in it which perhaps the over easiness of my friends thought a sufficient defense perhaps indeed i imposed on myself as well as them  if there be any who think i meant them an offense that i did it through wantonness or through contempt of the audience i heartily ask their pardon and the only way i have left to make them amends is to exert myself in that character on thursday next if they will honor me with their company that night the matter is come to this issue that i must either rise or fall in the opinion of the world by the event of that night if i am the person mr cibber represents if i was an unworthy member of the college which my old cotemporaries there and those ornaments of learning the fellows who knew my behavior will hardly take his word for if i am not fit to be received in a company of strollers for which compliment the many people of fashion who have honored me with their acquaintance in private and their approbation in public are much obliged to him i am not indeed worthy of your countenance you all know me i have lived amongst you if i have the least title to your favor i hope the goodnature of my friends and the benevolence of the public which i have so often and in so extraordinary a manner experienced will not desert me in this exigence nor suffer me to fall a sacrifice to the mean artifices and be banished my country by the wicked schemes of a  no i will not put myself so much on a level with him as to call him by the name he deserves  who i am well assured dare not show his face in his own  if any expressions too warm or indiscreet have dropped from me in the course of this address i hope for the indulgence of the public when i inform them that i have been obliged to draw it up almost in the space of one day and that too in no very easy state of mind for i question whether the innocent man though he has great advantages over the other feels less than the man of guilt while he is laboring under a load of calumny my whole intention was to endeavor to clear myself with all duty deference and submission to the public whose humble servant i am  thomas sheridan  a proper reply to a late scurrilous libel entitled mr sheridans address to the town parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus what damned costive poet have thou been reading congreve pray sir when you write do you let blood and take physic or make use of stewed pruants only vide the rehearsal and write about it goddess and about it pope wednesday afternoon july         when i call this a proper reply i mean such a one as may be fitting for the public to read and not such a one as sheridan ought to receive without playing the critic on his nonsensical tautological style and rambling inconnections i shall only take this notice of his scurrility foul language in an address to the public is an affront to their ears it is a breach of good manners and almost as unpardonable as throwing glasses etc in company there is neither wit sense pleasantry or bravery in either  that it is said by many that mr sheridan spirited up some persons to create a disturbance in the theater is a known truth and it is also a truth that many firmly believe it from wellgrounded reasons sheridan s pretending to know nothing of the advertisement and letter first published in mr faulkners journal is not at all surprising after many other things he has modestly ventured to assert even when numbers know the contrary mr arne told me at the rainbow coffeehouse on wednesday last in company with several others that he had been just talking with mr faulkner at the globe coffee house who among other things declared his opinion that it was indiscreet in mr sheridan to cause or suffer such things to be published twould be more likely to prejudice than serve him etc and that he had advised mr sheridan to the contrary  whose reply was  he was determined  besides this it is notorious he had several persons to dine or sup with him on different days and had lost no time nor spared any money in chair hire etc to alarm all parts of the town as well as his particular intimates he was an injured person forsooth though in what has not yet appeared add to this his previous declarations to any ones appearing in any part he had thought of playing his threatening them with an ill reception from his friends over whom he boasted a particular sway no great compliment to them by the way and what must we think of this man or what regard ought the public to have either to his word or oath  the riot that ensued on the thursday following is known to the whole town their sentiments of it will better come from their mouths than my pen  the towns generous and uncommon reception and protection of me since was an instance what an abhorrence they had of the former rash behavior of a few misled by a very bad man  i must have recourse to his vocabulary ever i can find words low enough to paint him the extraordinary kind treatment the public afforded me on monday night in the character of othello i am conscious was more owing to their spirited hospitable usage of a stranger than any merits my attempts to please them could lay claim to  i have a sincere and grateful sense of their favors it warms my heart and i shall always think it a duty incumbent on me loudly to acknowledge an act so much to their honor i confess it here and shall not forget it when in england to which place i propose returning speedily  though the modest the brave mr sheridan whose veracity is to be ranked with his other virtues is pleased to assert the impossibility of my returning i shall contradict him by facts not by dirty language  let me inform him all bad expressions retort upon the slanderer let then his own scurrilous libel stick on himself till he wipes it off like a gentleman his affectation of treating me with contempt as an actor is such a pretty piece of presumptive vanity that his choice opinion alone should lead the town and such a paltry puff of his own praise as is only fit to be laughed at  but how if the great sheridan should have given something under his own hand quite contradictory to this mean opinion of a man whom he says he had no cause to be afraid of what will gentlemen think of tommy then why  as they think of him already  as i choose facts rather than mere assertions to contradict his calumny and falsehoods i desire the patience of the public to read the following letter sent from mr sheridan to me in a letter enclosed to mr giffard then in london the date says when  a true copy of mr sheridans letter to mr cibber march   d      sir though i have not the favor of being known to you yet i make bold to write to you about an affair in which you are concerned as well as i i hear the gentlemen of aungierstreet theater intend to make proposals to you about a summer expedition to this kingdom as i had some thoughts of doing the same in favor of the people of smockalley this intelligence has hastened my application to you personally which otherwise might appear too abrupt there are many reasons why i should think it our mutual interest to play in one house in the first place if we act in different houses the town will possibly be divided and the receipts of both will necessarily be much lessened not that i should expect this upon the footing of merit but i know not how it is whether it be their partiality to their countryman or whether it be owing to the powerful interest of a number of friends that i have in this city but there never was known such encouragement such applause given to any actor or such full houses as since i appeared on the stage mr giffard will inform you that dublin is not like london we have not two audiences in the whole city especially as the town is now more empty than it has ever been known besides as it is not improbable but that we may be together next winter it will be a great advantage to practice such plays together as we can both appear in i am commissioned to assure you from the managers of smockalley and i will also do it from myself that you shall have all the encouragement that you can expect they are as willing and they are as well able to do it as those in aungierstreet i should be obliged to you if you would let me know as soon as possible whether you have any design of coming hither what are your terms and how soon it would be convenient for you to come you may think it is my own interest that has prompted me to write to you it is very true i have no small cause to be afraid of so potent an antagonist but i believe upon mature deliberation you will also find it your interest to be with us if you will favor me with a speedy answer you will extremely oblige  your admirer and very humble servant thomas sheridan   to this i wrote an answer i believe not unbecoming a gentleman to send or a gentleman to receive  sheridan may print it if he pleases i hope he will not alter it though  as i have been honored with a message from the heads of the college to signify their detestation of the outrageous proceedings at the theater on the night othello was first intended and those gentlemen having absolutely disclaimed any of the advertisements being any act of the college but on the contrary look on em as a reflection and affront on that worthy body let sheridan make em libellers not i i say sheridan  sheridan who carried that piece of rhetoric last friday to mr faulkner who prudentially chose not to affront his worthy fellow citizens as he declared to sheridan  indeed master tommy to soften it it seems altered the word butchers to ruffians a tender apellation and then was angry with mr faulkner who positively refused to insert it some other printers did insert it who have confessed sheridan brought it to em here it may not be improper to transcribe sheridans third paragraph of his modest address etc  though the public may have but little regard to my bare word on this occasion yet if they consider that after so solemn a declaration if what i say be false i put it in the power of any one of these gentlemen at any time to prove me a scoundrel if they consider how low i must fall even in their opinions should i give what they know to be a lie under my hand in a public manner i hope no one will think that i would with my eyes open commit such a piece of folly  o sheridan sheridan quae te dementia caepit  you little thought when you wrote this that mr faulkner had declared his refusing the advertisement or that mrs reilly had sent word to the college that you brought the advertisement to her in which you changed the word butchers to ruffians and by which in the name of the abused college you clear yourself of knowing any thing of the matter any one may be satisfied of the truth of this who will give themselves the trouble to call at the printers  as to the insinuation of my procuring ruffians as the well bred sheridan may style them to be at the theater i appeal to the public if i have not always in any discouse i ever held on the subject made it my earnest request every step should be avoided that might disturb the public peace and i hoped none would be omitted to preserve it if any honest man will step forth and say i have not acted thus or ever desired any one to be present to give me a forced applause let this i say be proved and i will bow me to the shame tom sheridan deserves for all his falsehoods  in answer to the message i was favored with from the college as aforementioned i begged my humble respects might be acceptable and though i was pressed to mention the names of those who were concerned in the disturbance i desired to be excused since as i was a stranger to their persons i might possibly be misinformed and though i had been advised to address the provost on this occasion nay farther to apply for a lord chief justices warrant to be served on the aggressors  i declined all proceedings of this sort though i have an undoubted right to the protection of the laws equal with any of my fellow subjects i had charity enough to consider this as an inconsiderate act of warm blood and more the effect of partiality to this artful man than any ill will to me i imagined their cooler reason would disprove it i believed their judgments would not repeat it and i declared without fresh occasion never to disturb any one about it i have kept my word  but to go on with you sir pray what were those thousand unforeseen accidents that so disordered your dear mind on the fatal night you mention why have you not recited em i called on you to do it in my epistle to you did you not appear to every one very tranquil till there was no great hopes of a crowded audience still your philosophy prevailed till it appeared the robe did not appear that indeed  inflamed your noble liver and made you rage well but on a sudden mr cibbers behavior which before was complaisant or rather meanly submissive a generous and grateful expression for my treating you all along with more breeding than you deserved or probably ever understood or practiced was totally changed this assertion every one behind the scenes that night can deny i appeal to mr giffard mr wright and many others there if i did not advise you like a friend and a gentleman not to do an indiscreet uncivil thing toward the audience let philips or any one be to blame  and so on my ordering the curtain to be drawn up you rushed precipitately on the stage these lies are as monstrous as the father of em i never ordered the curtain to rise till the audience accepted my offer of having cato read did you not undress yourself from head to foot and positively swear to me and several you would inform the audience you would not play on account of your disappointment were you not in your own clothes when you appeared and did you not farther even then he will outlie a chambermaid or a woman of qualitys porter cong way of the world abuse the ears of the audience with saying philips had locked up your clothes though many saw you dressed for the part as aforementioned  if i chose to play on to fulfill my agreement which the managers would not release me from was i not right  the actors you say determined to seize on the receipt of that night to pay their salaries it is true you mr morris and mr wright agreed they should have that house not having received any salary for three weeks  but you proposed to receive the next for your self alone and had taken care to seize the best receipt taken at your playing viz the first night of cato which did not amount to forty pounds  who then acted honestly i whochose not to dismiss the audience or you who to the disappointment of the poor unpaid people would have deprived em of the receipt of that house by a dismission what could i propose by playing on but justly to fulfill the agreements on my part which the unfair managers would neither release us from nor pay us for certainly i ought to take all legal means to recover what i have been so unjustly deprived of the dismission of the rehearsal a play too often repeated given out by philips on a byday against the sense of the company when you were yourself afraid of playing was the imprudent act of philips though at the time the audience were sent away every one allows there was a better prospect of an audience than there was at the same hour to the play of cato  if my offering to the audience to read cato and play syphax was as your wit and modesty terms it an impudent and extravagant proposal what sort of language would you bestow on them who allowed of it if you durst the trouble was not unnecessary though fatiguing enough it was both my duty and interest to act as the audience directed and by their appointment i played syphax and read cato i wonder you have not published your displeasure toward them for the terrible mortification your little pride mean vanity poor envy and rancarous heart felt from the unbounded goodnature they showed me on that occasion  but this it seems tommy says was a malicious wicked scheme i had long in agitation sure i must have dealt with the devil tommy to have foreknown you could have acted so suddenly as you did the part of such an extravagant fool who could have suspected it and why should i chicken wish to build my fame on thy poor ruin i question if i did not pass for an actor of reputation when you probably eat spoonmeat to build my fame upon such ruins were as low as a generals hoping to gain reputation from his laying siege to and demolishing a set of cotts or cabins i ask pardon for the sudden extravaganza of the comparison as far as it relates to the officer but shall not apologize for what part relates to you you will be honored by any comparison   well but tommy says my fame was designed on his ruin to prove it he will give an account of his behavior to mr cibber since his arrival in this kingdom  very pretty reasoning this truly how was your behavior to prove my design  prithee boy go to school again learn to make themes and to mend your manners  well to proceed tommy will ask mr cibber a few questions which have no analogy nor are at all apposite to any question mr cibber has made tommy no sophister tommy cannot answer em  very well child go on i will answer your questions they are as follow  quest   is he mr cibber not conscious that had it not been for me he could not have set his foot on any stage in this kingdom  answ how could i be conscious i could not without your assistance set my foot on any stage here after you had by letter of complement invited me to one theater and mr desbrisay and other gentlemen men of worth and honor had by message and letter of attorney granted to mr swan who came to england on purpose invited me to the other needs there more be said to this  quest   did i not quash a cartel which was signed by the managers of both companies under severe penalties to exclude him from acting on either stage  answ how came your power to quash a this cartel was idly designed to exclude all english actors from the theaters here cartel or who had a right to make such cartel that mr swan he is absent therefore to be treated tenderly drew one is certain that some injudicious people signed it i believe but still aungierstreet was open to receive me  the same terms proffered me  nay would i have engaged alone double the terms which i am now to get when i can but mr sheridans particular application and persuasions have drawn me into an agreement i have but too much reason to repent  quest   did i not as a stranger treat him with all civility though the unhappy character he labored under prevented my having any friendship with him  answ and so thou condescending creature did treat me with all civility and pray why should not you  or could you suppose you would not hear of it whenever you behaved otherwise i think you have and i believe you will still  oh but my unhappy character prevented your having any particular friendship with me i shall always think it a happy part of my character not to have been too far inveigled by you and a happiness in my circumstances that you have given me timely warning not to enter into any intimacy into which my goodnatured credulity and your wheedling cunning might have betrayed me i have suffered too much already it is well known by such caitiffs  quest   was i not a principal means of preventing the trial between mr sloper and him and the letters which passed between him and his wife from being reprinted here soon after his arrival and did i not commission a friend to offer the expense of the impression out of my own pocket rather than a stranger should be hurt  answ you say but we have only your bare word for it which is now in no great estimation you prevented the trial between sloper and me being printed i dont know you did nor do i believe you did and i am sure i dont care whether it is printed or no time truth and undeniable facts have opened the eyes of mankind so much in my behalf on account of that unhappy affair that i have no farther anxiety about it nor dread any imputation on my honor or honesty thereby  as to the letters between me and my wife whenever they are read all sensible impartial readers will readily allow me to be thoa weak an unfortunate man a hurt lover an injured husband and a friend betrayed  but how dare you thou unspeakable wretch mention my wife  or what would thou intimate i defy my direst enemy who dares speak truth to say that ought ever happened between us but what too fatally has proved me to be one who loved not wisely but too well  as to mrs cibber i shall only at present say of her the amendment of her conduct joined to her merits as an actress having gained her the good will of many and restored her to the charitable thoughts of a kind world i will scorn though wounded in the deepest manner human nature can feel ever to use any low invectives against a woman or to obstruct her future quiet or her happiness unless and i hope there will be no occasion some future cause should call upon my honor as a husband to put that power in force which my humanity would be shocked to be driven to the necessity of executing  but say thou unnatural thing of nothing unknowing as your nearest friends aver either of the joys or pains of love thou hateful stranger to the ties of kindred or real joy of social friendship what but the most rancrous heart of the most base infamous villain and notorious poltroon could have drawn this disgraceful paragraph from the gall of thy invidous pen those epithets i many times have used in most public places in public print or viva voce and ever shall joined to the name of sloper nor will the name of thomas sheridan henceforward be ever mentioned by me but the same epithets will be heard or understood that a gentleman of honor in this city did prevent the republishing of the abovementioned letters i have reason to believe and must think it designed as an act of good nature in him as not willing either should be hurt  but your stopping em i know nothing of any more than i do of the obligations you would intimate i have to you unless you mean it an obligation  that i have accidentally done you the favor to dine with you when i might have passed my time more agreeably in better company  quest   did i not promise him to study any new character for his second benefit a favor which i had refused to others much more worthy of it  ans you did promise to study a part for my benefit though i did not want you to do it but you since said you would play no more and if you have refused that mountainous favor as your own vain imagination paints it to worthier persons i think as every one will you were very much to blame  quest   did i not when i found mr philips trifling with him and refusing to perform the contract before his face declare that i never would in any shape be concerned with mr philips hereafter if he did not pay him nay more offered to play with mr cibber in the other house to try by that means to make up his loss  quest   did not mr cibber say on that occasion that i behaved with such honor and laid him under such obligations that he only wished for an opportunity to return them  ans   and   when philips trifled and behaved ill enough as he knows not how to behave well you did talk of being concerned no more with philips and of playing with me in another house which you thought it would be your interest to do i made you several compliments on that account which on reflection were more than you deserved for a proposition you had no right to make since you were then actually engaged with philips in articles for some time so could not keep your word and whenever you play the players too well know how much your own interest will be considered before the welfare of any one person or the interest of the whole body  may one not reasonably suggest you rather chose to play with me that my good nature or good manners call it indolence if you will might decline any part you wished and if the allsufficient tommy held my playing in tragedy so cheap whence all these unnecessary cautions of his against my playing in that light or his endeavors before i appeared in the kingdom to imprint in the minds of some people these things can be proved tommy my incapacity for such performance or whence his present anger avowed against any attempts of mine of that sort indeed child your heat betrays you here it outruns your cunning and so your name brought full houses when we played to empty benches the worst houses i have seen here were when you played indeed youth you should remember the old saying fibbers should have good memories not one full house have i seen you play to since i came  the first time i ever saw you on the stage was in the play of julius caesar when the curiosity of seeing your brother in cassius was what the managers depended on for bringing the audience i was told there was then about  0 l  you played lord townly for a widows benefit to about  0 l hamlet i believe to less though for a benefit too richard to less than  0 l and caused about    ls worth of tickets to be given away to puff for you etc the best receipt you had was to cato which i have mentioned and the first night of your appearing in the character of horatio in the fair penitent was worse than any of these and i believe the very worst audience they have known a long while  why youre bewitched sure sed quos jupiter vult perdere prius dementat  that you have disobliged an audience by not performing more than once that you have created disturbances more than once the whole town knows but that you were always under the necessity of so doing nothing but the nonsense of thy own peerless pericranium could ever persuade you to assert  can any one in their senses suppose i could undertake so wild a project as to attempt driving you out of a kingdom you were born in and in which you had as you often boasted such a strong natural interest or why were i to stay or ever to return must my establishment be grounded on your removal upon my word incomparable sir i cannot pay you so great a compliment as to think that necessary nor do i think thou egregious mock monarch like thee of monopolizing kingdoms or as you in your letter to mr g  k ridiculously enough phrasd it of dividing em or that we are to be as you farther said to him the twin stars of heaven etc and such like trash which his better sense as i am credibly informed smiled at but i suppose the town here are to dread your threatening to depart and join in a petition for your stay should you cruel man leave this weeping nation to deplore your absence for a while i will venture to affirm your return will be pretty quick unless you can persuade every body in england to hold every performer as low in their opinion as you do when comparing em to your inimitable self  all men have some degree of vanity without it there would be but little emulation but yours is so barefaced so stupidly apparent a schoolboy would act with more discretion  however cordially partial you may be to your dainty delicate self i shall not forfeit my understanding so much ever to hint you have the least right to stand in any degree of comparison with mr quin or mr garrick whatever your critical noddle may be pleased to allege or with many more there or some here who in their different walks will always be your superiors   as an actor though i have more to say to you as a man i shall yet leave you for a while this answer already swelling to a large size but shall take an opportunity of showing you impartially what you are and what you are not when probably the judging world will take their farewell of thee with this parody thou art but a stalking shadow a poor poor player who have strutted and fretted thy hour upon the stage and now  you are heard no more twas a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying  nothing   twere endless to trace you through your repeated falsehoods or to take notice of all your sheridaninian rhetoric numbers can confront you as to the first and as to the latter it is fit only to be laughed at  but out of thy own mouth will i condemn thee wicked scribler you say yourself page   th  the audience was greatly offended at the disappointment they met with in your not being able to perform and very justly too since it was not in your power to give them the reasons which prevented it  no nor ever was nor ever will be  now if tommy will but correct it boldly and instead of not being able to perform read thus not willing to perform why then the fact will be truly stated i believe  you say being equally skilled in theatrical affairs as you are in laws of hospitality and good breeding  the giving out three plays together is a most unusual thing  no tommy it has been frequently done in england where the theaters are somewhat better conducted than here or they would be in a woeful plight and the company on such occasions have been greatly served thereby oh but some of the characters were yours pray who are you what do you mean that they fitted you in private life i will readily allow you all the virtues you can find crammed into richard or macheth  their valor and their policy excepted little cunning that betrays it self is no policy but the pangs and pleasures of othello sure you dont pretend to have known  oh but you mean they were your parts and pray why the property of you particularly any more than of many others who have acted em before you and it is possible dont play em worse  but you would not play and nobody else must  pert enough that  you say what right had i to answer your first address to the town  why child i never did answer it my epistle was ready for the press before i ever saw your paper as a gentleman can testify who brought it to me just as i was going to send away my letter twas your idle reports which numbers have known you guilty of and the two illnatured advertisements which no one believes you innocent of calculated to create a disturbance and the silly threatening papers posted up about the town all these made me think it necessary to break silence  your nonsense in saying i keep every theater in hot water is very pretty to be sure if you did but know what you meant but as to my troublesome temper there is not i believe a player that will not contradict you  i am confident there is none of the profession here that will find fault with my want of manners good nature or good humor but is there any of em that have not laughed at your ridiculous tyranny or been astonished at your ill usage even of the women  but they should excuse you there tommy how can you tell properly to treat a sex every body believes youre scarce acquainted with  and so you cannot find out any tolerable color i had to be so cavalier a volunteer in the cause  really too many public and private libels pressed me to the service  but it is no matter whether you can find the cause or no if the public finds it and if they are pleased  must i be frightned cause a spalpeen stares as to your pretty compliment to your friends by calling their zeal indiscreet that blunder needs no remark  and to say i knowingly and willingly brought the anger of any set of people upon me is an assertion so absurd nothing can equal the folly of it but the falsehood  it is a pretty plump contradiction to the forced compliment you make when you are pleased to allow me a man of common sense but your effronterie in denying all knowledge of the advertisements or having even the least knowledge of the gentlemen whom you pretend were angry on your account  though living witnesses have proved and will farther your being deeply concerned in publishing the first and that you were daily and hourly in company with the latter as you confess in your own libel is matchless indeed  such glaring contradictions prove you thought your readers must be as silly as your self and would overlook them  it is notorious the college resenting the freedom of the printers in publishing papers as coming from them which they disclaim have on enquiry found sheridan brought em sheridan set em on for this truth let any one appeal to mr faulkner mr exshaw mrs reilly and their servants etc you talk of a message you sent me by mr wright of your having endeavored to appease the anger of your friends etc you took care to send the message late enough for i received none till within half an hour or thereabouts of my letter being cried about the treets  but i no more believe your sincerity in this than i do in every thing else  the impatience of those itinerant gentry the flying stationers being great i must hasten to a conclusion they farther inform me if i swell this to an enormous size twill not be so portable as they could wish nor can they afford it for so small a price as a penny that i may therefore neither inconvenience their traffic or incur their mightinesses displeasure i shall give you but a few words more and then leave thee to those thorns which in thy bosom lodge to goad and sting thee   and so the whole intention of thy long elaborate piece is to introduce a whining begging paragraph in behalf of your benefit thou prince of canters and thou king of maunders is it come to this does this agree with tommys dauntless declarations he never did nor ever would ask any one to come to see him twas to oblige themselves not him they came etc etc is that too modest and gentle mr bays no but it is very great and as farfetched a fancy as ever was known  how are the mighty fallen but this prodigious work the learned tommy did not take up much above a whole day though by his late publishing it it is possible he may sib there too to draw up  miraculous why what an amazing author you may prove in time but prithee how could thou be so long about it i have a child shall write twice as much nonsense in half the time and be more ashamed of it when done  and was its state of mind uneasy good lack you question whether the innocent man feels less than the man of guilt while he is laboring under a load of calumny  really i cannot readily answer you calumny you have endeavored to load me with but as i know no guilt i cannot say i have felt much anxiety of mind nay i am so innocent of any base intentions that i solemnly declare i sleep very sound and am very easy try if you can do so too and rest perturbed spirit farewell remember me  t c  a letter from ancient pistol to young pistol who acted that part on monday the  st of august      at the theater in s  ka  y being an epistle from the dead to the living thou dog in forehead popes hom sirrah it is with no small discomfort and anxiety of mind i hear so exploded a rascal as you should by imitating my noble character endeavor to recommend your self to the world as a second pistol a fellow so little heroic either in mind or gesture that even the character of scrub had been debased by you had not there been other inferior parts in plays such as footmen bailiffs and tapsters thy impudence in assuming mine had been more excusable but every other act of your life as well as this demonstrates you were born to bring that vice to perfection which before did but faintly appear in the awkward gestures of half impudent and half bashful men nay to such a pitch of transcendency have you carried impudence that even thine own father old colley whom none will charge of being over modest begins to be ashamed of you but sirrah neither thy commencing pimp sharper poet or what is baser still a self willed cuckold carries such aggravations of impudence with them as your affecting to play my other parts you might have played without having straining for or deviating from the common course of your lise but surely heroism as little becomes you as majesty would a clown or military weapons a tailor yet under all these disadvantages of body and mind must i forsooth be personated  i whose lofty style employed on greatest things might well become the mouths of mightiest kings thou profane unmeritable wretch may the mighty gods condemn me to the lowest tortures if i am not sick when i think of you and yet such is my cursed destiny i cannot put thee out off my thoughts so much thy impudence provokes me  well you cannot live always  a time will come when thy ugly soul freed from that cage thy body shall descend to these gloomy and dreadcreating shores then shall thou find wretch yea even then when all thy worldly debts shall be paid thou shall here find a score the payment of which shall anniliate your soul even to horror thy worst fears at which you are pretty apt will not let you conceive how i will use you  i will spurn you under my big boot as an elephant would a bears cub or the jackcal of a lion it shall avail thee little that thou art the son of a laureat such laureats as he i despise you are as good a poet yourself and yet by g  if you can find me any earthly scribler besides him who writes as ill as you i will forgive you however injured i may be from the very bottom of my heart but this engagement you will never be able to perform and so the enmity still holds  i hear you are now after selling your native country arrived in ireland and thinking thy self far enough removed from the scene of your former roguery set up for a new man of honor well of all thy impudences this is without dispute the greatest to say there were one or two greater rascals in the world than yourself were a brag might easily be dispensed with but to defy any man to find a flaw in your honor who never was known to have any is like playing as you actors phrase it the double for who the devil that was but half sober would look for a house in a peppercorn but perhaps thou take honor and baseness to be like the two halves of one circle and he who comes to the extremity of one must of consequence be at the beginning of the other if it be so grammercy right honorable  i wish you joy of your new title which i promise you fresh as it is will last no longer than you have an opportunity of contracting a new debt or the persuading some few credulous creatures you are capable of being a sincere friend or an innocent companion no no sirrah would you ever hope to come at the character of an honest man it must be by inverting the present notions concerning virtue and vice could you by any cunning sophistry pesuade mankind that falsehood was truth dissimulation sincerity and malice good nature and so of other vices you might stand fair sor the first place in the list of honorable gentlemen but while the present set of maxims prevail you must content yourself to be held and that deservedly as the basest of mankind  thus i think i have given you some reasons why i should resent your appearing in my character seeing the nobleness of it cannot but suffer through the vile action and worse fame of the performer desist therefore from ever assuming that part nor cowardly take the advantage of my absence to insult me least too far provoked i may be tempted to trespass upon the edict of pluto and quitting these shores resist once more the mansions of my former earthly habitation in order to the obtaining due satisfaction  nor think the space that is our shores between shall thy vile carcass from my fury screen winged with fierce wrath and wraths a mountain thing from this to thee as lightening quick i would spring and when thou do supine at midnight snore locked in the embraces of some favorite whore or if too poor to keep a drab in pay thou lie alone and dreamest of some play i will come and clothed with terrors of the night thy trembling soul from its base lodgings fright me as a gorgon trembling thou shall own and quick convert your brazen face to stone or if my noble soul disdains a slave so base as you should fall by one so brave some imp directed by my high commands seizing the brimful jordan where it stands shall down thy gaping mouth its freightage pour and quench your soul in an unsavory shower so shall men say when you have resigned your breath who stinking lived has died a stinking death pistol  a letter from a young lady to mr cibber mr cibber i believe you will think this comes very late by way of answer to a paper you published dated   th of july entitled a proper reply to a late scurrillous libel etc i have been in the country for this good while past and heard nothing of your quarrel with mr sheridan till the day before yesterday when the abovenamed paper was put into my hands by a gentleman who at the same time related the occasion of your dispute to me i must confess when i first cast my eyes on your reply i imagined i should have been of your party but when i had read a few pages of it i own i changed my mind and began to suspect that the gentleman had been a little partial in his account  you begin with letting the public know that to address them in foul language is an affront to their ears and a breach of good manners  a very hopeful beginning  and would not one imagine that a gentleman who thought thus would write nothing contradictory to such an opinion but would at least keep within the bounds of common decency in his expressions yes certainly and mr cibber is so conscious of the heinousness of using ill language that he most religiously avoids it as i shall take notice of more at large presently in the mean while i shall proceed in order to your several paragraphs  mr arne say you told me at the rainbow coffeehouse that he had been just talking with mr faulkuer at the globe coffeehouse who among other things declared his opinion that it was indiscreet in mr sheridan to cause or suffer such things to be published etc etc  a printers opinion  why man if it was a stadtholders you could not deliver it with more solemnity poor faulkner is an honest fellow but for gods sake dont talk of his opinion  well in the next place you inform us mr sheridan spared no money in chairhire to alarm all parts of the town  why this is not like london chairhire is very cheap here and you may go almost from one end to the other of our poor little city in an hours time and it will not cost you nineteen pence if you dont believe me prithee for once make the experiment  now to come to your promise of good manners again  you say you will contradict mr sheridan by facts not by dirty language  very good still i am in hopes you will keep your word but we shall see that presently in a few lines after this you call him the great sheridan and by and by master tommy there is no scurrillity in this i grant you but indeed my friend there is a little malice and a little childishness in it  but to come to a more material place  you ask mr sheridan why he did not recite those thousand unforeseen accidents that disordered his dear mind etc  why indeed mr sheridan should in justice to himself have been a little more explicit with respect to them accidents whatever they were but is it not possible i speak to you as a man of common sense now and leave the dispute quite out of the question is it not very possible that a man may by a hundred little concurring incidents so trivial in themselves that they would scarce bear a repetition yet at the same time may make a great impression on a delicate mind be really so disordered that it would be actually impossible for him to exert himself properly at some particular junctures certainly nothing is more true instances of this nature are seen frequently and i knew a lady who put off her marriage day and dismissed the impatient bridegroom with all his train because she was disappointed of her wedding slippers  i think this is a parallel case with the one in question  but to go on  you say you treated mr sheridan with more good breeding than he deserved or probably ever understood or practiced an admirable instance of your good breeding this and a great compliment to the college where mr sheridan received his education do you remember you are talking to a gentleman one who was born such and educated such and it is to be presumed conversed with none other till the narrowness of his fortune reduced him to the sad necessity of being company for the gentry of the stage this kingdom i own is much honored by your presence and is likely by your means to improve as much in good breeding as it will in the regulation of the theaters the man of manners is a character i find you affect and keep up notably but really till you undeceived me i always thought a players politeness was much of a size with a printers opinion  you tell us you offered to play syphax and read cato i will not call this an impudent and extravagant proposal but i cannot help saying there seems to be a good deal of art and design in it what could you propose by such an offer but to make mr sheridans behavior in refusing to act appear in the worst light when opposed to your kind candescension in taking upon you to act two parts which was the case in effect when he totally refused to appear in one you knew the audience must have an ill impression made on them for the present from such a refusal you take them in the mood and out of your great affection to them like an obliging creature choose the fatigue of playing two characters a thing perhaps not so new to you where that little obstinate perverse chit sheridan would not as i said before play one  kind indeed but between you and i i suspect you in this plausible intention and am apt to believe there was more illnature than complaisance in it  but come you advance apace with your court breeding the good nature you say was showed you on this occasion you wonder didnt provoke mr sheridan to publish his displeasure against the people for the terrible mortification his little pride mean vanity poor envy and rancarous heart felt on this dismal account  now from envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness good lord deliver us pray how do you know that mr sheridan was so much mortified softly or you will betray yourself and easily discover that the pleasure you proposed to yourself in mortifying your antagonist was a motive much more prevailing with your social humane heart to act as you did than that of obliging your audience  is not this true  well here you quote mr sheridans expressions  tommy as you call him says your fame was designed on his ruin and to prove it he will give an account of his behavior to you since your arrival in this kingdom  very pretty reasoning this say you how was his behavior to prove my design this it seems was a high joke to you but pray have a little patience had mr sheridan only related his own conduct toward you without mentioning any part of your behavior with respect to him i own that would be a method of proving a little new it might indeed make the ingratitude or insincerity of a man appear in blacker colors but that it could not prove his design must be allowed but if i dont mistake mr sheridan he gives us some account of your conduct as well as his own but there was no need of that the town have been witnesses to it and i think it is very obvious from what you have said done and wrote that your intentions were none of the most charitable your behavior in the affair of cato proved your designs and mr sheridans behavior toward you proved how little he deserved such treatment  where is the absurdity of this  i suppose it was thus that every body but yourself understood mr sheridan though perhaps he did not consider it so distinctly   i shall pass over that part of your reply which is by way of dialogue between you and mr sheridan because there are some private reflections in it of a nature too tender to be trifled with but i long to come to the place where you show yourself the very pink of courtesy i mean where you salute mr sheridan by the name of the most base infamous villain and notorious poltroon  courteous and polite i confess  you told us fibbers should have good memories  so should railers too you seem to forget that all bad expressions retort upon the slanderer if you believe this you have them for your pains but you should have considered this before you gave your pen such a liberty  but i had like to have forgot your lofty manner of addressing him before this  but say thou unnatural thing of nothing unknowing as your nearest friends aver either of the joys or pains of love thou hateful stranger to the ties of kindred or real joy of social friendship very sublime i had some thoughts of throwing it into meter but i was afraid it would lose its dignity and therefore chose to let it remain in blank verse pray who gave you this odd character of mr sheridan i am his countrywoman have always lived in the same city with him and have been acquainted with his name for some years and yet i never heard that he had such a little adamantine heart as to be insensible both to love and friendship he has kindred who i have been informed are in some measure obliged to his tenderness for their support  i think this is not an argument that he has so savage a breast as you would intimate so that it is probable them near friends you speak of have misinformed you  you give us to understand that you have not seen mr sheridan play to one full house since you came i cannot tell indeed what particular fatality may have attended him since you came but i know his name whatever jest you are pleased to make of it seldom failed to bring a numerous and polite audience nor is it let me tell you over and above civil in you to point out any particular night when as you say there was the very worst audience that has been known a long time how do you know how many persons of distinction and merit might have been there i presume you are not well enough acquainted here to assirm this upon your own knowledge pray what do you call the worst audience did you mean the thinnest if you did you should have said so for the other word i think affronts the whole audience at once be it good or bad mr sheridan himself didnt do worse than this  you think proper to speak with great contempt of his style and as a competent judge at once pronounce it nonsensical tautological and inconnected to be sure you can never be guilty of any such notorious faults but pray let me ash you a question i must first make use of your own words to mr sheridan i shall not say you forfeit my understanding so much as ever to hint you have the least right to stand in any degree of comparison with mr quin or mr garrick or with many more there where pray mr cibber one would imagine by your way of putting it that quin and garrick were the names of two cities but i suppose you were dreaming of london when you made this mistake and indeed i believe you were sleepy when you wrote the whole but you go on with your comparison he is not on a footing you tell us with quin or garrick but this is the best of it or with some here who in their different walks will always be his superiors o lamentable if by their different walks you mean their different gaits or manner of treading the stage i dont know but some of them may have the advantage of mr sheridan but as players i dare say not one of them would have the vanity to offer such an assertion  i am almost tired of you but i will go on you tell us very obligingly that the theaters in england are somewhat better conducted than those here or they would be in a woeful plight is this a reflection on mr sheridan in particular or on the whole body of the managers which do you think really i dont know that it affronts mr sheridan at all but you fancy you will do it completely by and by where you tell us of his ill usage to the women a sex he cannot tell properly how to treat being scarce acquainted with if this were true i cannot see how he is the worse for it and really the less he is acquainted with that part of the sex which his present method of life must unavoidably throw in his way i must say he will be the better for it but let me inform you i know some ladies of sense and reputation that are acquainted with him and never found him wanting either in that complacency which is natural to a man of a good understanding or that respect which is due to a woman of honor for my own part i never exchanged a word with him in my life and therefore cannot possibly speak out of any particular prejudice you will not believe this probably but with all due submission to you i am very easy about that  i thank my stars i am come to your lost page but there is an expression here that stops me short must i be frightened because a spalpeen stares what do you take a spalpeen to be mr cibber a bear may be or a bugabow i believe you are not rightly apprized of the sense of the word and yet it may be properly enough applied to a player they are people who labor in one season and are beggars in the other that is all  but it is time to take my leave of you which i shall do anon though the flying stationers dont press me to a conclusion as they did you but indeed i am afraid you had to do with great knaves for they would make you believe that if you increased the bulk of your paper they could not afford it for a penny but let me tell you as a friend that in so cheap a country as ireland they could afford ten times as much of the same wit for half the price  a word or two more and then adieu i find you take the liberty of playing upon sacred verse as well as the tag ends of comedies i should think this almost unpardonable but having a precedent of so great a genius i hope i may without offending venture to insert the verse which you left incomplete your exclamation is how are the mighty fallen pray give me leave to add and the weapons of war perished for believe me all the papers you have penned on the present occasion have been put to their proper use   i am etc  an answer to the young lady or a letter from mrs slammekin to miss tabitha tammy etc miss tabby i do indeed think your answer comes very late and if it had not come at all miss i dont see any great loss the world would have had of it miss but since you have scribled to amuse yourself why should not i do so too my dear and as i have been a great frequenter of the theaters both at london and here i think i have as good a right to prattle and judge of playhouse disputes as mrs anybody for really miss i always pay for my place and was ever above excepting an order from any of the fellows whether i sat in the green box the balcony or the lattices i will assure you miss  so you have been in the country for this good while past why really miss tammy i heard you retired to country solitude the day after your cousin tommys benefit you were lately seen at laughlinslown in your jockey cap and a hunting pole in your hand an unbecoming weapon for a young miss by the way and you know how the ladies there laughed at the uncouth figure you made dear creature dont have any more such flights i beg of you  but pray miss tabitha why are you so free with poor mr faulkner what has he done to deserve any fleer from you  oh i forgot he ungraciously rejected one of tommys polite advertisements a heinous and unpardonable crime i grant you  but dear angel why may not a printers opinion if he is an honest sensible man be of as much weight as a stadtholders  lud that is a filthy hard word how could you think of it  as mr faulkners opinion was not wrong sure it had been better for tommy to have paid more regard to it but if tommy is such a coxcomb to regard no bodys opinion but his own why  tommy must take the consequence  pray miss tabby advise tommy never more to commit such paw tricks never more to tell horrid fibs and write a whole paragraph to prove himself a sad fellow and then make you sully your pretty fingers with ink to excuse them but does not cibber fairly charge tommy that he knew and approved of the two letters in faulkners journal to prove this he mentions mr faulkners telling him his opinion that it would be better not to have them printed i grant it may be nothing to the public what was faulkners opinion but it proves that mr faulkner knew sheridan to be so much interested in the advertisements that he thought his resolution alone necessary as to the putting them in or leaving them out and sheridans answer to mr faulkner accordingly was i am determined yet asterwards frontless sheridan in his silly address solemnly declares it was all without his knowledge  matchless impudence  tommy cannot answer this nor has attempted it  cibber surther charges sheridan that he himself carried the other advertisement to faulkners where it was refused that he himself altered the word butchers to ruffians and afterward himself carried it to reillys and in which as you may see he himself declares that he himself is innocent of the former advertisements or letters and knew nothing at all of the matter this is a truth mr faulkner mrs reilly and other living witnesses can prove  thus then stands the fact  mr sheridan disappointed either at not having a particular robe or at the thinness of the audience or perhaps desirous to indulge his vanity in making an audience be dismissed though mr cibber and mrs giffard were in the play who by that means were to be thought os no consequence or from tommys uneasy delicate mind he did not choose there should be any play then says it was ungrateful and insincere in any man to attempt any character he had played thus he forms wild ideas in his noddle of his being injured sets a man up as an imaginary enemy cruelly persecutes him and endeavors by means the most unjustifiable to society no less than the endangering of lives to hinder any one from doing what tommy through spleen pique pride and impertinence would not do himself  by several passages in your letter miss i shrewdly suspect tommy has gone farther in the character of congreves petulant which cibber mentions in his first letter  i question whether tommy like petulant besides having wrote to himself has not put on a hood mask and scarf and called for himself positively it looks mighty like it i protest i will not forgive it if like slender in the play i am to be deceived and instead of sweet mrs anne page am to be put upon by a great lubberly boy  i hear when cibber read your letter he burst into a loud laugh and cried stap my vitals tam again then added with the composed serenity of lord foppington tam is the impudentest fellow that nature ever spawned into the world strike me speechless  did cibber guess right or how dear creature  but pray miss tabby why did you give yourself the needless trouble of telling cibber the price of chairhire here sure you cannot but suppose he has been idly indolent enough to have rode in one several times here as he frequently used in london when your cousin tommy found it much more convenient to walk on foot when tommy was not plagued with the encumbrance of a chair a horse a footman or any other impertinent equipage nor knew the fatigue of being leveed by winemerchants tradesmen etc which his late luck made him unexpectedly acquainted with  that cibber calls tommy the great sheridan and afterward master tommy is not at all inconsistent since all the world must suppose the first can be but irony had cibber said sheridan was brave just witty generous handsome genteel polite a pretty fellow a complete gentleman or an excellent actor would any one have supposed cibber in earnest  to be sure my dear you know they could not  i again question whether tommy not caring to show his face like a man has not hid himself under a petticoat   you own miss tabby tommy should in justice to himself have been a little more explicit with regard to them accidents  a little more explicit  why he has said nothing at all but that he had not his fine playthings as childish a reason as we when we wore bibs and aprons ever gave for not eating our bread and butter when perhaps it wanted glass windows upon it or because our dolls were not dressed to our minds but i wish miss tabby you had let us into a few or any one of those little concurring trifling incidents that made so great an impression on the delicate mind of the dainty deary as rendrd him incapable at a particular juncture oh the critical minute how has tommy lost it oh ged i wish he may ever get over it well i vow miss tabby you brought all the blood of my body into my face you wicked creature you gauky romp you wild toad how can you give one such comical naughty ideas  well that parallel of the lady dismissing her impatient bridegroom for want of her slippers is apt enough and was very near as ridiculous as disappointing an audience for want of a particular robe twas a dangerous trial of the bridegrooms love did he ever return to the lady  and was the lady as handsome as pretty tommy  sure tommy would not disappoint a bride for want of white gloves and a laced nightcap  but miss tabby why do you lug the college into your epistle that is so like tommy what reflection is it on them that tommy does not understand good breeding i have heard of a parsons being hanged and a soldiers being drummd out of a regiment yet neither brought any reflection on the gown or the army though you and i are two prateapace baggages does it follow none of our sex know when to hold their tongues but of what consequence is it to the public whether cibber is a gentleman by birth or whether any of sheridans relations were ever transported or made their exits at the tripple tree but sure tommy will not pretend to say he acted like a gentleman when he did all he could to set the whole town in a blaze and laid schemes for very fatal consequences while he has had recourse to the meanest falsehoods basest equivocations and misrepresentations to shelter himself from the tumults he wished to create  the town are greatly obliged to him a pretty grateful return this for the charitable assistance they have afforded him when the narrowness of his fortune reduced him to the necessity of gaining more from a theater through the indulgence compassion and benevolence of the gentlemen and ladies here than ever his boasted merits can pretend to lay claim to  well your playing upon the players politeness and printers opinion is prodigious pleasant and pretty i protest ah how the ps come in there  p upon p or pay upon pay as bays says as good as ever was wrote  what were cibbers real motives for reading cato and playing syphax i will not pretend to determine any more than you miss tabby or your cousin tommy ought  that it was fatiguing is certain  that it required some art as an actor i suppose  that it prevented the audience from being disappointed through tommys vanity and caprice is undeniable  who one may reasonably suggest wished as there was not a great audience to dismiss them that it might be said there could be no play without tommy why should we suppose any illnatured design in mr cibbers offer of giving himself so much trouble twas allowed by the audience an act of complaisance they thought he acquitted himself well and their repeated applauses showed their opinion  now as i told you miss i have seen plays often in london i shall farther inform you i have heard it said there that mr cibber has frequently managed a theater with such success that both the town and the players have been well pleased nay i have heard it allowed no actor better knows how to conduct a theater than he does  i suppose he did not come hither to learn that art if there is any in it  nor can any of the directors here boast much of the regular conduct of their play houses i believe   i vow miss tabby i must chide you for taking the l  ds name in vain and making so free with any thing out of a good book  how could you say from envy hatred malice etc good l  d deliver us indeed miss my mama would have been angry with me for talking so profanely and ludicrously  i will assure you miss i am no prude but i know when to be decent to   you say if you dont mistake mr sheridan he gives some account of mr cibbers conduct as well as his own  why my dear you do mistake he gives no account  i allow with you all tommy could say were needless  for the town will always judge for themselves  that cibber has joined the words base infamous villain and notorious poltroon to tommy sheridans name is undeniable and after tommy had impudently and impertinently mentioned family distresses quite foreign to the purpose what less could tommy expect or what gentleman or lady will be offended with mr cibber for bestowing such appellations on tommy after so just a provocation why does not tommy shake em off it is his own fault if they stick upon him  but has he not dealt as freely with himself in the third paragraph of his own letter does he not there under his own hand in a public manner prove himself an unfit companion for any gentleman whatever  bad expressions certainly retort upon the slanderer but when the person pointed at deserves those expressions which i dont hear any one deny but that tommy did they will remain where they are placed and are only bold truths not slander  as you grow critical miss tabby on cibbers lofty and sublime manner of addressing tommy give me leave to suppose cibber might grow a little warm on so nice a point as the mention of a woman the occasion appears just enough and it is excusable if his style swells a little if you or i were in a passion it is possible we might elevate our dialect as well as raise our voices  you desire to know who gave cibber that odd character of sheridan cibber tells you his nearest relations and friends  you declare miss you have been acquainted with sheridans name nothing more i hope for some years so may every shoeboy my dearest that can read for it is to be met with underneath many an alehouse sign in this city and many parts adjacent  but why dear child will you be so cruel to mention any of his indigent relations for such they must be who could submit to be obliged to him for support not that poverty is any crime  but it is not quite pretty to hint at the narrowness of their circumstances  and should tommy boast of any relief he may have afforded em would not tommy by such declaration cancel the obligation and may we not conclude tommy has more ostentation than generosity  sure tommy does not pretend to talk of any favors he ever conferred on his brother  though tommy condescended to share with the managers the profits of his brothers playing it is not yet apparent tommy ever refunded any part thereof to his brother  that tommy has not played to a full house since mr cibbers arrival in this kingdom is certain nor had for some time before his arrival  the joke was over  though the gentry here are as benevolent and generous as any nation yet it was not to be supposed they could throw away their charity in one quarter for ever  well i vow and protest miss that was comically thought of you to find out calling a thin audience a bad audience was an affront  but i believe you will not easily persuade the undertakers of any playhouse to think a thin audience agood one  nor would any half dozen persons of the greatest distinction or merit be angry at the expression if they were the only spectators i have seen the royal family at an opera in london and so thin a house the few that were there all allowed it to be a very bad audience and not one thought themselves affronted by the declaration  why as you say cibber does find fault and pretty justly i believe with sheridans style and calls it properly enough nonsensical and tautological and adds his matter is inconnected etc now were cibbers style and matter worse would that prove tommys good no sure  when you quote mr cibbers words viz i shall not forfeit my understanding so much as ever to hint you have the least right to stand in any degree of comparison with mr quin or mr garrick or with many more there  you add  where mr cibber why in england miss tabby england my dearest mentioned a few lines before  laud child sure this must be a wilful oversight of yours if you dont own that  i shall suspect you though you style yourself a young lady to be really an old gentlewoman if your sight is dim call for your spectacles  well youre charmingly pleasant again on the words different walks sure you must be mighty pretty company i will swear youre a provoking creature you agreeable devil you  you own some of the actors may have the advantage of tommy in treading the stage and i am sure many others will allow though the actors do not vainly and foolishly like tommy puff their own praises yet the judicious i say easily discern there are players who in their different walks or casts of playing are so much superior to tommy they would be paid no great compliment by being put in competition with him  when cibber says the theaters in england are somewhat better conducted than the play houses here i dont suppose he means a compliment either to sheridan or the managers might he not by such compliment arraign his judgment should he either extol tommy as an actor or the others as managers  most people are of opinion he would  that cibber knew what the word spalpeen meant is pretty certain by his applying it to sheridan and your explanation of it fully shows miss that it fits tommy very well how near he was to being a beggar till he labored last season in his vocation as a player is pretty notorious  well as you say i am tired of you and my tea waits but oh you dirty thing you what do you mean by cibbers papers having been put to their proper use if you mean curling your hair  why you know child we do that with our love letters  sure  lud bless me  why miss you dont mean any naughty nastiness do you  oh fie o ged i must leave you  why you filthy hoyden  you will scent the room child  well i did not think such a thing could have come out of your mouth goodbytoyou  oh paw paw  i wash my hands of you  yours slammy  verses addressed to mr sheridan on his late affair in the theater i envy will merit still pursue as shade succeeds to light and though a shade obscures the view it

because your eyes are weak x  the fault is yours if faults you see  the punishing be mine  and my complete revenge shall be  i still will rise and shine an epilogue spoke by mr cibber in the character of nobody he enters in a cloak well sirs to keep my word though as i take it youre all but fairly bit if i should break it for what is an epilogue when nobodys to speak it but least the humor with the cheat should lie thus i transform myself to nobody throwing off his cloak he appears habited in a large pair of breeches  as the character of nobody is often represented in pictures etc  in this vile punning form some ancient noddy at first presumed to represent nobody my birth from long before the world i trace from whence the proudest mortals give me place no interests can from such allegiance move em for who is not pleased when nobodys above em frances monarch whose aims unbounded he would give just terms of peace nay keep his word with me for all he toils for is the good of nobody the ties of friendship twixt us well is known to me he wishes the imperial crown for while he seems to let two rivals share it he really means that nobody should wear it thus it is the aim of great men still you see in greatest actions to have regard to me for which they are equally beloved by nobody now as i have merit so too i have my errors one is i hold to all mankind true mirrors it is i plain dealing nobody can tell the secret price for which preferments sell or when wrong steps in government are made besure the faults on my strong shoulders laid which when to public grievances they mount why then poor nobody is called to an account thus still of great or lowest facts you see the universal faults still charged on nobody and yet how deep some cheeks would blush were i to tell what pranks are played when nobody is by oh the stolen raptures you receive and give the vows you swear which only i believe here many struggling nymphs over powerd appear when the warm lover whispers in their ear by heavens my angel nobody can hear but hold sir negative for at this rate a man for ever might of nothing prate so let the fit of praise or censure seize you you still must own that nobody could please you  a prologue spoken by mr cibber on the   th of june being the anniversary of his majestys accession to the throne when great augustus bore imperial sway wanton in ease the happy nations lay often as the rolling year the day restored the favorite day which gave the world a lord the grateful muse her willing tribute paid and joyous sung the hero she obeyed blessed be this day which shall for ever bear the whitest mark and dignisy the year from whose fair beams united glories spring and form at once a hero and a king greatly intent he scorns inglorious rest whilst europes fate lies struggling in his breast her peace her safety all his thoughts control and touch the strongest passions of his soul while in full stream his royal pity flows he points his thunder only against his countrys foes britains with shame their factious schemes give over and now their idle fears are heard no more securely they their monarchs wisdom trust who knows a kings best praise is to be just hence shall he stand our bulwark in alarms our ornament in peace our shield in arms rebellions sons their impious league shall cease and party storms be hushed into a peace fair property shall raise her cheerful head and over our fruitful plains her influence shed each tuneful bard shall touch his sounding lyre and sing the british arms with grecian fire the muse once more shall quit her favorite skies and see in georges praise a second iliad rise  a prologue addressed to the gentlemen and ladies of this kingdom by mr cibber at his benefit when i behold such radiant circles there enriched with all that is good or wise or fair while wit and beauty amiably unite i am awed i am charmed and dazzled with the sight and own no kingdom with hibernia vies for elegance of taste and brightest eyes ambitious of your praise i hither came your praise is merit your applause is fame those little talents my poor skill displays your goodness suffers and your bounty pays for this ye generous minds my thanks receive those thanks are all you ask or i can give o did my genius with my will conspire did that but equal half my fond desire my actions then might some proportion bear to bring your favors and my merits near i own mambition is to charm your taste yet plead no title to your favors past but wish for future worth to make them last proud if my utmost toil might justly claim the smallest portion of impartial fame if all the care and industry i show shall merit half those honors you bestow  an epilogue wrote by jo hains a celebrated comedian of facetious memory and spoken by mr cibber riding on an ass you have seen before now since this shape showing age more asses than mine on a beaucrowded stage wherefore by the example of famed pinky my brother  show this stage has asses as well as an other  mounted i am come to invite you often hither  beaumont and fletcher thus coupled together  fancy his judgment my person his face ith the mighty good interest he

brother the son the father we all ride one another then as a jest for this time let it pass and he that likes it not  may kiss my ass  a prologue spoken by  cibber august   th on the ba dettingen too long has britain been by france amused her peace invaded and her faith abused while europes freedom in the balance hung and faithless lewis like a siren sung to sooth our monarch whose supplies alone
