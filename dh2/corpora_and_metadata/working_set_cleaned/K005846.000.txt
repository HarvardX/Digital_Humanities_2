sole and first ambition what  to spend some squires to gallias cooks most dainty dupes melt manors in ragouts or drown in soups this coxcomb doats on fiddlers till he sees his mortgaged mountains destitute of trees convinced too late that modern strains can move with mightier force than those of greece the grove in headless statues rich and useless urns marmoreo from the classic tour returns so poor the wretch of current coin you would laugh  he cares not  if his antique medals caesars be but safe some tread the slippery paths of loves delights these deal the cards or shake the box at

distant ancestors saw crowned with moss with meeting boughs and deepening to the view here shoots the broad umbrageous avenue here various trees compose a checkered scene glowing in gay diversities of green there the full stream through intermingling glades shines a broad lake or falls in deep cascades nor wants there hazle copse or beechen lawn to cheer with sun or shade the bounding fawn and see

beauties joined at high and solemn festivals have dined presenting often fair virtues shining task in mystic pageantries and moral it was a fashionable practice among our ancient nobility and gentry of both sexes to perform personally in entertainments of this kind nothing could be a more delightful or rational method of spending an evening than this miltons comus was thus exhibited at ludlowcastle in the year      see ben johnsons masks  poetry painting and music were here united in their highest perfection it were to be wished that our modern people of distinction would revive this excellent practice and substitute it in the place of routes and masquerades but in the present age the idea of the true decorum seems to be utterly extinct and even the dignity of human nature seems to be quite overrun with the false refinements of affected elegance and all the inconsistent fopperies of studied folly   masque but vain all ancient praise or boast of birth vain all the palms

directs proud from a wellbred thing to risque their necks the warriors scar not half so graceful seems as at new market dislocated limbs thy sages hear amid the admiring crowd adjudge the stakes most eloquently loud with critic skill over dubious bets preside the low dispute or kindle or decide all empty wisdom and judicious prate of distancd horses gravely fix the fate guide the nice conduct of a daring match and over the equestrian rights with care paternal watch meantime no more the mimic patriots rise to guard britannias honor warm and wise no more in senates dare assert her laws nor pour the bold debate in freedoms cause neglect the counsels of a sinking land and know no rostrum but newmarkets a kind of scaffold where is held a consistory made up of several very eminent gentlemen for determining doubtful cases in the race etc this place might not improperly be called a pandaemonium stand are these the sage directive powers designed with the nice search of a sagacious mind in

of the british race changed from the chosen chiefs of ancient days who warmed with genuine glorys honest thirst divinely labored in the pythian dust theirs was the wreath that lifted from the throng theirs was the theban bards recording song meantime to manly emulation blind slaves to each vulgar vice that stains the mind our british therons issue to the race of their own generous coursers the disgrace what though the grooms of greece never took the odds they won no bets  but then they soared to gods and more an hieros palm a pindars ode than all the united plates of g  e bestowed greece how i kindle at thy magic name feel all thy warmth and catch the kindred flame thy solemn scenes and awful visions rise in ancient grace before my musing eyes here spartas sons in mute attention hang while sage lycurgus pours the mild harangue there xerxes hosts all pale with deadly fear shrink at her leonidas fated heros flashing spear here hung with many a lyre of silver string the laureat walks of sweet ilissus spring and lo where rapt in beautys heavenly dream hoar plato walks his olivd academe  yet ah no more the seat of art and arms delights with wisdom or with virtue warms lo the stern turk with more than gothic rage has blasted all the bays of ancient age no more her groves by sacred feet are trod each attic grace has left the loved abode fallen is fair greece by luxurys pleasing bane seduced she drags a barbarous foreign chain britannia watch o trim thy withering bays remember thou have rivaled graecias praise great nurse of works divine yet oh beware lest thou the fate of greece my country share recall thy wonted worth with conscious pride thou too have seen a solon in a hyde have bade thine edwards and thine henrys rear with spartan fortitude the british spear alike have seen thy sons deserve the meed or of the moral or the martial deed finis
