oroonoko or the royal slave     epistle dedicatory    to the right honourable the lord maitland     my lord  since the world is grown so nice and critical upon dedications and will needs be judging the book by the wit of the patron we ought with a great deal of circumspection to chuse a person against whom there can be no exception and whose wit and worth truly merits all that one is capable of saying upon that occasion  the most part of dedications are chargd with flattery and if the world knows a man has some vices they will not allow one to speak of his virtues this my lord is for want of thinking rightly if men woud consider with reason they woud have another sort of opinion and esteem of dedications and woud believe almost every great man has enough to make him worthy of all that can be said of him there my lord a picturedrawer when he intends to make a good picture essays the face many ways and in many lights before he begins that he may chuse from the several turns of it which is most agreeable and gives it the best grace and if there be a scar an ungrateful mole or any little defect they leave it out and yet make the picture extreamly like but he who has the good fortune to draw a face that is exactly charming in all its parts and features what colours or agreements can be added to make it finer all that he can give is but its due and glories in a piece whose original alone gives it its perfection an ill hand may diminish but a good hand cannot augment its beauty a poet is a painter in his way he draws to the life but in another kind we draw the nobler part the soul and mind the pictures of the pen shall outlast those of the pencil and even worlds themselves tis a short chronicle of those lives that possibly woud be forgotten by other historians or lye neglected there however deserving an immortal fame for men of eminent parts are as exemplary as even monarchs themselves and virtue is a noble lesson to be learnd and tis by comparison we can judge and chuse tis by such illustrious presidents as your lordship the world can be betterd and refind when a great part of the lazy nobility shall with shame behold the admirable accomplishments of a man so great and so young  your lordship has read innumerable volumes of men and books not vainly for the gust of novelty but knowledge excellent knowledge like the industrious bee from every flower you return laden with the precious dew which you are sure to turn to the publick good you hoard no one reflection but lay it all out in the glorious service of your religion and country to both which you are a useful and necessary honour they both want such supporters and tis only men of so elevated parts and fine knowledge such noble principles of loyalty and religion this nation sighs for where shall we find a man so young like st augustine in the midst of all his youth and gaiety teaching the world divine precepts true notions of faith and excellent morality and at the same time be also a perfect pattern of all that accomplish a great man you have my lord all that refind wit that charms and the affability that obliges a generosity that gives a lustre to your nobility that hospitality and greatness of mind that ingages the world and that admirable conduct that so well instructs it our nation ought to regret and bemoan their misfortunes for not being able to claim the honour of the birth of a man who is so fit to serve his majesty and his kingdoms in all great and publick affairs and to the glory of your nation be it spoken it produces more considerable men for all fine sence wit wisdom breeding and generosity for the generality of the nobility than all other nations can boast and the fruitfulness of your virtues sufficiently make amends for the barrenness of your soil which however cannot be incommode to your lordship since your quality and the veneration that the commonalty naturally pay their lords creates a flowing plenty there    that makes you happy and to compleat your happiness my lord heaven has blest you with a lady to whom it has given all the graces beauties and virtues of her sex all the youth sweetness of nature of a most illustrious family and who is a most rare example to all wives of quality for her eminent piety easiness and condescention and as absolutely merits respect from all the world as she does that passion and resignation she receives from your lordship and which is on her part with so much tenderness returnd methinks your tranquil lives are an image of the new made and beautiful pair in paradise and tis the prayers and wishes of all who have the honour to know you that it may eternally so continue with additions of all the blessings this world can give you  my lord the obligations i have to some of the great men of your nation particularly to your lordship gives me an ambition of making my acknowledgements by all the opportunities i can and such humble fruits as my industry produces i lay at your lordships feet this is a true story of a man gallant enough to merit your protection and had he always been so fortunate he had not made so inglorious an end the royal slave i had the honour to know in my travels to the other world and though i had none above me in that country yet i wanted power to preserve this great man if there be anything that seems romantick i beseech your lordship to consider these countries do in all things so far differ from ours that they produce unconceivable wonders at least so they appear to us because new and strange what i have mentioned i have taken care shoud be truth let the critical reader judge as he pleases twill be no commendation to the book to assure your lordship i writ it in a few hours though it may serve to excuse some of its faults of connexion for i never rested my pen a moment for thought tis purely the merit of my slave that must render it worthy of the honour it begs and the author of that of subscribing herself    my lord     your lordships most obligd       and obedient servant         a behn     the history of the royal slave   i do not pretend in giving you the history of this royal slave to entertain my reader with the adventures of a feignd hero whose life and fortunes fancy may manage at the poets pleasure nor in relating the truth design to adorn it with any accidents but such as arrived in earnest to him and it shall come simply into the world recommended by its own proper merits and natural intrigues there being enough of reality to support it and to render it diverting without the addition of invention  i was myself an eyewitness to a great part of what you will find here set down and what i could not be witness of i receivd from the mouth of the chief actor in this history the hero himself who gave us the whole transactions of his youth and i shall omit for brevitys sake a thousand little accidents of his life which however pleasant to us where history was scarce and adventures very rare yet might prove tedious and heavy to my reader in a world where he finds diversions for every minute new and strange but we who were perfectly charmd with the character of this great man were curious to gather every circumstance of his life  the scene of the last part of his adventures lies in a colony in america called surinam in the westindies  but before i give you the story of this gallant slave tis fit i tell you the manner of bringing them to these new colonies those they make use of there not being natives of the place for those we live with in perfect amity without daring to command em but on the contrary caress em with all the brotherly and friendly affection in the world trading with them for their fish venison buffaloes skins and little rarities as marmosets a sort of monkey as big as a rat or weasel but of a marvellous and delicate shape having face and hands like a human creature and cousheries a little beast in the form and fashion of a lion as big as a kitten but so exactly made in all parts like that noble beast that it is it in miniature then for little paraketoes great parrots muckaws and a thousand other birds and beasts of wonderful and surprizing forms shapes and colours for skins of prodigious snakes of which there are some threescore yards in length as is the skin of one that may be seen at his majestys antiquarys where are also some rare flies of amazing forms and colours presented to em by myself some as big as my fist some less and all of various excellencies such as art cannot imitate then we trade for feathers which they order into all shapes make themselves little short habits of em and glorious wreaths for their heads necks arms and legs whose tinctures are unconceivable i had a set of these presented to me and i gave em to the kings theatre it was the dress of the indian queen infinitely admird by persons of quality and was inimitable besides these a thousand little knacks and rarities in nature and some of art as their baskets weapons aprons c we dealt with em with beads of all colours knives axes pins and needles which they usd only as tools to drill holes with in their ears noses and lips where they hang a great many little things as long beads bits of tin brass or silver beat thin and any shining trinket the beads they weave into aprons about a quarter of an ell long and of the same breadth working them very prettily in flowers of several colours which apron they wear just before em as adam and eve did the figleaves the men wearing a long stripe of linen which they deal with us for they thread these beads also on long cottonthreads and make girdles to tie their aprons to which come twenty times or more about the waste and then cross like a shoulderbelt both ways and round their necks arms and legs this adornment with their long black hair and the face painted in little specks or flowers here and there makes em a wonderful figure to behold some of the beauties which indeed are finely shapd as almost all are and who have pretty features are charming and novel for they have all that is called beauty except the colour which is a reddish yellow or after a new oiling which they often use to themselves they are of the colour of a new brick but smooth soft and sleek they are extreme modest and bashful very shy and nice of being touchd and tho they are all thus naked if one lives for ever among em there is not to be seen an indecent action or glance and being continually usd to see one another so unadornd so like our first parents before the fall it seems as if they had no wishes there being nothing to heighten curiosity but all you can see you see at once and every moment see and where there is no novelty there can be no curiosity not but i have seen a handsome young indian dying for love of a very beautiful young indian maid but all his courtship was to fold his arms pursue her with his eyes and sighs were all his language while she as if no such lover were present or rather as if she desired none such carefully guarded her eyes from beholding him and never approachd him but she looked down with all the blushing modesty i have seen in the most severe and cautious of our world and these people represented to me an absolute idea of the first state of innocence before man knew how to sin and tis most evident and plain that simple nature is the most harmless inoffensive and virtuous mistress tis she alone if she were permitted that better instructs the world than all the inventions of man religion would here but destroy that tranquillity they possess by ignorance and laws would but teach em to know offences of which now they have no notion they once made mourning and fasting for the death of the english governor who had given his hand to come on such a day to em and neither came nor sent believing when a mans word was past nothing but death could or should prevent his keeping it and when they saw he was not dead they askd him what name they had for a man who promisd a thing he did not do the governor told them such a man was a lyar which was a word of infamy to a gentleman then one of em replyd governor you are a lyar and guilty of that infamy they have a native justice which knows no fraud and they understand no vice or cunning but when they are taught by the white men they have plurality of wives which when they grow old serve those that succeed em who are young but with a servitude easy and respected and unless they take slaves in war they have no other attendants  those on that continent where i was had no king but the oldest warcaptain was obeyd with great resignation  a warcaptain is a man who has led them on to battle with conduct and success of whom i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter and of some other of their customs and manners as they fall in my way  with these people as i said we live in perfect tranquillity and good understanding as it behoves us to do they knowing all the places where to seek the best food of the country and the means of getting it and for very small and unvaluable trifles supplying us with what tis almost impossible for us to get for they do not only in the woods and over the sevanas in hunting supply the parts of hounds by swiftly scouring thro those almost impassable places and by the mere activity of their feet run down the nimblest deer and other eatable beasts but in the water one would think they were gods of the rivers or fellowcitizens of the deep so rare an art they have in swimming diving and almost living in water by which they command the less swift inhabitants of the floods and then for shooting what they cannot take or reach with their hands they do with arrows and have so admirable an aim that they will split almost an hair and at any distance that an arrow can reach they will shoot down oranges and other fruit and only touch the stalk with the darts point that they may not hurt the fruit so that they being on all occasions very useful to us we find it absolutely necessary to caress em as friends and not to treat em as slaves nor dare we do otherwise their numbers so far surpassing ours in that continent  those then whom we make use of to work in our plantations of sugar are negroes blackslaves altogether who are transported thither in this manner  those who want slaves make a bargain with a master or a captain of a ship and contract to pay him so much apiece a matter of twenty pound a head for as many as he agrees for and to pay for em when they shall be deliverd on such a plantation so that when there arrives a ship laden with slaves they who have so contracted go aboard and receive their number by lot and perhaps in one lot that may be for ten there may happen to be three or four men the rest women and children or be there more or less of either sex you are obliged to be contented with your lot  coramantien a country of blacks so called was one of those places in which they found the most advantageous trading for these slaves and thither most of our great traders in that merchandize traffick for that nation is very warlike and brave and having a continual campaign being always in hostility with one neighbouring prince or other they had the fortune to take a great many captives for all they took in battle were sold as slaves at least those common men who could not ransom themselves of these slaves so taken the general only has all the profit and of these generals our captains and masters of ships buy all their freights  the king of coramantien was of himself a man of an hundred and odd years old and had no son tho he had many beautiful black wives for most certainly there are beauties that can charm of that colour in his younger years he had had many gallant men to his sons thirteen of whom died in battle conquering when they fell and he had only left him for his successor one grandchild son to one of these dead victors who as soon as he could bear a bow in his hand and a quiver at his back was sent into the field to be traind up by one of the oldest generals to war where from his natural inclination to arms and the occasions given him with the good conduct of the old general he became at the age of seventeen one of the most expert captains and bravest soldiers that ever saw the field of mars so that he was adord as the wonder of all that world and the darling of the soldiers besides he was adornd with a native beauty so transcending all those of his gloomy race that he struck an awe and reverence even into those that knew not his quality as he did into me who beheld him with surprize and wonder when afterwards he arrived in our world  he had scarce arrived at his seventeenth year when fighting by his side the general was killd with an arrow in his eye which the prince oroonoko for so was this gallant moor calld very narrowly avoided nor had he if the general who saw the arrow shot and perceiving it aimed at the prince had not bowd his head between on purpose to receive it in his own body rather than it should touch that of the prince and so saved him  twas then afflicted as oroonoko was that he was proclaimed general in the old mans place and then it was at the finishing of that war which had continud for two years that the prince came to court where he had hardly been a month together from the time of his fifth year to that of seventeen and twas amazing to imagine where it was he learnd so much humanity or to give his accomplishments a juster name where twas he got that real greatness of soul those refined notions of true honour that absolute generosity and that softness that was capable of the highest passions of love and gallantry whose objects were almost continually fighting men or those mangled or dead who heard no sounds but those of war and groans some part of it we may attribute to the care of a frenchman of wit and learning who finding it turn to a very good account to be a sort of royal tutor to this young black and perceiving him very ready apt and quick of apprehension took a great pleasure to teach him morals language and science and was for it extremely belovd and valud by him another reason was he lovd when he came from war to see all the english gentlemen that traded thither and did not only learn their language but that of the spaniard also with whom he traded afterwards for slaves  i have often seen and conversed with this great man and been a witness to many of his mighty actions and do assure my reader the most illustrious courts could not have produced a braver man both for greatness of courage and mind a judgment more solid a wit more quick and a conversation more sweet and diverting he knew almost as much as if he had read much he had heard of and admired the romans he had heard of the late civil wars in england and the deplorable death of our great monarch and would discourse of it with all the sense and abhorrence of the injustice imaginable he had an extreme good and graceful mien and all the civility of a wellbred great man he had nothing of barbarity in his nature but in all points addressd himself as if his education had been in some european court  this great and just character of oroonoko gave me an extreme curiosity to see him especially when i knew he spoke french and english and that i could talk with him but tho i had heard so much of him i was as greatly surprized when i saw him as if i had heard nothing of him so beyond all report i found him he came into the room and addressed himself to me and some other women with the best grace in the world he was pretty tall but of a shape the most exact that can be fancyd the most famous statuary could not form the figure of a man more admirably turnd from head to foot his face was not of that brown rusty black which most of that nation are but a perfect ebony or polished jet his eyes were the most aweful that could be seen and very piercing the white of em being like snow as were his teeth his nose was rising and roman instead of african and flat his mouth the finest shaped that could be seen far from those great turnd lips which are so natural to the rest of the negroes the whole proportion and air of his face was so nobly and exactly formd that bating his colour there could be nothing in nature more beautiful agreeable and handsome there was no one grace wanting that bears the standard of true beauty his hair came down to his shoulders by the aids of art which was by pulling it out with a quill and keeping it combd of which he took particular care nor did the perfections of his mind come short of those of his person for his discourse was admirable upon almost any subject and whoever had heard him speak would have been convinced of their errors that all fine wit is confined to the white men especially to those of christendom and would have confessd that oroonoko was as capable even of reigning well and of governing as wisely had as great a soul as politick maxims and was as sensible of power as any prince civilizd in the most refined schools of humanity and learning or the most illustrious courts  this prince such as i have describd him whose soul and body were so admirably adorned was while yet he was in the court of his grandfather as i said as capable of love as twas possible for a brave and gallant man to be and in saying that i have named the highest degree of love for sure great souls are most capable of that passion  i have already said the old general was killd by the shot of an arrow by the side of this prince in battle and that oroonoko was made general this old dead hero had one only daughter left of his race a beauty that to describe her truly one need say only she was female to the noble male the beautiful black venus to our young mars as charming in her person as he and of delicate virtues i have seen a hundred white men sighing after her and making a thousand vows at her feet all in vain and unsuccessful and she was indeed too great for any but a prince of her own nation to adore  oroonoko coming from the wars which were now ended after he had made his court to his grandfather he thought in honour he ought to make a visit to imoinda the daughter of his fosterfather the dead general and to make some excuses to her because his preservation was the occasion of her fathers death and to present her with those slaves that had been taken in this last battle as the trophies of her fathers victories when he came attended by all the young soldiers of any merit he was infinitely surprizd at the beauty of this fair queen of night whose face and person were so exceeding all he had ever beheld that lovely modesty with which she receivd him that softness in her look and sighs upon the melancholy occasion of this honour that was done by so great a man as oroonoko and a prince of whom she had heard such admirable things the awfulness wherewith she receivd him and the sweetness of her words and behaviour while he stayd gaind a perfect conquest over his fierce heart and made him feel the victor could be subdud so that having made his first compliments and presented her an hundred and fifty slaves in fetters he told her with his eyes that he was not insensible of her charms while imoinda who wishd for nothing more than so glorious a conquest was pleasd to believe she understood that silent language of newborn love and from that moment put on all her additions to beauty  the prince returnd to court with quite another humour than before and tho he did not speak much of the fair imoinda he had the pleasure to hear all his followers speak of nothing but the charms of that maid insomuch that even in the presence of the old king they were extolling her and heightning if possible the beauties they had found in her so that nothing else was talkd of no other sound was heard in every corner where there were whisperers but imoinda imoinda  twill be imagind oroonoko stayd not long before he made his second visit nor considering his quality not much longer before he told her he adord her i have often heard him say that he admird by what strange inspiration he came to talk things so soft and so passionate who never knew love nor was usd to the conversation of women but to use his own words he said most happily some new and till then unknown power instructed his heart and tongue in the language of love and at the same time in favour of him inspird imoinda with a sense of his passion she was touchd with what he said and returnd it all in such answers as went to his very heart with a pleasure unknown before nor did he use those obligations ill that love had done him but turnd all his happy moments to the best advantage and as he knew no vice his flame aimd at nothing but honour if such a distinction may be made in love and especially in that country where men take to themselves as many as they can maintain and where the only crime and sin against a woman is to turn her off to abandon her to want shame and misery such ill morals are only practisd in christian countries where they prefer the bare name of religion and without virtue or morality think that sufficient but oroonoko was none of those professors but as he had right notions of honour so he made her such propositions as were not only and barely such but contrary to the custom of his country he made her vows she should be the only woman he would possess while he livd that no age or wrinkles should incline him to change for her soul would be always fine and always young and he should have an eternal idea in his mind of the charms she now bore and should look into his heart for that idea when he could find it no longer in her face  after a thousand assurances of his lasting flame and her eternal empire over him she condescended to receive him for her husband or rather receive him as the greatest honour the gods could do her  there is a certain ceremony in these cases to be observd which i forgot to ask how twas performd but twas concluded on both sides that in obedience to him the grandfather was to be first made acquainted with the design for they pay a most absolute resignation to the monarch especially when he is a parent also  on the other side the old king who had many wives and many concubines wanted not courtflatterers to insinuate into his heart a thousand tender thoughts for this young beauty and who represented her to his fancy as the most charming he had ever possessd in all the long race of his numerous years at this character his old heart like an extinguishd brand most apt to take fire felt new sparks of love and began to kindle and now grown to his second childhood longd with impatience to behold this gay thing with whom alas he could but innocently play but how he should be confirmd she was this wonder before he usd his power to call her to court where maidens never came unless for the kings private use he was next to consider and while he was so doing he had intelligence brought him that imoinda was most certainly mistress to the prince oroonoko this gave him some chagrine however it gave him also an opportunity one day when the prince was a hunting to wait on a man of quality as his slave and attendant who should go and make a present to imoinda as from the prince he should then unknown see this fair maid and have an opportunity to hear what message she would return the prince for his present and from thence gather the state of her heart and degree of her inclination this was put in execution and the old monarch saw and burnd he found her all he had heard and would not delay his happiness but found he should have some obstacle to overcome her heart for she expressd her sense of the present the prince had sent her in terms so sweet so soft and pretty with an air of love and joy that could not be dissembled insomuch that twas past doubt whether she lovd oroonoko entirely this gave the old king some affliction but he salvd it with this that the obedience the people pay their king was not at all inferior to what they paid their gods and what love would not oblige imoinda to do duty would compel her to  he was therefore no sooner got into his apartment but he sent the royal veil to imoinda that is the ceremony of invitation he sends the lady he has a mind to honour with his bed a veil with which she is covered and securd for the kings use and tis death to disobey besides held a most impious disobedience  tis not to be imagind the surprize and grief that seizd the lovely maid at this news and sight however as delays in these cases are dangerous and pleading worse than treason trembling and almost fainting she was obligd to suffer herself to be coverd and led away  they brought her thus to court and the king who had causd a very rich bath to be prepard was led into it where he sat under a canopy in state to receive this longdfor virgin whom he having commanded to be brought to him they after disrobing her led her to the bath and making fast the doors left her to descend the king without more courtship bad her throw off her mantle and come to his arms but imoinda all in tears threw herself on the marble on the brink of the bath and besought him to hear her she told him as she was a maid how proud of the divine glory she should have been of having it in her power to oblige her king but as by the laws he could not and from his royal goodness would not take from any man his wedded wife so she believd she should be the occasion of making him commit a great sin if she did not reveal her state and condition and tell him she was anothers and could not be so happy to be his  the king enragd at this delay hastily demanded the name of the bold man that had married a woman of her degree without his consent imoinda seeing his eyes fierce and his hands tremble whether with age or anger i know not but she fancyd the last almost repented she had said so much for now she feard the storm would fall on the prince she therefore said a thousand things to appease the raging of his flame and to prepare him to hear who it was with calmness but before she spoke he imagind who she meant but would not seem to do so but commanded her to lay aside her mantle and suffer herself to receive his caresses or by his gods he swore that happy man whom she was going to name should die tho it was even oroonoko himself therefore said he deny this marriage and swear thyself a maid that replyd imoinda by all our powers i do for i am not yet known to my husband tis enough said the king tis enough both to satisfy my conscience and my heart and rising from his seat he went and led her into the bath it being in vain for her to resist  in this time the prince who was returnd from hunting went to visit his imoinda but found her gone and not only so but heard she had receivd the royal veil this raisd him to a storm and in his madness they had much ado to save him from laying violent hands on himself force first prevaild and then reason they urgd all to him that might oppose his rage but nothing weighd so greatly with him as the kings old age uncapable of injuring him with imoinda he would give way to that hope because it pleasd him most and flatterd best his heart yet this servd not altogether to make him cease his different passions which sometimes ragd within him and softend into showers twas not enough to appease him to tell him his grandfather was old and could not that way injure him while he retaind that awful duty which the young men are usd there to pay to their grave relations he could not be convincd he had no cause to sigh and mourn for the loss of a mistress he could not with all his strength and courage retrieve and he would often cry oh my friends were she in walld cities or confind from me in fortifications of the greatest strength did inchantments or monsters detain her from me i would venture thro any hazard to free her but here in the arms of a feeble old man my youth my violent love my trade in arms and all my vast desire of glory avail me nothing imoinda is as irrecoverably lost to me as if she were snatchd by the cold arms of death oh she is never to be retrieved if i would wait tedious years till fate should bow the old king to his grave even that would not leave me imoinda free but still that custom that makes it so vile a crime for a son to marry his fathers wives or mistresses would hinder my happiness unless i would either ignobly set an ill precedent to my successors or abandon my country and fly with her to some unknown world who never heard our story  but it was objected to him that his case was not the same for imoinda being his lawful wife by solemn contract twas he was the injurd man and might if he so pleasd take imoinda back the breach of the law being on his grandfathers side and that if he could circumvent him and redeem her from the otan which is the palace of the kings women a sort of seraglio it was both just and lawful for him so to do  this reasoning had some force upon him and he should have been entirely comforted but for the thought that she was possessd by his grandfather however he lovd her so well that he was resolvd to believe what most favourd his hope and to endeavour to learn from imoindas own mouth what only she could satisfy him in whether she was robbd of that blessing which was only due to his faith and love but as it was very hard to get a sight of the women for no men ever enterd into the otan but when the king went to entertain himself with some one of his wives or mistresses and twas death at any other time for any other to go in so he knew not how to contrive to get a sight of her  while oroonoko felt all the agonies of love and sufferd under a torment the most painful in the world the old king was not exempted from his share of affliction he was troubled for having been forcd by an irresistible passion to rob his son of a treasure he knew could not but be extremely dear to him since she was the most beautiful that ever had been seen and had besides all the sweetness and innocence of youth and modesty with a charm of wit surpassing all he found that however she was forcd to expose her lovely person to his witherd arms she could only sigh and weep there and think of oroonoko and oftentimes could not forbear speaking of him tho her life were by custom forfeited by owning her passion but she spoke not of a lover only but of a prince dear to him to whom she spoke and of the praises of a man who till now filld the old mans soul with joy at every recital of his bravery or even his name and twas this dotage on our young hero that gave imoinda a thousand privileges to speak of him without offending and this condescension in the old king that made her take the satisfaction of speaking of him so very often  besides he many times enquird how the prince bore himself and those of whom he askd being entirely slaves to the merits and virtues of the prince still answerd what they thought conducd best to his service which was to make the old king fancy that the prince had no more interest in imoinda and had resignd her willingly to the pleasure of the king that he diverted himself with his mathematicians his fortifications his officers and his hunting  this pleasd the old lover who faild not to report these things again to imoinda that she might by the example of her young lover withdraw her heart and rest better contented in his arms but however she was forcd to receive this unwelcome news in all appearance with unconcern and content her heart was bursting within and she was only happy when she could get alone to vent her griefs and moans with sighs and tears  what reports of the princes conduct were made to the king he thought good to justify as far as possibly he could by his actions and when he appeard in the presence of the king he shewd a face not at all betraying his heart so that in a little time the old man being entirely convincd that he was no longer a lover of imoinda he carryd him with him in his train to the otan often to banquet with his mistresses but as soon as he enterd one day into the apartment of imoinda with the king at the first glance from her eyes notwithstanding all his determined resolution he was ready to sink in the place where he stood and had certainly done so but for the support of aboan a young man who was next to him which with his change of countenance had betrayd him had the king chancd to look that way and i have observd tis a very great error in those who laugh when one says a negro can change colour for i have seen em as frequently blush and look pale and that as visibly as ever i saw in the most beautiful white and tis certain that both these changes were evident this day in both these lovers and imoinda who saw with some joy the change in the princes face and found it in her own strove to divert the king from beholding either by a forcd caress with which she met him which was a new wound in the heart of the poor dying prince but as soon as the king was busyd in looking on some fine thing of imoindas making she had time to tell the prince with her angry but lovedarting eyes that she resented his coldness and bemoand her own miserable captivity nor were his eyes silent but answerd hers again as much as eyes could do instructed by the most tender and most passionate heart that ever lovd and they spoke so well and so effectually as imoinda no longer doubted but she was the only delight and darling of that soul she found pleading in em its right of love which none was more willing to resign than she and twas this powerful language alone that in an instant conveyd all the thoughts of their souls to each other that they both found there wanted but opportunity to make them both entirely happy but when he saw another door opend by onahal a former old wife of the kings who now had charge of imoinda and saw the prospect of a bed of state made ready with sweets and flowers for the dalliance of the king who immediately led the trembling victim from his sight into that prepard repose what rage what wild frenzies seizd his heart which forcing to keep within bounds and to suffer without noise it became the more insupportable and rent his soul with ten thousand pains he was forcd to retire to vent his groans where he fell down on a carpet and lay struggling a long time and only breathing now and thenoh imoinda when onahal had finished her necessary affair within shutting the door she came forth to wait till the king called and hearing some one sighing in the other room she passd on and found the prince in that deplorable condition which she thought needed her aid she gave him cordials but all in vain till finding the nature of his disease by his sighs and naming imoinda she told him he had not so much cause as he imagined to afflict himself for if he knew the king so well as she did he would not lose a moment in jealousy and that she was confident that imoinda bore at this minute part in his affliction aboan was of the same opinion and both together persuaded him to reassume his courage and all sitting down on the carpet the prince said so many obliging things to onahal that he halfpersuaded her to be of his party and she promised him she would thus far comply with his just desires that she would let imoinda know how faithful he was what he sufferd and what he said  this discourse lasted till the king called which gave oroonoko a certain satisfaction and with the hope onahal had made him conceive he assumed a look as gay as twas possible a man in his circumstances could do and presently after he was calld in with the rest who waited without the king commanded musick to be brought and several of his young wives and mistresses came all together by his command to dance before him where imoinda performd her part with an air and grace so surpassing all the rest as her beauty was above em and received the present ordained as a prize the prince was every moment more charmed with the new beauties and graces he beheld in this fairone and while he gazed and she dancd onahal was retired to a window with aboan  this onahal as i said was one of the castmistresses of the old king and twas these now past their beauty that were made guardians or governantees to the new and the young ones and whose business it was to teach them all those wanton arts of love with which they prevaild and charmd heretofore in their turn and who now treated the triumphing happyones with all the severity as to liberty and freedom that was possible in revenge of the honours they rob them of envying them those satisfactions those gallantries and presents that were once made to themselves while youth and beauty lasted and which they now saw pass as it were regardless by and paid only to the bloomings and certainly nothing is more afflicting to a decayd beauty than to behold in itself declining charms that were once adord and to find those caresses paid to new beauties to which once she laid claim to hear them whisper as she passes by that once was a delicate woman those abandond ladies therefore endeavour to revenge all the despights and decays of time on these flourishing happyones and twas this severity that gave oroonoko a thousand fears he should never prevail with onahal to see imoinda but as i said she was now retird to a window with aboan  this young man was not only one of the best quality but a man extremely well made and beautiful and coming often to attend the king to the otan he had subdud the heart of the antiquated onahal which had not forgot how pleasant it was to be in love and tho she had some decays in her face she had none in her sense and wit she was there agreeable still even to aboans youth so that he took pleasure in entertaining her with discourses of love he knew also that to make his court to these shefavourites was the way to be great these being the persons that do all affairs and business at court he had also observed that she had given him glances more tender and inviting than she had done to others of his quality and now when he saw that her favour could so absolutely oblige the prince he faild not to sigh in her ear and look with eyes all soft upon her and gave her hope that she had made some impressions on his heart he found her pleasd at this and making a thousand advances to him but the ceremony ending and the king departing broke up the company for that day and his conversation  aboan faild not that night to tell the prince of his success and how advantageous the service of onahal might be to his amour with imoinda the prince was overjoyd with this good news and besought him if it were possible to caress her so as to engage her entirely which he could not fail to do if he complyd with her desires for then said the prince her life lying at your mercy she must grant you the request you make in my behalf aboan understood him and assurd him he would make love so effectually that he would defy the most expert mistress of the art to find out whether he dissembled it or had it really and twas with impatience they waited the next opportunity of going to the otan  the wars came on the time of taking the field approached and twas impossible for the prince to delay his going at the head of his army to encounter the enemy so that every day seemd a tedious year till he saw his imoinda for he believed he could not live if he were forced away without being so happy twas with impatience therefore that he expected the next visit the king would make and according to his wish it was not long  the parley of the eyes of these two lovers had not passd so secretly but an old jealous lover could spy it or rather he wanted not flatterers who told him they observd it so that the prince was hastend to the camp and this was the last visit he found he should make to the otan he therefore urged aboan to make the best of this last effort and to explain himself so to onahal that she deferring her enjoyment of her young lover no longer might make way for the prince to speak to imoinda  the whole affair being agreed on between the prince and aboan they attended the king as the custom was to the otan where while the whole company was taken up in beholding the dancing and antick postures the womenroyal made to divert the king onahal singled out aboan whom she found most pliable to her wish when she had him where she believed she could not be heard she sighd to him and softly cryd ah aboan when will you be sensible of my passion i confess it with my mouth because i would not give my eyes the lye and you have but too much already perceived they have confessd my flame nor would i have you believe that because i am the abandond mistress of a king i esteem myself altogether divested of charms no aboan i have still a rest of beauty enough engaging and have learnd to please too well not to be desirable i can have lovers still but will have none but aboan madam replyd the halffeigning youth you have already by my eyes found you can still conquer and i believe tis in pity of me you condescend to this kind confession but madam words are used to be so small a part of our countrycourtship that tis rare one can get so happy an opportunity as to tell ones heart and those few minutes we have are forced to be snatchd for more certain proofs of love than speaking and sighing and such i languish for  he spoke this with such a tone that she hoped it true and could not forbear believing it and being wholly transported with joy for having subdued the finest of all the kings subjects to her desires she took from her ears two large pearls and commanded him to wear em in his he would have refused em crying madam these are not the proofs of our love that i expect tis opportunity tis a lonehour only that can make me happy but forcing the pearls into his hand she whisperd softly to him oh do not fear a womans invention when love sets her a thinking and pressing his hand she cryd this night you shall be happy come to the gate of the orangegrove behind the otan and i will be ready about midnight to receive you twas thus agreed and she left him that no notice might be taken of their speaking together  the ladies were still dancing and the king laid on a carpet with a great deal of pleasure was beholding them especially imoinda who that day appeared more lovely than ever being enlivened with the good tidings onahal had brought her of the constant passion the prince had for her the prince was laid on another carpet at the other end of the room with his eyes fixed on the object of his soul and as she turned or moved so did they and she alone gave his eyes and soul their motions nor did imoinda employ her eyes to any other use than in beholding with infinite pleasure the joy she produced in those of the prince but while she was more regarding him than the steps she took she chanced to fall and so near him as that leaping with extreme force from the carpet he caught her in his arms as she fell and twas visible to the whole presence the joy wherewith he received her he clasped her close to his bosom and quite forgot that reverence that was due to the mistress of a king and that punishment that is the reward of a boldness of this nature and had not the presence of mind of imoinda fonder of his safety than her own befriended him in making her spring from his arms and fall into her dance again he had at that instant met his death for the old king jealous to the last degree rose up in rage broke all the diversion and led imoinda to her apartment and sent out word to the prince to go immediately to the camp and that if he were found another night in court he should suffer the death ordained for disobedient offenders  you may imagine how welcome this news was to oroonoko whose unseasonable transport and caress of imoinda was blamed by all men that loved him and now he perceived his fault yet cryd that for such another moment he would be content to die  all the otan was in disorder about this accident and onahal was particularly concernd because on the princes stay depended her happiness for she could no longer expect that of aboan so that eer they departed they contrived it so that the prince and he should both come that night to the grove of the otan which was all of oranges and citrons and that there they would wait her orders  they parted thus with grief enough till night leaving the king in possession of the lovely maid but nothing could appease the jealousy of the old lover he would not be imposed on but would have it that imoinda made a false step on purpose to fall into oroonokos bosom and that all things looked like a design on both sides and twas in vain she protested her innocence he was old and obstinate and left her more than half assurd that his fear was true  the king going to his apartment sent to know where the prince was and if he intended to obey his command the messenger returnd and told him he found the prince pensive and altogether unprepard for the campaign that he lay negligently on the ground and answerd very little this confirmed the jealousy of the king and he commanded that they should very narrowly and privately watch his motions and that he should not stir from his apartment but one spy or other should be employd to watch him so that the hour approaching wherein he was to go to the citrongrove and taking only aboan along with him he leaves his apartment and was watched to the very gate of the otan where he was seen to enter and where they left him to carry back the tidings to the king  oroonoko and aboan were no sooner enterd but onahal led the prince to the apartment of imoinda who not knowing any thing of her happiness was laid in bed but onahal only left him in her chamber to make the best of his opportunity and took her dear aboan to her own where he shewed the height of complaisance for his prince when to give him an opportunity he suffered himself to be caressed in bed by onahal  the prince softly wakend imoinda who was not a little surprizd with joy to find him there and yet she trembled with a thousand fears i believe he omitted saying nothing to this young maid that might persuade her to suffer him to seize his own and take the rights of love and i believe she was not long resisting those arms where she so longed to be and having opportunity night and silence youth love and desire he soon prevaild and ravished in a moment what his old grandfather had been endeavouring for so many months  tis not to be imagined the satisfaction of these two young lovers nor the vows she made him that she remained a spotless maid till that night and that what she did with his grandfather had robbd him of no part of her virginhonour the gods in mercy and justice having reserved that for her plighted lord to whom of right it belonged and tis impossible to express the transports he sufferd while he listend to a discourse so charming from her loved lips and clasped that body in his arms for whom he had so long languished and nothing now afflicted him but his sudden departure from her for he told her the necessity and his commands but should depart satisfyd in this that since the old king had hitherto not been able to deprive him of those enjoyments which only belonged to him he believed for the future he would be less able to injure him so that abating the scandal of the veil which was no otherwise so than that she was wife to another he believed her safe even in the arms of the king and innocent yet would he have venturd at the conquest of the world and have given it all to have had her avoided that honour of receiving the royal veil twas thus between a thousand caresses that both bemoand the hard fate of youth and beauty so liable to that cruel promotion twas a glory that could well have been spared here tho desired and aimd at by all the young females of that kingdom  but while they were thus fondly employd forgetting how time ran on and that the dawn must conduct him far away from his only happiness they heard a great noise in the otan and unusual voices of men at which the prince starting from the arms of the frighted imoinda ran to a little battleax he used to wear by his side and having not so much leisure as to put on his habit he opposed himself against some who were already opening the door which they did with so much violence that oroonoko was not able to defend it but was forced to cry out with a commanding voice whoever ye are that have the boldness to attempt to approach this apartment thus rudely know that i the prince oroonoko will revenge it with the certain death of him that first enters therefore stand back and know this place is sacred to love and me this night tomorrow tis the kings  this he spoke with a voice so resolvd and assurd that they soon retired from the door but cryd tis by the kings command we are come and being satisfyd by thy voice o prince as much as if we had enterd we can report to the king the truth of all his fears and leave thee to provide for thy own safety as thou art advisd by thy friends  at these words they departed and left the prince to take a short and sad leave of his imoinda who trusting in the strength of her charms believed she should appease the fury of a jealous king by saying she was surprized and that it was by force of arms he got into her apartment all her concern now was for his life and therefore she hastend him to the camp and with much ado prevaild on him to go nor was it she alone that prevaild aboan and onahal both pleaded and both assured him of a lye that should be well enough contrived to secure imoinda so that at last with a heart sad as death dying eyes and sighing soul oroonoko departed and took his way to the camp  it was not long after the king in person came to the otan where beholding imoinda with rage in his eyes he upbraided her wickedness and perfidy and threatning her royal lover she fell on her face at his feet bedewing the floor with her tears and imploring his pardon for a fault which she had not with her will committed as onahal who was also prostrate with her could testify that unknown to her he had broke into her apartment and ravished her she spoke this much against her conscience but to save her own life twas absolutely necessary she should feign this falsity she knew it could not injure the prince he being fled to an army that would stand by him against any injuries that should assault him however this last thought of imoindas being ravished changed the measures of his revenge and whereas before he designed to be himself her executioner he now resolved she should not die but as it is the greatest crime in nature amongst them to touch a woman after having been possessd by a son a father or a brother so now he looked on imoinda as a polluted thing wholly unfit for his embrace nor would he resign her to his grandson because she had received the royal veil he therefore removes her from the otan with onahal whom he put into safe hands with order they should be both sold off as slaves to another country either christian or heathen twas no matter where  this cruel sentence worse than death they implord might be reversed but their prayers were vain and it was put in execution accordingly and that with so much secrecy that none either without or within the otan knew any thing of their absence or their destiny  the old king nevertheless executed this with a great deal of reluctancy but he believed he had made a very great conquest over himself when he had once resolved and had performd what he resolved he believed now that his love had been unjust and that he could not expect the gods or captain of the clouds as they call the unknown power would suffer a better consequence from so ill a cause he now begins to hold oroonoko excused and to say he had reason for what he did and now every body could assure the king how passionately imoinda was beloved by the prince even those confessd it now who said the contrary before his flame was not abated so that the king being old and not able to defend himself in war and having no sons of all his race remaining alive but only this to maintain him on his throne and looking on this as a man disobliged first by the rape of his mistress or rather wife and now by depriving him wholly of her he feard might make him desperate and do some cruel thing either to himself or his old grandfather the offender he began to repent him extremely of the contempt he had in his rage put on imoinda besides he considerd he ought in honour to have killed her for this offence if it had been one he ought to have had so much value and consideration for a maid of her quality as to have nobly put her to death and not to have sold her like a common slave the greatest revenge and the most disgraceful of any and to which they a thousand times prefer death and implore it as imoinda did but could not obtain that honour seeing therefore it was certain that oroonoko would highly resent this affront he thought good to make some excuse for his rashness to him and to that end he sent a messenger to the camp with orders to treat with him about the matter to gain his pardon and endeavour to mitigate his grief but that by no means he should tell him she was sold but secretly put to death for he knew he should never obtain his pardon for the other  when the messenger came he found the prince upon the point of engaging with the enemy but as soon as he heard of the arrival of the messenger he commanded him to his tent where he embraced him and received him with joy which was soon abated by the downcast looks of the messenger who was instantly demanded the cause by oroonoko who impatient of delay askd a thousand questions in a breath and all concerning imoinda but there needed little return for he could almost answer himself of all he demanded from his sight and eyes at last the messenger casting himself at the princes feet and kissing them with all the submission of a man that had something to implore which he dreaded to utter besought him to hear with calmness what he had to deliver to him and to call up all his noble and heroick courage to encounter with his words and defend himself against the ungrateful things he had to relate oroonoko replyd with a deep sigh and a languishing voicei am armed against their worst effortsfor i know they will tell me imoinda is no moreand after that you may spare the rest then commanding him to rise he laid himself on a carpet under a rich pavilion and remained a good while silent and was hardly heard to sigh when he was come a little to himself the messenger asked him leave to deliver that part of his embassy which the prince had not yet divind and the prince cryd i permit theethen he told him the affliction the old king was in for the rashness he had committed in his cruelty to imoinda and how he deignd to ask pardon for his offence and to implore the prince would not suffer that loss to touch his heart too sensibly which now all the gods could not restore him but might recompense him in glory which he begged he would pursue and that death that common revenger of all injuries would soon even the account between him and a feeble old man  oroonoko bad him return his duty to his lord and master and to assure him there was no account of revenge to be adjudged between them if there was he was the aggressor and that death would be just and maugre his age would see him righted and he was contented to leave his share of glory to youths more fortunate and worthy of that favour from the gods that henceforth he would never lift a weapon or draw a bow but abandon the small remains of his life to sighs and tears and the continual thoughts of what his lord and grandfather had thought good to send out of the world with all that youth that innocence and beauty  after having spoken this whatever his greatest officers and men of the best rank could do they could not raise him from the carpet or persuade him to action and resolutions of life but commanding all to retire he shut himself into his pavilion all that day while the enemy was ready to engage and wondring at the delay the whole body of the chief of the army then addressd themselves to him and to whom they had much ado to get admittance they fell on their faces at the foot of his carpet where they lay and besought him with earnest prayers and tears to lead them forth to battle and not let the enemy take advantages of them and implored him to have regard to his glory and to the world that depended on his courage and conduct but he made no other reply to all their supplications than this that he had now no more business for glory and for the world it was a trifle not worth his care go continued he sighing and divide it amongst you and reap with joy what you so vainly prize and leave me to my more welcome destiny  they then demanded what they should do and whom he would constitute in his room that the confusion of ambitious youth and power might not ruin their order and make them a prey to the enemy he replyd he would not give himself that troublebut wished em to chuse the bravest man amongst em let his quality or birth be what it would for oh my friends says he it is not titles make men brave or good or birth that bestows courage and generosity or makes the owner happy believe this when you behold oroonoko the most wretched and abandoned by fortune of all the creation of the gods so turning himself about he would make no more reply to all they could urge or implore  the army beholding their officers return unsuccessful with sad faces and ominous looks that presaged no good luck sufferd a thousand fears to take possession of their hearts and the enemy to come even upon them before they could provide for their safety by any defence and tho they were assured by some who had a mind to animate them that they should be immediately headed by the prince and that in the mean time aboan had orders to command as general yet they were so dismayd for want of that great example of bravery that they could make but a very feeble resistance and at last downright fled before the enemy who pursued em to the very tents killing em nor could all aboans courage which that day gained him immortal glory shame em into a manly defence of themselves the guards that were left behind about the princes tent seeing the soldiers flee before the enemy and scatter themselves all over the plain in great disorder made such outcries as rouzd the prince from his amorous slumber in which he had remained buried for two days without permitting any sustenance to approach him but in spite of all his resolutions he had not the constancy of grief to that degree as to make him insensible of the danger of his army and in that instant he leaped from his couch and crydcome if we must die let us meet death the noblest way and twill be more like oroonoko to encounter him at an armys head opposing the torrent of a conquering foe than lazily on a couch to wait his lingering pleasure and die every moment by a thousand racking thoughts or be tamely taken by an enemy and led a whining lovesick slave to adorn the triumphs of jamoan that young victor who already is enterd beyond the limits i have prescribd him  while he was speaking he sufferd his people to dress him for the field and sallying out of his pavilion with more life and vigour in his countenance than ever he shewd he appeard like some divine power descended to save his country from destruction and his people had purposely put him on all things that might make him shine with most splendor to strike a reverend awe into the beholders he flew into the thickest of those that were pursuing his men and being animated with despair he fought as if he came on purpose to die and did such things as will not be believed that human strength could perform and such as soon inspird all the rest with new courage and new ardor and now it was that they began to fight indeed and so as if they would not be outdone even by their adord hero who turning the tide of the victory changing absolutely the fate of the day gaind an entire conquest and oroonoko having the good fortune to single out jamoan he took him prisoner with his own hand having wounded him almost to death  this jamoan afterwards became very dear to him being a man very gallant and of excellent graces and fine parts so that he never put him amongst the rank of captives as they used to do without distinction for the common sale or market but kept him in his own court where he retaind nothing of the prisoner but the name and returned no more into his own country so great an affection he took for oroonoko and by a thousand tales and adventures of love and gallantry flatterd his disease of melancholy and languishment which i have often heard him say had certainly killd him but for the conversation of this prince and aboan and the french governor he had from his childhood of whom i have spoken before and who was a man of admirable wit great ingenuity and learning all which he had infused into his young pupil this frenchman was banished out of his own country for some heretical notions he held and tho he was a man of very little religion yet he had admirable morals and a brave soul  after the total defeat of jamoans army which all fled or were left dead upon the place they spent some time in the camp oroonoko chusing rather to remain a while there in his tents than to enter into a palace or live in a court where he had so lately sufferd so great a loss the officers therefore who saw and knew his cause of discontent invented all sorts of diversions and sports to entertain their prince so that what with those amusements abroad and others at home that is within their tents with the persuasions arguments and care of his friends and servants that he more peculiarly prizd he wore off in time a great part of that chagrin and torture of despair which the first efforts of imoindas death had given him insomuch as having received a thousand kind embassies from the king and invitation to return to court he obeyd tho with no little reluctancy and when he did so there was a visible change in him and for a long time he was much more melancholy than before but time lessens all extremes and reduces em to mediums and unconcern but no motives of beauties tho all endeavourd it could engage him in any sort of amour tho he had all the invitations to it both from his own youth and other ambitions and designs  oroonoko was no sooner returnd from this last conquest and receivd at court with all the joy and magnificence that could be expressd to a young victor who was not only returnd triumphant but belovd like a deity than there arrivd in the port an english ship  the master of it had often before been in these countries and was very well known to oroonoko with whom he had traffickd for slaves and had usd to do the same with his predecessors  this commander was a man of a finer sort of address and conversation better bred and more engaging than most of that sort of men are so that he seemd rather never to have been bred out of a court than almost all his life at sea this captain therefore was always better receivd at court than most of the traders to those countries were and especially by oroonoko who was more civilizd according to the european mode than any other had been and took more delight in the white nations and above all men of parts and wit to this captain he sold abundance of his slaves and for the favour and esteem he had for him made him many presents and obligd him to stay at court as long as possibly he could which the captain seemd to take as a very great honour done him entertaining the prince every day with globes and maps and mathematical discourses and instruments eating drinking hunting and living with him with so much familiarity that it was not to be doubted but he had gaind very greatly upon the heart of this gallant young man and the captain in return of all these mighty favours besought the prince to honour his vessel with his presence some day or other at dinner before he should set sail which he condescended to accept and appointed his day the captain on his part faild not to have all things in a readiness in the most magnificent order he could possibly and the day being come the captain in his boat richly adornd with carpets and velvet cushions rowed to the shore to receive the prince with another longboat where was placd all his musick and trumpets with which oroonoko was extremely delighted who met him on the shore attended by his french governor jamoan aboan and about an hundred of the noblest of the youths of the court and after they had first carried the prince on board the boats fetchd the rest off where they found a very splendid treat with all sorts of fine wines and were as well entertaind as twas possible in such a place to be  the prince having drank hard of punch and several sorts of wine as did all the rest for great care was taken they should want nothing of that part of the entertainment was very merry and in great admiration of the ship for he had never been in one before so that he was curious of beholding every place where he decently might descend the rest no less curious who were not quite overcome with drinking rambled at their pleasure fore and aft as their fancies guided em so that the captain who had well laid his design before gave the word and seizd on all his guests they clapping great irons suddenly on the prince when he was leapd down into the hold to view that part of the vessel and locking him fast down securd him the same treachery was used to all the rest and all in one instant in several places of the ship were lashd fast in irons and betrayd to slavery that great design over they set all hands at work to hoist sail and with as treacherous as fair a wind they made from the shore with this innocent and glorious prize who thought of nothing less than such an entertainment  some have commended this act as brave in the captain but i will spare my sense of it and leave it to my reader to judge as he pleases it may be easily guessd in what manner the prince resented this indignity who may be best resembled to a lion taken in a toil so he raged so he struggled for liberty but all in vain and they had so wisely managed his fetters that he could not use a hand in his defence to quit himself of a life that would by no means endure slavery nor could he move from the place where he was tyd to any solid part of the ship against which he might have beat his head and have finishd his disgrace that way so that being deprived of all other means he resolvd to perish for want of food and pleasd at last with that thought and toild and tird by rage and indignation he laid himself down and sullenly resolvd upon dying and refused all things that were brought him  this did not a little vex the captain and the more so because he found almost all of em of the same humour so that the loss of so many brave slaves so tall and goodly to behold would have been very considerable he therefore orderd one to go from him for he would not be seen himself to oroonoko and to assure him he was afflicted for having rashly done so unhospitable a deed and which could not be now remedied since they were far from shore but since he resented it in so high a nature he assurd him he would revoke his resolution and set both him and his friends ashore on the next land they should touch at and of this the messenger gave him his oath provided he would resolve to live and oroonoko whose honour was such as he never had violated a word in his life himself much less a solemn asseveration believd in an instant what this man said but replyd he expected for a confirmation of this to have his shameful fetters dismisd this demand was carried to the captain who returnd him answer that the offence had been so great which he had put upon the prince that he durst not trust him with liberty while he remaind in the ship for fear lest by a valour natural to him and a revenge that would animate that valour he might commit some outrage fatal to himself and the king his master to whom the vessel did belong to this oroonoko replyd he would engage his honour to behave himself in all friendly order and manner and obey the command of the captain as he was lord of the kings vessel and general of those men under his command  this was deliverd to the still doubting captain who could not resolve to trust a heathen he said upon his parole a man that had no sense or notion of the god that he worshippd oroonoko then replyd he was very sorry to hear that the captain pretended to the knowledge and worship of any gods who had taught him no better principles than not to credit as he would be credited but they told him the difference of their faith occasiond that distrust for the captain had protested to him upon the word of a christian and sworn in the name of a great god which if he should violate he must expect eternal torments in the world to come is that all the obligations he has to be just to his oath replyd oroonoko let him know i swear by my honour which to violate would not only render me contemptible and despised by all brave and honest men and so give my self perpetual pain but it would be eternally offending and displeasing all mankind harming betraying circumventing and outraging all men but punishments hereafter are sufferd by ones self and the world takes no cognizance whether this god has revengd em or not tis done so secretly and deferrd so long while the man of no honour suffers every moment the scorn and contempt of the honester world and dies every day ignominiously in his fame which is more valuable than life i speak not this to move belief but to shew you how you mistake when you imagine that he who will violate his honour will keep his word with his gods so turning from him with a disdainful smile he refused to answer him when he urged him to know what answer he should carry back to his captain so that he departed without saying any more  the captain pondering and consulting what to do it was concluded that nothing but oroonokos liberty would encourage any of the rest to eat except the frenchman whom the captain could not pretend to keep prisoner but only told him he was securd because he might act something in favour of the prince but that he should be freed as soon as they came to land so that they concluded it wholly necessary to free the prince from his irons that he might shew himself to the rest that they might have an eye upon him and that they could not fear a single man  this being resolved to make the obligation the greater the captain himself went to oroonoko where after many compliments and assurances of what he had already promisd he receiving from the prince his parole and his hand for his good behaviour dismissd his irons and brought him to his own cabin where after having treated and reposd him a while for he had neither eat nor slept in four days before he besought him to visit those obstinate people in chains who refused all manner of sustenance and intreated him to oblige em to eat and assure em of their liberty the first opportunity  oroonoko who was too generous not to give credit to his words shewd himself to his people who were transported with excess of joy at the sight of their darling prince falling at his feet and kissing and embracing em believing as some divine oracle all he assurd em but he besought em to bear their chains with that bravery that became those whom he had seen act so nobly in arms and that they could not give him greater proofs of their love and friendship since twas all the security the captain his friend could have against the revenge he said they might possibly justly take for the injuries sustained by him and they all with one accord assurd him that they could not suffer enough when it was for his repose and safety  after this they no longer refusd to eat but took what was brought em and were pleasd with their captivity since by it they hoped to redeem the prince who all the rest of the voyage was treated with all the respect due to his birth tho nothing could divert his melancholy and he would often sigh for imoinda and think this a punishment due to his misfortune in having left that noble maid behind him that fatal night in the otan when he fled to the camp  possessd with a thousand thoughts of past joys with this fair young person and a thousand griefs for her eternal loss he endurd a tedious voyage and at last arrivd at the mouth of the river of surinam a colony belonging to the king of england and where they were to deliver some part of their slaves there the merchants and gentlemen of the country going on board to demand those lots of slaves they had already agreed on and amongst those the overseers of those plantations where i then chancd to be the captain who had given the word orderd his men to bring up those noble slaves in fetters whom i have spoken of and having put em some in one and some in other lots with women and children which they call pickaninies they sold em off as slaves to several merchants and gentlemen not putting any two in one lot because they would separate em far from each other nor daring to trust em together lest rage and courage should put em upon contriving some great action to the ruin of the colony  oroonoko was first seizd on and sold to our overseer who had the first lot with seventeen more of all sorts and sizes but not one of quality with him when he saw this he found what they meant for as i said he understood english pretty well and being wholly unarmd and defenceless so as it was in vain to make any resistance he only beheld the captain with a look all fierce and disdainful upbraiding him with eyes that forcd blushes on his guilty cheeks he only cryd in passing over the side of the ship farewel sir tis worth my sufferings to gain so true a knowledge both of you and of your gods by whom you swear and desiring those that held him to forbear their pains and telling em he would make no resistance he cryd come my fellowslaves let us descend and see if we can meet with more honour and honesty in the next world we shall touch upon so he nimbly leapt into the boat and shewing no more concern sufferd himself to be rowd up the river with his seventeen companions  the gentleman that bought him was a young cornish gentleman whose name was trefry a man of great wit and fine learning and was carried into those parts by the lord  governor to manage all his affairs he reflecting on the last words of oroonoko to the captain and beholding the richness of his vest no sooner came into the boat but he fixd his eyes on him and finding something so extraordinary in his face his shape and mein a greatness of look and haughtiness in his air and finding he spoke english had a great mind to be enquiring into his quality and fortune which though oroonoko endeavourd to hide by only confessing he was above the rank of common slaves trefry soon found he was yet something greater than he confessd and from that moment began to conceive so vast an esteem for him that he ever after lovd him as his dearest brother and shewd him all the civilities due to so great a man  trefry was a very good mathematician and a linguist could speak french and spanish and in the three days they remaind in the boat for so long were they going from the ship to the plantation he entertaind oroonoko so agreeably with his art and discourse that he was no less pleasd with trefry than he was with the prince and he thought himself at least fortunate in this that since he was a slave as long as he would suffer himself to remain so he had a man of so excellent wit and parts for a master so that before they had finishd their voyage up the river he made no scruple of declaring to trefry all his fortunes and most part of what i have here related and put himself wholly into the hands of his new friend who he found resented all the injuries were done him and was charmd with all the greatnesses of his actions which were recited with that modesty and delicate sense as wholly vanquishd him and subdud him to his interest and he promisd him on his word and honour he would find the means to reconduct him to his own country again assuring him he had a perfect abhorrence of so dishonourable an action and that he would sooner have dyd than have been the author of such a perfidy he found the prince was very much concerned to know what became of his friends and how they took their slavery and trefry promised to take care about the enquiring after their condition and that he should have an account of em  tho as oroonoko afterwards said he had little reason to credit the words of a backearary yet he knew not why but he saw a kind of sincerity and aweful truth in the face of trefry he saw honesty in his eyes and he found him wise and witty enough to understand honour for it was one of his maxims a man of wit could not be a knave or villain  in their passage up the river they put in at several houses for refreshment and ever when they landed numbers of people would flock to behold this man not but their eyes were daily entertaind with the sight of slaves but the fame of oroonoko was gone before him and all people were in admiration of his beauty besides he had a rich habit on in which he was taken so different from the rest and which the captain could not strip him of because he was forcd to surprize his person in the minute he sold him when he found his habit made him liable as he thought to be gazed at the more he begged trefry to give him something more befitting a slave which he did and took off his robes nevertheless he shone thro all and his osenbrigs a sort of brown holland suit he had on could not conceal the graces of his looks and mein and he had no less admirers than when he had his dazling habit on the royal youth appeard in spite of the slave and people could not help treating him after a different manner without designing it as soon as they approached him they venerated and esteemed him his eyes insensibly commanded respect and his behaviour insinuated it into every soul so that there was nothing talked of but this young and gallant slave even by those who yet knew not that he was a prince  i ought to tell you that the christians never buy any slaves but they give em some name of their own their native ones being likely very barbarous and hard to pronounce so that mr trefry gave oroonoko that of cæsar which name will live in that country as long as that scarce more glorious one of the great roman for tis most evident he wanted no part of the personal courage of that cæsar and acted things as memorable had they been done in some part of the world replenished with people and historians that might have given him his due but his misfortune was to fall in an obscure world that afforded only a female pen to celebrate his fame tho i doubt not but it had lived from others endeavours if the dutch who immediately after his time took that country had not killed banished and dispersed all those that were capable of giving the world this great mans life much better than i have done and mr trefry who designd it died before he began it and bemoand himself for not having undertook it in time  for the future therefore i must call oroonoko cæsar since by that name only he was known in our western world and by that name he was received on shore at parhamhouse where he was destind a slave but if the king himself god bless him had come ashore there could not have been greater expectation by all the whole plantation and those neighbouring ones than was on ours at that time and he was received more like a governor than a slave notwithstanding as the custom was they assigned him his portion of land his house and his business up in the plantation but as it was more for form than any design to put him to his task he endured no more of the slave but the name and remaind some days in the house receiving all visits that were made him without stirring towards that part of the plantation where the negroes were  at last he would needs go view his land his house and the business assignd him but he no sooner came to the houses of the slaves which are like a little town by itself the negroes all having left work but they all came forth to behold him and found he was that prince who had at several times sold most of em to these parts and from a veneration they pay to great men especially if they know em and from the surprize and awe they had at the sight of him they all cast themselves at his feet crying out in their language live o king long live o king and kissing his feet paid him even divine homage  several english gentlemen were with him and what mr trefry had told em was here confirmd of which he himself before had no other witness than cæsar himself but he was infinitely glad to find his grandeur confirmed by the adoration of all the slaves  cæsar troubled with their overjoy and overceremony besought em to rise and to receive him as their fellowslave assuring them he was no better at which they set up with one accord a most terrible and hideous mourning and condoling which he and the english had much ado to appease but at last they prevailed with em and they prepared all their barbarous musick and every one killd and dressd something of his own stock for every family has their land apart on which at their leisuretimes they breed all eatable things and clubbing it together made a most magnificent supper inviting their grandee captain their prince to honour it with his presence which he did and several english with him where they all waited on him some playing others dancing before him all the time according to the manners of their several nations and with unwearied industry endeavouring to please and delight him  while they sat at meat mr trefry told cæsar that most of these young slaves were undone in love with a fine sheslave whom they had had about six months on their land the prince who never heard the name of love without a sigh nor any mention of it without the curiosity of examining further into that tale which of all discourses was most agreeable to him asked how they came to be so unhappy as to be all undone for one fair slave trefry who was naturally amorous and delighted to talk of love as well as any body proceeded to tell him they had the most charming black that ever was beheld on their plantation about fifteen or sixteen years old as he guessd that for his part he had done nothing but sigh for her ever since she came and that all the white beauties he had seen never charmd him so absolutely as this fine creature had done and that no man of any nation ever beheld her that did not fall in love with her and that she had all the slaves perpetually at her feet and the whole country resounded with the fame of clemene for so said he we have christend her but she denies us all with such a noble disdain that tis a miracle to see that she who can give such eternal desires should herself be all ice and all unconcern she is adornd with the most graceful modesty that ever beautifyd youth the softest sigherthat if she were capable of love one would swear she languished for some absent happy man and so retired as if she feard a rape even from the god of day or that the breezes would steal kisses from her delicate mouth her task of work some sighing lover every day makes it his petition to perform for her which she accepts blushing and with reluctancy for fear he will ask her a look for a recompence which he dares not presume to hope so great an awe she strikes into the hearts of her admirers i do not wonder replyd the prince that clemene should refuse slaves being as you say so beautiful but wonder how she escapes those that can entertain her as you can do or why being your slave you do not oblige her to yield i confess said trefry when i have against her will entertained her with love so long as to be transported with my passion even above decency i have been ready to make use of those advantages of strength and force nature has given me but oh she disarms me with that modesty and weeping so tender and so moving that i retire and thank my stars she overcame me the company laughd at his civility to a slave and cæsar only applauded the nobleness of his passion and nature since that slave might be noble or what was better have true notions of honour and virtue in her thus passed they this night after having received from the slaves all imaginable respect and obedience  the next day trefry askd cæsar to walk when the heat was allayd and designedly carried him by the cottage of the fair slave and told him she whom he spoke of last night lived there retird but says he i would not wish you to approach for i am sure you will be in love as soon as you behold her cæsar assured him he was proof against all the charms of that sex and that if he imagined his heart could be so perfidious to love again after imoinda he believed he should tear it from his bosom they had no sooner spoke but a little shockdog that clemene had presented her which she took great delight in ran out and she not knowing any body was there ran to get it in again and bolted out on those who were just speaking of her when seeing them she would have run in again but trefry caught her by the hand and cryd clemene however you fly a lover you ought to pay some respect to this stranger pointing to cæsar but she as if she had resolved never to raise her eyes to the face of a man again bent em the more to the earth when he spoke and gave the prince the leisure to look the more at her there needed no long gazing or consideration to examine who this fair creature was he soon saw imoinda all over her in a minute he saw her face her shape her air her modesty and all that calld forth his soul with joy at his eyes and left his body destitute of almost life it stood without motion and for a minute knew not that it had a being and i believe he had never come to himself so oppressd he was with overjoy if he had not met with this allay that he perceived imoinda fall dead in the hands of trefry this awakend him and he ran to her aid and caught her in his arms where by degrees she came to her self and tis needless to tell with what transports what extasies of joy they both a while beheld each other without speaking then snatched each other to their arms then gaze again as if they still doubted whether they possessd the blessing they grasped but when they recoverd their speech tis not to be imagined what tender things they expressd to each other wondring what strange fate had brought them again together they soon informd each other of their fortunes and equally bewaild their fate but at the same time they mutually protested that even fetters and slavery were soft and easy and would be supported with joy and pleasure while they could be so happy to possess each other and to be able to make good their vows cæsar swore he disdained the empire of the world while he could behold his imoinda and she despised grandeur and pomp those vanities of her sex when she could gaze on oroonoko he adord the very cottage where she resided and said that little inch of the world would give him more happiness than all the universe could do and she vowd it was a palace while adorned with the presence of oroonoko  trefry was infinitely pleased with this novel and found this clemene was the fair mistress of whom cæsar had before spoke and was not a little satisfyd that heaven was so kind to the prince as to sweeten his misfortunes by so lucky an accident and leaving the lovers to themselves was impatient to come down to parhamhouse which was on the same plantation to give me an account of what had happened i was as impatient to make these lovers a visit having already made a friendship with cæsar and from his own mouth learned what i have related which was confirmed by his frenchman who was set on shore to seek his fortune and of whom they could not make a slave because a christian and he came daily to parhamhill to see and pay his respects to his pupil prince so that concerning and interesting myself in all that related to cæsar whom i had assured of liberty as soon as the governour arrived i hasted presently to the place where these lovers were and was infinitely glad to find this beautiful young slave who had already gaind all our esteems for her modesty and extraordinary prettiness to be the same i had heard cæsar speak so much of one may imagine then we paid her a treble respect and tho from her being carved in fine flowers and birds all over her body we took her to be of quality before yet when we knew clemene was imoinda we could not enough admire her  i had forgot to tell you that those who are nobly born of that country are so delicately cut and raised all over the forepart of the trunk of their bodies that it looks as if it were japand the works being raised like high point round the edges of the flowers some are only carved with a little flower or bird at the sides of the temples as was cæsar and those who are so carved over the body resemble our antient picts that are figurd in the chronicles but these carvings are more delicate  from that happy day cæsar took clemene for his wife to the general joy of all people and there was as much magnificence as the country could afford at the celebration of this wedding and in a very short time after she conceived with child which made cæsar even adore her knowing he was the last of his great race this new accident made him more impatient of liberty and he was every day treating with trefrey for his and clemenes liberty and offerd either gold or a vast quantity of slaves which should be paid before they let him go provided he could have any security that he should go when his ransom was paid they fed him from day to day with promises and delayd him till the lordgovernor should come so that he began to suspect them of falshood and that they would delay him till the time of his wifes delivery and make a slave of the child too for all the breed is theirs to whom the parents belong this thought made him very uneasy and his sullenness gave them some jealousies of him so that i was obliged by some persons who feard a mutiny which is very fatal sometimes in those colonies that abound so with slaves that they exceed the whites in vast numbers to discourse with cæsar and to give him all the satisfaction i possibly could they knew he and clemene were scarce an hour in a day from my lodgings that they eat with me and that i obligd them in all things i was capable i entertained them with the lives of the romans and great men which charmed him to my company and her with teaching her all the pretty works that i was mistress of and telling her stories of nuns and endeavouring to bring her to the knowledge of the true god but of all discourses cæsar liked that the worst and would never be reconciled to our notions of the trinity of which he ever made a jest it was a riddle he said would turn his brain to conceive and one could not make him understand what faith was however these conversations faild not altogether so well to divert him that he liked the company of us women much above the men for he could not drink and he is but an ill companion in that country that cannot so that obliging him to love us very well we had all the liberty of speech with him especially my self whom he calld his great mistress and indeed my word would go a great way with him for these reasons i had opportunity to take notice to him that he was not well pleased of late as he used to be was more retired and thoughtful and told him i took it ill he should suspect we would break our words with him and not permit both him and clemene to return to his own kingdom which was not so long a way but when he was once on his voyage he would quickly arrive there he made me some answers that shewd a doubt in him which made me ask what advantage it would be to doubt it would but give us a fear of him and possibly compel us to treat him so as i should be very loth to behold that is it might occasion his confinement perhaps this was not so luckily spoke of me for i perceivd he resented that word which i strove to soften again in vain however he assurd me that whatsoever resolutions he should take he would act nothing upon the white people and as for myself and those upon that plantation where he was he would sooner forfeit his eternal liberty and life itself than lift his hand against his greatest enemy on that place he besought me to suffer no fears upon his account for he could do nothing that honour should not dictate but he accused himself for having sufferd slavery so long yet he chargd that weakness on love alone who was capable of making him neglect even glory itself and for which now he reproaches himself every moment of the day much more to this effect he spoke with an air impatient enough to make me know he would not be long in bondage and tho he sufferd only the name of a slave and had nothing of the toil and labour of one yet that was sufficient to render him uneasy and he had been too long idle who usd to be always in action and in arms he had a spirit all rough and fierce and that could not be tamd to lazy rest and tho all endeavours were usd to exercise himself in such actions and sports as this world afforded as running wrestling pitching the bar hunting and fishing chasing and killing tygers of a monstrous size which this continent affords in abundance and wonderful snakes such as alexander is reported to have encounterd at the river of amazons and which cæsar took great delight to overcome yet these were not actions great enough for his large soul which was still panting after more renownd actions  before i parted that day with him i got with much ado a promise from him to rest yet a little longer with patience and wait the coming of the lord governour who was every day expected on our shore he assurd me he would and this promise he desired me to know was given perfectly in complaisance to me in whom he had an entire confidence  after this i neither thought it convenient to trust him much out of our view nor did the country who feard him but with one accord it was advisd to treat him fairly and oblige him to remain within such a compass and that he should be permitted as seldom as could be to go up to the plantations of the negroes or if he did to be accompanyd by some that should be rather in appearance attendants than spies this care was for some time taken and cæsar lookd upon it as a mark of extraordinary respect and was glad his discontent had obligd em to be more observant to him he received new assurance from the overseer which was confirmed to him by the opinion of all the gentlemen of the country who made their court to him during this time that we had his company more frequently than hitherto we had had it may not be unpleasant to relate to you the diversions we entertaind him with or rather he us  my stay was to be short in that country because my father dyd at sea and never arrivd to possess the honour designd him which was lieutenantgeneral of six and thirty islands besides the continent of surinam nor the advantages he hopd to reap by them so that though we were obligd to continue on our voyage we did not intend to stay upon the place though in a word i must say thus much of it that certainly had his late majesty of sacred memory but seen and known what a vast and charming world he had been master of in that continent he would never have parted so easily with it to the dutch tis a continent whose vast extent was never yet known and may contain more noble earth than all the universe beside for they say it reaches from east to west one way as far as china and another to peru it affords all things both for beauty and use tis there eternal spring always the very months of april may and june the shades are perpetual the trees bearing at once all degrees of leaves and fruit from blooming buds to ripe autumn groves of oranges lemons citrons figs nutmegs and noble aromaticks continually bearing their fragrancies the trees appearing all like nosegays adornd with flowers of different kinds some are all white some purple some scarlet some blue some yellow bearing at the same time ripe fruit and blooming young or producing every day new the very wood of all these trees has an intrinsic value above common timber for they are when cut of different colours glorious to behold and bear a price considerable to inlay withal besides this they yield rich balm and gums so that we make our candles of such an aromatic substance as does not only give a sufficient light but as they burn they cast their perfumes all about cedar is the common firing and all the houses are built with it the very meat we eat when set on the table if it be native i mean of the country perfumes the whole room especially a little beast calld an armadillo a thing which i can liken to nothing so well as a rhinoceros tis all in white armour so jointed that it moves as well in it as if it had nothing on this beast is about the bigness of a pig of six weeks old but it were endless to give an account of all the divers wonderful and strange things that country affords and which we took a great delight to go in search of tho those adventures are oftentimes fatal and at least dangerous but while we had cæsar in our company on these designs we feard no harm nor sufferd any  as soon as i came into the country the best house in it was presented me calld st johns hill it stood on a vast rock of white marble at the foot of which the river ran a vast depth down and not to be descended on that side the little waves still dashing and washing the foot of this rock made the softest murmurs and purlings in the world and the opposite bank was adornd with such vast quantities of different flowers eternally blowing and every day and hour new fencd behind em with lofty trees of a thousand rare forms and colours that the prospect was the most ravishing that sands can create on the edge of this white rock towards the river was a walk or grove of orange and lemontrees about half the length of the mall here whose flowery and fruitbearing branches met at the top and hinderd the sun whose rays are very fierce there from entring a beam into the grove and the cool air that came from the river made it not only fit to entertain people in at all the hottest hours of the day but refresh the sweet blossoms and made it always sweet and charming and sure the whole globe of the world cannot shew so delightful a place as this grove was not all the gardens of boasted italy can produce a shade to outvie this which nature had joind with art to render so exceeding fine and tis a marvel to see how such vast trees as big as english oaks could take footing on so solid a rock and in so little earth as coverd that rock but all things by nature there are rare delightful and wonderful but to our sports  sometimes we would go surprising and in search of young tygers in their dens watching when the old ones went forth to forage for prey and oftentimes we have been in great danger and have fled apace for our lives when surprizd by the dams but once above all other times we went on this design and cæsar was with us who had no sooner stoln a young tyger from her nest but going off we encounterd the dam bearing a buttock of a cow which she had torn off with her mighty paw and going with it towards her den we had only four women cæsar and an english gentleman brother to harry martin the great oliverian we found there was no escaping this enraged and ravenous beast however we women fled as fast as we could from it but our heels had not saved our lives if cæsar had not laid down her cub when he found the tyger quit her prey to make the more speed towards him and taking mr martins sword desired him to stand aside or follow the ladies he obeyd him and cæsar met this monstrous beast of mighty size and vast limbs who came with open jaws upon him and fixing his aweful stern eyes full upon those of the beast and putting himself into a very steady and good aiming posture of defence ran his sword quite through his breast down to his very heart home to the hilt of the sword the dying beast stretchd forth her paw and going to grasp his thigh surprizd with death in that very moment did him no other harm than fixing her long nails in his flesh very deep feebly wounded him but could not grasp the flesh to tear off any when he had done this he hallowd to us to return which after some assurance of his victory we did and found him lugging out the sword from the bosom of the tyger who was laid in her blood on the ground he took up the cub and with an unconcern that had nothing of the joy or gladness of victory he came and laid the whelp at my feet we all extremely wonderd at his daring and at the bigness of the beast which was about the height of an heifer but of mighty great and strong limbs  another time being in the woods he killd a tyger that had long infested that part and borne away abundance of sheep and oxen and other things that were for the support of those to whom they belongd abundance of people assaild this beast some affirming they had shot her with several bullets quite through the body at several times and some swearing they shot her through the very heart and they believed she was a devil rather than a mortal thing cæsar had often said he had a mind to encounter this monster and spoke with several gentlemen who had attempted her one crying i shot her with so many poisond arrows another with his gun in this part of her and another in that so that he remarking all the places where she was shot fancyd still he should overcome her by giving her another sort of a wound than any had yet done and one day said at the table what trophies and garlands ladies will you make me if i bring you home the heart of this ravenous beast that eats up all your lambs and pigs we all promisd he should be rewarded at our hands so taking a bow which he chose out of a great many he went up into the wood with two gentlemen where he imagind this devourer to be they had not passd very far into it but they heard her voice growling and grumbling as if she were pleasd with something she was doing when they came in view they found her muzzling in the belly of a new ravishd sheep which she had torn open and seeing herself approachd she took fast hold of her prey with her fore paws and set a very fierce raging look on cæsar without offering to approach him for fear at the same time of loosing what she had in possession so that cæsar remaind a good while only taking aim and getting an opportunity to shoot her where he designd twas some time before he could accomplish it and to wound her and not kill her would but have enragd her the more and endangerd him he had a quiver of arrows at his side so that if one faild he could be supplyd at last retiring a little he gave her opportunity to eat for he found she was ravenous and fell to as soon as she saw him retire being more eager of her prey than of doing new mischiefs when he going softly to one side of her and hiding his person behind certain herbage that grew high and thick he took so good aim that as he intended he shot her just into the eye and the arrow was sent with so good a will and so sure a hand that it stuck in her brain and made her caper and become mad for a moment or two but being seconded by another arrow she fell dead upon the prey cæsar cut her open with a knife to see where those wounds were that had been reported to him and why she did not die of em but i shall now relate a thing that possibly will find no credit among men because tis a notion commonly receivd with us that nothing can receive a wound in the heart and live but when the heart of this courageous animal was taken out there were seven bullets of lead in it the wound seamd up with great scars and she livd with the bullets a great while for it was long since they were shot this heart the conqueror brought up to us and twas a very great curiosity which all the country came to see and which gave cæsar occasion of many fine discourses of accidents in war and strange escapes  at other times he would go a fishing and discoursing on that diversion he found we had in that country a very strange fish calld a numbeel an eel of which i have eaten that while it is alive it has a quality so cold that those who are angling tho with a line of ever so great a length with a rod at the end of it it shall in the same minute the bait is touchd by this eel seize him or her that holds the rod with a numbness that shall deprive em of sense for a while and some have fallen into the water and others dropd as dead on the banks of the rivers where they stood as soon as this fish touches the bait cæsar usd to laugh at this and believd it impossible a man could lose his force at the touch of a fish and could not understand that philosophy that a cold quality should be of that nature however he had a great curiosity to try whether it would have the same effect on him it had on others and often tryd but in vain at last the soughtfor fish came to the bait as he stood angling on the bank and instead of throwing away the rod or giving it a sudden twitch out of the water whereby he might have caught both the eel and have dismissd the rod before it could have too much power over him for experimentsake he graspd it but the harder and fainting fell into the river and being still possessd of the rod the tide carryd him senseless as he was a great way till an indian boat took him up and perceivd when they touchd him a numbness seize them and by that knew the rod was in his hand which with a paddle that is a short oar they struck away and snatchd it into the boat eel and all if cæsar was almost dead with the effect of this fish he was more so with that of the water where he had remaind the space of going a league and they found they had much ado to bring him back to life but at last they did and brought him home where he was in a few hours well recoverd and refreshd and not a little ashamd to find he should be overcome by an eel and that all the people who heard his defiance would laugh at him but we cheard him up and he being convincd we had the eel at supper which was a quarter of an ell about and most delicate meat and was of the more value since it cost so dear as almost the life of so gallant a man  about this time we were in many mortal fears about some disputes the english had with the indians so that we could scarce trust our selves without great numbers to go to any indian towns or place where they abode for fear they should fall upon us as they did immediately after my coming away and the place being in the possession of the dutch they usd them not so civilly as the english so that they cut in pieces all they could take getting into houses and hanging up the mother and all her children about her and cut a footman i left behind me all in joints and naild him to trees  this feud began while i was there so that i lost half the satisfaction i proposd in not seeing and visiting the indian towns but one day bemoaning of our misfortunes upon this account cæsar told us we need not fear for if we had a mind to go he would undertake to be our guard some would but most would not venture about eighteen of us resolvd and took barge and after eight days arrivd near an indian town but approaching it the hearts of some of our company faild and they would not venture on shore so we polld who would and who would not for my part i said if cæsar would i would go he resolvd so did my brother and my woman a maid of good courage now none of us speaking the language of the people and imagining we should have a half diversion in gazing only and not knowing what they said we took a fisherman that livd at the mouth of the river who had been a long inhabitant there and obligd him to go with us but because he was known to the indians as trading among em and being by long living there become a perfect indian in colour we who had a mind to surprize em by making them see something they never had seen that is white people resolvd only my self my brother and woman should go so cæsar the fisherman and the rest hiding behind some thick reeds and flowers that grew in the banks let us pass on towards the town which was on the bank of the river all along a little distant from the houses or huts we saw some dancing others busyd in fetching and carrying of water from the river they had no sooner spyd us but they set up a loud cry that frighted us at first we thought it had been for those that should kill us but it seems it was of wonder and amazement they were all naked and we were dressd so as is most commode for the hot countries very glittering and rich so that we appeard extremely fine my own hair was cut short and i had a taffety cap with black feathers on my head my brother was in a stuffsuit with silver loops and buttons and abundance of green ribbon this was all infinitely surprising to them and because we saw them stand still till we approachd em we took heart and advancd came up to em and offerd em our hands which they took and lookd on us round about calling still for more company who came swarming out all wondering and crying out tepeeme taking their hair up in their hands and spreading it wide to those they calld out to as if they would say as indeed it signifyd numberless wonders or not to be recounted no more than to number the hair of their heads by degrees they grew more bold and from gazing upon us round they touchd us laying their hands upon all the features of our faces feeling our breasts and arms taking up one petticoat then wondering to see another admiring our shoes and stockings but more our garters which we gave em and they tyd about their legs being lacd with silver lace at the ends for they much esteem any shining things in fine we sufferd em to survey us as they pleasd and we thought they would never have done admiring us when cæsar and the rest saw we were receivd with such wonder they came up to us and finding the indian trader whom they knew for tis by these fishermen calld indian traders we hold a commerce with em for they love not to go far from home and we never go to them when they saw him therefore they set up a new joy and cryd in their language oh heres our tiguamy and we shall know whether those things can speak so advancing to him some of em gave him their hands and cryd amora tiguamy which is as much as how do you do or welcome friend and all with one din began to gabble to him and askd if we had sense and wit if we could talk of affairs of life and war as they could do if we could hunt swim and do a thousand things they use he answerd em we could then they invited us into their houses and dressd venison and buffalo for us and going out gatherd a leaf of a tree called a sarumbo leaf of six yards long and spread it on the ground for a tablecloth and cutting another in pieces instead of plates set us on little low indian stools which they cut out of one entire piece of wood and paint in a sort of japanwork they serve every one their mess on these pieces of leaves and it was very good but too highseasond with pepper when we had eat my brother and i took out our flutes and playd to em which gave em new wonder and i soon perceivd by an admiration that is natural to these people and by the extreme ignorance and simplicity of em it were not difficult to establish any unknown or extravagant religion among them and to impose any notions or fictions upon em for seeing a kinsman of mine set some paper on fire with a burningglass a trick they had never before seen they were like to have adord him for a god and beggd he would give em the characters or figures of his name that they might oppose it against winds and storms which he did and they held it up in those seasons and fancyd it had a charm to conquer them and kept it like a holy relique they are very superstitious and calld him the great peeie that is prophet they shewed us their indian peeie a youth of about sixteen years old as handsome as nature could make a man they consecrate a beautiful youth from his infancy and all arts are used to compleat him in the finest manner both in beauty and shape he is bred to all the little arts and cunning they are capable of to all the legerdemain tricks and slight of hand whereby he imposes on the rabble and is both a doctor in physick and divinity and by these tricks makes the sick believe he sometimes eases their pains by drawing from the afflicted part little serpents or odd flies or worms or any strange thing and though they have besides undoubted good remedies for almost all their diseases they cure the patient more by fancy than by medicines and make themselves feared loved and reverenced this young peeie had a very young wife who seeing my brother kiss her came running and kissd me after this they kissd one another and made it a very great jest it being so novel and new admiration and laughing went round the multitude that they never will forget that ceremony never before usd or known cæsar had a mind to see and talk with their warcaptains and we were conducted to one of their houses where we beheld several of the great captains who had been at council but so frightful a vision it was to see em no fancy can create no sad dreams can represent so dreadful a spectacle for my part i took em for hobgoblins or fiends rather than men but however their shapes appeard their souls were very humane and noble but some wanted their noses some their lips some both noses and lips some their ears and others cut through each cheek with long slashes through which their teeth appeard they had several other formidable wounds and scars or rather dismembrings they had comitias or little aprons before them and girdles of cotton with their knives naked stuck in it a bow at their back and a quiver of arrows on their thighs and most had feathers on their heads of divers colours they cryd amora tiguamy to us at our entrance and were pleasd we said as much to them they seated us and gave us drink of the best sort and wonderd as much as the others had done before to see us cæsar was marvelling as much at their faces wondring how they should be all so wounded in war he was impatient to know how they all came by those frightful marks of rage or malice rather than wounds got in noble battle they told us by our interpreter that when any war was waging two men chosen out by some old captain whose fighting was past and who could only teach the theory of war were to stand in competition for the generalship or great warcaptain and being brought before the old judges now past labour they are askd what they dare do to shew they are worthy to lead an army when he who is first askd making no reply cuts off his nose and throws it contemptibly on the ground and the other does something to himself that he thinks surpasses him and perhaps deprives himself of lips and an eye so they slash on till one gives out and many have dyd in this debate and its by a passive valour they shew and prove their activity a sort of courage too brutal to be applauded by our black hero nevertheless he expressd his esteem of em  in this voyage cæsar begat so good an understanding between the indians and the english that there were no more fears or heartburnings during our stay but we had a perfect open and free trade with em many things remarkable and worthy reciting we met with in this short voyage because cæsar made it his business to search out and provide for our entertainment especially to please his dearly adord imoinda who was a sharer in all our adventures we being resolvd to make her chains as easy as we could and to compliment the prince in that manner that most obligd him  as we were coming up again we met with some indians of strange aspects that is of a larger size and other sort of features than those of our country our indian slaves that rowd us askd em some questions but they could not understand us but shewd us a long cotton string with several knots on it and told us they had been coming from the mountains so many moons as there were knots they were habited in skins of a strange beast and brought along with em bags of golddust which as well as they could give as to understand came streaming in little small channels down the high mountains when the rains fell and offerd to be the convoy to any body or persons that would go to the mountains we carryd these men up to parham where they were kept till the lordgovernor came and because all the country was mad to be going on this golden adventure the governor by his letters commanded for they sent some of the gold to him that a guard should be set at the mouth of the river of amazons a river so calld almost as broad as the river of thames and prohibited all people from going up that river it conducting to those mountains or gold but we going off for england before the project was further prosecuted and the governor being drownd in a hurricane either the design died or the dutch have the advantage of it and tis to be bemoand what his majesty lost by losing that part of america  though this digression is a little from my story however since it contains some proofs of the curiosity and daring of this great man i was content to omit nothing of his character  it was thus for some time we diverted him but now imoinda began to shew she was with child and did nothing but sigh and weep for the captivity of her lord herself and the infant yet unborn and believd if it were so hard to gain the liberty of two twould be more difficult to get that for three her griefs were so many darts in the great heart of cæsar and taking his opportunity one sunday when all the whites were overtaken in drink as there were abundance of several trades and slaves for four years that inhabited among the negro houses and sunday being their day of debauch otherwise they were a sort of spies upon cæsar he went pretending out of goodness to em to feast among em and sent all his musick and orderd a great treat for the whole gang about three hundred negroes and about an hundred and fifty were able to bear arms such as they had which were sufficient to do execution with spirits accordingly for the english had none but rusty swords that no strength could draw from a scabbard except the people of particular quality who took care to oil em and keep em in good order the guns also unless here and there one or those newly carried from england would do no good or harm for tis the nature of that country to rust and eat up iron or any metals but gold and silver and they are very expert at the bow which the negroes and indians are perfect masters of  cæsar having singled out these men from the women and children made an harangue to em of the miseries and ignominies of slavery counting up all their toils and sufferings under such loads burdens and drudgeries as were fitter for beasts than men senseless brutes than human souls he told em it was not for days months or years but for eternity there was no end to be of their misfortunes they sufferd not like men who might find a glory and fortitude in oppression but like dogs that lovd the whip and bell and fawnd the more they were beaten that they had lost the divine quality of men and were become insensible asses fit only to bear nay worse an ass or dog or horse having done his duty could lie down in retreat and rise to work again and while he did his duty endurd no stripes but men villanous senseless men such as they toild on all the tedious week till black friday and then whether they workd or not whether they were faulty or meriting they promiscuously the innocent with the guilty sufferd the infamous whip the sordid stripes from their fellowslaves till their blood trickled from all parts of their body blood whose every drop ought to be revenged with a life of some of those tyrants that impose it and why said he my dear friends and fellowsufferers should we be slaves to an unknown people have they vanquished us nobly in fight have they won us in honourable battle and are we by the chance of war become their slaves this would not anger a noble heart this would not animate a soldiers soul no but we are bought and sold like apes or monkeys to be the sport of women fools and cowards and the support of rogues and runagades that have abandoned their own countries for rapine murders theft and villanies do you not hear every day how they upbraid each other with infamy of life below the wildest salvages and shall we render obedience to such a degenerate race who have no one human virtue left to distinguish them from the vilest creatures will you i say suffer the lash from such hands they all replyd with one accord no no no cæsar has spoke like a great captain like a great king  after this he would have proceeded but was interrupted by a tall negro of some more quality than the rest his name was tuscan who bowing at the feet of cæsar cryd my lord we have listend with joy and attention to what you have said and were we only men would follow so great a leader through the world but o consider we are husbands and parents too and have things more dear to us than life our wives and children unfit for travel in those unpassable woods mountains and bogs we have not only difficult lands to overcome but rivers to wade and mountains to encounter ravenous beasts of preyto this cæsar replyd that honour was the first principle in nature that was to be obeyd but as no man would pretend to that without all the acts of virtue compassion charity love justice and reason he found it not inconsistent with that to take equal care of their wives and children as they would of themselves and that he did not design when he led them to freedom and glorious liberty that they should leave that better part of themselves to perish by the hand of the tyrants whip but if there were a woman among them so degenerate from love and virtue to chuse slavery before the pursuit of her husband and with the hazard of her life to share with him in his fortunes that such a one ought to be abandoned and left as a prey to the common enemy  to which they all agreedand bowed after this he spoke of the impassable woods and rivers and convinced them the more danger the more glory he told them that he had heard of one hannibal a great captain had cut his way through mountains of solid rocks and should a few shrubs oppose them which they could fire before em no twas a trifling excuse to men resolved to die or overcome as for bogs they are with a little labour filled and hardend and the rivers could be no obstacle since they swam by nature at least by custom from the first hour of their birth that when the children were weary they must carry them by turns and the woods and their own industry would afford them food to this they all assented with joy  tuscan then demanded what he would do he said he would travel towards the sea plant a new colony and defend it by their valour and when they could find a ship either driven by stress of weather or guided by providence that way they would seize it and make it a prize till it had transported them to their own countries at least they should be made free in his kingdom and be esteemd as his fellowsufferers and men that had the courage and the bravery to attempt at least for liberty and if they died in the attempt it would be more brave than to live in perpetual slavery  they bowd and kissd his feet at this resolution and with one accord vowd to follow him to death and that night was appointed to begin their march they made it known to their wives and directed them to tie their hamocks about their shoulders and under their arms like a scarf and to lead their children that could go and carry those that could not the wives who pay an entire obedience to their husbands obeyd and stayd for em where they were appointed the men stayd but to furnish themselves with what defensive arms they could get and all met at the rendezvouz where cæsar made a new encouraging speech to em and led em out  but as they could not march far that night on monday early when the overseers went to call em all together to go to work they were extremely surprized to find not one upon the place but all fled with what baggage they had you may imagine this news was not only suddenly spread all over the plantation but soon reached the neighbouring ones and we had by noon about  00 men they call the militia of the country that came to assist us in the pursuit of the fugitives but never did one see so comical an army march forth to war the men of any fashion would not concern themselves tho it were almost the common cause for such revoltings are very ill examples and have very fatal consequences oftentimes in many colonies but they had a respect for cæsar and all hands were against the parhamites as they called those of parhamplantation because they did not in the first place love the lordgovernor and secondly they would have it that cæsar was ill used and baffled with and tis not impossible but some of the best in the country was of his council in this flight and depriving us of all the slaves so that they of the better sort would not meddle in the matter the deputygovernor of whom i have had no great occasion to speak and who was the most fawning fairtongud fellow in the world and one that pretended the most friendship to cæsar was now the only violent man against him and though he had nothing and so need fear nothing yet talked and looked bigger than any man he was a fellow whose character is not fit to be mentioned with the worst of the slaves this fellow would lead his army forth to meet cæsar or rather to pursue him most of their arms were of those sort of cruel whips they call cat with nine tails some had rusty useless guns for shew others old basket hilts whose blades had never seen the light in this age and others had long staffs and clubs mr trefry went along rather to be a mediator than a conqueror in such a battle for he foresaw and knew if by fighting they put the negroes into despair they were a sort of sullen fellows that would drown or kill themselves before they would yield and he advisd that fair means was best but byam was one that abounded in his own wit and would take his own measures  it was not hard to find these fugitives for as they fled they were forced to fire and cut the woods before em so that night or day they pursud em by the light they made and by the path they had cleared but as soon as cæsar found that he was pursud he put himself in a posture of defence placing all the woman and children in the rear and himself with tuscan by his side or next to him all promising to die or conquer encouraged thus they never stood to parley but fell on pellmell upon the english and killed some and wounded a great many they having recourse to their whips as the best of their weapons and as they observed no order they perplexed the enemy so sorely with lashing em in the eyes and the women and children seeing their husbands so treated being of fearful and cowardly dispositions and hearing the english cry out yield and live yield and be pardond they all ran in amongst their husbands and fathers and hung about them crying out yield yield and leave cæsar to their revenge that by degrees the slaves abandond cæsar and left him only tuscan and his heroick imoinda who grown as big as she was did nevertheless press near her lord having a bow and a quiver full of poisoned arrows which she managed with such dexterity that she wounded several and shot the governor into the shoulder of which wound he had like to have died but that an indian woman his mistress sucked the wound and cleansd it from the venom but however he stird not from the place till he had parlyd with cæsar who he found was resolved to die fighting and would not be taken no more would tuscan or imoinda but he more thirsting after revenge of another sort than that of depriving him of life now made use of all his art of talking and dissembling and besought cæsar to yield himself upon terms which he himself should propose and should be sacredly assented to and kept by him he told him it was not that he any longer feard him or could believe the force of two men and a young heroine could overthrow all them and with all the slaves now on their side also but it was the vast esteem he had for his person the desire he had to serve so gallant a man and to hinder himself from the reproach hereafter of having been the occasion of the death of a prince whose valour and magnanimity deserved the empire of the world he protested to him he looked upon his action as gallant and brave however tending to the prejudice of his lord and master who would by it have lost so considerable a number of slaves that this flight of his should be lookd on as a heat of youth and a rashness of a too forward courage and an unconsiderd impatience of liberty and no more and that he labourd in vain to accomplish that which they would effectually perform as soon as any ship arrived that would touch on his coast so that if you will be pleased continued he to surrender yourself all imaginable respect shall be paid you and your self your wife and child if it be born here shall depart free out of our land but cæsar would hear of no composition though byam urged if he pursued and went on in his design he would inevitably perish either by great snakes wild beasts or hunger and he ought to have regard to his wife whose condition requird ease and not the fatigues of tedious travel where she could not be secured from being devoured but cæsar told him there was no faith in the white men or the gods they adord who instructed them in principles so false that honest men could not live amongst them though no people professd so much none performd so little that he knew what he had to do when he dealt with men of honour but with them a man ought to be eternally on his guard and never to eat and drink with christians without his weapon of defence in his hand and for his own security never to credit one word they spoke as for the rashness and inconsiderateness of his action he would confess the governor is in the right and that he was ashamed of what he had done in endeavouring to make those free who were by nature slaves poor wretched rogues fit to be used as christian tools dogs treacherous and cowardly fit for such masters and they wanted only but to be whipped into the knowledge of the christian gods to be the vilest of all creeping things to learn to worship such deities as had not power to make them just brave or honest in fine after a thousand things of this nature not fit here to be recited he told byam he had rather die than live upon the same earth with such dogs but trefry and byam pleaded and protested together so much that trefry believing the governor to mean what he said and speaking very cordially himself generously put himself into cæsars hands and took him aside and persuaded him even with tears to live by surrendring himself and to name his conditions cæsar was overcome by his wit and reasons and in consideration of imoinda and demanding what he desired and that it should be ratifyd by their hands in writing because he had perceived that was the common way of contract between man and man amongst the whites all this was performed and tuscans pardon was put in and they surrenderd to the governor who walked peaceably down into the plantation with them after giving order to bury their dead cæsar was very much toild with the bustle of the day for he had fought like a fury and what mischief was done he and tuscan performed alone and gave their enemies a fatal proof that they durst do any thing and feard no mortal force  but they were no sooner arrived at the place where all the slaves receive their punishments of whipping but they laid hands on cæsar and tuscan faint with heat and toil and surprizing them bound them to two several stakes and whipped them in a most deplorable and inhuman manner rending the very flesh from their bones especially cæsar who was not perceived to make any moan or to alter his face only to roll his eyes on the faithless governor and those he believed guilty with fierceness and indignation and to complete his rage he saw every one of those slaves who but a few days before adord him as something more than mortal now had a whip to give him some lashes while he strove not to break his fetters tho if he had it were impossible but he pronounced a woe and revenge from his eyes that darted fire which was at once both aweful and terrible to behold  when they thought they were sufficiently revenged on him they untyd him almost fainting with loss of blood from a thousand wounds all over his body from which they had rent his clothes and led him bleeding and naked as he was and loaded him all over with irons and then rubbd his wounds to complete their cruelty with indian pepper which had like to have made him raving mad and in this condition made him so fast to the ground that he could not stir if his pains and wounds would have given him leave they spared imoinda and did not let her see this barbarity committed towards her lord but carried her down to parham and shut her up which was not in kindness to her but for fear she should die with the sight or miscarry and then they should lose a young slave and perhaps the mother  you must know that when the news was brought on monday morning that cæsar had betaken himself to the woods and carryd with him all the negroes we were possessd with extreme fear which no persuasions could dissipate that he would secure himself till night and then would come down and cut all our throats this apprehension made all the females of us fly down the river to be secured and while we were away they acted this cruelty for i suppose i had authority and interest enough there had i suspected any such thing to have prevented it but we had not gone many leagues but the news overtook us that cæsar was taken and whipped liked a common slave we met on the river with colonel martin a man of great gallantry wit and goodness and whom i have celebrated in a character of my new comedy by his own name in memory of so brave a man he was wise and eloquent and from the fineness of his parts bore a great sway over the hearts of all the colony he was a friend to cæsar and resented this false dealing with him very much we carried him back to parham thinking to have made an accommodation when he came the first news we heard was that the governor was dead of a wound imoinda had given him but it was not so well but it seems he would have the pleasure of beholding the revenge he took on cæsar and before the cruel ceremony was finished he dropt down and then they perceived the wound he had on his shoulder was by a venomd arrow which as i said his indian mistress healed by sucking the wound  we were no sooner arrived but we went up to the plantation to see cæsar whom we found in a very miserable and unexpressible condition and i have a thousand times admired how he lived in so much tormenting pain we said all things to him that trouble pity and goodnature could suggest protesting our innocency of the fact and our abhorrence of such cruelties making a thousand professions and services to him and begging as many pardons for the offenders till we said so much that he believed we had no hand in his ill treatment but told us he could never pardon byam as for trefry he confessd he saw his grief and sorrow for his suffering which he could not hinder but was like to have been beaten down by the very slaves for speaking in his defence but for byam who was their leader their headand should by his justice and honour have been an example to emfor him he wished to live to take a dire revenge of him and said it had been well for him if he had sacrificed me instead of giving me the comtemptible whip he refused to talk much but begging us to give him our hands he took them and protested never to lift up his to do us any harm he had a great respect for colonel martin and always took his counsel like that of a parent and assured him he would obey him in any thing but his revenge on byam therefore said he for his own safety let him speedly dispatch me for if i could dispatch myself i would not till that justice were done to my injured person and the contempt of a soldier no i would not kill myself even after a whipping but will be content to live with that infamy and be pointed at by every grinning slave till i have completed my revenge and then you shall see that oroonoko scorns to live with the indignity that was put on cæsar all we could do could get no more words from him and we took care to have him put immediately into a healing bath to rid him of his pepper and ordered a chirurgeon to anoint him with healing balm which he sufferd and in some time he began to be able to walk and eat we failed not to visit him every day and to that end had him brought to an apartment at parham  the governor had no sooner recoverd and had heard of the menaces of cæsar but he called his council who not to disgrace them or burlesque the government there consisted of such notorious villains as newgate never transported and possibly originally were such who understood neither the laws of god or man and had no sort of principles to make them worthy the name of men but at the very counciltable would contradict and fight with one another and swear so bloodily that twas terrible to hear and see em some of em were afterwards hanged when the dutch took possession of the place others sent off in chains but calling these special rulers of the nation together and requiring their counsel in this weighty affair they all concluded that damn em it might be their own cases and that cæsar ought to be made an example to all the negroes to fright em from daring to threaten their betters their lords and masters and at this rate no man was safe from his own slaves and concluded nemine contradicente that cæsar should be hanged  trefry then thought it time to use his authority and told byam his command did not extend to his lords plantation and that parham was as much exempt from the law as whitehall and that they ought no more to touch the servants of the lordwho there represented the kings person than they could those about the king himself and that parham was a sanctuary and tho his lord were absent in person his power was still in being there which he had entrusted with him as far as the dominions of his particular plantations reached and all that belonged to it the rest of the country as byam was lieutenant to his lord he might exercise his tyranny upon trefry had others as powerful or more that interested themselves in cæsars life and absolutely said he should be defended so turning the governor and his wise council out of doors for they sat at parhamhouse we set a guard upon our lodgingplace and would admit none but those we called friends to us and cæsar  the governor having remaind wounded at parham till his recovery was completed cæsar did not know but he was still there and indeed for the most part his time was spent there for he was one that loved to live at other peoples expence and if he were a day absent he was ten present there and usd to play and walk and hunt and fish with cæsar so that cæsar did not at all doubt if he once recoverd strength but he should find an opportunity of being revenged on him though after such a revenge he could not hope to live for if he escaped the fury of the english mobile who perhaps would have been glad of the occasion to have killed him he was resolved not to survive his whipping yet he had some tender hours a repenting softness which he called his fits of cowardice wherein he struggled with love for the victory of his heart which took part with his charming imoinda there but for the most part his time was passd in melancholy thoughts and black designs he considerd if he should do this deed and die either in the attempt or after it he left his lovely imoinda a prey or at best a slave to the enraged multitude his great heart could not endure that thought perhaps said he she may be first ravishd by every brute exposd first to their nasty lusts and then a shameful death no he could not live a moment under that apprehension too insupportable to be borne these were his thoughts and his silent arguments with his heart as he told us afterwards so that now resolving not only to kill byam but all those he thought had enraged him pleasing his great heart with the fancyd slaughter he should make over the whole face of the plantation he first resolved on a deed that however horrid it first appeard to us all when we had heard his reasons we thought it brave and just being able to walk and as he believed fit for the execution of his great design he beggd trefry to trust him into the air believing a walk would do him good which was granted him and taking imoinda with him as he used to do in his more happy and calmer days he led her up into a wood where after with a thousand sighs and long gazing silently on her face while tears gushd in spite of him from his eyes he told her his design first of killing her and then his enemies and next himself and the impossibility of escaping and therefore he told her the necessity of dying he found the heroick wife faster pleading for death than he was to propose it when she found his fixd resolution and on her knees besought him not to leave her a prey to his enemies he grieved to death yet pleased at her noble resolution took her up and embracing of her with all the passion and languishment of a dying lover drew his knife to kill this treasure of his soul this pleasure of his eyes while tears trickled down his cheeks hers were smiling with joy she should die by so noble a hand and be sent into her own country for thats their notion of the next world by him she so tenderly loved and so truly adord in this for wives have a respect for their husbands equal to what any other people pay a deity and when a man finds any occasion to quit his wife if he love her she dies by his hand if not he sells her or suffers some other to kill her it being thus you may believe the deed was soon resolvd on and tis not to be doubted but the parting the eternal leavetaking of two such lovers so greatly born so sensible so beautiful so young and so fond must be very moving as the relation of it was to me afterwards  all that love could say in such cases being ended and all the intermitting irresolutions being adjusted the lovely young and adord victim lays herself down before the sacrificer while he with a hand resolved and a heartbreaking within gave the fatal stroke first cutting her throat and then severing her yet smiling face from that delicate body pregnant as it was with the fruits of tenderest love as soon as he had done he laid the body decently on leaves and flowers of which he made a bed and conceald it under the same coverlid of nature only her face he left yet bare to look on but when he found she was dead and past all retrieve never more to bless him with her eyes and soft language his grief swelld up to rage he tore he ravd he roard like some monster of the wood calling on the lovd name of imoinda a thousand times he turned the fatal knife that did the deed towards his own heart with a resolution to go immediately after her but dire revenge which was now a thousand times more fierce in his soul than before prevents him and he would cry out no since i have sacrificd imoinda to my revenge shall i lose that glory which i have purchased so dear as at the price of the fairest dearest softest creature that ever nature made no no then at her name grief would get the ascendant of rage and he would lie down by her side and water her face with showers of tears which never were wont to fall from those eyes and however bent he was on his intended slaughter he had not power to stir from the sight of this dear object now more beloved and more adord than ever  he remained in this deplorable condition for two days and never rose from the ground where he had made her sad sacrifice at last rouzing from her side and accusing himself with living too long now imoinda was dead and that the deaths of those barbarous enemies were deferred too long he resolved now to finish the great work but offering to rise he found his strength so decayd that he reeled to and fro like boughs assailed by contrary winds so that he was forced to lie down again and try to summon all his courage to his aid he found his brains turned round and his eyes were dizzy and objects appeard not the same to him they were wont to do his breath was short and all his limbs surprizd with a faintness he had never felt before he had not eat in two days which was one occasion of his feebleness but excess of grief was the greatest yet still he hoped he should recover vigour to act his design and lay expecting it yet six days longer still mourning over the dead idol of his heart and striving every day to rise but could not  in all this time you may believe we were in no little affliction for cæsar and his wife some were of opinion he was escaped never to return others thought some accident had happened to him but however we faild not to send out a hundred people several ways to search for him a party of about forty went that way he took among whom was tuscan who was perfectly reconciled to byam they had not gone very far into the wood but they smelt an unusual smell as of a dead body for stinks must be very noisom that can be distinguishd among such a quantity of natural sweets as every inch of that land produces so that they concluded they should find him dead or some body that was so they passd on towards it as loathsom as it was and made such rustling among the leaves that lie thick on the ground by continual falling that cæsar heard he was approachd and though he had during the space of these eight days endeavourd to rise but found he wanted strength yet looking up and seeing his pursuers he rose and reeld to a neighbouring tree against which he fixd his back and being within a dozen yards of those that advancd and saw him he calld out to them and bid them approach no nearer if they would be safe so that they stood still and hardly believing their eyes that would persuade them that it was cæsar that spoke to them so much he was alterd they askd him what he had done with his wife for they smelt a stink that almost struck them dead he pointing to the dead body sighing cryd behold her there they put off the flowers that coverd her with their sticks and found she was killd and cryd out oh monster that hast murderd thy wife then asking him why he did so cruel a deed he replyd he had no leisure to answer impertinent questions you may go back continued he and tell the faithless governor he may thank fortune that i am breathing my last and that my arm is too feeble to obey my heart in what it had designd him but his tongue faultering and trembling he could scarce end what he was saying the english taking advantage by his weakness cryd let us take him alive by all means he heard em and as if he had revivd from a fainting or a dream he cried out no gentlemen you are deceived you will find no more cæsars to be whipt no more find a faith in me feeble as you think me i have strength yet left to secure me from a second indignity they swore all anew and he only shook his head and beheld them with scorn then they cryd out who will venture on this single man will nobody they stood all silent while cæsar replied fatal will be the attempt of the first adventurer let him assure himself and at that word held up his knife in a menacing posture look ye ye faithless crew said he tis not life i seek nor am i afraid of dying and at that word cut a piece of flesh from his own throat and threw it at em yet still i would live if i could till i had perfected my revenge but oh it cannot be i feel life gliding from my eyes and heart and if i make not haste i shall fall a victim to the shameful whip at that he ripd up his own belly and took his bowels and pulld em out with what strength he could while some on their knees imploring besought him to hold his hand but when they saw him tottering they cryd out will none venture on him a bold englishman cryd yes if he were the devil taking courage when he saw him almost dead and swearing a horrid oath for his farewel to the world he rushd on him cæsar with his armd hand met him so fairly as stuck him to the heart and he fell dead at his feet tuscan seeing that cryd out i love thee o cæsar and therefore will not let thee die if possible and running to him took him in his arms but at the same time warding a blow that cæsar made at his bosom he receivd it quite through his arm and cæsar having not strength to pluck the knife forth tho he attempted it tuscan neither pulld it out himself nor sufferd it to be pulld out but came down with it sticking in his arm and the reason he gave for it was because the air should not get into the wound they put their hands across and carryd cæsar between six of em fainting as he was and they thought dead or just dying and they brought him to parham and laid him on a couch and had the chirurgeon immediately to him who dressed his wounds and sowd up his belly and usd means to bring him to life which they effected we ran all to see him and if before we thought him so beautiful a sight he was now so alterd that his face was like a deathshead blackd over nothing but teeth and eyeholes for some days we sufferd no body to speak to him but caused cordials to be poured down his throat which sustained his life and in six or seven days he recovered his senses for you must know that wounds are almost to a miracle curd in the indies unless wounds in the legs which they rarely ever cure  when he was well enough to speak we talkd to him and askd him some questions about his wife and the reasons why he killd her and he then told us what i have related of that resolution and of his parting and he besought us we would let him die and was extremely afflicted to think it was possible he might live he assurd us if we did not dispatch him he would prove very fatal to a great many we said all we could to make him live and gave him new assurances but he beggd we would not think so poorly of him or of his love to imoinda to imagine we could flatter him to life again but the chirurgeon assurd him he could not live and therefore he need not fear we were all but cæsar afflicted at this news and the sight was ghastly his discourse was sad and the earthy smell about him so strong that i was persuaded to leave the place for some time being my self but sickly and very apt to fall into fits of dangerous illness upon any extraordinary melancholy the servants and trefry and the chirurgeons promisd all to take what possible care they could of the life of cæsar and i taking boat went with other company to colonel martins about three days journey down the river but i was no sooner gone than the governor taking trefry about some pretended earnest business a days journey up the river having communicated his design to one banister a wild irish man one of the council a fellow of absolute barbarity and fit to execute any villany but rich he came up to parham and forcibly took cæsar and had him carried to the same post where he was whippd and causing him to be tyd to it and a great fire made before him he told him he should die like a dog as he was cæsar replied this was the first piece of bravery that ever banister did and he never spoke sense till he pronouncd that word and if he would keep it he would declare in the other world that he was the only man of all the whites that ever he heard speak truth and turning to the men that had bound him he said my friends am i to die or to be whipt and they cryd whipt no you shall not escape so well and then he replyd smiling a blessing on thee and assurd them they need not tie him for he would stand fixd like a rock and endure death so as should encourage them to die but if you whip me said he be sure you tie me fast  he had learnd to take tobacco and when he was assurd he should die he desird they would give him a pipe in his mouth ready lighted which they did and the executioner came and first cut off his members and threw them into the fire after that with an illfavourd knife they cut off his ears and his nose and burnd them he still smoakd on as if nothing had touchd him then they hackd off one of his arms and still he bore up and held his pipe but at the cutting off the other arm his head sunk and his pipe dropt and he gave up the ghost without a groan or a reproach my mother and sister were by him all the while but not sufferd to save him so rude and wild were the rabble and so inhuman were the justices who stood by to see the execution who after paid dear enough for their insolence they cut cæsar into quarters and sent them to several of the chief plantations one quarter was sent to colonel martin who refusd it and swore he had rather see the quarters of banister and the governor himself than those of cæsar on his plantations and that he could govern his negroes without terrifying and grieving them with frightful spectacles of a mangled king   thus died this great man worthy of a better fate and a more sublime wit than mine to write his praise yet i hope the reputation of my pen is considerable enough to make his glorious name to survive to all ages with that of the brave the beautiful and the constant imoinda
