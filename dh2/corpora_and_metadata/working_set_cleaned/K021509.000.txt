are arrived in a cheerful country at last looking about bless me what a charming air and what a charming appetite it gives one i have scarcely swallowed any thing but dust for these three weeks but here ends our tedious journey  yonder is the city of messina and hard by resides the man my master is in search of  why my master has left savoy to seek this interview with poor dead julias jealous husband i am yet to learn  oh here he comes   enter carlos carlos  at length valoury the hurry of traveling is over  you now will have time to recover your fatigue   valoury yes signor carlos and to lose my appetite i hope for the one is as irksome a companion as the other   carlos would my distrestes could be as easily removed as yours  the shade of my departed julia haunts me at every turn and her injured memory calls aloud for vengeance   valoury ah sir if grief or resentment could restore her to life i would starve myself into a passion with pleasure but as that is impossible might i advise you signor i should recommend a temperate meal or two before we proceed any further   carlos temperate valoury can anguish insupportable be temperate listen to the story of my heart  that julia the hapless wife of the imperious count montoni whom thou saw interred at palermo    valoury and a melancholy sight it was signor carlos  i remember i was just sitting down to an excellent barbacue smoking hot when the procession passed the window but so it is whenever a man is upon the point of being happy some cursed thing or other always interferes to chill his prospects   carlos think valoury of an attachment begun almost in childhood and improved with growing years when loves soft wishes were sanctioned by reason and dear expectation nourished by consenting friends   valoury what then was the cause of your losing her   carlos her fathers avarice and ambition this proud indignant lord the count montoni with large possessions and extended power was captivated with my julias blooming charms and do i live to repeat it tore her from me in the moment when she was to have been mine for ever   valoury but how came the lady to consent   carlos there thou have touched the cord of anguish in my breast that drove me from my native home to seek in solitude a calm which alas valoury thy masters heart can never more experience that brings me back again on the wings of rage and vengeance to demand atonement for wrongs too great to be endured  with great energy valoury bless me sir has any thing happened lately   carlos yes from the amiable constantia the only surviving sister of my hapless love i learn by papers found since her decease that the most infernal arts were put in practice by the count and his adherents to bend the timid fair one to their cruel purpose   valoury mercy on me my hair stands on end they hinted too at palermo that the ladys death was sudden and extraordinary   carlos by basest forgery she was induced to believe i had already been wedded to another   valoury to another indeed as if gentlemen of your prudent turn of mind did not think one wife at a time quite sufficient   carlos but the hour of retribution is at hand meanwhile bear this letter to constantia  her father old fractioso is one of the chief magistrates in the city i would on no account that he should hear of my return therefore be careful to deliver it into her own hands   valoury trust it to me signor and dad shall know no more of the business than an exminister does of the cabinet or a fashionable husband of his wifes bedchamber   carlos from her you may learn tidings of my friend hilario whose return from germany i expect about this time and i know notwithstanding her fathers obstinate prohibition constantia is not insensible to his deserts   valoury and a charming gentleman he is would he were here  his cheerfulness would drive away your honors melancholy  sorrow with him is like a bad signet it squeezes the surface but leaves no impression   sound of horns carlos hark here come the falconers with their hawks  we must not be seen retire  be expeditious and meet me at the hotel   valoury at the hotel  ah sir you need not doubt my expedition for sure no love sick girl in europe can be more sharp set than is your honors very hungry humble servant   exeunt severally enter montauban in a falconers dress with hawks etc a train of sportsmen all in

pipes of their wives our hawks they are a gallantie show with rings and feathers so fine the falconer laughs at sports below and cries the air is mine what sportsmen to joys then inferior would stoop when the summit of sporting is hawking la leup la leup enter count montoni count montauban draw near thy activity and diligence are commendable  are the hawks strong and eager   montauban well my lord

count i do not mean to chide thee gentle montauban nor thwart thy amorous pursuits  they may perchance enable thee to do me service   montauban o let me fly to execute your commands   count then thus it is i have reason to suspect that constantia holds secret correspondence with carlos my avowed and mortal foe the man who in lifes childish thoughtless hour stole my wifes affections for whose sake she shunned my embraces and notwithstanding her father forced her to be mine withheld from me a husbands lawful rights and died the sullen vestal she had lived   montauban you astonish me my lord

count did he so i do not wonder at it for indeed i dread his presence aside he has done me signal service and i mean as suits my character and station to give him due reward   montauban your lordships ever bountiful and good   count i thought to have met him here  he will not be tardy to attend  i tremble at the interview  yet how avoid it  it shall be so aside though bernardo is deserving of my warmest gratitude yet the load of obligation bears so hard upon my nature i cannot will not see him face to face till opportunity afford him ample recompense   montauban such ever is the case with noble minds   count do thou go forward  meet him on the way  give him this ring as earnest of my friendship  tell him we shall meet anon  meanwhile he will rest assured my favor shall go hand in hand with his desert to latest life  haste thee good montauban   exit montauban count alone right glad i am this meeting is awhile delayed for though i have gone too far to recede though injured pride and wounded honor demand from the offender due expiation and though i am certain bernardo has used every precaution to secure us from discovery yet such are the weak workings of my mind there is a something which i cannot shake off that makes me shudder at the thought of seeing him  going enter carlos carlos pardon me count montoni if i thus intrude upon your privacy and dare to interrupt your progress   count ha my detested rival aside i see you dare invade the privilege of decorum and intrude upon me like a lawless robber   carlos spare your opprobrious epithet  it recoils upon yourself  who wast that robbed me of my hearts best joy the loved companion of my early years  the allotted partner of my future life who was it that basely practiced on a timid female and in conjunction with a sordid parent led her to pronounce unwilling vows and meanly triumphed over a forced consent   count i scorn your imputation and despise your vanity thus idle coxcombs when their schemes are baffled and the light froth that flatters giddy girls are in more ripened years seen through and slighted they know not how to bear their humbled pride but fly to falsehood and abuse for shelter   carlos infamous evasion   count go  learn to check this habit of conceit learn to endure the freaks of female minds and condescend to think the gallant carlos though in the zenith of his youths career may sometimes suffer from a jilting mistress while men with less desert may prove more fortunate   carlos your levity count montoni is contemptible and your insinuation ungenerous as unjust  did i not soon as i heard the gentle maid had yielded to your solicitation and as i then thought from worldly motives abandoned the heart she once had deigned to prize did i not tear myself from my friends my family my home quit the fond scenes where i had been so blessed and with a bosom bleeding at every pore leave you to the uninterrupted enjoyment of your nuptial happiness   count why then return to brave me unprovoked and interrupt domestic grief my wife is now no more you can no longer plume yourself upon her favor or attack the sacred honor of a husband   carlos heaven grant me patience must i then repeat the wrongs thou have done me and sting thy hardened bosom with reproach   count go on  i am proof against a ruffians foul invective   carlos draws draw then and with thy sword defend what with thy tongue thou can not   count it is well i am prepared else had thy murderous intent been gratified  drawing carlos base slanderer but words are useless i come not to remonstrate but to punish   count have at thee then assassin as thou art   they fight enter bernardo bernardo what do i see my lord  my lord  is this the method to secure your wishes   count bernardo sinks his sword then i must pause  no power on earth but thee could stay my arm   carlos i see you are now protected but mark me count my justice shall not sleep till treachery like thine feel the resentment it deserves   exit count speaking after him take my defiance with thee bernardo thou art welcome indeed thou art i did not think we should have met so soon   bernardo not so soon my lord i came hither by your own appointment   count true i sent a message to thee by montauban but no matter  this rencontre has determined me  we have no time to lose  i had some compunction but now rage and jealousy resume their sway   bernardo let them not transport you too far  we have hitherto proceeded with discretion but caution still is necessary   count the funeral at palermo will lull suspicion   bernardo no doubt my lord it will  but this intruder carlos must be guarded against   count vile miscreant his officious return has fixed my wavering resolution and nervd my trembling hand  tonight at the castle let us meet   bernardo we will my lord   count provide thee a torch  a spade  the dagger shall be mine   bernardo i shall not fail   count gives him a casket my trusty bernardo take this casket it contains

who roars out and drives him off fractioso murder i shall be suffocated  help to turn him out returns and adjusts himself mercy on me there is no security for one either at home or abroad  all the bolts in the world cannot keep a forward girl in the house or hankering fellow out of it   constantia dear papa you do not indeed you do not pursue the right method to secure my duty or your own peace would parents treat their children as friends instead of keeping them at a severe distance the social communication of each others sentiments would enable one party to give better advice and induce

delight wherever they go  fractioso must distract wherever they go    scene iii the outside of an old castle with large gates closed a turret door is visible in the interior of the castle  a hole in the wall that appears to lead to a subterraneous passage  the whole wears an appearance of great antiquity and ruins enter cloddy with a quantity of hares patridges etc cloddy well done cloddy thee didsnt lay thy snares last night for nothing  by the dickens here is as pretty a bunch of preserved property as any justice would wish to see at his table and a pretty round sum it will bring me when i have got it safe housed  for our old rich citizens do so like a titbit especially when it is prohibited  and why should they not they call me a poacher  mayhap so i be  what then  so be other people its my belief as how its a pretty general trade  song  cloddy in poaching all mankind delight late and early prizing dearly every scheme by day or night to wiredraw one another friends to trap the wit will try he tips the wink and cocks his eye and while he looks so woundy sly makes game even of his brother smoke the joke what fool so dull always grinning mouthing chinning  let us quiz his ugly phiz giggling whilst he is grinning  see miss and madam lay their snares painted faces studied graces all for catching unawares flights of gamesome lovers madam plays the harpsicols and squalls affected rigmarols while miss in dancing reels and drolls new steps fer lures discovers head and tail along she will sail down the middle turn and sidle with a hitch and capering itch to the true scotch fiddle od so here is somebody coming i must run into my old hiding place yonder  that hole under the castle wall  it has used to be a rare snug place but of late i have heard so many strange noises near about i fear there be other people hiding as well as myself  rabbit it here they come   retreats into a hole under the wall enter carlos and hilario carlos so my poor friend after the father had generously locked you into his daughters apartment  he cooly turned you neck and heels out of his own street door   hilario faith something very like it or notwithstanding my attachment to your person my love for another persons person would have made me a truant to friendship   carlos impossible   hilario impossible is it that a man should prefer being safe in a warm house playing bopeep with the bright eyes of his mistress to scampering across a cold country for a game at pistols with his friends rival   carlos notwithstanding your pleasantry i am convinced you would go a great way to serve me   hilario yes and not a little way to serve myself  your kindnesses to me and our early friendship will i trust never be forgotten  you certainly stand second  that is after the ladies in my account  but i myself am at the top of the page and you know its the fashion now to take care of number one   carlos true my friend and number one is at present tolerably secure  i have already had a rencontre with this dread adversary   hilario already i hope you are not wounded   carlos sorely   hilario bless me carlos where is it   carlos in the heart hilario  deep  incurable  a surgeons skilful hand may ease the poniards stroke  times healing finger is ineffectual here   hilario i am sorry for it how much kinder the old greybeard is to me  as he totters round me with a grin i whip his scythe from his hand and cut off my sorrows in the middle   carlos enviable vivacity had not relendess fortune marked me for the child of woe i might have shared in all your cheerfulness   hilario my dear friend take comfort  let us return to the city  these desolate old ruins dont seem to promise much entertainment  they have made me grave already   carlos to me the world is all a void  julia my once destined julias lost for ever as they go out a bell tolls in the castle whence came that dismal sound   hilario from that dismal castle i suppose  let us begone  the toll of a bell always makes me nervous   carlos i thought this dreary spot had been uninhabited  who could have occasioned it   hilario who gaffer beelzebub to be sure  who the devil else would live in such a place  i shall retire  he is not fit company for me   carlos perhaps it is some person in distress  some lonely hermit sinking beneath the pressure of disease   hilario or perhaps some robber who having tenderly murdered the lonely hermit kindly resolves to give him christian burial   bell tolls again carlos again  i am resolved to see further into this business   hilario and i am determined to remain totally in the dark  carlos i am off   carlos will you leave me hilario can you desert your friend   hilario what did you say desert you  never  i may be at times a little apprehensive but i never can forsake my friend  was the whole court of lucifer armed against my carlos damme but i would have a tustle with some of the cloven blacklegs   carlos come then  suppose we try whether these antique gates will yield to our attack   hilario move on  if the worst comes to the worst it will be only bringing an old house about our ears  it will not do  old ebony has fastened them with his own claw  trying to open them carlos going toward the place where cloddy is let us search narrowly round the mouldering walls time may perhaps have made some opening in them a light appears softly  do thou observe a light in yonder turret   hilario alarmed a light to be sure i did  the devils are at work  i think we had better leave them to themselves   carlos observing the light mark it moves

murmur of another kind struck upon my ear   carlos what mean you   hilario you shall hear  but come a little further from that cursed cavern you know after having trampt about these diabolical apartments for half an hour together we agreed to separate at the end of a long gallery and took different routs   carlos we did so  and the distant glimmer of light from this lanthorn which i found standing on the pavement led me to the dismal recess where we again met  but proceed    hilario the fact is that old ebony has been more attentive to me than to your worship   carlos will you be

promised me mountains if i would be his but soon i found courtiers were callous to shame and mountains and molehills with them were the same to be spoken for that very night when i was at my favorite amusement listening i heard a rustling of silks upon the staircase there was my spark making love to my ladys maid rigged out in an old cast off of her mistresses so   soon i found courtiers were callous etc ii a widow whose tears were unceasingly shed for her spouse her protector her all that was dead made me wonder the dame should such sorrow survive till i found that she had a kind cousin

to think that my lady julia is not dead   constantia how my sister alive   annette you shall hear  just now as i was standing in the passage thinking of nothing and peeping as i now and then do in a little pocket looking glass who should whisk by me but the count montoni   constantia what of him   annette he looked alarmed and confused and i am convinced he didnt know what he was about   constantia why so   annette because he took no more notice of me than if i had been the meerest dowdy in all messina  so i was determined to go and listen at the door of your fathers library where they were locked up together   constantia well   annette at first i heard some muttering about an old castle and then the words carlos and murder   constantia carlos and murder alas my poor hilario no wonder you are not returned   anette dont be uneasy madam  i am certain no mischief has happened for i heard the old gentleman exclaim julia not dead then carlos must be laid hold of and so maam i ran

great burial was all a flam  and that she was found secreted in an old castle under the protection of signor carlos her first lover who he says aided by constantia and hilario were the authors of the whole contrivance   cloddy odratten i dont believe it  i believe that black dog i used to see on the parapet was the real poacher he and the count depend on it were the knaves that laid the snares

the plots that are carrying on against her at this moment   cloddy oh ho so then i find your great folks can carry on their plots in the dark as well as us little ones   annette yes the old gentleman at the instigation of the count has summoned the city guard to their assistance and ordered the galleys to row round the lighthouse in case carlos and his friend should put off to sea for he has resolved this very night to arrest and convey them to prison come with me brother  there is not a moment to lose   noise without cloddy no  nor a moment to find neither for here are the whole posse at

cannot say i ever doubted you and now i am convinced that constantia  carlos  julia  that damned hilario and all of them have joined in a conspiracy to rob and murder us  for if they bring dead people to life they can soon make live people dead   count you know signor that your daughter julia went to palermo at your own request for change of air it was not then in my power to attend her  news was

understand the exercise   sergeant dont you then well teach it you  come  proceed   they go through the ceremony of relieving guard  hilario does it awkwardly and is left as sentinel on duty sergeant

what is he going to do with that vessel   cloddy i will tell you  he has gotten a house in the remote part of the country among the mountains on the seacoast  and he is going to take his daughter there and all his plate and his jewels and every thing he can carry away   hilario what can be his motive for that   cloddy why they says he dont like the count montoni her husband as well as he was used and they have had words together and i suppose he thinks if he does not secure the property himself the count will do it for him   hilario likely enough  but hasnt he another daughter   cloddy yes but she has no husband to make any claims and to take care that she never shall he has sent her to a convent   hilario to a convent has he   cloddy sure enough  to keep her out of the way of a most mischevous fellow one hilario  do you know him he is the wickedest dog    hilario ay that he is  i know him as well as i do myself  but see here is the old man coming   cloddy there he is an old rogue  leading his daughter to be banished  od rabbit it  sister can know nothing of this flight  i doubt she have been off her listening or she would raise the whole city with her clack  how a name ofortune has he made madam julia consent to go but she is a sweet lady that is the truth on it and as tractable as a staunch pointer   hilario cant you contrive to assist the lady i dare say youre full as clever as youre honest   cloddy i tell you what sentinel  i would do any thing to serve her because why when i accidentally tumbled down once and killed a large covey of partridges she

servant with a traveling cloak and hat fractioso it dont signify talking  you must go and you shall go  and i will have you go  i tell you again between the mad count and the cunning carlos i dont think my life is worth a years purchase   julia had carlos been so inconsiderate as to entertain improper hopes the letter you have just now obliged me to write to him must have extinguished them all  oh sir why did i write but to oblige my father  where do i wish to live and die but under his protecting roof let me not however be torn from my loved sister the partner of my infancy the only companion of my happy days i ever now can cherish   fractioso your sister is safe enough in a cloister  she has no husband to frighten her poor father  dont you remember how fierce the count looked at our last interview he knit his brows and said ough i will have my wife  then you cried   no   no then he replied blood and oons i will have her dowry then i too cried no no  so i am determined to hide both you and the property where they will be safe from a furious husband and an artful lover   julia oh sir consider your distressed child   fractioso yes and i will consider my distressed self  i should not be surprised if they were to try to lock me up likewise in an old castle  therefore dispatch  come on board while there is nobody to interrupt  nay no demurring  who knows but that dog hilario may have made his escape and be now at hand to outwit me   julia must i then renounce every ray of hope oh carlos carlos   fractioso come no crying  go to the boat  anthonio to a servant conduct her on board  give me my sailing cloak and hat  i will but wait for the captain and follow  take those diamonds julia  there i knew you would not be disobedient   gives her a casket julia disobedient alas an implicit submission to your will has brought on your unhappy julia every misfortune of her life   gives her hand to the servant who leads her to the quay fractioso i think there is nothing else but misfortunes when we have to deal with women  loss of property as well as loss of time looking about where can this sea captain be gone to sentinel  to hilario hilario your honor   fractioso trying to put on his cloak have you observed any body waiting here about   hilario helping him i have  give me leave to assist your honor   fractioso thank you friend  who have you observed   hilario two or three stern  looking fellows   fractioso two or three  you alarm me  who were they  what did they say   hilario they enquired if i had seen a little decrepid old gentleman embark on board a vessel   fractioso the devil they did  i am all over in a tremble  i dare say that devil hilario was one of the party  nobody else would have asked such a question   hilario yes he was one  i know him  he is now one of us  he is made a soldier    fractioso that is too good for him  what company is he in   hilario stops putting on his cloak very indifferent at present  hush   fractioso why

see who why you wont let me see any thing   hilario who  the same sterr  looking fellows that were in search of the little decrepid old gentleman  and there  there is that fiend you talked of  that imp of the devil hilario  see they are all with their swords drawn   fractioso frightened i am murdered  i am a dead man music is heard why they have got music   hilario yes to drown your cries  dont

and ship off another to the lord knows where  i have already counteracted the first scheme and hope i shall be in time to prevent the other  ha who is that coming this way it is the wretch bernardo  he seems much agitated   enter bernardo bernardo ungrateful treacherous villain after having hazarded my life in his service to make an attempt upon it himself   annette who made such an attempt good bernardo who could be base enough to attack so precious a life as yours   bernardo who that monster the count montoni   annette what your friend and patron   bernardo the same  finding me resolved no longer to assist his criminal designs against the lady julia and her father and dreading my discoverery of the past he would have secured my silence by the daggers point   annette that is one way indeed of making one hold ones tongue   bernardo i luckily averted the blow and would have avenged it but the disappointed assassin took refuge in a boat that was waiting for him on the beach and has i suppose fled his country for ever   annette in my mind his country is very much obliged to him it would be lucky if all countries could get rid of their secret enemies in the same way   bernardo i am determined now to make every atonement in my power   annette indeed i think it is high time  so then my friend your assertion respecting the guilt of carlos was a mistake and the business at that old castle was    bernardo o name it not  horror and remorse overwhelm me  would i could see signor fractioso he knows not that carlos whom he despised and rejected has been the savior of his daughters life   fractioso peeps through a hole in the centry box annette none but such an obstinate simpleton as my master could have been so imposed upon   bernardo he has been deceived  grossly deceived   annette oh he is always made a fool of  he ought to be locked up in some place for life   fractioso peeps again enter cloddy laughing cloddy ha ha ha  sister  sister  help me to laugh a little  ha ha ha   annette mocking ha ha ha  you dont seem to want any help  what is the matter wiseacre   cloddy i will tell you  you see that ship  old fractioso hired it to carry his daughter and the rest of his goods and chattels to the black mountains and intended to go with them himself  well the lady and the things are on board the wind fills the mainmast huzza there goes a farewell gun gun fires but instead of the old gentleman who the devil do you think has taken his place   fractioso why the devil himself   cloddy no but a near relation of his  hilario   fractioso gives him a blow on the back with his fist through the hole then roars out with his head through it and kicks against the door furiously till he bursts it open fractioso you villain  holloa stop the ship  save my property that is all i care for  holloa  roaring and stamping enter constantia constantia how has this happened sir   fractioso out of my way jezabel  i dare say you are as bad as the rest   running about frantic annette how came you out of the way when a man carried off your daughter   fractioso would he had carried you all off so that he had taken nothing else   annette o fie that is not at all like my poor old grandmother   fractioso running about in a storm of passion curse your poor old grandmother  there they go  but i will be after them  you knave you minion of that rascally count seizing bernardo come with me  get into a ship and if you overtake that vessel i will save your life  if not i will erect a gallows and hang you and myself too  and you you poaching dog you shall make one of the bunch   exit taking bernardo with him and trying to seize cloddy who escapes cloddy noa  noa  thankee for the offer  an i do swing i should like to have the whole tree to myself   exit on the other side annette well madam  it is lucky i contrived to get you out of the convent  my talent of listening has been of service to us all  though i little thought your father was rivalling me in my own art  he has overheard bernardos full confession of the counts guilt  and i should hope the old gentleman is not quite out of his mind   constantia but what is become of poor carlos you said when you delivered him my sisters letter    annette ah the one her barbarous father forced her to write to him   constantia forced indeed annette  twas the only alternative he left her to save herself from being again committed to the power of her tyrant husband   annette when carlos read the cruel mandate commanding him never to think of her more  oh i shall never forget him  he paused  then read it again  then tore himself away saying he would seek refuge in some happier clime   constantia i trust his friend hilario knows of his retreat   enter montauban  hastily montauban lady if you have any pity for your father you will hasten to the quay he is at this moment engaging a vessel to sail he knows not where and is so outrageous i believe none but yourself can quiet him   constantia i will go to him directly  come annette   annette certainly  mam  all these disasters are brought upon us by that detestable count your master to bernardo husbands indeed i should never think of such wretches  and if ever montauban you attempt to put your wife down into a cellar let me advise you to beware of your own upper story  come madam   exit with constable montauban true it is i was a firm adherent to the count so long as i thought him an honorable patron  now justice to myself demands that i should withdraw my services from one so treacherous and unprincipled   song  montauban vain are

amongst those ruinated places by the sea snore  well if as how i had not been in the way he would have gone near to have died for it  this duelling is a sad thing amongst gentlefolks though it seems to gain ground now amongst people who are no gentlefolks  i think i hear somebody approaching  pray heaven it be none of the robbers who infest this part of our calabrian coast  thof they can get nothing from such a poor fellow as me   enter valoury  hastily valoury o lord where am i i believe i am safe at last  no i am not  here is another of them  forgive me my sins ah sir sweet beautiful

you for a footpad to be sure  no i dont  i take you for a gentleman an honorable gentleman but a burnt child you know    fisherman what have you too been hurt there is a poor wounded signor hard by that i have been taking care of for some days past   valoury a wounded signor what is he called   fisherman i think i saw on the back of a letter he is always reading the name of carlos   valoury carlos what carlos he that is in love with the lady julia  he that is the rival of the count montoni  he that is master to the sweetest and best looking servant that ever had an appetite  where is he let me see him  i am his faithful follower  and have come here on purpose to make him laugh and be merry   fisherman then you are come to very little purpose he is wounded both in body and mind  i fear in spite of my skill he will not be long above water   valoury above water why what is the matter what has happened   fisherman all i know you shall hear  returning from fishing the other evening i saw land out of an open boat two men of decent appearance  more so than either you or i   valoury surveying himself speak for yourself if you please  but go on   fisherman i overheard one say this retired place will suit the other replied it will  and the event will prove who best deserved her well they walked into a wood  i followed to see what it all meant  directly they drew their swords and after a round or two one unknown gentleman fell and the other fled leaving him for dead   valoury and the other was the count beyond all doubt  oh the butcher but where is my poor master show me to him   fisherman i am only going down to the shore to prepare my tackle ready for the next tide and if you will follow me in a few minutes i will direct you to where the poor gentleman passes most of his time he is sadly out of sorts that is the truth of it but my skill perhaps may do something   exit valoury alone i will fated master wounded both in body and mind  however i will raise my own

remains of a beautiful arch is seen in the middle through which the sea is disernible carlos discovered writing on a stone part of the ruins  his arm bound up carlos here died carlos who lived but for julia  that is my epitaph  there the pensive moralist or chance wanderer may read the little story of my fate those who loved me will shed a tear of recollection to my memory those who but professed it may pass the stone unmoved  oh julia could i have believed you would have used me thus takes out a letter can it be her hand it is it is  alas what can so deeply wound the heart or so fatally unstring each nerve of life as coldness and ingratitude from the object on which all our hopes are centered   enter valoury valoury there he is  bless me how changed can that be my once gallant master sir signor heaven be praised we are met once more sir   carlos we are and perhaps for the last time my faithful valoury  your are come to lay your masters ashes in the silent tomb  look there   pointing to ruins valoury looking there  why what is that hole surely it is not a grave   carlos why not what place so proper to terminate my woes times beckoning hand amid these mouldering ruins seems to invite decaying nature here to seek her last repose   valoury mercy forbid   carlos here is my death blow  fixed  determined  all will soon be over shows julias letter see  it is julias hand  it is she has sealed my doom   valoury dear sir dont mind what the ladies write  do let me lead you to the fishermans hut  think how much more comfortable even that will be than to remain amongst these broken bits of stone so hard that not even an ostrich could digest them   carlos valoury observe my final request  i thought ere this to have met the triumph of my toils but lingering strength still keeps me on the brink of fate  despair must speed the blow aside when you shall behold me disfigured motionless and pale when that cold house shall take its tenant in convey this stone to the spot  strew some damp earth on your departed master then fix the monument and turn away   valoury lord your honor dont talk so dolefully   carlos one thing beside should chance conduct the fair one to these lonely ruins point out the undeckt stone tell her one tear will not degrade her honor or incense  i can no more  my eyes grow dim  my strength fails   sinks on valourys shoulder valoury alas my dear master i am like an april day i wish to smile but am forced to weep my faithful services were acceptable when you was happy i hope they will be doubly useful now in your distress a ship appears in sight and salutes  it must be the same vessel that sailed from the quay in  st scene there sir  do you hear that do cheer up a little  who knows but that vessel may bring you comfort   carlos what comfort can it bring to me misfortune has clouded all my youthful prospects and flattering hope beamed forth one transient ray only to fix a gloom more permanent   sailors shout without valoury hear your honor how joyous they are  no doubt they are friends   carlos perhaps not noise and uproar are often the forerunners of vice and profligacy  let us retreat however and shelter ourselves behind these ivyd towers   they retire behind ruins enter hilario and julia followed by sailors hilario away you rogues  away you have steered right and i have rewarded you exeunt sailors so our person is arrived and all our movables are safe  well charming lady is not this better than the black mountains they say carlos is in this part of the coast  it would have been full as gallant if he had come down to the strand to receive our person on landing   julia alas i know not why  my heart forbodes some new misfortune i shudder at the recollection of the unfeeling letter my father forced me to write to him  why did the country people tell us he was buried among these ruins   hilario only a figurative expression as we authors term it he was always fond of poking in odd holes and corners so the bumkins call it burying himself alive  carlos holloa carlos calling and looking round gad was ever lady in so whimsical a situation her lover hid amongst piles of old rubbish and her father locked up in a watchbox  carlos car  hah what the devils here an epitaph reads here died carlos who  dead why it is  o lord oh ho ho   falls on a stone julia what is the matter sir are you not well   hilario

is dead screaming almighty powers the measure of my woes is now complete   hilario have patience dearest lady   julia even this i could have borne hilario had your friends dying moments witnessed my unshaken constancy and ever growing love  but to suppose me base perfidious  with his last breath perhaps to curse  oh it is too much i cannot support it   hilario madam i have little comfort to bestow  yet let me say that grief when tempered with reason honors alike the living and the dead   julia more agitated here will i pass my drooping hours of life and weary heaven with prayers for carlos   clasps her hands in a kind of frenzy hilario trying to raise her rise hapless lady  be advised   julia with wild resignation and trying to get up yes  let me rise  superior to my fate let me assert the rights of nature  no brutal lord no tyrant father shall restrain me more  yes carlos i loved you living  i revere your memory  you early taught my heart to feel and its last pulse shall beat for you   exit enter carlos and valoury from the ruins carlos then am i blessed indeed  my cares are flown and joy and rapture fill my heart anew   hilario jumping about and kicking down the

new calamity   fractoiso be quiet  i say i have proofs  damned proofs  i have seen my sweet soninlaw that was  heard bernardo confront him  i have taxed him myself and by my famous crossexamining talents i have drawn out the whole truth the count is no more married to my daughter than he is to me  the ceremony was a base deception upon us all  he had got another wife before   hilario huzza and i suppose he has as many castles as wives to conceal them in   fractioso will nobody stop that fellows mouth i tell you i have delivered him over to the hands of justice and julia is her own mistress
