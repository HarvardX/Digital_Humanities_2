the strangers at home a comic opera in three acts as performed at the theater royal in drury lane  tableau  london printed for harrison and co no   paternoster row mdcclxxxvi  to his royal highness the prince of wales sir it being peculiarly the business of a dramatic writer to select those popular topics upon which he is assured of having the public voice with him it might naturally be expected that after receiving your royal highnesss gracious permission to lay this dramatic essay at your feet i should eagerly have availed myself of the opportunity thus given me of expatiating on those manners talents and virtues which constitute so general a theme of admiration but minds truly conscious of meriting praise are ever reserved and delicate in accepting it and perhaps your royal highness will not suffer a sincere acknowledgment of merit because the panegyric of princes has been too often stained with adulation  restrained by this consideration i must content myself with offering my humble acknowledgments for the honor conferred on me in the countenance of my feeble endeavors to cultivate an elegant art which so eminently boasts the protection of your royal highness  i am with the most profound respect your royal highnesss most obedient and most devoted servant james cobb london feb         advertisement the author of the strangers at home would think himself guilty of great injustice if at a moment when the piece is so highly honored by the public approbation he should forget how much of that approbation he owes to the abilities of the performers all of whom so kindly interested themselves in its success to mr king he has peculiar obligations for the care and attention with which he superintended the rehearsals of the opera and to that gentlemans judicious criticisms he is likewise highly indebted although it might be superfluous for the author to add his praises to those which the public have so liberally and deservedly bestowed on mr linleys

at the door   regnalto by no means you know my suspicions of aldobrand with whom i left the charge of my sister and my house i am resolved to remain concealed till i can satisfy those suspicions   laurence but may not i satisfy my hunger in the mean while sir   regnalto have a little patience   laurence ah sir patience is a bad physician he has worn me to a skeleton already if i dont change my doctor he will soon make a dreadful change in me but here comes the algerine captain who brought us over   enter montano regnalto noble ibrahim i thank heaven that i am at length arrived where i may be enabled properly to acknowledge that benevolence whose rays illumined our night of slavery nay start not are you surprised to find gratitude among the christian virtues   montano no my generous friend wide as the sun darts his beams he finds that precious jewel which decks alike the turban and the cross   regnalto then let me express the grateful sentiments i feel    montano it will be sufficient that you suffer me to remain unknown and unnoticed in this city  exit montano regnalto we must hasten to offer our respects to the generous octavio   laurence i had much rather offer my respects to a wellcovered table we shall be in better spirits after supper my gratitude will grow stronger as my stomach gets fuller   regnalto away no trifling we must pay our compliments where they are due  exit laurence well sir if it must be so i will follow you presently though mine i fear will be but empty compliments  ha here comes our fellowcaptive firelock the english soldier that merry old fellow whose jests and songs made us so often forget our sorrows  enter firelock once more welcome to european ground my old son of fun and frolic   firelock aye my boy and a son who has never dishonored his family it is only your common dull metal that rusts with the breath of care and misfortune the high polish of mirth and good humor always cast off the envenomed damp   laurence and did you really never meet with any misfortune which obliged you to complain   firelock faith i never remember lamenting but two misfortunes in my whole life one that i was not at the prussian review and the other that i had not the honor of being among the brave fellows besieged in gibraltar  but that is all over now however i hope i shall yet live to fight for my country   laurence i am going to return thanks to signor octavio   firelock so shall i as soon as i am dressed   laurence dressed   firelock aye i hardly dare call myself an englishman while i wear the badges of slavery our noble captain ibrahim has kindly presented me with the very clothes in which i was taken by the algerines so within an hour you shall see me in that character which commands respect in every part of the world  a british soldier  and then i shall want nothing but a mistress to make me completely happy   laurence they you know are to be purchased every where   firelock aye but i would as soon think of buying a friend as a mistress always barter love for love and friendship for friendship for egad when either of the commodities are put up to sale depend upon it they are not worth buying however i dont despair of making myself pretty well understood by some kind florentine girl or other love i take it is an universal language much the same in most countries   laurence but you will remember it is a language in which the oldest scholars are not generally the greatest proficients   firelock i understand you young man but i fear nothing i am a mixture of spring and autumn old time and i have had so long a battle that he has given up the point at last and left me master of the field besides if even a mistress should be coy i have yet my bottle to comfort me  air in vain whining lovers their cupid shall prize and boast that his godships derived from the skies though divine was the birth of the young god of love our bacchus we know was the son of great jove let us number loves votries i think we can prove that though all the world drink it is not all the world love when malicious young cupid oerwhelms us with grief in the comforts of bacchus we find sure relief though chloe disdainful deny you her charms when glowing with rapture you rush to her arms pay your court to a bumper and there you will find a gay smiling mistress eternally kind nay when chilling age like bleak winter comes on and the sunshine of beauty and love shall be gone still constant your bumper will smile to the end and supply both the places of mistress and friend let us number loves votries i think we can prove that though all the world drink it is not all the world love  scene a room in regnaltos house enter aldobrand and viola aldobrand there are all the people in florence out at their windows gaping at this scurvy procession of slaves tinkle but an old brass shovel in the streets of this city and the inhabitants will swarm like bees at the sound one would think there was a triumph for some victory today   viola and what can be a nobler triumph than the triumph of humanity what a nobler victory than that of freedom over slavery   aldobrand psha dont tell me selfpreservation is the first tie of nature   viola but is it the only tie sir   aldobrand charity should begin at home   viola and should charity end at home too   aldobrand certainly you would not have me turn charity out of doors she keeps house with sober decent people and only goes astray with such spendthrifts as octavio  by the bye viola octavio has invited us to his house today   viola to his house sir aside  how my heart beats and do you mean that we should accept of his invitation   aldobrand why yes for once in a way  we are to meet signor lucilio and his wife laura there aside  laura is a charming creature   viola i am astonished sir   aldobrand dont be alarmed i will take care to watch octavio for i suppose he will teaze you with a parcel of stuff that he is dying for love of you and    viola do you really think he will   aldobrand oh yes these rakish young dogs begin to make love the moment they see a woman just as naturally as you would say pretty pol to a parrot but you must not answer him   viola perhaps then he will think that my silence gives consent   aldobrand frown at him as you do at me when i make love to you and i will be hanged if he mistakes your silence for consent then  exit viola well signor aldobrand since you teach me the lesson of dissimulation you must even take the consequences  air since you teach me dear sir the art of deceiving you surely can never take it ill if while with attention your lessons receiving on yourself i should practice my skill and when of your own wit the dupe i have made you all doubts of your art twill remove for you cannot but esteem it a compliment paid you to show you how much i improve so doting parents often have smiled at mischief from a favorite child and viewed with fond exulting joy the growing genius of the boy who gives poor hodges awkward bow and shows you how he goes to plough hits off the vicars vacant stare wry faces makes behind his chair then slily mocks the parsons quaffing while they almost expire with laughing soon panting for satiric fame our little master seeks new game and tired of laughing at the guest on host and hostess breaks his jest the fathers gouty steps takes off his purblind eyes and winters cough nor can mammas pert smiling leer escape the wicked urchins sneer while giggling servants raptured sit to see how well the little wit now apes the simpers of mamma then coughs and hobbles like papa  reenter aldobrand with fabio aldobrand fabio this prodigal fool octavio has ransomed another parcel of slaves from algiers   fabio yes the procession has disturbed the whole city   aldobrand and this is called generosity for my part fabio i think such doings should not be tolerated when fate has thought fit to send a man into slavery i think it is flying in the face of fate to release him from his situation   fabio your reasoning is very just sir   aldobrand fabio i never hear of a released captive but i think of regnalto if by any ill luck he should find his way back to florence    fabio impossible sir you know i have assured you    aldobrand why yes you have assured me but you must know friend fabio i dont think that telling truth is your forte  however run and view this new cargo of slaves bring me but a true account of regnaltos not being among them and i will compound with you for a months lying afterward  exit fabio enter alice well alice any news of the worthy regnalto   alice alas no sir   aldobrand ah  nor of your husband   alice no sir i have heard nothing of poor laurence aside  the old wretch shall not discover that i have seen him   aldobrand my poor friend i must give a tear to humanity   alice certainly sir aside  it costs you nothing or else you would not give that   aldobrand now to our own concerns  do you know alice i have resolved to take viola with me to visit octavio   alice to visit laura you mean i find she is to be of the party   aldobrand ha ha  why i dont think laura has been insensible to my amorous glances  only i have never yet had an opportunity of explaining myself   alice aside  an old fool  i will turn this to violas account lord sir what a turk you are among the women marrying a young girl of eighteen and seducing a married woman of twenty at the same time i declare i should not expect it from you   aldobrand psha psha the older a man grows the better use he should make of his time  but tell me alice how can i contrive to get a private interview with laura  suppose in some disguise let me tell you disguise is very useful to us men of gallantry   alice no bad thought sir  what say you to the dress of a monk it will not be the first time that garb has covered designs as pious as yours   aldobrand a monks habit  zounds a man might as well make love in his shroud it is a monument erected to signify the decease of human frailty   alice oh no sir it will only like other monuments point out where the remains are deposited  but sir you know a little money will be necessary for this business   aldobrand money   alice certainly sir generosity is the only test of a lovers being in earnest  air a fig for all your whining stuff fine speeches sweet as honey of love you cannot give proof enough except you give your money were i your mistress faith and troth your avarice soon would lose me for compliments are but mere froth  you must good sir excuse me of all the arrows love can boast the golden ones are best sir and he who boldly bids the most can never be in jest sir it is true that i make rather free but faith you shall not refuse me so draw your pursestrings now do you see  or else you must excuse me  aldobrand giving her money but egad i run a great hazard here  indeed it is true i have no other means to get at laura than by risquing viola in octavios house but then i must depend on your watchful care over her alice   alice trust to me sir   aldobrand if the young slut should dare to listen to him  if she should forget herself so far as to    alice follow her own inclinations as you do her crime would certainly be of the blackest dye   aldobrand psha but you know the weakness and inexperience of young girls   alice for which reason their faults are to be more severely punished well i admire the men who while they are continually boasting a superiority of understanding very modestly reserve to themselves the privilege of committing acts of folly with impunity  exeunt scene an apartment in octavios house enter regnalto and laurence laurence lord sir we have waited a great while to see signor octavio i dare say he will excuse our going now ceremony i am told is quite out of fashion with great folks   regnalto what would you quit his house without thanking him for your liberty do you not feel the warmth of gratitude for so inestimable a gift  air grief thy tyrant reign is over now i tread my native shore mirth fair freedoms sister guest shall impart her choicest zest to each flask of generous wine gaily offered at her shrine see the sparkling glass goes round care avaunt it is hallowed ground  laurence i think humility should teach us that to wait among the servants is the properest situation for us  i hear them now at supper sir and as we are but slaves    regnalto slaves the noble octavio will receive us as friends   laurence then sir for that very reason we should go to supper  when a generous man entertains his friends at his own house he is always best pleased to see them eat heartily   regnalto peace here comes octavio  enter octavio generous octavio we owe you thanks which language can never express   octavio silence sir will be the most acceptable eloquence on that subject your mien and deportment bespeak you of no vulgar rank   laurence aside he says nothing of my mien and deportment  octavio and regnalto converse aside octavio do not mistake me i have not the smallest wish to know any thing you may desire to conceal no one is under restraint here as long as it suits your convenience make this your home and accept in the mean time whatever my house affords   laurence thank you my lord i wish we had known as much before perhaps we should have made free i am sure i should but to night we sup at signor regnaltos though i think a little snack before supper   regnalto frowns octavio to regnalto what were you acquainted with regnalto   laurence yes my lord and he had a very great regard for him too or i am much mistaken   octavio perhaps then you know his sister   regnalto alas sir i fear she has forgotten me it is ten years ago since i held the little prattler on my knee   laurence and now i suppose signor octavio would be glad in turn to hold the little prattler on his knee   octavio alas had viola a parent living there would be no longer any obstacle to our happiness but to have my hopes blasted thus by an avaricious guardian   air when prudence opposes the dictates of love a parent may fairly our choice disapprove it is kind then to save us from what would enslave us to tell us the tale of experience with truth and check by advice the wild sallies of youth but when prudence smiles on the soft nuptial band and affection and reason are joined hand in hand with hymens torch lighted our mutual faith plighted alas how severe is fates partial decree that cruelly tears me my charmer from thee sir i will confer on you what to the noble mind is one of the most acceptable favors  an opportunity of showing your gratitude i love signora viola here is a letter in which i propose that she should fly with me this evening from the power of the wretch with whom her unsuspecting brother too hastily entrusted her this letter you shall do me the favor to deliver   laurence aside a mighty pretty employ my master has got into   octavio i have invited aldobrand to bring the charming viola with him today but as i hardly expect any success from that scheme this letter is my last resource   enter servant servant the captain of the ship from algiers sir begs to speak with you  exit octavio adieu i will not offend your zeal to serve me by urging that secresy on which my success depends  exit regnalto laurence   laurence sir   regnalto this is rather a singular situation   laurence not at all sir nothing can be more regular when a lover thinks of marrying his mistress her nearest relation should always be one of the first persons consulted on the business  but here comes my dear alice   regnalto dont discover who i am laurence   laurence i wont sir i will not  how her eyes sparkle while she is looking for me   regnalto enquire after my sister   laurence i will sir  pretty rogue  pretty rogue   regnalto i am very impatient    laurence yes sir so am i   enter alice alice ah my poor laurence  embracing him   laurence poor indeed alice  i  i  well and how do you do i had a thousand things to say to you but they are all jumbled together and like a great crowd trying to get out of the playhouse they press on one another till they quite choke up the passage   alice you are wasted away prodigiously   laurence aye i am not the man i was alice   alice i am very sorry for it laurence   laurence when you and i parted i was as plump as good living and laughing could make me but now i may indeed say  my wife is my better half  regnalto pulls his sleeve and pray how does your young lady do  pretty little soul she    alice why i will tell you  but i see we are not alone who is that   laurence a brother captive of mine he is both deaf and dumb so you may say what you will before him   regnalto aside the rogue has not lost his old knack at invention   alice la what a pity it is that such a welllooking man should have any deficiencies   laurence but tell me how is your young lady   alice as well as any poor girl can be when she is doomed to marry a miserly old guardian who tells her forsooth that she shall find a father in him   regnalto aside an old villain   laurence well alice and do you think there so any thing so much amiss in a husbands becoming a father   alice signor regnalto he says has certainly died in slavery  now i think of it can you tell me any news of our old master   laurence i cannot indeed alice so dont ask me any thing about him   alice poor man gone i suppose i am sorry for him   laurence we shall never have such another master   alice no never he was the most good tempered creature one of the best men in the world for a servant to live with so easily cheated   laurence easily cheated no no alice that is too much   alice nay laurence i am sure you know it as well as any body living how many bottles of his best wine did you drink and made him believe the rats got into the cellar and eat away the corks   laurence lord lord   regnalto aside i shall make some interesting discoveries   laurence not another word alice   alice why what the deuce are you afraid of you may be sure a dumb man cannot make any words about the matter   regnalto aside to laurence it is lucky for you sirrah that you have deprived me of my speech   alice heyday  what can he whisper   laurence no but he makes a queer comical kind of a noise which i who am used to him can understand as well as if he spoke ever so distinctly   alice and what does he mean   laurence why to let me know he is hungry as i am and in faith it is no wonder considering how long it is since we tasted roastmeat let us take him home with us alice you will find him a mighty agreeable companion he will never contradict you   alice i declare he seems as if he understood every word we say   laurence oh he is very intelligent i can teach him any thing  but come never did soldier long more for conquest than i do to attack my supper  my dear alice well be as merry as love and good wine can make us  exeunt enter octavio and montano octavio heavens montano what a difference must this algerine habit make in you when even i did not discover you who but three years ago was the most intimate friend you had in florence   montano but laura    octavio inconsolable for your loss she sequestered herself from the world for some time   montano that was kind   octavio at length however to the surprise of every one after slighting the first noblemen in florence she suddenly married a young stranger   montano a stranger   octavio named lucilio gentle yet lively in his manners in his person an adonis in miniature   montano do not oppress me with his praises rather say that he is base unworthy  that my sword    octavio hold montano i conjure you by our friendship  lucilio and laura are here consider this house is their sanctuary retire but for a moment you shall see laura presently nay you shall even speak to her  i beg only a moments delay  montano and octavio retire enter laura and rosa laura oh rosa this uncertainty of my montanos fate like the torturing arts of medicine protracts my unhappy life but too long   rosa upon my word madam you must think me a very complaisant husband thus to make me the confidante of your affection for another   laura you are a strange girl however i must own it was a lucky thought for me which suggested this scheme of calling you my husband to get rid of the importunities of my lovers   rosa yes really and lucky for me too from your humble companion in petticoats to become your lord and master in breeches  i am sure i may truly say marriage has made a man of me   laura but hear me rosa   rosa rosa  you forget that i am your husband aye and so kind and so indulgent too am not i the best of husbands laura sighs ah you will never know my value till you have got your beloved signor montano and then you will soon find the difference between us   laura you trifler   rosa however though we may forget ourselves in private let us at least take care to behave like husband and wife in public that is no more than many married couples oblige themselves to do but seriously my dear madam is it possible you can doubt montanos constancy duty and reason will secure    laura duty and reason when opposed to love  oh rosa  air in vain when with the fatal dart unerring in his aim the little archer wounds the heart does reason urge her claim the powerful sun of beautys eyes beams forth too bright a ray she thaws cold duty with her sighs and reason melts away  octavio and montano come forward octavio to laura my friend ibrahim is lately from algiers madam  introduces montano then walks apart with rosa laura i  i  had a friend carried to that part of the world sir for whom i am much interested   montano aside  how guilt flushes her cheeks i knew him well madam   laura you knew him  a  his name was    montano aside zounds i forgot to wait for my name   laura montano a native of florence   montano montano  he  he  was my friend madam   laura then you can tell me news of him aside  now for life or death   montano he is no longer considered as a christian slave he has taken the turban i myself saw him last in the algerine habit   laura heaven and earth   montano i have heard him often repeat the name of laura   laura indeed  you distress me sir   montano montano loved her once loved her as the slave who now adores her  seizing lauras hand laura you are bold sir   montano and is that madam a fault in the estimation of a lady   laura i have a husband sir who will answer whether it ought not to be so in mine  signor octavio a word with you  walks aside with octavio rosa comes forward montano and do you sir take upon you to chastise every one who dares to love that lady   rosa not i upon my soul sir it would be a very troublesome office besides it is too flattering to my vanity to have my wife universally beloved    montano she was beloved by montano did you know him sir   rosa montano montano  oh the man who went one afternoon to fish in the mediterranean and was himself caught by an algerine rover   montano did you know montano young sir   rosa oh yes sir i recollect he had the vanity to be my rival poor man i ought not to abuse him for i owe him infinite obligations for the merriment laura and i have so often had at his expense   montano sdeath sir you dare not repeat what you say   rosa really sir i dont desire it tautology in conversation is very disagreeable   montano if montano were here    rosa why if he were sir i should certainly pity the poor devil to be laughed at by a successful rival would be intolerable and really i could not help it  ha ha ha  air when first i began sir to ogle the ladies and prattle soft nothings as a pretty fellows trade is while with rapturous praises i dwelt on each feature if i stole a sly kiss twas  fye you wicked creature but soon in tones lower and softer and sweeter halfpleasd they would whisper  fye fie you wicked creature indeed my attractions no gallantry needed each evening still conquests to conquests succeeded perplexed how so many fond claims i should parry to settle all disputes i resolved faith to marry then pressed lovely laura in language still sweeter till blushing she whispered  im yours you wicked creature  montano harke signor lucilio i will not hear montano insulted with impunity i shall walk by the riverside two miles from the city at six tomorrow morning you understand me sir   rosa aside  a pretty scrape i am got into  perfectly sir you find the air from the water beneficial to your health   montano insulting coward draw instantly   rosa looking round and perceiving octavio approach to part them zounds sir with all my heart this is not to be borne  signor octavio nothing but the respect i bear you prevents my punishing that boaster as he deserves your presence protects him from my rage aside to laura  let us be gone i am frightened out of my wits   octavio signor lucilio i am concerned for my friends warmth   rosa as to that sir i am very happy you interfered i declare i tremble to think what might have been the consequence   laura signor octavio what has passed will i am sure plead my apology for begging your permission to retire   quartetto laura good signor you will excuse me  pray dont my dear refuse me lucilio let us go rosa laura you must excuse me  satisfaction you shall not refuse me before i go octavio good signor you will excuse me pray dont my friend refuse me  hold sir you must excuse me  pray good lucilio go laura be by your reason aided why will not you be persuaded hear me come your passion smother for this you will thank me some day or other lucilio let us go  signor octavio with thanks to you sir adieu adieu sir  lucilio let us go rosa no i will not be persuaded  hear me  eh well then my passion i will try to smother adieu signor i go  but i shall find sir some time or other for a private word or so octavio why will not you be persuaded hear me hold before a lady your anger smother  pray good lucilio go you may you know find some

in the other laurence tell the cook to make haste alice i like my victuals rather under done   alice you have been used to eat your meat rare i suppose   laurence yes the meat that came to my share in algiers was very rare indeed  not above once a month   alice and how did they treat you laurence tell me all about it   laurence they treated me with my board to be sure  to sleep on i mean a scarcity of bread and water and plenty of stripes and hard labor for my part i had rather pay my own way in florence than be treated so by the best algerine of em all   alice pray laurence had your master many wives   laurence wives aye in every hole and corner of his house they ran about like rabbits in a warren   alice and did not you turn poacher now and then and snap up a stray rabbit  eh laurence   laurence not i indeed i had a much keener appetite for a fat capon  hunger is a bitter enemy to gallantry  besides the infidels have ways of keeping their wives to themselves which we have not yet attained   alice by making slaves of them  thank my stars that odious fashion does not prevail in christendom   laurence no the matter is just reversed with us in all christian countries the wives keep their husbands in subjection  but here comes madam viola   enter viola viola honest laurence i am rejoiced to see you once more at home   laurence thank ye maam  i am much rejoiced to see myself

the men the least said about them is the best and as for their manners egad i never was treated with so much illmanners by any other set of people before or since   viola laurence you are released

from octavio and makes signs of secresy a letter opening it hastily and from octavio reading dearest viola our situation must plead my excuse for the proposal i thus abruptly offer tomorrow is to make

arabia and sold to a chief of the wild arabs   regnalto aside a pretty journey these good people have marked out for me   fabio and i dare say by this time he is as expert at robbing a caravan as the best freebooter among them   aldobrand then he has traveled to some end fabio   fabio yes sir and i hope that will be the end of his travels   aldobrand with all my heart give dummy a bumper to that

signor lucilio ten thousand thanks for this honor believe me i am heartily glad to see you   rosa i am come signor aldobrand to request your advice and assistance in a matter of great moment to me   aldobrand i am sure i shall be particularly happy    rosa i know you are a man of gallantry    aldobrand aside egad i am sorry for that   rosa and therefore i wish for your counsel  but are we out of hearing   aldobrand as snug as a conclave of cardinals   rosa give me leave to ask you what measures do you think i ought to pursue with the man who has dared to make love to my wife   aldobrand a  a  aside  oh that i were but safe out of the room why surely  is it possible that    rosa possible why not sir is not laura handsome enough to be an object of temptation   aldobrand upon my soul i think so sir dont mistake me aside  what shall i say to him   rosa when i consider the nature of the affront    aldobrand but consider at the same time good signor how liable we all are to frailty temptation is an enemy who wrestles with us through life growing stronger as we grow weaker and if youth cannot resist him it is not to be wondered at that he should easily trip up an old mans heels   rosa i am resolved to punish him severely   aldobrand aside  i shall be exposed to all florence are there no apologies which you could be prevailed on to receive   rosa what apologies can he offer after having had the assurance to threaten my life    aldobrand aside i threaten his life  what the devil does he mean now   rosa the presumption to challenge me to single combat   aldobrand challenge you  upon my veracity i never dreamt of such a thing   rosa yes the haughty algerine dared me to measure swords with him   aldobrand the haughty algerine   rosa ibrahim the commander of the vessel last from algiers   aldobrand aside  i am restored to life give me your hand my dear signor lucilio well have the scoundrel hanged drawn quartered flayed and carbonaded  a dog a rascal a villain  a  such an abominable attempt   rosa but how shall we manage my dear friend i have every thing to dread from him while he is at liberty you are a magistrate and can assist me   aldobrand he shall be thrown into prison in two hours time   rosa will that be strictly legal   aldobrand legal aye to be sure if it can serve a friend laws were made for the benefit of society and are not our friends the very flower of society   rosa but let us be careful not to infringe the strict letter of the law   aldobrand aye that is a true oracle always doubtful in it is meaning we lawyers are the priests and who so proper to expound it as we who make it the letter of the law reminds me of a fanciful cloud in a summer sky though no two persons can agree in what it really represents you may look at it till you make what you will of it   rosa and yet how beautiful are those clouds when gilded by the sun of equity   aldobrand psha psha when the clouds gather fast the sun of equity as you call it sometimes finds it a devilish hard task to shine through them but come let us to business we have not a moment to lose i will dispatch the officers of justice after this ibrahim and they will seize him the instant they set eyes on him   rosa well signor aldobrand i perceive you improve on the poets who represent justice as blind you kindly remove the band from her eyes that she may distinguish objects clearly   aldobrand modern justice is only blind to the faults of her friends   rosa and what does she do with her sword   aldobrand reserves that for their enemies   rosa ha ha ha  then her scales only remain to be disposed of   aldobrand which are too useful to be parted with they are for the receipt of fees one scale for the plaintiff and the other for the defendant of course you know that which is best filled makes the other kick the beam  and so much for justice  exeunt scene the house of octavio enter octavio and alice octavio well alice then the charming viola is permitted by her guardian to visit this house today you may depend on my gratitude   alice i will sir though i own it is not a quality on which generally speaking i place the greatest dependence   octavio surely you do not doubt it is existence you do not think it a mere phantom   alice why really sir my experience has taught me that gratitude is something like a ghost every body talks of it but nobody sees it appear   octavio as to that i can easily conjure up the apparition  giving her a purse how do you like it   alice oh i admire your spirit i assure you sir it could not appear in a prettier shape   octavio but tell me dear alice how am i to elude the vigilance of aldobrand   alice very easily sir you must know the old fool expects to meet laura her with whom he is most desperately in love  but i see him coming i will engage him while you slip down stairs and entertain your mistress  exit octavio enter aldobrand aldobrand here i am so amorous  but so frightened my heart is like a volcano in iceland fire and frost at the same time if laura should not requite my passion  if i should fail alice    alice fail sir there is no such word in the lovers dictionary   aldobrand then i suppose mine is the old edition for egad i think i see it in the title page in black letter it frightens me so that i cannot turn over a new leaf   alice come sir i will comfort you with an example in a ballad which i learnt of an english captain who used to visit my poor master signor regnalto  air young roger the ploughman who wanted a mate went along with his daddy a courting to kate with nosegay so large in his holiday clothes his hands in his pockets away roger goes now he was as bashful as bashful could be and kitty poor girl was as bashful as he so he bowed and he stard and he let his hat fall then he grinnd scratched his head and said  nothing at all if awkward the swain no less awkward the maid she simperd and blushed with her apronstring played till the old folks impatient to have the thing done agreed that young roger and kate should be one in silence the young ones both nodded assent their hands being joined to be married they went where they answered the parson with voices so small you would have sworn that they both had said  nothing at all but mark what a change in the course of a week kate quite left off blushing hodge boldly could speak could joke with his deary laugh loud at the jest she could coax too and fondle as well as the best and ashamed of past folly they have often declared to encourage young folks who at courtship are scared if at first to your aid some assurance you call when once you are used to it it is  nothing at all a lover is like a swimmer fear will be sure to sink him   aldobrand then egad i shall certainly go to the bottom alice   alice never fear that sir  trust to the corkjacket i have brought you  shewing his disguise  this will keep your head above water i will warrant  come sir let me help you on with it   aldobrand putting on the friars dress heigho make haste and lead me to laura that i may face the enemy while i have courage enough left for the attack   alice i will go and reconnoitre sir   aldobrand and do

his confessor in faith if you are you must have a troublesome task of it by all accounts i am sure you deserve to be paid well for keeping such a battered old conscience in repair   aldobrand aside how i long to break the rascals head   firelock but i cannot think where the old fellow can be gone he was seen to enter this room not half an hour ago   aldobrand why what the devil are you set to watch him you dog   firelock heyday here is language for a man of mortification you seem to have forgot yourself father   aldobrand rather so indeed  but if you knew me better you would find me a true son of the church   firelock aye i dare say one of those dutiful children who are seldom better pleased than when they are drinking their mother church in full bumpers and lest her family should be extinct like good sons take all the care in their power to provide her with grandsons   aldobrand i forgive your scurrility friend  you shall find that monkish manners can cover liberality of sentiment   firelock as an extinguisher covers a candle  but here come octavio and viola   aldobrand aside a comfortable situation i shall be in to be sure for though i should be cuckolded before my face i must like a snail draw my horns within my shell   enter octavio and viola firelock we are all safe sir the enemy has retreated and left you master of the field   octavio follow aldobrand my faithful friend lest he should return unexpectedly  but who is this   firelock oh as for this ghostly father though he may hitherto have been a neutral power i dare say he is a true politician and now victory has declared for you will have no objection to become your ally  exit octavio a lucky thought this good priest shall join our hands  you tremble viola   viola oh octavio you will forgive that timidity which makes me start at the precipitancy of a measure    octavio which alone can release you from the power of an avaricious tyrant  i will submit the case to this worthy man convinced that i could not have fixed on any person better qualified to decide the matter   aldobrand aside i wish to my soul the worthy man were safe at home  a plague on this masquerading if he finds me out i shall have his sword through me in a twinkling   octavio my good father this lady is threatened with marriage by her guardian a wretch whom if you knew you must despise  she has blessed me with the avowal of her affection   viola that avowal octavio i willingly repeat why should i blush to own my acquaintance with love while he is the companion of virtue   aldobrand aside the devil take her fine sentiments   octavio thus then let me seize this charming hand and our good friend here i am persuaded will cheerfully assist me in making it my own aldobrand shakes his head what you say no perhaps you are not aware what a sad old fellow this guardian is he reviles ecclesiastical government wherever he goes and declares he hates a priest so much that he is ready to faint at the sight of his habit he says it resembles charity for it is always sure to cover a multitude of sins   viola you seem to be mistaken in the person to whom you apply octavio   aldobrand aside most cursedly mistaken if he knew all   octavio as to his shaking his head that is a disorder easily cured by a proper application to the palm of the patients hand  giving money to aldobrand aldobrand aside egad if i refuse money he will soon discover me to be no churchman  taking the money octavio are you better father  not quite cured yet eh  i must touch the other hand then  giving him more money  now i will answer for it he will find himself perfectly well   aldobrand aside then i will even get off while i am well  going octavio stopping him not so fast my good friend   enter alice who starts back with seeming surprise and then whispers viola viola aside to alice my guardian do you say   alice affecting astonishment bless me what do i see  to what a pass of wickedness is this world arrived  oh my poor master how he has been imposed upon and now perhaps he will think me an accomplice in the plot i shall run mad with vexation  as for you signora viola i shall take care that you shall never speak another word to that vile seducer aside to viola  tell him immediately how we are circumstanced  aside to aldobrand while viola whispers octavio  ah my dear sir how lucky it was for us all that i came in just at the moment i did  what deceit there is in the world   aldobrand aside to alice a d  nd deal indeed  alice you must take care they dont suspect me   alice aside to aldobrand  leave that to me sir i blush for you signora viola to behave so to your guardian  and as for you signor octavio    octavio i should have been married by this time had it not been for that piece of mock sanctity who dared to receive money for what he never intended to perform but i am resolved to take the most signal revenge   alice dear sir what do you mean aside to octavio  stick to that bless me how your eyes roll dont be rash   aldobrand aside to alice what is to become of me alice   alice surely signor octavio you dont mean to attempt his life   aldobrand aside to alice hold your tongue he will not think of killing me if you dont put him in mind of it   alice to be sure the poor gentleman is entirely in your power it would be the easiest thing in the world to destroy him without it is being discovered you might hang him in the garden or drown him in the river  or shoot him   or  let me see    aldobrand aside to alice the devils in the wench  you forget that you are counsel for the defendant   alice

this morning but you seem soon blown from your anchor as you call it   alice consider sir what a storm we are in    octavio it is impossible my dear viola not even your entreaties can disarm my resentment   alice what sir not if he agrees to marry you   octavio aside agrees to marry me  what the devil can she mean now  on that condition indeed    alice leave me to calm the fears of the good man   octavio well father i leave you to your female friend eloquence you know is the gift of the sex i dare say alice will persuade you to listen to the voice of reason though i cannot  exeunt octavio and viola aldobrand egad if reason speaks through your voice i dont wonder that so few people in the world listen to her for the very tone of it is enough to throw one into a quaking fit  a pretty sort of an engagement you have formed for me alice how the devil am i to fulfill it   alice why sir you must even run away that is the most approved remedy when a man cannot fulfill his engagements   enter montano who seeing aldobrand and alice retires to the back of the scene montano aside a confession scene as i take it i may chance to profit by it   aldobrand but then i leave viola behind me   alice i will take care she shall soon follow you i can persuade octavio to any thing you see i have gained his confidence   aldobrand egad if you have gained his confidence you have made a pretty comfortable addition to your own stock for i think he has as good a share as any man i ever knew   alice i have news to tell you of your beloved laura    montano aside his beloved laura   alice but i fancy in this jumble of passions love has sunk to the bottom   aldobrand why in faith fear is the oil of the passions attempt to mix it with whatever you will it is always sure to swim at top   alice which proves that with you love is weighty and fear light but i have to inform you sir that laura left this house on pretense of illness and that she is now at home where she expects you

confessor who has the keeping of a pretty girls conscience leads a mighty agreeable life the pleasure of giving absolution must be so great that like a skilful physician who delights in being constantly employed one might be tempted now and then to make a flaw in a patients constitution for the satisfaction of performing the cure   montano coming forward and drawing his sabre stop doctor   aldobrand ah good signor what would you have do you wish to be married  spare my life and command my services   montano signor aldobrand i have overheard the whole of your pious conversation and am so much edified by it that i am resolved to quit the turban and assume the religious habit which you wear  yes i am determined to try the virtues of that magic garment which can blind the eyes of a fine woman to age and infirmity for surely without such assistance you could never have presumed to think of gallantry   aldobrand i dont know that   montano can that shrivelled countenance and those tottering limbs be formed for seduction   aldobrand there is no fixed standard for beauty and ladies often differ in their tastes   montano well settle that point another time in the mean while we

devil shall i manage to conceal myself egad i will slip down this staircase  exit enter octavio and viola octavio cast away your scruples my love and rely upon me  air by that eloquent language which speaks in the eyes by the ardour which breathes in the lovers sad sighs as in absence the nameless soft wishes arise i prythee now hear me my dearest by those fond anxious doubts which all lovers must feel which although some few moments of bliss they may steal yet fan loves pure flame and still wound but to heal i prythee now hear me my dearest by our hopes when the moment of meeting is nigh when affection no longer can pardon deny hopes which live in a look in a word in a sigh i prythee now hear me my dearest by my passion for which words alas are too weak by that lovedawning blush which now glows on your cheek and so kindly avows what your tongue will not speak i prythee now hear me my dearest make yourself perfectly easy my dear viola montano will protect you i thought he was here but i

just now stealing down the dark private staircase which leads to the garden with his hands before his face like a sulky child endeavoring to escape a whipping there is no fear of your losing him sir except he can creep through the keyhole for i locked the door as i came up and put the key in my pocket to prevent old aldobrands surprising us   enter aldobrand behind aldobrand aside the door is

friendship   aldobrand aside he little thinks that my appearance of friendship is like some other friendships  a mere disguise which i shall throw off as soon as convenient   octavio in a word i will entrust viola to his care while i stay to face the expected storm   alice shall i run and fetch him sir   octavio it is by no means necessary at this unfortunate moment my conversation would serve only to distress him   aldobrand aside it would indeed most plaguily   octavio only beg him to accompany viola to my house by the riverside two trusty servants will attend him   viola surely octavio i should be safer under this roof   octavio no my charmer montano will conduct you to a more agreeable asylum to a place which i hope my viola will shortly call her home   aldobrand aside yes egad i will take care she shall soon find herself at home   octavio oh montano i commit my existence into your hands  tell him my dear alice to watch over her as if she were the darling of his own soul i know he will with pleasure receive the precious pledge from me   aldobrand aside with great pleasure indeed and i fancy when once i get the precious pledge in my possession you will find it no easy matter to redeem it  but i must retreat to my hiding place   octavio we have no time to lose my love give your hand to my friend and your guardian   aldobrand aside ha ha ha  exit viola but consider

i am betrayed and am fallen a victim to my own imprudence  breaks from him and exit at the moment rosa enters on the opposite side montano wraps himself up in his disguise rosa your servant good signor aldobrand i have caught you at last possibly you have assumed this disguise in order to give laura some intelligence of ibrahim   montano aside he little thinks that he is so near the truth   rosa or very likely you have resolved to make love in masquerade as it might not be quite convenient to appear in your own person   montano aside right again the man has an admirable knack at guessing   rosa you see i am not ignorant of the person whom that disguise conceals nor of the purpose for which it was assumed   montano aside in faith i rather perceive you are ignorant of it by your bullying in so high a style   rosa i find the algerine is not yet taken that rogue who was to be hanged drowned flayed and carbonaded you have let him escape after all your promises to imprison him in spite of law or equity   montano aside a pretty hairsbreadth escape i have had   rosa but you have been bribed i doubt not that you are interested in his being at liberty   montano aside rather so indeed   rosa and i am to be assassinated by him i dare say i am betrayed and that at this moment he knows that you issued the order for apprehending him at my request   montano aside not till this moment did he know it good signor lucilio   rosa not that i fear the arm of the haughty moor could i but meet him face to face i only dread lest lurking under some disguise he may attack me at a moment when i am not prepared for i fancy my courage was never yet brought in dispute   montano aside i dare believe not there can be but one opinion of it   rosa but not even the abject silence which guilt imposes on your tongue shall save you from my just revenge  i have a very curious piece of steel here  drawing her sword enter firelock behind montano and i believe i have just such another  draws and discovers himself firelock and here is a third which i will match with either of them   rosa ibrahim   firelock my friend the algerine captain fighting in ambuscade   montano the same  but perhaps signor lucilio this is one of your unprepared moments   rosa i  i  am not yet prepared for you indeed sir  you  you are safe  putting up her sword  aldobrand must be the first victim of my vengeance   montano pitiful boy draw instantly are these the evasions    rosa i am not to be frightened sir  i  i shall not fight at present true courage sir like mine  always calm  always calm i say  and intrepid looks down sir with contempt on the impotent attacks of  of  of malice  and  and in short sir  i  i shall find another time to see you  exit firelock i am not sorry he has escaped you such a conquest would have disgraced your sword   montano and this is the being for whom laura has quitted me but i will think no more of it  ere i quit florence for ever the villainy of this aldobrand in perverting the laws to his unworthy purposes shall be punished he is a traitor to his country who tamely beholds her laws and liberties invaded either by the assassin hand of knavery or the bolder attacks of tyranny  air accursed the wretch whose coward soul awed by oppressions guilty hand dares not the lawless power control which drives fair freedom from the land who deaf to honors call sublime tamely to tyranny submits becomes the accomplice in the crime and shares the treason he permits exit scene aldobrands house montanos algerine habit and turban lying on a chair enter viola viola alas how suddenly have i been awakened from my dream of bliss how unexpected the reverse but a moment ago i seemed to be treading the paths of happiness and whither have they led me yet does not hope desert me i will caress the kind guest and like a drowning wretch still continue to clasp him while i seem to be irrecoverably sinking  air thus we view the treacherous morning with false smiles the hills adorning though of storms they give no warning yet no sooner seen than gone still while clouds on clouds impelling the storm drives on with ruin swelling fancy every cloud dispelling paints tomorrows happy dawn  enter aldobrand and alice aldobrand once more i bid you welcome home my young madam  why you made but a short visit to your lover  egad ne and i have been playing the english game of cricket with you i bowl you at him he bats you back again to me you come plump into my hands so he is caught out and there is an end of the game  go to your chamber and study the charms of retirement  exit viola alice well sir i am quite impatient to hear your success with laura   aldobrand aside  ah the cockatrice  but i will dissemble  dont mention her alice i have had enough of gallantry the very name is poison to my ears  a pistol to my head  a dagger to my breast    enter fabio fabio signora laura is below   aldobrand indeed  why  why  there is great condescension in her visiting me  i will wait on her   alice what sir would you put the steel to your breast   aldobrand ah alice if it be steel it is certainly touched with a loadstone for i am irresistibly drawn to it though i dread it is point  exeunt aldobrand and fabio alice poor viola thus to be awakened in a fright from her dream of happiness  but i will assist her to fit the old dotard yet   enter montano in the friars habit bless me signor aldobrand can i believe my eyes why i parted with you but this moment and now i see you in the very dress    montano discovering himself which was intended as aldobrands passport to laura  i have done with it my dear and am come for my own clothes  throws aside the friars dress and puts on the turban etc alice are not you the algerine captain who behaved so kindly to the poor slaves  i am sure you must be a good christian in your heart  montano retires while aldobrand enters aldobrand alice give orders that my doors be instantly shut against that ruffian ibrahim  here is poor lucilio come to claim my protection he and laura are afraid to trust themselves in their own house  that fellow is born to be the plague of my life wherever i go i am sure to meet him   montano coming forward i understand that you have issued an order to apprehend me good signor   alice aside i hope the captain will give him a sound beating  i will go and keep the servants out of hearing  exit montano i mean to surrender myself to justice if necessary but i fear though you call yourself her representative you do not speak the voice of your constituent but are like a bad inn which promises good accommodation on its sign while there is nothing but extortion within   aldobrand how dare you thus affront a magistrate   montano miscreant do not rouse my anger or by all your villainies i swear    aldobrand help help   enter rosa montano but i beg pardon your life is that gentlemans property he has sworn to dispatch you before he fights me   aldobrand i will give up my turn with all my soul   rosa signor aldobrand pay no attention to the idle dreams of a madman   montano well if you will have them dreams i dreamt that under this disguise  taking up the friars dress  i believe we are all three acquainted with it  under this disguise i say the seducing gallant aldobrand meant to attempt the chastity of that gentlemans wife    rosa angrily how signor aldobrand   montano and that the brave and noble lucilio conniving at the designs of this youthful ravisher lay in wait for him to take advantage of his cowardice   aldobrand how signor lucilio  and who the devil told you all this   montano there is my author who also while i was disguised as a friar informed me of your kind intention not only to imprison but to hang drown flay and carbonade me  i think those were your words signor aldobrand  i make no ceremony gentlemen in acquainting you with each others rascality i am persuaded you are both too much of the poltroon for me to apprehend any bloodshed between you   aldobrand very pretty upon my soul  they seem to be excellent company so i will even leave them together  exit rosa yes yes i shall remember this  but i must keep down my passion  air good sir in vain you bend your brow and look so queer i know not how and set your arms akimbo my laughter you provoke ha ha ha ha so pleasant is the joke if sir i chose to try my skill of fencing soon you would have your fill but mighty signor whiskers with you i will not engage ha ha ha ha a fig for all your rage nay prythee friend dont draw your sword i shall not draw mine upon my word nor could i fight for laughing were i to look at you ha ha ha ha and so sweet sir adieu  montano going meets octavio octavio my friend my montano how happy your presence makes me  then my viola is safe  my visit here at this time will prevent aldobrands suspecting the scheme by which he is deprived of his prey    montano aside he must mean my personating aldobrand at lauras how could it have reached his ears   octavio tell me montano how did she look what did she say relate every circumstance   montano why when i first entered the house she took me for aldobrand   octavio took you for aldobrand  ha ha ha a ridiculous mistake and no great compliment to you neither  well did she not often call upon octavio   montano no she never mentioned your name   octavio that is strange   montano her tongue faltering with conscious guilt    octavio conscious guilt what a strange phrase for the amiable timidity of the sex  but proceed   montano just as i caught her in my arms    octavio what   montano her husband rushed into the room and surpised us   octavio her husband  what husband  i talk to you of my viola the lovely charge whom i entrusted to you not two hours ago   montano viola entrusted to me  why my dear friend either you or i must have lost our wits for i dont recollect that i ever saw the lady in my life   octavio i am in torment  oh viola   enter regnalto hastily regnalto she is now in the house alice by your own orders gave her into the hands of aldobrand who by some unaccountable accident was dressed like ibrahim   montano rather whimsical in you to mistake aldobrand for me and no great compliment to me neither as you say to octavio   regnalto it is not too late to retrieve every thing  signor ibrahim you must not be seen here wait near the gardengate your friend octavio will need your services   montano well octavio take care you make no more mistakes  exit regnalto but we are interrupted dissemble your chagrin at what is passed and fear nothing   enter aldobrand and fabio octavio signor aldobrand my errand will apologize for this unseasonable visit   aldobrand rather unseasonable to be sure and especially as viola    octavio sir i speak to you of regnalto  i hear he is released from slavery   aldobrand released from slavery  ha   octavio why you seem surpised you    aldobrand my joy overcomes me  that is all   octavio he is soon to make his appearance in florence   aldobrand i should be heartily glad to see him  aside  at the devil but pray how did you hear this news   octavio my lacquey had it this moment from regnaltos servant laurence who is his old acquaintance   aldobrand aside  i am in a cold chill regnaltos servant in florence   octavio in your house at this moment   aldobrand in my house  run fabio and bring him hither immediately  my old friends servant to be under my roof and i not know it  exit fabio octavio it rather seems as if he meant to conceal himself from you   aldobrand egad that is very true as you say  perhaps the dog may have robbed his master and when he finds himself discovered he may make off i had better go and see after him myself there are so many rogues in the world  exit octavio to regnalto tell me what means    regnalto ask me no questions they believe me dumb still let them think so   octavio the charming viola    regnalto accepts the offer which your letter conveyed to her i will assist in her elopement and have a ladder of ropes ready placed at the balcony in the garden   octavio transport  and this news of regnalto    regnalto is true  but here comes aldobrand   octavio then we must not be seen together  the garden at twelve   regnalto depend on me  exit enter aldobrand aldobrand aye there is that dog laurence sure enough  but there is no fear of his running away he is so tipsy he can hardly stand   octavio you must feel a singular satisfaction at the approaching return of your old friend regnalto   aldobrand a very singular satisfaction indeed  i never felt any thing like it before   enter laurence drunk and fabio octavio is that regnaltos servant   aldobrand he himself sir   laurence there you are mistaken for i am not myself at present   octavio and your master    laurence like man like master he is not himself neither but we shall come to ourselves both of us before tomorrow morning   aldobrand where is your master aside  i sit on pins and needles   laurence my master is at home   aldobrand at home   laurence and yet he is not at home  because the people make a stranger of him   aldobrand is he in florence   laurence how can i tell i hardly know where i am myself and if i did i would not tell you for to speak the truth i have my suspicions of you my old boy   aldobrand old boy  familiar rogue   laurence familiar i am sure you and i have been very distant for these nine years past   aldobrand a blessed state you are in sirrah   laurence yes i am married and that is a blessed state you will never be in  do you think now that signora viola will ever marry such an ugly decrepit old     aldobrand why you abusive rascal  out of my sight   laurence signor octavio she is a fine girl and walks in the garden sometimes  love lights her she does not want the light of the moon   aldobrand eh what   octavio aside that fellows tongue will discover all   aldobrand what is that you said about the moon   laurence that if you were married you would be very much like the moon   aldobrand how   laurence why in the course of a month you would certainly have horns  exit aldobrand signor octavio you will pardon my reminding you that it is very late   octavio i understand you signor and as it is near my hour i will take my leave   aldobrand good night sweet signor  exit octavio  fabio i dont know whether i am upon my head or my heels this regnalto is certainly in florence and then i dont like what that drunken fellow said to octavio about violas walking in the garden i fear there is some mischief stirring tell guiseppe and roberto to get their carbines and well take a walk round the garden signor lucilio too shall join our company  i am always most valiant when i am best supported  exeunt scene the garden a ladder of ropes fixed to the balcony enter montano montano this i think is the spot where octavio appointed me to stand guard  alas if my endeavors for my friends happiness are crowned with no better success than those for my own  but i hear voices  retreating to the back of the scene enter laura and rosa rosa i wish we could see some one appear at the window that we might apprize viola of her danger   laura happy viola to love and be beloved while i have lavished my affection on an ingrate who perhaps at this very moment amuses a happy mistress with the fond tale of my weakness  air hope on thee i call while through thy paths i stray wherever my footsteps fall oh light me on my way though lost in errors maze still kindly soothe my woe nor let truths brighter blaze show what i fear to know  rosa think no more of your false lover madam take my advice and from among the noble youths of florence who languish for your smiles choose one to whom i may resign you   montano aside pretty advice from a husband  sdeath i cannot suffer this disgrace of manhood to exist  drawing his sword laura oh my dear girl    montano aside how a girl   laura how continually has my tongue dwelt on it is dearest theme  the praises of my montano   montano aside montano  do i live   laura but it is all over rosa  i will retire from a world which has lost it is only charm for me a convent shall    montano this excess of joy is too much   laura hark   rosa it is the voice of ibrahim   montano no it is a voice with which the gentle laura should be better acquainted a voice which during four cruel years of slavery has never ceased to invoke heaven for her happiness   laura oh rosa it is  it is my montano  faints in his arms rosa and so ends my first chapter of matrimony  a very excellent mode of getting rid of a wife without the trouble of a divorce or the expense of a separate maintenance  how many poor husbands would envy me  but my dear madam  and sir  you forget that this is a moment as critical to viola as to yourselves and i hear footsteps in the garden   montano let us retire then my love from this arbor i can watch whether any one approaches the balcony   enter laurence still drunk with a bottle in his hand laurence it is rather a dark night or else i dont see clear  air though i cannot walk quite straight and in figures of eight still circling my legs do their duty you will always observe that a regular curve is reckoned the true line of beauty of orpheus they tell he who fiddled so well that his notes made hills rocks and trees caper so i can in my way when a solo i play make them dance full as well as that scraper though at first on a survey things seem topseyturvey when youre used to it they dont look so frightful still they move more or less and good judges confess moving prospects are always delightful the worlds circular motion i am sures no false notion for though sober i never could believe it truth in wine boys is found now i see it turns round he that is drunk can most plainly perceive it i wonder where my master is as for old aldobrand i suppose he is in bed and asleep   enter aldobrand and fabio at the back of the stage they approach laurence softly but i cannot think what is become of my good friend dummy as they call him  ah sir are you there i have been looking for you all over the garden  what not come to your speech yet  in faith i think you have infected me for i have not my speech half so well as i had a little while ago  where is signor octavio  you dont stand still what makes you stagger so  why dont you answer me sir old aldobrand cannot hear us now  aldobrand seizes him on one side fabio on the other aldobrand but he can hear you hangdog  so dummy can speak can he   laurence ah signor aldobrand is it you  upon my soul i did not know you   aldobrand i will make you know me you dog before i have done with you   fabio hush i hear somebody  come this way sir retiring behind to laurence  sit you down there   laurence i will  and take a nap   enter regnalto and firelock viola and alice appear at the window alice signor octavio where are you   viola i am frightened to death signor octavio    firelock aside bless their sweet tongues there is more music in a pretty womans voice than in all the orchestras in italy   viola say who you are   regnalto the friend of octavio in a word the dumb slave the ladder of ropes is rendered useless for i have secured the key of the door but somebody approaches  descend and i will be ready to receive you  viola and alice retire enter octavio octavio well met my trusty friends true i see to your appointment   regnalto suppose in case of a discovery i were to personate regnalto his clothes fit me exactly and i might by that means further your designs   octavio not at the expense of my honor i will not owe my success to artifice   regnalto psha a little artifice is often very useful it is only retreating from an enemy when he is too powerful for us and a good pair of heels is sometimes very serviceable  eh friend firelock   firelock a good pair of heels may be as useful to a coward as artifice is to a knave but honesty as much despises the aid of the one as courage disdains the assistance of the other   regnalto viola approaches   enter viola and alice from a door under the balcony octavio my viola   viola what a transition from despair to happiness  octavio i commit myself to your honor   octavio charming viola my affection shall prove that your confidence is not misplaced   aldobrand and fabio come forward aldobrand lights there  guiseppe  roberto  where are you  enter servants with lights your servant signor octavio  viola shrieks and swoons in regnaltos arms  this scheme is no better than the other and you have not got your algerine friend to back you now   montano comes forward with laura and rosa montano here i am signor aldobrand at your service   rosa and here am i you are among friends you see   aldobrand why then as i am among friends i shall make free  attempting to seize viola firelock stand off if you regard your life  draws aldobrand thank you for tho hint i will take your advice  retreating but as for you my lads to the servants fall on  seize the lady   regnalto not while i have an arm to defend her   aldobrand well said dummy  kill him my boys in the first place   octavio first you have to conquer me slaves  throwing himself before regnalto aldobrand why signor octavio are you mad  what right has that fellow to viola  am not i her guardian   regnalto throwing off his slaves dress and am not i her brother   fabio to aldobrand it is a pity you sent for the lights sir   regnalto to the servants sheathe your swords i am master here  your term is expired signor aldobrand   aldobrand yes and i am turned out at a moments warning i see   viola do i at length embrace my brother  kind heaven i have no more to ask   regnalto except a husband viola and him i give to you without asking  giving her hand to octavio  a husband to whom your brother owes his liberty and life   laurence coming forward heyday my old boy why you are mistaken again  you have made a cursed number of blunders this evening  rot me if i believe you are quite sober   regnalto and now my generous friend ibrahim    montano no longer ibrahim but montano  fortune who made us companions in adversity has compensated for all by giving you to me as a companion in happier days   laura signor montano i hope you will not forget my first husband  pointing to rosa rosa believe me i shall not forget your second as long as i live i am sure i found it so hard a task to personate the husband    laurence that i suppose the next time you get married you will personate the wife  depend upon it you will act the part much more naturally   alice if she wants a good example let her copy me laurence   octavio to firelock as for you my noble soldier    firelock as for me signor i have to thank you for two favors first for restoring to me the greatest of blessings  my liberty and secondly  for affording me the opportunity of showing my gratitude   regnalto to aldobrand wretch what have you to say in defense of yourself   aldobrand nothing good signor regnalto  least said is soonest mended   regnalto repent then of your villainy in silence let us only hear the voice of joy  we have now the highest blessing mortals can possess  that of sharing the happiness we create   finale regnalto away with all care till tomorrow no longer we are destined to roam today bid adieu to all sorrow and welcome the strangers at home chorus away with all care etc duett laura and montano no more of fortune well complain since she so kind has proved at last our joys contrasted with our pain shall brighter shine for sorrows past laurence on the subject now before us i would fain my zeal display  aldobrand and i too would join the chorus if i knew but what to say viola my freedom i gladly resign nor shall i for liberty ever repine octavio and i from my purpose will never depart to bind faster those bonds in which love holds your heart firelock though i have no objection to fighting in faith it is better by half with such happy lovers uniting to join in the song and the laugh alice believe me i joy to behold you all going to be married so soon  you know maam i often have told you a good husband is fortunes best boon rosa when i marry although i will not barter my own little person for pelf in wedlock i will keep up the charter and still wear the breeches myself chorus away with all care till tomorrow no longer we are destined to roam o chase from our bosoms
