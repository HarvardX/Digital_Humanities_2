preface the great reputation which dr hoffman has deservedly acquired by his superior abilities and long experience in his profession has made his writings universally known and esteemed by the learned  this treatise being intended for general use he has wrote with more plainness and with as few terms of science as possible to render it generally useful as the subject he treats of is proper for every one to be acquainted with whose state of health has required the use of this common and almost universal remedy  we thought it would not be amiss to prefix the opinions of those eminent physicians dr moffett mr lemery and dr arbuthnot on the same subject which we have therefore here adjoined all which confirm and strengthen the sentiments of dr hoffman in this treatise  dr moffett in his treatise of foods says asses milk is an especial cure for that sort of consumption wherein the flesh decays through ulceration of the lungs and breathing parts it is both meat and medicine cleansing and nourishing alike not so thin as to hinder expectoration nor so thick as to cause condensation of the matter putrified but being of a middle temper and consistence and consequently most proper for that disease a middle age asss milk is the best having got such a one shut her from her foal four or five hours before you use her milk let her be well curried lest her skin growing foul ill vapors be increased inwardly for want of perspiration feed her with grinded maltstraw dried mingled with a little sweet fennelseed annis or carrawayseeds which she will eat with great pleasure and digest into a sweet and wholesome blood an hour after that milk her as near the patient as you can that it may be drank before the air has altered it for if it be once cold it is not wholesome this may be done twice a day morning and evening upon an empty stomach neither eating or drinking after it for two hours you may sweeten it with sugar candy sugar of roses or fine honey and it will be more effectual in winter let her be fed with the sweetest meadow hay  mr lemery in his treatise on foods says asses milk as to its consistence and virtues is much like that of a woman it is much used as a remedy against the phthisick and other disorders of the lungs and being like womans milk is of a qualifying nature is beneficial in the cure of pimples the defluxions of the eyes and to ease the pains of the gout  dr arbuthnot in his treatise on aliments page    observes that womans milk is the sweetest as to the nutritious quality the next to it is that of asses  the translator hopes he has rendered the authors sense very clear and wishing it may prove of general good recommends it to the perusal of the public  november  0      a treatise of the extraordinay virtues and effects of asses milk those who have had a long and careful experience in the practice of physic have a better opportunity than the rest of mankind of observing that the plainest sorts of remedies those which are most readily prepared and as it were at hand in every family are highly preferable to all kinds of compounds and artificial mixtures of drugs whatsoever not only in regard to the safety in using them but likewise in their real virtue and efficacy whether they be intended to thoroughly subdue or put a timely stop to all the various kinds of diseases  if we diligently revise the best writings of physicians in the earliest ages we shall find that they met with greater success and wrought more cures with the most simple and easy medicines such as are quite agreeable to nature such as only require a regulation in diet and have a greater share of nourishment than of physic in them than the chemists of later times can effect with their inestimable secrets and subtle compositions produced by the force of fire for all these unless administered with the nicest care and discretion instead of doing service are sure to do much mischief and therefore must be esteemed very dangerous and far less eligible than those family remedies that may be used without any hazard at all  undoubtedly the refined art of chemistry which brings to light the various mixtures and properties of natural substances deserves a very great and peculiar degree of admiration and the experiment is very surprising of the chemists who are able to relieve the sufferings of their patients with a few drops only or a very small pill yet when the larger or more plentiful preparations of what are called galenical medicines are rejected when no regard is shown to the safe assistance of regulated diets so much recommended by the ancients and medicines altogether chemical are almost universally used against all diseases the effect is that the practice of physic is become far more dangerous in our days than it was formerly and gets discredit by more frequent instances of the loss of patients for my own part i was always guided by the following rule that the only way to gain a happy and successful method in the healing art is continually to unite theory with practice the experience of the ancients with that of the moderns and galenical and domestic remedies with chemical for i have discovered by a long improved experience that remedies which have blended in them the powers of both nourishment and physic and are therefore pleasant and refreshing to the frame of our bodies are not only the safest but the most efficacious in the cure and prevention of diseases and it is undeniable that the use and properest method of administering these is more exactly to be learnt from the remains of the ancients authors than from the works of the moderns or even of such of the moderns as have plainly a fondness and partiality for the ancients  one of the most eminent and distinguished instances of what i thus assert is asses milk which indeed was strenuously recommended by the ancient physicians and esteemed of sovereign benefit in rooting out the obstinate remains of the most grievous distempers yet most of our later physicians in other respects men of high repute are very ignorant of its most excellent qualities and therefore were either so cautious as seldom to introduce into their practice this desirable promoter of health or actually were afraid to use it at all in the following treatise therefore i intend by fair and just arguments founded on an extensive experience to set forth all the admirable virtues of asses milk which have so long been absolutely forgotten and unknown  but before we come immediately to the subject it is not improper previously to show in general that all milk is a sort of food that has a singular medicinal virtue belonging to it without considering its remarkable nourishing quality which very weighty reasons should recommend its being medicinally used that milk has this nutritive quality must i think be readily allowed by all as it appears constantly to every man by his own experience to be particularly constituted and adapted to the support of our bodies the unborn child while yet enclosed in the womb grows and is nourished by milk which is prepared for it in the structure of the secundines when it is born it acquires still additional firmness from a supply of milk is gradually wrought up to its perfect form and all its inward parts gain so much more strength in proportion as they are able to alter and digest whatever food they take in and reduce them to the milky juice called chyle lastly every man so long as he remains alive receives his whole nourishment and vigor from chyle which is extracted from the food digested and dissolved and is in truth no other than milk it is milk that supplies the principles and materials not of the blood alone but of all the fluids that cherish and sustain life  since then milk is so manifestly proved to be the principal of all the kinds of aliment so it may be deservedly reckoned the chief of all remedies which though it may not seem clear and evident to others may be proved to demonstration with very little difficulty to begin then with experience the best instructor in all things and what is superior to all the most refined speculations  no man that has cultivated ever so slight an acquaintance with the medicinal art can be ignorant that the milk of almost all animals has a very powerful and mavelous efficacy in tempering subduing and diminishing the force of the strongest poisons whether they come from the kingdom of minerals animals or plants especially those of a corrosive kind that are most remarkable for fatal execution and so great is this efficacy that any person who has taken poison by a seasonable use of milk in a proper method and quantity will be sure to escape immediate death and recover perfect health on which account it may be reasonably questioned whether there be any more ready and prevalent antidote to be found in the whole works of nature and the most ancient and early writers in medicine both knew and described the certain virtue of milk against poisons diosscorides the most ancient writer concerning the materia medica says that milk if fresh and new is serviceable against corrosions and inflammations occasioned by deadly poisons such as cantharides pityocampa salamandra or bupreste orpiment dorycnium aconite or ephemeron and pliny repeats almost the very same account  if we enquire into the treatment of diseases themselves it will appear that milk was frequently and successfully employed against them from numberless testimonies and examples to be found in many late authors in common with those ancient physicians hippocrates galen celsus and the arabian writers this will be more largely illustrated when we proceed to the subject of asses milk at present let it suffice to produce what we read in martian that heretofore milk was esteemed the sacred anchor and foundation of all remedies so that there was scarce any distemper in which milk was not made use of the same is attested by jo jac wepfer an eminent author and noble ornament of the faculty among the dutch there is surely some divine quality belonging to milk formerly i could not have believed it had i not had convincing experience of it mine own eyes have seen men entirely renewed by it for by a discreet use of it multitudes have acquired a sounder constitution more hale complexion and greater strength of body  but though the milk that is generally used in the medicinal way is that of the common domestic sorts of animals as cows sheep and goats yet asses milk is by far the most efficacious and its virtues in physic exceed those of every other species so much that no sort of remedy is to be discovered so safe and so powerful in its effects for this taken at seasonable times in due quantities and with a proper regimen gives eminent relief to such as are afflicted with phthisics hectics consumption and slow consuming fevers chronical coughs and a scorbutic atrophy hypochondriac and hysteric disorders cramps ulcers in the bowels and diseases that proceed from a saline acrid erosion this consideration induced me to fix upon this sort of milk above all others for the subject of my observations in order to set forth its powers and properties to demonstrate its usefulness and confirm it by testimonies and examples  in the first place we must assign the reason why asses milk is to be preferred in medicine before that of other creatures which may be done in a more convincing and satisfactory manner if we previously lay down some certain stated propositions concerning the composition of milk and those ingredients which are the foundation of all its operations it is universally known that milk consists of three different substances each of which has a different quality and powers peculiar to itself the first is the fluid part commonly called serum or whey the next is the oily fat part which exhibits itself in cream on the surface and is to be wrought into butter the third is of a coarser nature earthy and mucilaginous in its texture and of this cheese is formed the serum or watery portion exceeds the others in quantity so that in different milks there will be found eight or ten parts of this fluid to one only of solid the butter or oily fat substance is the lightest and the least in quantity and inflammable in its nature and lastly the curd is of a more fixed and heavy temper is very readily hardened by acids and subsides to the bottom in the substance of cheese  the efficacy of every sort of milk in curing and subduing any disease is derived from this threefold nature of the ingredients that constitute the substance of milk for that milk which is thin and liquid and contains a larger proportion of serum is preferable for its faculty of moistening diluting cleansing and relaxing again that which is heavier and has much of the gross substance of curd is valuable for its excellence in hardening confirming and consolidating the broken vessels  but that which produces a great share of cream and likewise a considerable quantity of the curdlike substance is eminent for its softening smoothening and nourishing quality if we examine the different species of milks that are in common and daily use the human is the sweetest of all of a very soft and rich temperature and is the best accommodated for the nutriment of the human body that of cows is fatter has more of the earthy and less of the watery substance and is therefore less fitted for cleansing the vessels but best formed for softening tempering and nourishing sheeps milk is the most gross and very full of the earthy mucilaginous curd whence it has little of a cleansing power but is extremely useful for closing up such blood vessels or lymphaticks as are injured and corroded by acrid humors goats milk has very little serum and is of a pretty thick and astringent consistence produces very little butter yet is more cleansing and diluting than cows milk  this different proportion in the ingredients of milk and the difference of beneficial effects arising therefrom is not so much to be ascribed to the food of the animals of which more largely hereafter as to the different texture and conformation of their bodies for though we were to feed the various milchcreatures with the same sort of food for the same length of time and in the same manner in all respects yet would they not give milk of one and the same nature but each of its own and peculiar kind it is therefore a very evident truth that the matter and quality of the food conduces but little toward the formation of milk but that it is altogether brought to perfection by the pculiar nature of the animal which consist in a distinct composition and texture of the fluids namely the temperature of the blood and other juices and a particular make structure and constitution of the solids especially of the glands belonging to the udder which are composed of numberless fine vessels  when we examine more minutely into the medicinal virtue and disposition of asses milk it will appear to be fraught with an abundance of peculiar excellencies which render it so exceedingly wholesome in the first place it is thinner than all other milks and abounds with watery and serous ingredients this is what aristotle and galen have both observed who call it  composed of the minutest particles since then it is known that many diseases are caused by a grossness and tenacity of the juices which as they pass slowly through the finer vessels of which the principal emunctories and strainers of the glands consist are apt to stop in those narrow passages to fill them up and occasion obstructions it is very obvious and natural to conclude that the use of asses milk which abounds with serous and fluid particles must be extremely proper to open the obstructed vessels to attenuate the gross and viscid juices and set them in an easy and free motion again when we know that multitudes of distempers proceed from an acrid salt and corrosive state of the fluids we cannot but be assured that the thin serum of assesmilk will not fail of diluting softening and subduing them although it must be allowed at the same time that the sweet oily substance contributes much toward this effect which embraces and involves the pointed particles of salt and by this means the crude illdigested juices being property corrected are by the plentiful assistance of serum conveyed in their due course through the vessels appointed for secretion  it is another extraordinary excellence of asses milk that it contains but a small proportion of the grosser curdling substance out of eight ounces of asses milk which i set over hot coals in a broad vessel after all the serum was evaporated i could scarce gather so much as six drachms of a whitish sweet matter i then took twelve ounces of the same milk and set it by to curdle in a close vessel filled about half way in three days time a very white and thin curd settled at the bottom which when separated from the whey by straining through filtrating paper and afterward dried scarce amounted to two drachms all the rest of its solid parts having in part passed with the whey through the strainer and partly adhered to the sides of the vessels or lost themselves in the operation on the contrary the same weight of cows milk treated in the same manner thickened into a grosser and heavier curd which when cleared from the whey spread out in a broad plate and dried in the sun weighed ten drachms from these experiments it is evident that the quantity of the gross curdling substance is very small in asses milk when compared with other sorts for this reason it easily diffuses itself into the minutest extremities of the blood vessels thoroughly dilutes the vital juices liquifies the sluggish humors and when it has thus dissolved them conveys them off a third circumstance that more strongly evinces the salubrious quality of asses milk is that the share of cheeselike substance which it contains is extremely soft and tender and never makes a gross or firm curd to make this evident i warmed some asses milk and sprinkled it with vinegar expecting to see it contract a thick consistence but nothing appeared of that sort except a few light thin flakes floating here and there on the serum when on the contrary cows milk the instant it was mixed with an acid condensed into lumps of a considerable hardness and fell to the bottom now in all cures which are sought by milk nothing can be so hurtful and dangerous as to have it curdle in the stomach to prevent which accident ought to be the physicians principle care and concern for the mischiefs occasioned by a coagulation of milk in the stomach are very pernicious and have been observed and cautioned against by the best authors it is past dispute therefore that that milk is the most wholesome and properest for medicinal uses which has least tendency to curdle which is the case with asses milk in the most remarkable degree  a fourth and the most valuable excellence in asses milk is its exquisite sweetness in which it exceeds all other species of milk except the human for you may extract from it by much the greatest quantity of delicate tasted sugar or rather a thick substance resembling manna to try the experiment i boiled twelve ounces of asses milk in the month of july over a gentle fire and immediately it produced a thick concretion very sweet weighing one ounce upon this i poured it into a glass with a pint of rain water which when frequently shaken almost dissolved the mass leaving only a small sediment the liquor was then poured through filtrating paper and set to evaporate and yielded half an ounce of an honeylike substance extremely sweet and white as asses milk therefore contains so plentiful a proportion of sweet salts we cannot doubt but it has for that reason a very singular medicinal quality which cannot be expected in other kinds of milk for this honeylike salt greatly softens checks and moderates the acrimony of humors whether acid or bilious and by gently irritating the fibers of the bowels urges them to their office and operation hippocrates very justly observes that asses milk disposes to purging more than any other and in another place advises as a remedy for the fluor albus first to occasion a gentle purging by drinking asses milk and then to change it for cows milk  from these enlarged observations which we have made on the excellencies of asses milk it must be evident to all that judge sensibly that it has an admirable efficacy toward curing many distempers it may now be proper to enumerate those distempers in regular order and explain the usefulness of this milk in each particular the first and most remarkable instance we shall give by proving that no surer or more successful remedy can be invented or recommended against consumptions the use of milk in such diseases had long been practiced till the physical schools of cnidos and cos exploded it at length hippocrates who came from the latter vindicated and established its credit and was universally followed in it by all the physicians of the next age galen says a great deal in praise of milk in consumptive cases and speaks of a place called stabia very famous for its good air pasture for cattle and their wholesome milk which was filled frequently with crowds of consumptive people that came thither for relief and aretaeus ascribes so extraordinary virtues to milk in this grievous distemper that he does not scruple to affirm that if consumptive folks would drink great quantities of milk they would need no other remedy  yet although milk of all kinds be a wholesome medicine in consumptive and decaying constitutions yet asses milk excells the others in a greater degree because it fully answers every requisite that can conduce to the cure of consumptions if we strictly enquire into the cause and origin of a consumption of the lungs it will be found to proceed from a stoppage and obstruction of the vessels of which the lungs are almost entirely composed whence hippocrates very properly and ingeniously describes the rise of a consumption in these words when the lungs have collected a quantity of blood or salt phlegm and cannot discharge them but they settle and fix there they occasion little pustules to rise which suppurate at first and through the whole distemper there continues a sharp dry cough chilliness a fever a pain in the breast and back and sometimes a a strong wheesing both in lying down and sitting up and then the patient begins to spit up much corrupted matter  it was usual with the ancients to vary their prescriptions of milk for consumptions and sometimes order asses milk before and sometimes after the use of other milk as different occasions required hippocrates advises purging with asses milk boiled or mares milk strained which much resembles asses milk and drank every morning to the quantity of about a quart after which he recommends cows milk or goats  prosper alpinus greatly recommends the use of womans milk at first then asses and lastly goats in a consumption and ulceration of the lungs for my part i am convinced both from reason and experience that asses milk alone is sufficient for the cure of this terrible disease for nothing can be so properly adapted as this is by its abundance of sweet detersive salts to cleanse away and disperse the matter that obstructs the vessels and pipes of the lungs besides it greatly restores decayed strength cools the heat of the intestines fills out the wasted limbs and preserves a free and open perspiration yet i do not deny but when the obstruction of the vessels in the lungs is cured cows milk or goats by reason of their plenty of gross earthy substance may be proper to fill up and consolidate the cavities made by the corrosive ulcers  if i may be allowed to produce my own experience i could recount many instances of consumptive people who were afflicted with an obstinate cough a fever a great discharge of viscid matter from the lungs and an amazing waste of the whole body and who after an ineffectual trial of other remedies by my directions took to a long continued course of asses milk or cows milk either with or without some sort of tea and perfectly recovered but omitting others i shall only relate one very late case which is now fresh in my memory a man about thirty years old of a very debauched life and given to all kinds of intemperance especially drinking of spirituous liquors first fell into a spitting of blood which being cured though after a long continuance he contracted a fever which at first had the appearance of a defluxion but at length consumed his strength and afflicted him night and day he continually spit up a great discharge of purulent and viscid matter his strength failed and his flesh wasted so speedily that he could not walk about and was given over by every body yet after he had laid three months in this sad condition by gods blessing he recovered unexpectedly at the return of the spring on drinking goats milk warm every morning after i had administered gentle opening salineabstersive and nitrous powders to remove his obstructions and hectic heat  yet we must take notice that though this be such a sovereign remedy for consumptions and when given in a judicious manner scarce ever fails of success yet it will not cure every sort of consumption but must be applied in the beginning of the distemper and is most likely to take effect before the ulcers be grown callous or the corroded cavity be too deep and large or the fever become continued and without intermission celsus justly advises if it be a real consumption you ought to attack it as early as possible for when this distemper is of long date it is not easily conquered but in the beginning as in all lasting and obstinate fevers the use of milk is proper and alpinus very discreetly says that a regular course of milk will cure consumptions in their beginning before the ulcers be grown large and callous  as a spitting of blood difficulty of breathing wasting of the flesh and a small fever all generally inseparable companions of a consumption of the lungs are occasioned by the same cause namely an obstruction of the vessels of the lungs and pustules that arise from thence which in the height of the distemper grow to a scirrhous and cancerous ulceration there is no more powerful help against all these symptoms than asses milk and it has always been recommended by the most ancient and able physicians there is a remarkable passage in trallian which says if the whole body receives no benefit from food but begins apparently to waste away and the breast does not discharge much matter they ought to live on milk only and that of asses excells all others because it purges to a proper degree the same author again commends asses milk for a difficulty of breathing such as are afflicted with a difficulty of breathing i have often known relieved by asses milk when given properly for it clears and removes whatever is fixed in the vessels of the lungs and in another place speaking of spitting blood he fays all that spit blood find relief from milk for there is no medicine or food of any kind so suited to their case as milk and those that took to the use of that alone at first and persevered in it for a long time have all recovered their health i knew a man that by living on milk for a whole year and entirely abstaining from wine was cured of a spitting of blood and matter and escaped falling into a consumption  a consumption with a slow feverish heat is most times caused by a stoppage or obstruction in the smaller vessels thence proceeds a stagnation of the humors either in the lungs or bowels and glandulous parts of the belly now asses milk serves to moisten and remove these obstructions it likewise cools and checks the violence of the feverish heat whence it is evident that a right use of asses milk is not only extremely serviceable but the very best of all remedies in a slow fever hippocrates agrees with us in this and advises those that have a consumption and small fever to drink milk and riverius relates a remarkable case of a young lady of montpellier aged    who had been long confined to her bed with a cough that harrassed her night and day perpetual watching a pain in her stomach a slow fever costiveness and a general decay of the whole body who was perfectly recovered by drinking asses milk for one month after being prepared for it by a laxative cooling julep  to this let me add a most singular case that came within my observation a few years ago a gentlewoman had for many years been subject to much sickness but now for half a year together was afflicted with a slow fever a loathing of food languidness of the limbs a dry cough watchings a great pain about the os sacrum heat of urine profuse sweats by night and so entire a waste and decay in flesh and strength that she was unable to stir from her bed in vain had she been plied with decoctions antihectic powders stomachicks antihysterics resolvents and a thousand other things she lay past all hopes and in expectation of certain death at length in the beginning of the spring by my directions she took to asses milk taking between whiles a little opening manna mixed with some cooling nitrous powders and now and then some nourishing broths prepared with laxative roots and with such happy success that in three days only every thing appeared wonderfully amended and though the cure was not entirely completed in many weeks she was at last perfectly restored to her health and vigor  i likewise judge asses milk to be very efficacious against an empyema which is often caused by a pleuresy improperly treated especially in bodies of a spongy habit and shows itself by a constant and copious spitting of matter to confirm which opinion i shall relate a remarkable case as told by t valleriola a woman after recovery from a pleuresy began to discharge by spitting great quantities of purulent matter which reduced her to a miserable thin emaciated and lifeless condition the author tried to relieve her breast of that load of filth by detersive drinks linctuss broths and such sort of things but without success at length as her fever was not very high nor any obstruction appeared to be in the hypochondria or the bowels he prescribed asses milk fresh milked and sweetened with a little sugar which having drank for six weeks she recovered her health and a good constitution and died twelve years after in childbed i likewise remember many years since when i practiced physic at minden a nobleman thirty years of age of a full and sanguine habit of body who after a pleuresy injudiciously treated fell into so very great a spitting both of purulent and chylous matter which lasted more than a month and that he sometimes spit more than a pint a day and was thereby surprizingly weakened and emaciated i ordered him to drink asses milk with powders of crabshells and bole armonic balsam of sulphur of almonds sperma ceti and dragons blood mixed when he had done this for two months by the assistance of providence he was happily cured to the admiration of all that knew him  but yet it is not only in these diseases which affect the lungs and other intestines with a cough fever waste and consumption that asses milk has this admirable and divine efficacy but it is also wonderfully serviceable for soothing abating and lulling the fierceness of pains in the nervous parts of the body chiefly those that fix themselves in the joints these diseases such as the gout in the hands feet and hips are caused by a sharp thin serum issuing out of those glands which were discovered by clopton havers nay through the coats of the glands and falling on the articulonerveotendinous ligaments which corrodes them and occasions most acute pains cramps and contractions of the limbs this in time affects the whole system of the nerves and brings on a fever watching anxiety languidness want of appetite and universal restlessness if the fit be very violent in these rheumatic and gouty cases the whole mass of humors is infected with foul salt tartarous and sharp particles which is perhaps owing to some antecedent cause a fullness of blood some suppression of a critical discharge from the blood irregular living or excess in eating and yet some modern practitioners are apt to confound these remote causes with the proximate the salt foulness of the humors and prove themselves quite ignorant of the nature of this distemper as well as of the method of applying remedies for it is evident from experience that all such remedies as sweeten the juices correct the sharp salts and as it were sheathup their points and at the same time gently promote each different kind of excretion go a great way toward relieving the violence of the distemper soften and mitigate the sharp pains and in a great measure cure the disease itself unless it be hereditary or of a very long date  now milk and particularly that of asses is by far the best and most excellent of this sort of remedies excepting the diluting decoctions that are prepared from roots nor is its excellence any late discovery of the moderns but the earliest writers in physic and all their followers highly recommended and approve it hippocrates advises in a sciatica first a purge and then a course of asses milk and in the same treatise he adds it is proper in the gout first to soften the bowels with a glyster or suppository and after a purge to drink warm whey or asses milk pliny tells us many have been relieved from pains in the joints by drinking milk and celsus says many people by a long course of asses milk have been so thoroughly cleared of this distemper as to be free from it ever after among the moderns gabriel fonseca hollerius ballonius baglivi sydenham sachs griselius pechlinus dolaeus waldschmidt and many more all agree from numberless experiments and observations in allowing milk and especially asses milk to be the principal comfort and relief of gouty and rheumatic persons  and i can from my own knowledge assert that after using gentle laxatives made of manna solutive syrup of roses and some absorbents mixed i have found the drinking of goats milk where asses could not be had for many days together without meat or drink of any other sort has given great benefit the pains have grown milder and of shorter continuance and all the other symptoms have ceased i have known many gouty old men who after drinking asses milk with manna for the three first days and then continuing it alone for a fortnight have found their pains greatly abated but when they laid aside this remedy their torture was most intense and obstinate and confined them to their beds for some months yet this must all along be observed that in these distempers the good effects of milk is more speedy and certain where the patient is young the disease not inveterate the gout not fixed to a particular part nor transmitted by inheritance  as asses milk proves so very useful in relieving the pains that seize the outward parts of the body so it is likewise no less serviceable against those that affect the inward nervous parts the stomach and intestines as is the case in convulsive cholics this very beneficial effect of it is to be accounted for in the following manner the asses milk being diluting corrects and overpowers the acrimony of the bilious juices softens and relaxes the contracted fibers with its serous and slippery particles and with its sweet ingredients renders the bowels laxative then that corrosive matter which occasions all the pain is readily conveyed off by stool and all is easy and quiet the truth of this ballonius asserts and although hippocrates forbids the use of milk where there are bilious purgings yet if there be no remarkable fever to corrupt the milk i think it should be given for if it may be thrown into the bowels by a glyster without any hurtful effect why not also into the stomach  when cramps and convulsions seize the nervous parts which is the common symptom in hypochondriac and hysteric fits i have always observed milk especially that of asses do great good provided there be no costiveness nor obstruction in the bowels and the first passages be not clogged with sharp and viscid phlegm hence sydenham highly approves the use of milk in what he calls the hysteric cholic many women says he for a long while troubled with hysteric disorders especially that which i call hysteric cholic have been quite cured by only living on milk for some time bened sylvaticus bestows the highest praises on asses milk in hypochondriac complaints which he directs to be sweetened with sugar and made a moderate purge by a small mixture of powdered senna and drank for forty days together and although hippocrates forbids milk where the hypochondria are distended that is when the stomach is expanded with wind or the belly swollen and overcharged with blood yet i have often learned from indisputable experience that the hypochondria are not always thus oppressed but that the stomach and adjoining intestines are often tortured with contractions caused by the sharpness of the humors and blood that stagnates in the finer vessels and that this disorder is successfully removed by milk  for the same reason this judicious author zealously recommends asses milk in madness and hypochondriac melancholy which are occasioned by spasms that force too great a quantity of blood into the head so that it cannot circulate equally and freely through the vessels of the membranes that enclose the brain and if it be drank every morning to the quantity of four or five ounces for the space of a month or longer it corrects the acrid humors eases the contractions of the fibers cools and relaxes the bowels and by gradually removing the cause subdues that terrible disorder but in order for more certain success it is proper to make an addition to the purging quality of the milk by mixing a little manna the happy effects of which i have very often experienced  since therefore it is so evident that asses milk is beneficial to the nerves and heals their several forementioned disorders by means of its softening and lubricating quality we cannot doubt but it may be properly administered in other complaints where the nervous parts are likewise afflicted and disordered with violent motions as in epilepsies and convulsive fits this is affirmed by that eminent author sylvaticus in many places and i can attest the same with confidence for i could produce very many examples of it but one in particular of a youth of noble birth about fourteen years of age and of admirable parts and understanding having been struck by some sudden fright he was instantly seized with strong convulsions in his limbs chiefly his legs and arms and after much anxiety and uneasiness of spirits was oppressed with entire swoonings so that the fit came sometimes every other day sometimes every day about the evening and pursuing him for the space of two months reduced him to a very weak condition many physicians were consulted who gave him various medicines but without any effect at last he was ordered to drink every morning about three ounces of asses milk now and then with a little manna and to be put in a warm bath every other day taking between whiles some antiepileptic powders in a months time the disorder disappeared and the patient by the divine blessing recovered his health and strength  let us consider those grievous disorders that attend the scurvy such as a wasting of the flesh fierce pains and contractions of the limbs external ulcers and erosions all which are derived from a total distemperature of the juices a suppression of those very useful evacuations of sweat and excrement from a a defect in the secretion of the bilious humors in the spleen from a salt sulphurous foulness in the humors and likewise from their too thick consistence which retards their natural progress and obstructs the finer vessels now nothing can be so proper to open these closed passages to remove obstructions to correct the acrimony of the humors and to dissolve their viscidity as diluting moistening and cooling remedies such as the whey of goats milk or what is still preferable to all asses milk  the strongest testimony i can produce in favor of this eminent good quality in milk is that of the best author that ever wrote upon the scurvy eugalenus who says i have seen many people recover out of the scurvy from the use of milk and milkdiets with a stronger and better constitution than those that have lived under the rules and prescriptions of physicians and he mentions several that have been cured of scorbutic fevers by milk though contrary to the prescription of hippocrates in his aphorisms and i myself could produce a multitude of examples within my own experience of people afflicted with a wandering scorbutic gout a national distemper in westphalia whom i absolutely cured when i practiced physic at minda with no other medicine than asses or other sorts of milk if it were not needless to tire the reader with so many illustrations of a thing that is so clear and evident  when scorbutic people and old men who are naturally subject to a salt and foul corruption of the humors and likewise such as are infected with a venereal taint are afflicted with dangerous ulcers that seem to resemble cancers even in these terrible symptoms a very speedy and sure relief may be had from asses milk and the whey of it which as it is evident from all the abovementioned arguments is likewise confirmed by the authorities of many authors both ancient and modern dioscorides recommends milk mixed with honey or salt in all sorts of ulcerations in general as well inward as outward for violent itching in the skin pimples and foul humors of the body galen advises the use of asses milk for ulcers in the uterus the reins the bladder and pudenda to these we may add the assertion of sylvaticus that asses milk drank for thirty or forty days together not only entirely cured a cancerous swelling in the neck of the uterus but also a venereal ulcer attended with a consumption and slow fever again the same author commends the same remedy for the cure of that herculean distemper the elephantiasis in these words asses milk drank every morning to the quantity of a quart with a little sugar and cream of tartar to render it purgative is a very excellent remedy for the elephantiasis and ambrose parey in his book of surgery says he has known by experience the admirable efficacy of asses milk in cancerous ulcers both taken inwardly and applied outwardly in fomentations  and while we are enumerating the many noble virtues of asses milk we must not omit its peculiar excellence not only as a remedy to the distempers of old men but as a sort of food of great efficacy in restoring their decayed strength with regard to its medicinal excellence in relieving old age we have elsewhere shown at large that in an advanced age the blood and all the juices contract a great degree of foulness and corruption from obstructions in the excretory glands and vessels whence in time proceeds variety of distempers the most remarkable of which are indigestion languidness in the limbs consumption of the solids a low fever and pruritus and all these are to be relieved by a proper use of milk and on this account it has always been held in great esteem both by the ancients and moderns for it is very efficacious in rendering the humors fluid when they are too thick in diluting those that are salt and acrid in relaxing the too rigid and tense fibers and in restoring the excretions when disturbed to their proper order as it not only cleanses the foul juices but likewise breeds a proper supply of good ones it will be sufficient for the present purpose to produce the authority of trallian who strongly recommends asses milk to old people who are under a consumptive wasting and the reason he gives for it is because they have but a small share of strength and are neither able to separate nourishment from common food nor to distribute it through the constitution wherefore the milk of women is first to be preferred and next to it that of asses  if we enquire into the nourishing and analeptic property of asses milk by which it retards the decays of old age and restores the strength of those who have been reduced by distempers no body can hesitate to give the preference to this kind of milk above any others  but it may not perhaps be disagreeable or improper to produce the authority of authors of great credit who have treated of this subject i shall begin with the recommendation that helmont gives of it who although in other parts of his writings he condemns the use of milk yet in libr de digest aliment ascribes a particularly refreshing invigorating and nourishing property to that of asses supposing that the ass as a longlived animal is furnished with milk preferable to any others eryphon as herodotus relates relied altogether on asses milk for restoring old and emaciated people i myself also knew an officer of the army who was restored to his former health and ease by asses milk though he was almost entirely wasted away with the venereal distemper and excruciating pains that had afflicted him for several years heurnius also relates that asses milk prevents old age and wrinkles for which reason no doubt it was that poppaea the wife of nero always ordered a hundred asses to be kept that she might bathe every day in their milk to preserve her skin white soft and smooth  having now explained the property of asses milk and its excellence in several disorders i shall proceed to the proper method of giving it and then show what is necessary to be observed in order to expect success from it but it will first be proper to say somewhat of the animal itself a milch ass ought to be quite free from any disorder not very old but of a middle age neither too fat nor too lean and may be esteemed the better if she bring her foal in the month of may she ought not to be fed in a house but kept in meadows which produce plenty of medicinal herbs she should drink river water which as it is lighter and more diluting than spring water passes off quicker by the proper discharges and mixing more thoroughly with the humors cleanses them more effectually helmont has an ingenious remark on this subject he advises that the ass should be combed or curried every morning as horses are for that it may easily be known from the milk whether she has been dressed that morning or not without doubt there may be some reason for this because the use of the currycomb increases perspiration and cleanses the humors by passing off a great many saline particles that way  it ought to be considered too what the ass is fed with because the nature and properties of the milk of animals is altered by their diet so as to be more or less wholesome or even adapted to some particular disorders for as it is a common practice to make a purging or alterative medicine given to the nurse communicate its properperties to her milk and take effect on the child so no doubt the same will hold good in regard to the animals whose milk we use galen proves this by the instance of goats who are fed with scammony or spurge whose milk is purging dioscorides and hippocrates are of the same opinion and in the acta haffniensia it is asserted that wormwood eaten in large quantities makes the milk bitter from hence it is that coelius aurelianus commends milk in the coeliac passion or flux which is taken from goats that feed on willows vine leaves oaks or sallows plaintain and plants of the same nature giving this reason for it because the astringent quality of the herbs communicates itself to the milk but there is a remarkable difference between the milk which is produced in spring from green pasture and that in winter from dry food varro who was very well acquainted with what belong to country affairs was of this opinion and says that milk from barley and stubble and all kinds of hard and dry food is nourishing but that is more cleansing which comes from green pasture and dioscorides thinks that milk in spring is thinner and because it comes from green pasture more laxative and softening  from whence it plainly appears that milk of all sorts but more especially asses is not only most serviceable in the spring but that its virtues may by a regulation of food be so prepared as to be particularly effective against any one distemper wherefore i should advise that a milch ass be fed with such herbs as in themselves are known proper for the disease you would relieve in a consumption and diseases of the lungs and breast let her be supplied with veronica ground ivy the blind or dead nettle coltsfoot scurvy grass or if you want to restore the vigor of the solids with sanicula tansey nummularia consolidamajor flowers of st johnswort alchimilla polygonum and the like or let the creature be drove to places where these plants abound in pains and spasms both inward and external it may be useful to mix in her food yarrow chamomile flowers acacia meadwort tilia melilot spurge mallows marsh mallows and others of this nature in slow and hectic fevers besides those we named as good for the lungs we may add plantane prunella and scurvy grass mixed with germander if the hypochondria are obstructed and cause a scorbutic foulness in the juices choose out some herbs of the opening or laxative kind such are fumitory the lesser centaury absinthium scurvy grass trefoil watercress nasturtium and the lesser houseleek in the same manner may milk be rendered medicinal and fit for almost any complaints by administering such herbs and flowers as the physician shall esteem most proper and effectual  as to the method of using it these following rules may be observed    in cases of necessity asses milk may be drank at all times but it is by far the most serviceable in the spring and summer when all the herbs are full of juices and greatly enrich the milk   the milk should be milked into a pail set over hot water and immediately put into a vessel that has a narrow mouth and shuts close and so drank directly while it is warm for milk like all other liquors has a subtle spirit of a strengthening and invigorating quality which by no means ought to be allowed to fly off with its warmth hence galen orders that milk be drank instantly and the animal brought to the patients bedside for that its nature like that of the semen is at once altered by the open air   the morning is the best time of day to drink as it will operate the easier in an empty stomach and therefore no other food ought to be taken in four or five hours after it yet if circumstances require a frequent repetition of it if may be drank in the afternoon but it should be about four hours after dinner has been digested and in but half the quantity that is drank in the morning   it is impossible to prescribe in general any fixed quantity that should be used because of the difference of ages constitutions and distempers but thus far may be said that you ought never to exceed the quantity of three common pints   the time of continuing it must be directed by the degree and strength of the distemper if that be very obstinate it were well to continue drinking it for three months or longer especially if a favorable prospect appears of success and the violence of the symptoms abate very discernably  yet a prudent and experienced physician will so order regulate and methodise the use of this medicine as almost to insure success and avoid any hurtful consequences i shall therefore conclude with a few cautions that should be observed very accurately    before a course of milk is begun the state and condition of the stomach must be carefully inquired into whether it will bear milk and have a sufficient degree of strength to concoct digest and then discharge it for if that be weak and infirm if it be troubled with wind and phlegm or be loaded with a crowd of acid humors milk must not be taken because until these things are remedied that will curdle and stagnate and corrupt and increase the flatulence and uneasiness it will be proper therefore to cleanse and relieve the stomach first either downwards by a gentle dose of manna or where the case will allow by a vomit with a grain or two of emetic tartar   great care must be had that the milk be not turned to curd and therefore where the food is apt to grow acid in the stomach as is the case with old and hypochondriac people it is advisable to give absorbent earthy and alcaline medicines mixed with the milk adding likewise some stomachic carminative essence or volatile oily salt   when the patient has drank milk for six or eight days a gentle dose of manna should be given to purge the bowels and carry off whatever foulness the stomach may have contracted that the farther efficacy of the milk be not retarded   it is best to drink it at first sparingly three or four ounces and then to increase the draught gradually that the stomach be not too suddenly oppressed and conceive a dislike and loathing to the remedy   a proper regulation of diet must be observed during the course of milk the lightness of food must be chiefly consulted avoiding not only meats hard of digestion but also those that are reckoned to afford little nourishment and likewise all flatulent victuals summer fruits and acids of all kinds abstaining from all malt liquors and wines except a small quantity of the soundest spanish wines nor should any bread be used that is lumpish and fermented but what is made of the cleanest and finest wheat flour  in the last place let me add some instances wherein the use of milk may be judged improper in headaches arising from crudities in the stomach in very acute fevers and when the bowels are overcharged with gross blood milk is very pernicious being no less improper when the stomach is cold and filled with acids than when in a heat and ferment as it is in fevers and when the bilious humors abound because in both cases it quickly turns to a foul and offensive putrid state milk is also very prejudicial to those who either through neglect of bleeding or a total suppression of the discharge of the piles or the menses are afflicted with a too great and unnatural share of blood and consequently with a foulness of the humors which agrees entirely with the observation of hippocrates that the more you nourish distempered bodies the more you injure them for unless the excess of blood be reduced by moderate bleeding and the faulty digestion amended by medicines that correct the whole mass of fluids all sorts of milk must be avoided as extremely hurtful and dangerous  finis thi day is published price  s bound in one volume octavo the second edition beautifully printed of hippocrates upon air water and situation
