nw view of carlisle castle from a drawing in the possesion of tr maunsell esquire james lowes sculp   plan of the city of carlisle and places adjacent from a drawing in the possesion of j r maunsell esquire  map of carlisle  the city of carlisle the traveller approaching from the south has the best view of the city seated on a fine eminence gradually emerging from an extensive plain of rich cultivated land the waters of the frith are seen on the one hand with the adjacent levells the back ground of the landscape is beautifully variegated by the irregular swells of the whole scotch promontory extending toward the irish sea the walls strengthened with an arrangement of buttresses at irregular distances lies upon one angle to the view in part concealing the houses of the city and boldly overtoped by the square tower of the castle and the august and solemn structure of the cathedral this view of carlisle is the more striking as there is no adjacent eminence from which cause the city looks more majestic as it crowns so beautiful a plain  the city is walled round the fortifications toward scotland appearing the most modern they are formed of better squared stones than several other parts of the works the east and south sides are supported by a multitude of buttresses which we presume have been built up occasionally to strengthen the decaying parts of the wall it is watered by three fine rivers the eden on the north the peterill on the east and caude on the west there are three gates to the city which from their different aspects are called the english irish and scotch gates on the approach from penrith on the south you enter the english gates on the approach from wigton on the southwest is the irish gate and the scotch gate to the north opens upon the bridges the walls are embrazured but without any earthwork the english gate is guarded by a very strong machicolated gate flanked by circular towers of great strength the guns mounted therein in several tiers would effectually sweep every approach this gateway with its towers and other works is commonly called the citadel an oblong with three round bastions  pennant  the ancient entrance into the city was through the citadel and was erected by the order of king henry viii the castle consists of various works but being kept up as a garrisoned place we conceive it imprudent to describe them minutely there were several officers appointed to this fortress viz a governor deputy governor townmajor engineer barrackmaster storekeeper head gunner three quarter gunners and a person to buy in and deliver out coals and candles to the garrison for many years prior to      the governor of this city was chosen from one of the representatives in parliament and most of the subordinate places in the garrison were given to the freemen of the city and generally members of the corporation so that frequently the chief magistrate was a quarter gunner  l for a list of the governors see page       the donjon or great tower more properly deserves the title of the citadel being surrounded by the other works it is square and very lofty and the walls of vast strength and thickness being constructed agreeably to the old modes of defense before the use of cannon it was strengthened by a draw bridge over a wide ditch and defended by modern works a half moon battery mounted with cannon and a very large platform also mounted with cannon under cover of the outward wall the top of the tower being embrazured and lined with turf and mounted with large cannon this part of the fortress could make a good defense and sustain a formidable attack by a well of vast depth constructed within the great tower and said to be of roman work the supply of water for the garrison could not be cut off by an enemy this well is not unlike that in bambrough castle in northumberland and has been constructed at the same time the great tower was built in the gates of the castle is still remaining the old portcullis and here are shown the apartments of mary queen of scots where she was lodged some time after her landing at workington and after being for a little space entertained with flattering respect found herself prisoner to her jealous rival   in the outer castle is a fine grass plot a garden and governors house  but it will be expected by our readers that we give a more particular description of this city and collect the historical facts relative to it  the name of carlisle has been deduced by several authors from different etymologies the british chronicle informs us this city was built by a british potentate called luel leland says the irishmen call bale a town and so peradventure did the old scotts thus might be said that lugabalia sounds luelstown lel itin v vii p     in lelands collectaniae vol ii p    extract from the   th chapter of the  st book of galfridus qui ut properitate regni usus est in aquilonari part britanniae civitatem aedificavit quam de nomine ejus caerleil vocant leil alias luel filius bruti cog viridis scuti condidit caerliel   the romans called it lugovallium or luguballum from its situation on severus wall and from the troops and people garrisoned there ptolemy calls it leucopibi nennius caer lualid the saxons retained the old name luel the welsh writers give it the name of the city of duballus some derive the name from the ancient british llugydagwal which implies an army by the wall from whence it is asserted the romans framed their appellation of lugovallium others from lagus or lucus which in the language of the celtae and britains signified a tower and which with the roman compound expressed a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum to the saxon name was added the word caer or city and from these caer leuel the present name of carlisle seems to come by an easy corruption it is reasonable to apprehend that in so fine a situation on the confluence of three rivers and the grand estuarie of the frith this place was of some strength and distinction before the coming of the romans it will naturally follow that the name was given antecedent to the building of severus wall or the vallum of hadrian and we conceive that leland points out the most probable etymology camden and his editors have taken great pains on this subject the romans and britains called it luguvallum and luguballium or luguballia the saxons as bede writes luel ptolemy as some think lucopibia which seems rather to be a corruption of  i e white houses and to be candida casa or whithorn in galloway nemicus caer lualid the ridiculous welsh prophecies the city of duballus we carlisle and the latins from the more modern name carleolum for that luguballia and carlisle are the same is universally agreed by our historians but as to the etymology what pains has our countryman leland taken about it and at last he is driven upon this shift that ituna might be called lugas and that ballum came from vallis a valley and so make luguvallum as much as a valley upon the luge but to give my conjectures also i dare affirm that the vallum and valia were derived from that famous military vallum of the romans which runs hard by the city for antoninus calls luguvallum ad vallum and the picts wall which was afterward built on the wall of severus is to be seen at stanwicks a small village a little beyond the eden it passed the river over against the castle where in the very channel the remains of it namely great stones appear to this day also pomponius mela has told us that lugus or lucus signified a tower among the old celtae who spoke the same language with the britains for what antoninus calls lugo augusti is in him turris augusti so that luguvallum both really is and signifies a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum upon this foundation if the french had made their lugdunum signify a tower upon a hill and their lucotetia so the ancients called what we call lutetia a beautiful tower for the words import so much in the british they might possibly have been more in the right than by deriving the latter from lutum dirt and the former from one lugdus a fabulous king as to the present name carlisle the original of this is plain enough from the british caer a city and lual luel lugubal leil or luil according to the several appellations ancient or modern importing as much as the town or city of luul etc mr goughs additions are dr gale derives it from lle an army and gual the wall as lugdunum from llu and dun a hill for tacitus says the lyonnois called themselves a roman colony and part of the army lugo augusti in mela is turris augusti the saxon chronicle says that rufus after placing a garrison here returned into the south and sent hither myccle  which bishop gibson in his edition of the chronicle had translated a great multitude of english but in his camden proposes reading  q d husbandmen as better agreeing with the tillage there mentioned and all the records ascribe the first improvement of the country to this colony  in dr todds ms we have several quotations relative to the etymology of the name from itin antiron ptolemys geog bid etc which are comprised in what is set forth in the text     it has been the opinion of several judicious visitants that the river eden has shifted its course and channel since the time of the romans and that formerly it passed nearer to the castle for it should seem an inconsistent task for that wise people to make their work traverse a rapid and broad river otherwise than in a direct line both mr horsley and mr warburton join in this opinion  it may safely be determined that the romans found this a place of some importance but that it was in their time rather a place of recess after the toils of warfare were over than a place of chief strength appears from the vicinity of stanwix the station in course upon the wall it is not to be doubted but caerluel was fortified as it lay too near the borders not to be subject to perils and alarms but we have no roman authorities to denominate it a regular roman city or station as we find those nearest to the wall on the south were olenacum now called old carlifle near wigton and bremetenracum called old perith the words of camden and his editors are that this city flourished in the time of the romans appears plainly enough from the several evidences of antiquity which they now and then dig up and from the frequent mention made of it by the writers of those times and even after the ravages of the picts and scots it retained something of its ancient splendour and was accounted a city that it was a place of strength in the time of the romans is evident not only from the mention of it in the accounts they took of britain when they had made it a province of the empire but also from roman mounments and inscriptions that have been some time dug up here one whereof is mentioned by malmsbury p     to have been discovered in the time of william rufus  hector bothis if any credit may be given to him relates that voada queen of the britons with the assistance of one colledus king of the scotts and caractacus king of the picts once upon a time destroyed the roman provinces and that the silures joined with them that in the engagement bnt calessium the strongest city of the britons killing the citizens and razing the very foundations that maximius a noble roman married her daughter and called the neighboring country west maria from his own name so that if this story be true the foresaid monument may have been erected for him  dr todds ms     we have no authority to determine what was the size or form of this place in distant antiquity leland says in his itinerary vol vii p    the hole site of the town is sore chaungidq for whereas the streets were and great edifices now be vacant and garden plottes the cite of cairluel stondeth in the forest of ynglewood the cite is in compace scant a mile and is walled with a right fair and strong wall ex lapide quadrato subrufo in diggyng to

for seals and in other places of cumberland in plewhyng has be fownde brickes conteynyng the prints of antique works  after the retreat of the romans we may naturally conceive this city would soon be evacuated by the britons and destroyed and laid waste by the northern nations who made constant irruptions and at length extended their rapine and devastation into the southern and interior parts of britain till repressed by the coming in of the saxon allies it would even be a considerable time after their introduction before they could extend their arms to these western parts during this period and in the darkness in which the history of those ages is involved we are left to conjecture that this now flourishing city lay in ashes and ruin till  egfrid possessing the diadem of northumbria carried his conquest to the western ocean the britons in this mountainous country long retained their natural ferocity and supported their uncivilized liberty and independance egfrid had cumberland as a tributary province of his kingdom and from that period we gain some degree of certainty in the history of this place bid says that northumberland and the picts scotts and britons in the northern parts were in perfect peace one with another in the year of god     and that there was such respect and reverence given to religion that persons of the best quality desired to be admitted to the offices of the church but not long after this the britons or cumbees who had been scattered in these parts ever since the recess of the roman legions began to unite themselves under a government of their own calling their province or kingdom cumberland or the land of the cumbri  dr todds ms   the first certain account we have of carlisle is in the seventh century of the christian era it appears that in egfrids reign it became a place of considerable strength and consequence he having caused it to be rebuilt and fortified with a wall he is also said to have repaired the church restored divine worship and placed in it a college of secular priests  gent mag      p     camden says in     egfrid king of northumberland gave it to the famous st cuthbert in these words i have likewise bestowed upon him the city called luguballia with the lands fifteen miles about it and quotes symeon dunelm this is a palpable error for cuthberts consecration was in     the words of symeon are et quia illa terra minus sufficiens erat lugubaliam que luel vocatur in circuita xv miliaria habentum in augmentum suscepit ubi etiam sanctimonialium congregatione stabilita reginam dato habitu religionis consecravit et inprofectu divinae servitutis scolas instituit vide vol ii of northumberland p   0 the grant at length dated     lel col v i p     bid says the citizens carried cuthbert to see the walls of their city and a well of admirable workmanship built in it by the romans several writers of st cuthberts life tell us of that holy mans founding here a d     a convent of monks a school and an abbey of nuns but from bedes life of st cuthbert cap    it seems as if the monastery here to which queen emenburga retired was in being before st cuthberts coming to carlisle  in the northwest corner of the forest of englewood stands the ancient city of carlisle it lay waste for the most part of  00 years before the conquest saving a few cottages among the ruins inhabited by irish and scots after the danes had wasted the country with sire and sword william rufus returning that way from alnwick when he had made peace with the king of scotland seeing the place to be of strength convenient to entertain his forces at any time against scotland commanded the same to be rectified and to be fortified with walls and with a castle this was about the latter end of his reign but he was prevented by an untimely death before he could perform all that which he intended for the good of the city yet he placed there a colony of dutchmen which were shortly thence translated into the isle of anglesey by him or his next successor henry beauclerk his brother and instead of them a new regiment of southern men of essex kent middlesex and other parts of the realm were brought to supply their place and to inhabit the counties of northumberland and westmorland under the leading of ranulph de meschines sisters son to hugh lupus or loup first earl of chester  tanner   after egfrids having restored the city and fortified it with a wall it became an appendage to the sea of lindisfarn by the royal gift thereof to st cuthbert and so continued till the year    0 when king henry i constituted it a separate bishopric by dugdales monasticon it appears that in  0   in the acts of william carilepho bishop of durham it was styled part of the diocese of the bishop of durham it is asserted that in  0   william the conqueror issued his mandate to the inhabitants of cumberland at large and of carlisle in particular that they should continue subject to the bishop of durham as their diocesian from whose predecessors they had received christianity  so far we are allowed to speak of this city from the loose records of antiquity from the time of the conquest we have more certainty and evidence of undeniable authenticity to guide us camdens description of the site of carlisle is to this purport between the confluence of these rivers peteril and cauda the ancient city of carlisle has a delightful pleasant situation bounded on the north with eden on the east with peteril and on the west with caude and besides these natural fences it is fortified with a strong stone wall a castle and citadel it is of an oblong form from west to east to the west is a pretty large castle which was built by william the second and repaired by king richard iii as should seem by the arms the period of time between the reign of egfrid and the coming of the danes affords a sufficient number of years to support a presumption that this place would greatly improve in importance and power before the progress of those ravagers but the advance only served to aggrandize its woe for when those invaders had possessed themselves of these northern parts we find carlisle again smoking in her ashes when they had laid waste northumberland their violence was suffered to proceed as far as this city and lay it in utter ruin burning the town throwing down the walls and killing man woman and child the inhabitants being then very numerous in that state it was left for near  00 years without an inhabitant but some few irish who lodged themselves among the ruins the very foundations of the city were so buried in the earth that it is said large oaks grew upon them and this is not only attested by our historians but also made out by some discoveries that have been lately made of large unhewn oak trees buried  0 or    feet below ground one of which was found by mr robert jackson alderman in digging for a well which round timber can be no other but some of the old monumental oaks that stood upon the walls as marks and witnesses of their utter ruin and destruction bid dr todds ms and so complete was the destruction that she lay overwhelmed in her desolation till the time of william the conqueror when one of his followers is said to have rebuilt some parts of the city founded or restored the ancient religious society there and dedicated the house to the honor of the blessed virgin of which he became the chief and in consequence of these pious works it was that the conqueror issued the foregoing mandate in which carlisle was particularly specified that this body of religious should be subject to the episcopal jurisdiction of durham as were the adjacent lands of northumberland  king william rufus but all the ecclesiastical buildings with the city and adjacent country being laid waste in the danish wars the city was rebuilt and fortified by king william rufus and walter a norman priest being made by that king governor of the city began a monastery to the honors of the blessed virgin mary which was finished and endowed by king henry i who placed therein regular canons of st austin  gibsons came  gul rufus rex angliae restauravit cairleul  lel col vol i p      ex lib  th hen

eastern and seeing the infant works of walter proceeding prosperously he undertook to restore the city and caused many public buildings to be erected the whole of which he directed should be defended by a complete circumvallation and a strong fortress the care of executing his plan he consigned to walter and under his inspection it is alleged the works were carried on from the appearance of several parts of the fortifications one is led to determine they are the work of that era for the normans brought into this country some of the best workmen the island ever possessed as appears by the remains of many of the northern castles whose dates are well ascertained and there is so great a similitude of the form and mode of architecture in the great tower of the castle of carlisle that thence by a common observer its date may be ascertained in the sides of this tower in several parts are placed the arms of england but these seem to denote no more than the reparations made by the several sovereigns particularly king richard iii   it is said he first placed here a colony of flemings and most probably they were the artificers who raised the fortifications for soon after we read of the city being restored and walled with the defense of a fortress added thereto we find the flemings were removed to north wales and the isle of anglesea and the king replaced them with a colony of south britains men used to husbandry and the culture of lands who should till this part of the forest of inglewood which hitherto had lain in its original state and teach the natives the mode of reaping from the natural fertility of their country the many comsorts of life and the progressive treasures to be won by industry of which they do not from any thing mentioned by historians appear to have conceived a previous idea to this colony all the records existing attribute the first tillage that was known in the fertile plains of carlisle bishop gibson in his edition of camden speaking of the evidence touching this matter in the saxon chronicle says it has it  which at first sight should seem to be an error for  but in truth this seems rather to be an error of the librarian for  and on that supposition the words would imply that a great number of husbandmen were sent thither and not englishmen for before that time the inhabitants of carlisle were english and what follows in the saxon chronicle  strengthens the conjecture as expressing the errand upon which they were sent viz to cultivate those parts this was deep policy in william as it was introducing a certain employment which would naturally call together many settlers and render his kingdom less subject to annoyances from a northern enemy by the increase of population and consequent strength of the frontiers the cultivation introduced by william had not made so rapid a progress in the course of seventy years as to have cleared the neighborhood of carlisle of wood for by the charter of king henry ii the citizens had the privilege of taking fuel and building timber from the royal forest of carlisle  camden says lugubalia now grown populous had as they write its earl or rather lord ralph meschines from whence descended the earls of chester  after the death of richard earl of chester who was drowned with the kings children ranulph meschines removed to chester and was earl thereof presently after king henry i died and king stephen usurping the state gave this county to david king of scots to procure his aid against king henry ii right heirs to the late king as son to maud the empress daughter and sole heir to henry i but the scots secretly favored him for his rights sake and for that he had made the said henry fitz empress knight at carlisle yet accepting the gift of the county whereunto he pretended his own right before granted to his ancestors by the saxon kings he made his eldest son henry fitz david earl of huntington and carlisle which henry founded the abbey of holm cultram in the time of king stephen his father confirming the grant of the revenues wherewith he endowed that house and so his son malcom king of scots after david after henry fitz david and king stephen were dead king henry fitz empress took carlisle and the county from the scots and granted to the city the first liberties i hear of that they enjoyed after the conquest but his charter was burned by a casual fire that happened in the town which defaced a great part of the same and all the records of antiquity of that place  denton  the next person we read of in history who had the title of earl of carlisle was andrew de harcla whom king edward ii for his good services against thomas earl of lancaster and his adherents and for subduing those who were carlisle castle  in rebellion and delivering them prisoners to the king created him earl of carlisle the degradation and sentence of andrew harcla earl of carlisle for high treason taken from a ms entitled honor and arms p   vid stows chronicle  a d      et reg edw ii ao     about the feast of the purification of our lady andrew de herkeley late made earl of carlisle under color of peace found that he would marry robert bruise his sister whereupon the king reputed him tratour and caused him to be taken by his trustye frinde sir antonie de lucy who sent him in irons strait to london where he was judged before sir antonie de lucy in this manner he was led to the bar as an earl worthily appareled with his sword girt about him hosed booted and spurred etc unto whom sir antonie spoke in this manner sir andrew quoth he the king for thy valiante service has done thee great honor and made thee earl of carlisle since which time thoue as a tratour to thy lord the king leddest his people that should have help him at the battle of beighland away by the country of copland and through the earldom of lancaster by which means our lord the king was discomfited there of the scots through thy treason and falsenesse whereas if thoue had come betimes he had had the victory and this treason thou committest for the great some of gold and silver that thoue receavest of james dowglasse a scot the kings enemy our lord the king will therefore that the order of knighthoode by the which thou receavest all thine honor and wooreship upon thy body be brought to naught and thy state undoone that other knights of lower degree may after thee beware and take example hereafter truly to serve then commanded he to hew his spurs from his heels then to break his sword over his headde which the king had given him to keep and defend his land therewith when he made him earl after this he let uncloath him of his furred tabard and of his whoode of his coat of arms and also of his girdle and when this was done sir antonie said unto him andrew quoth he now art thou no knight but a knave and for thy treason the king will that thou shall be hanged and drawn and thy headde smitten offe from thy body thy bowels taken out of thy body and burned before thee and thy body quartered and thy headde being smitten offe afterward to be set upon london bridge and thy four quarters shall be sent unto four good towns of england that all other may beware by thee which was accordingly done   from the time of his degradation   th king edward iii the title of earl of carlisle was never revived till the restoration of king charles ii when charles howard son of sir william howard in the   th year of that reign was created lord dacre of gilsland visc howard of morpeth and earl of carlisle in reward for his having been highly instrumental in that

fortifications should so soon fall into such decay as to be in the state represented by that report in the reign of queen elizabeth it appears thereby that the works consisted of a donjon whose walls are twelve feet in thickness an inward and outward ward the walls of the outward ward nine feet in thickness and eighteen feet in height and the walls of the inner ward twelve feet having a half moon bastion a tower called the captains tower two gates one to each ward in the castle a great chamber and a hall but no storehouse for ammunition in the walls of the town three gateway towers a semicircular bastion called springold tower and add to these the citadel but besides those mentioned in the report the walls were garnished with several square towers particularly a tower at the western sally port and a tower called the tile tower of particular strength  before we quit the subject of the castle we must remark the beautiful and extensive prospect which you command from the great tower the foreground is formed of level meads washed by eden in one part insulated by a separation of the river this plot is ornamented by two fine stone bridges one of four the other of nine arches the great passage toward scotland the hanging banks are crowded with the village and church of stanwix and the distant ground filled with the mountains of bewcastle to the south you command the plains toward penrith shut in on either hand by a vast chain of mountains over which crossfell and skiddaw are distinctly seen greatly eminent to the east a varied tract of cultivated country scattered over with villages and hamlets mingling beautifully with woodlands on the extensive landscape the distant horizon formed by the heights of northumberland to the west the frith spreads out its the deaney from the citywall  swview of the fratry  carlisle  nwview of the cathedral  neview of the castle  gate of the castle  shining expanse of waters margined on this hand by a cultivated tract on the other by the scotch coast where creffel and a chain of mountains extend toward the ocean  the parts of the cathedral now remaining show that the old structure when it was entire was a noble and solemn edisice the body of the cathedral church is of an older building than the quyer and yt is as a filial derived from st oswalds fast by pontfret lel itin vol vii page     but since his days it has undergone great change as will be shown in the sequel the present edifice consists of the east limb of the cross being the chancel and the cross aile or transept with the tower the greatest part of the west limb of the cross having been pulled down in the civil wars      with the materials they erected a guardhouse at every gate of the city and one in the marketplace and two batteries in the castle the circular arches and massive round columns whose shafts are only fourteen feet two inches high and circumference full seven and a half pennant which remain of the west limb and transept are of the heaviest order of the saxon architecture and at the first sight testify the different ages in which this part and the chancel were erected indeed the architecture denotes an earlier era than the time of william rufus and probably here is a part of the work of the age of st cuthbert but there is no corroborating evidence to attend the mode of building which might prove so ancient a date the west end is said to have been in length     feet from the cross aile of which    feet remains it being dismembered of    feet it is not in our power to determine how often this church was restored it is evident that the danes laid this city in ashes and that king william rufus under his trusty nominee walter the magna bait has it that d king of scotland built a great part of this cathedral restored the city and the public buildings but so early as the reign of king henry h the city was laid waste by the scots and the public records were burnt which most probably agreeable to the custom of those days were deposited in the archieves of the ecclesiastics conceiving this to be the fact then we must admit of some considerable change in this sacred edifice for in      we are told an accidental fire consumed the church with half of the city to the number of   00 houses as far as the north gate in the reign of king edward iii it was rebuilt by contributions the editor of camdens words are almost in the middle of the city stands the cathedral church the upper part whereof being newer is a curious piece of workmanship built by king henry viii but the lower is much more ancient  the lower west part is the parochial church and as old as st cuthbert or as walter who came in with the conqueror was a commander in his army rebuilt the city founded a priory and turning religious became himself the first prior of it the chancel was built by contributions about the year    0 and the belfrey was raised and the bells placed in it at the charge of william de strickland bishop in the year   0  the expression used by this learned editor is so indefinite that we own we are not able to determine whether he meant to imply that king henry viii built the present chancel by a writer in the gentlemans magazine      p     it is said on the   th richard ii near   00 houses were destroyed with the cathedral and suburbs by an accidental fire and he adds this account is taken

made in the preceding reign but it was ten years before bishop strickland raised the belfrey which would have been an useless work when the church was in ruins these contradictions and ambiguities we are at present obliged to leave unsolved  the choir is     feet in length and with the side ailes    feet broad the cross aile or transept is    feet broad so that the length of the church when entire was exactly  00 feet within the choir is of fine gothic architecture with light columns remarkably beautiful the stalls are garnished with tabernacle work the organ is placed at the cross screen which contains but a narrow and low entrance and is a great injury to this fine edifice by late repairs it is greatly embellished being wainscotted with oak from the stalls round the whole east end of the choir in a simple style after the old order the open gates leading into the side ailes are old and much broken but show excellent light tracery work finely ornamented the bishops throne is not magnificent but yet elegant and stately the breadth of the choir and ailes being    feet corresponds well with the height which to the center of the ceiling is    feet the roof was originally lined or vaulted with wood painted and ornamented with arms and devices of the several patrons and contributors to the work with the arms of france and england were those of the piercys lucys warrens and mowbrays the old wood lining remains in the cross aile and shows what was the former figure and the ornaments of the choir but the outward roof and wood ceiling of the choir having gone greatly to decay when repairs were made in      the ceiling was stuccoed in the form of a groined vault which is a great advantage to its appearance the whole expense amounted to   00l toward which dean bolton contributed  0l bishop lyttleton  00l and the countess dowager gower  00l the rest was made up by the dean and chapter the east window is large being    feet in height and  0 in breadth ornamented with fine pilasters but it has no cast of solemnity by means of a border of colored glass thrown round it of yellow red and green which looks gaudy the official duties of marriages christenings churchings and funerals are performed in the parish church the ordinary duties of the sabbath and prayers twice a day through the year in the choir on the burial of any of the members of the choir the corpse is carried into that part of the church the cathedral and parish church are both under one roof it has a stately steeple with a ring of eight bells which are rung on all public occasions the consistory or spiritual court is kept in part of the church in the abbey contiguous to the church and in which properly the church stands are several venerable buildings such as the deanery sratery head school cloisters porters lodge etc  l     in the ailes on each side are some strange legendary paintings of the history of st anthony st cuthbert and st augustine one represents the saint visited

this chapel was on the south side of the church  the chapel of st alban in      was on inquiry found not to have been consecrated and thenceforth divine offices and sepulture were prohibited to be longer performed therein this appears by an entry in bishop weltons register on the dissolution king edward vi granted the lands and tenements appertaining to this chantry unto thomas dalston and william denton  bishop whelpdale founded a chantry and endowed it with  00l for holy offices for the souls of sir thomas skeleton knt and mr john glaston  there was a chantry of the holy cross but who

there is no attempt to explain what person was here interred it is possible the tomb was made antecedent to the building of the throne  the whole of this noble edifice is of red freestone ornamented with pilasters and pointed arches there have been some statues on the eastern turrets but they are mutilated and gone greatly to decay  no circumstances are come to our knowledge touching the religious foundations here before or in the time of st cuthbert other than the mention made of them by ancient writers probably they did exist as several persons speaking of st cuthberts life tell us he founded a d     a convent of monks a school and an abbey of nuns but from bedes life of that saint chap xvii it appears the nunnery here to which queen emenburga retired was existing before st cuthberts visiting carlisle mr dentons account of these religious foundations is to the following effect   when the city was replenished with people for to maintain better policy in the same and to inform the people instead of a nunnery which had been there before and which william rufus had translated thence and established at ainstaplighe or rather in recompense for the lands to that nunnery belonging had in the   st year of his age and the   th of his consecration a prelate who by gradual and well merited advancements having passed through every dignity to the episcopal supported that with an amiable assemblage of graces and virtues which eminently formed in his character the courteous gentleman and the pious christian and rendered him a shining ornament to his species his nation his order his deportment in all human relations and positions was squared by the rules of morality and religion under the constant direction of a consummate prudence whilst his equanimity amidst all events and occurrences in an inviolable adherence to the golden medium made him easy to himself and agreeable to others and had its reward in a cheerful life a serene old age a composed death his excellent pattern was a continual lesson of goodness and wisdom and remains in his ever reverable memory an illustrious object of praise and imitation founded another at ainstaplighe endowing the same with other revenues there king henry i founded a college of secular priests in the second year of his reign and made athwald his confessor or chaplain prior of st botophs first prior of carlisle dedicating the church to the honor of the blessed virgin mary and endowed them with the tithes of the churches then founded in the forest of englewood but being hindered by the tumults and troubles of his time he could not perfect all things before the   d year of his reign and then stricken with grief for the loss of his children that were drowned coming from normandy by the counsel of the prior athelwold and to appease god for his sins as he thought he erected a bishops see at carlisle and made the said athelwald first bishop thereof whom the archbishop of york named thurstan did consecrate in the year      and in his stead another chaplain of the said king henry named walter was made the second prior of that house who a little before his election had taken upon him by the kings license a religious habit viz of a regular canon there which order of canons the king and bishop athelwold had placed in that house banishing the secular priests immediately upon his consecration the said walter gave to the church of carlisle for ever in pure alms his lands in lynstock richardby crosby little crosby walby brunskeugh carleton little carleton and the wood and the churches or rectories of st cuthbert in carlisle and staynwings which the king had given him and the same gift was confirmed unto them both by the king and bishop athelwold  the rectory of st cuthberts in carlisle was founded by the former inhabitants of carlisle before the danes overthrew the city and by them dedicated to the honor of st cuthbert of duresm who of ancient times was lord of the same for fifteen miles about carlisle at the first foundation of the church every citizen offered a piece of money which was a coin of brass then current which they buried under the foundation of the church steeple there as was found to be true at the late reedifying of st cuthberts steeple a d  for when they took up the foundation of the old steeple they found well near a bushel of that money  after the said priors athelwold and walter succeeded john who gave watercroft in flimby to the lord of workington son of gospatrick and after john bartholomew who in the time of bishop hugh confirmed orton in westmorland

priory together with a mansion near st cuthberts church where at that time stood an ancient building called arthurs chamber taken to be part of the mansion house of king arthur the son of uter pendragon of memorable note for his worthiness in the time of ancient kings waldeive also gave other ancient buildings called lions yards often remembered in the history of arthur written by a monk the ruins whereof are still to be seen as it is thought at ravenglass distant from carlisle according to that author fifty miles placed near the sea and not without reason thought therefore to be the same  dentons ms  mr dentons account of the money found in rebuilding the sleeple of st cuthberts church is rendered uncertain by some late discoveries and it is most probable it was a concealed treasure intended to be secured against the danes or some other ravagers for when the foundations were making for the present new edifice and the workmen had gone below the foundations of the old church they discovered the remains of a still more ancient erection and took up several pieces of broken sculpture among the rest the figure of a nun with her veil or hood well cut and in good preservation which we saw in the garden of george mounsey esquire of carlisle so that it should seem the old nunnery stood there this sculpture is now lost  in mr mounseys and other gardens adjoining many foundations of houses fragments of pottery quantities of oakwood human bones etc have been dug up at various times this ground is upon the east side of english street and called the greyfriars and up the west side adjoining the walls from st cuthberts church to the jail is called the blackfriars and similar things have been dug up here also a few years ago in making a drain from a house here toward the walls the top of an arch was discerned some of the stones being removed we discovered a spacious arched room one side of which rested upon the walls in height    feet in breadth    feet and in length about  0 feet the end was narrower and lower and supposed to have been connected with other similar rooms but the partitions built up there were four funnels went upright to the footpath of the walls but covered at the top with slags and iron grates in the funnels on the opposite side between two of the arches a horizontal funnel about two feet wide and three feet high went toward the city this was searched a considerable way till the person was entangled with rubbish which choked it up beneath this passage the floor was flagged and walled in about    inches high on each side and a conduit went through the city walls on the opposite side of the vault this was opened by removing the earth on the out side about four feet deep and let out a great quantity of water which was lodged in the vault proceeding to remove the wet rubbish which was collected the workmen were interrupted by the gunner of the castle who assumed a higher power than mr mead the store keeper at whose instance the search was making and the place was immediately shut up and never since opened we have accurate drawings and measurements which we have deferred laying before the public till a full investigation of this mysterious place be made we are confident there are many other such kind of vaults in the neighborhood  the editors it seems that walters foundation was entirely a new one and

canons of the order of st augustine appointing athelwald his confessor and chaplain the first prior notwithstanding dentons account we are convinced there was a succession of thirty priors after athelwald before the time of the dissolution athelwald afterward being made bishop of this diocese was succeeded in the priory by walter another chaplain of the kings who had taken upon him the regular habit and being a rigorous disciplinarian he banished all the secular priests from that religious house priors   athelwald made first bishop of the sea   walter  he gave to this house his

henry viii    was instituted and founded by king henry i in the year      two and thirty years after the foundation of the priory by the gift of egfrid carlisle became a member of the sea of lindisfarne and followed the translation of that bishopric to chester and finally to durham the cause alleged for dismembering carlisle and constituting there a separate see was on account of the distance from durham then the seat of the episcopacy and the consequential delays of episcopal duties there according to camden the monks of durham looked upon this act of the sovereign as a grievous infringement of their ancient rights and privileges but from the abject disposition of mind peculiar to that age they avoided pointing the accusation where it was due and alleged that when ralph bishop of durham was banished and the church had none to protect it certain bishops joined carlisle and tiviotdale to their diocese it is observable this is the only episcopal chapter in england of the order of st austin  tanner  king henry constituted ethelwald or as he is some times called adeluph then prior there the first bishop of this new see and the church of st mary then became a cathedral church  episcopus i in the distant age in which the first bishop of carlisle arose little can be gathered of the virtues of memorable actions of men though even thus eminent this obscurity is greatest in a country which was almost a constant scene of military exploits depredations and bloodshed carlisle though a chief barrier against the scots suffered many changes of fortune and the life of its bishop was frequently disturbed and full of trouble from such causes there is but little historic matter handed down to us personally relative to this prelate and several of his immediate successors we find him indeed busy in one ecclesiastical matter in which he was immediately adversary to the will of his sovereign he was one of the electors of henry murdac abbot of fountanis to be archbishop of york the kings displeasure was such at this transaction that he denounced vengeance against all those who were concerned in it but such was this prelates contempt of the sovereigns menaces and selfconfidence that he received murdac as his metropolitan when he came to visit david king of scotland then resident in this city pryn vol i p     he departed this life a d      though some learned persons have affirmed that before the settlement of mortmain  th king edward i impropriations were very rare in england yet this bishop who died above an hundred years before the enacting that law confirmed the churches of wetheral and warwick st michael and st lawrence appleby kirby stephen ormeshead morland clibburn bromfield croglin and the hermitage of st andrew in the parish of kirkland to the abbot and convent of st marys york with this single proviso that the said abbot and convent should allow such a portion to the officiating minister as thereby he may be decently maintained and be able to pay his synodals   and was succeeded by  episcopus ii bernard of whom we know little but his episcopal acts  in      he dedicated the church of st mary magdalene of lanercost he remained bishop of carlisle to the time of his death which happened a d      from the long continued vacancy of the sea it appears evidently that it was in a sad unsettled state and full of discord and troubles as well as meanly revenued for by the register of wetheral it is shown that king henry ii being present at carlisle tendered the bishopric to paulinus de leedes and as such was even an early influence in the ecclesiastical affairs offered to augment the income with  00 marks out of the churches of bambrough and scarbrough with the chapel of tickhill and two manors adjacent to carlisle but even with such augmentations paulinus refused it in      the temporalties continuing in the kings hand the following particulars amongst others were brought into account at the treasury for oil for the sacrament at easter two terms and carrying the same from london to carlisle   l in work of the greater altarand avement in the church of st mary carlisle   s  d in work of dormitory of the canons   l   s  d   it continued vacant to the beginning of the   th century and king john gave the revenues of the bishopric to support the archbishop of sclavonia in   0  the pope intermeddled with the income of the sea granting it to the archbishop of regula who was obliged to abandon his own and was destitute of support this act of the papal authority was confirmed by the king the continued vacancy let in a flood of enormities among the religious here the canons publicly announced their contempt of the papal authority and the censures of his legate in defiance of all the interdicts and sentences denounced to the contrary they persisted in celebrating divine services and all holy offices of the sacraments but their arrogance and impropieties did not cease there they swore fealty to the king of scots an avowed enemy to the crown of england and one in open opposition to the authority of the holy see in consequence of these licentious acts they set up an interdicted and excommunicated clerk for their bishop contrary to the will of their lawful sovereign and the popes legate and seizing the revenues of the bishopric applied them according to their own will enormities like these were to be corrected with the severest measures the council of king henry iii applied to pope honorius iii totally to remove these offensive canons and place prebends in their room to augment the revenues of the sea which were so small that no able and loyal person would accept of the bishopric and to displace the person who had been thus obtruded to the episcopacy

rymer vol i p       in consequence of which application the legate gallo at the popes command and with the sovereigns assent constituted hugh bishop of this diocese he being at that time abbot of belieu and the canons were banished  episcopus iii hugh abbot of belieu the elect of gallo the legate came to this see when distracted with the offenses of the clergy yet we do not find that religion was the least abbetted by this prelate the manners of the religious were not improved or the errors of those under him reformed nay he seemed even doubtful of his own authority when in the grant made by him to the convent of st marys in york a d    0 he styles himself hugo dei gratia karleolensis ecclesiae vocatus sacerdos so the register of wetheral shows he had the favor of his sovereign and was one of his sureties in the treaty entered into with alexander king of scotland rymer vol i p   0 the pope was petitioned to assist in the restoration of the churches of penrith newcastle rothbury corbridge and whittingham to the sea and in the kings letters on this occasion he styles him fidelis noster cui multo tenemur debito  ac sanctae romanae ecclesiae devotissimus pryn vol ii p     there cannot be a more certain channel for obtaining the true history of any mans life than the writings of cotemporaries and neighbors by such this prelate so much devoted to the church as he is styled by the king is accused of alienating the possessions of the sea nay of making fraudulent distributions thereof and the chronicle of lanercost passes this dreadful sentence on his untimely death that by the just judgment of god he perished miserably at the abbey of le forte in burgundy as he was returning from rome even if this is the language of truth it is not that of charity and shocks the reader when he perceives it comes from the records of the scriptores of a religious house  there is a rancour in it that gives a jealousy some latent cause had dictated the severe asseveration and we find by the register of holm cultram that about the year    0 this bishop of carlisle caused the convent of lanercost to relinquish a reserved rent issuing out of the church of burgh upon sands as not having been obtained by canonical rules if such a cause dictated the rancorous condemnation and judgment what detestation ought we not to hold these impious men in  we do not find that the episcopacy of this place was to be better filled by the successor of hugh whose want of learning gave him even a name of disgraceful distinction that of malclerk  episcopus iv walter was consecrated a d       he appears in history before his episcopacy in an unpromising character the friend and intimate counselor of the base king john his ambassador to rome against the dissident barons and the instigator of those projects which rendered that sovereigns memory detestable for ever pryn vol iii p    yet we find him promoted by king henry iii to this see enriched by the grant of the manor of dalston to this in      by the kings charter was added the office of treasurer of the exchequer of england with power of executing that duty by deputy of his own nomination but walter held this distinguished office but a very short time though his charter contained an appointment for life he was discharged in a disgraceful manner without any cause assigned his grants the instruments of his office were ordered to be cancelled and he was fined  00l the king appointing peter de rival his successor and commanded s de segrave his justiciar to put him in possession of the treasury in case walter refused to deliver the keys and all things belonging thereto by inventory and view and testimony of true men the affections and frowns of princes are so fluctuating and uncertain and their causes so frequently arise from the secret influence of villains who sport with their sovereigns weaknesses that we should not from thence deduce the character of any man this reverse of fortune some attribute to the intrigues of peter bishop of winchester who had great influence with the king walter would have repaired to rome for redress but having got on board a vessel at dover he was arrested by the officers of the crown and brought on shore the bishop of london was a spectator of this outrage and immediately pronounced a sentence of excommunication against those concerned in this arrest and so earnestly did he engage in this business that he hasted to hereford where the king held his court and with the assistance of several bishops there present renewed his sentence matt paris     but it was not long before walter was restored to royal favor being a suitable instrument for the times in the power of his prince a d      he was a chief instrument in the contract entered into between the king and the earl of

on the   th of february      he being advanced to this see from the archdeaconry of bath he fell into an unhappy opposition to the sherift of cumberland which occasioned his representing to the lord chancellor on the accession of king edward i that the bishop had forbidden his tenants to make their fealty to the king the bishop soon vilified the false representation and showed that he had requested the sheriff by message to receive their fealty and made an avowal for himself and his tenants that they were ready to give every assurance of their duty and fidelity to his majesty the bishops character seems to be discovered by his taking occasion on the application of the abbot of holm cultram who had suffered a distress by the sheriff for the dues of the crown more through resentment than the necessity of the case to pronounce a sentence of excommunication against him which was revoked by the operation of a writ of prohibition on his death  episcopus viii ralph irton succeeded to the sea a d    0 he was elected by the prior and convent but it being alleged they had proceeded therein contrary to the ordinary rules of their privilege they were attached to answer the

cornu eburneum they have yet in the cathedral of carlisle a symbol very probably of some of king henry is grants to the priory but in none of those grants of which any copy is now extant do those tithes appear the ceremony of investiture with a horn or other like symbol is very ancient and was in use before there were any written charters we read of ulf a danish prince who gave all his lands to the church of york and the form of the endowment was this he brought the horn out of which he usually drank and before the high altar kneeling devoutly drank the wine and by that ceremony enfeossed the church with all his lands and revenues  king canute another dane gave lands at pusey in berkshire to the family of that name there with a horn solemnly delivered as a confirmation of the grant which horn it is said is still there to be seen  so king edward the confessor granted to nigel the huntsman an hide of land called derehide and a wood called halewood with the custody of the forest of bernewood to hold of the king to him and his heirs by one horn which is the charter of the said forest  so that not the danes only but the english saxons also were acquainted with this ancient custom thus ingulphus abbot of crowland who lived in the time of william the conqueror acquaints us that it continued down to his time he tells us that many estates were granted by word only without writing as by delivery of a sword an helmet a horn or cup or such like but this mode he says in after times was changed  ulfs horn at york when the reformation began in king edward the vis time was swept away amongst other costly ornaments and sold to a goldsmith who took away from it the tippings of gold wherewith it was adorned and the gold chain which was affixed to it fafter which time the horn itself out in ivory of an octagon form came into the hands of general fairfax who being a lover of antiquities preserved it during the confusions of the civil wars whose memory is deservedly honored for other generous actions of this nature such as allowing mr dodsworth the antiquarian a yearly salary to preserve the inscriptions in churches the giving his valuable manuscripts to the university of oxford and his preserving the public library there as he did the cathedral at york from being spoiled and defaced after the surrender of the city and he dying in      this horn came into the possession of his next kinsman lord fairfax who ornamented it anew and restored it to its ancient repository where it now remains a noble monument of modern as well as ancient piety  arcuaeologia       but the grants given in evidence not extending to such tithes either expressly or by implication the right was adjudged to the king and he afterward granted the same to the prior and convent as beforementioned  this bishop was in great confidence with his sovereign and received several marks of his royal favor he was joined in commission with the bishop of caithness to collect tenths within the kingdom of scotland he was one of the kings most confidential commissioners for adjusting the claims to the crown of scotland on the   th of june and   th of august      he appears a witness to the kings claim of right to the kingdom of scotland on the death of queen margaret which was subscribed at norham on the   th of may      rymer he was one of the plenipotentiaries empowered to contract prince edward with the beforementioned princess and was an active agent in many other of the most important state transactions of his time notwithstanding his coming to the sea in the singular manner he did we do not discover that he ever betrayed any undue influence of the holy see or any sinister attempts to aggrandize the papal authority in this country by acts which could infringe the rights of his sovereign or the people through any undue extention of the authority of rome here in march       be suffered great fatigue in his journey from london in deep snow where he had been to attend parliament he reached linstock where reposing himself after a little refreshment a blood vessel broke and suffocated him in his sleep he was succeeded by  episcopus ix john halton who was a busy man in spiritual as well as secular concerns he was one of the canons of carlisle and probably of the same political principles with his predecessor as we see him succeeding that prelate in the commission for determining the claims to the crown of scotland and he was present in november      when sentence was given for john baliol and he did homage for his kingdom pryn in      he was emissary of king edward to the court of scotland and had letters of safe conduct for his journey by the popes authority he was the collector of tenths in the scotch diocese he entertained the king and his train at his castle of rose for a considerable time he was governor of the castle of carlisle a d   0  and had the custody of the scotch hostages and prisoners he was joined in commission

he was petitioner to the pope for the canonization of sir thomas de cantelupe late bishop of hereford in   0  he was summoned to attend the coronation of king edward ii he was shut up in carlisle by the blockade formed by edward bruces forces in      and obliged to appear by proxy in the parliament at westminster in      in recompense of the many and great services and sufferings of the now aged bishop of carlisle king edward ii addressed the pope for the appropriation of the church of horncastle in the diocese of lincoln being in the patronage of the said bishop to his own use and to annex the same for ever to the bishopric of carlisle that he and his successors during the ravages of the neighboring enemy may have a place of refuge and out of the profits of the church may be able to support themselves some years before this the king had granted his own royal license insignificant as it seems without a confirmation from rome for the said appropriation and in the same year the bishop himself desires one of the cardinals to make the same intercession to the pope as also for a remission of the pension paid to the papal see out of the rectory  reo halton he was one of the plenipotentiaries of the king in the treaty of peace with robert brus in    0 which is the last public capacity out of his episcopal office in which we find him on record he departed this life a d      and was succeeded by  episcopus x john ross      who was imposed upon this see by the arbitrary disposition of the pope contrary to the election of the chapter who had nominated william de ermya canon of york and which election had received royal confirmation  he was of a refractory and contentious disposition and though not employed in a political capacity had business enough upon his hands in his disputes and litigatious with his clergy he disturbed the prior and convent in the enjoyment of their revenue seized their tents and other effects and interfered with their appropriate churches insomuch that they were obliged to appeal to the sea of rome from whence a delegation was sent to the prior of durham to hear and determine the complaint as he was avaricious and refractory so was he malevolent and revengeful for taking advantage of some slight omission in the prior of carlisle not paying up certain tenths or other dues he pronounced sentence of excommunication the dreadful scourge which was put into the hands of such men by the powers of the church  he died at rose castle a d      the sea was immediately supplied by  episcopus xi john kirby prior of carlisle being elected and confirmed  th of may      he came to this episcopacy in a most unhappy era both in regard to the public troubles and agitations in the state and the litigious and unhappy disposition of the clergy he was continually subject to alarms from the scots in consequence of the king of englands unfortunate expeditions and unsuccessful arms and added to this he had gained the contempt and hatred of that people before the advancement to the sea so that it is said his ordinations were held in very distant quarters of the kingdom and he was frequently out of this diocese and to render his life still more distressful he was involved in innumerable suits with his clergy soon after followed a demand for a provision for one of the kings clerks edwardus dei gratia etc venerabili in christo

seems to be well founded for notwithstanding the st  st k ed   c  0 whereby the king grants that from henceforth he will no more such things desire but where he ought  yet by the common law the king as founder of archbishopricks bishoprics and many other religious houses had a corodyor pension in the several foundations a corody for his valets who attended him and a pension for a chaplain such as he should specially recommend till the respective possessor should promote him to a competent benefice     in      he was beset by ruffians as he passed through penrith who would have assassinated him and in the fray several of his retinue were wounded k reg in the month of october his palace of rose castle was burnt by the scots and the adjacent country swept of its cattle and flocks the crops destroyed and the whole adjoining lands laid waste chron laner he had great trouble in the collection of tenths he suffered a severe sentence from the court at york upon his refusing an established vicar to st marys in carlisle he was a defaulter in the payment of a large sum to the pope for tenths in lincolnshire for which he suffered suspension and excommunication but in      we find him again acting in the public capacity of commissioner with richard bishop of durham and others to treat with the scots touching the settlement of peace and commerce in      he was appointed to attend the princess joan to alphonsus king of castisle her contracted confort for which he was allowed five merks a day as board wages out of the kings exchequer  he departed this life a d      he was succeeded by  episcopus xii gilbert welton a person consecrated by the arbitrary authority of the sea of rome contrary to an election made by the chapter under the royal license and confirmation of the prior of carlisle john de horncastle but the king was pleased to revoke those powers in compliance with the dictates of the holy see and to confirm the consecration of gilbert  he was one of the commissioners appointed by the king to treat for the ransom of david king of scotland and for the establishment of peace between the two nations in      he was joined with thomas de lucy as wardens of the western marches and in the succeeding years was one of the commissioners in the memorable treaties for acknowledging david king of the scotch dominions and for making a renunciation of king edwards claim of sovereignty over the crown of scotland  he died in the latter end of the year      and was succeeded by  episcopus xiii thomas appleby who under the kings license was elected by the prior and convent out of their own canons but by an interposition of the papal authority the election was annulled and he came to the sea by provision from the holy see   th of january       he appears in several commissions of great moment and was joined with several men of high rank in the wardenship of the west marches and shortly before his death he was in the commission for proclaiming on the borders the articles of a truce concluded with france and scotland his particular character is not delivered down to us he appears to have been peaceful with his clergy and steady in his loyalty  he departed this life a d      the chapter with the usual license proceeded to an election for a successor and they accordingly chose one william strickland but here the pope showed an absolute disapprobation and refused to consecrate him and of his own nomination placed in this see  episcopus xiv robert reed a d      who was translated to chichester in the course of the same year and was succeeded in carlisle by  episcopus xv thomas merks  we have no evidence before us whether he was the nominee of the chapter or otherwise he was one of the monks of westminster and a great adherent to the unhappy monarch richard ii in whose will he was named an executor the history of that particular era is not wanted to show the reader from what principles he stood an advocate in parliament for the deposed king his attachment was so warm and his temper so regardless of every thing but truth that in the first sessions under king henry iv he pronounced the severest condemnations on the measures and the men by which the revolution had been effected and even treated the reigning prince with that derogation and contempt that he was committed for high treason and deprived of his bishopric tyndal rymer on the   d of january a d   00 the king consented he should be removed from the tower to westminster this relaxation of offended majesty was soon after followed by a permission under letters patent to obtain from the pope in benefices of the court of rome appointments of the yearly amount of an hundred merks but episcopacy was excepted in   0  we find him get institution to the rectory of todenham in gloucestershire the king made his petition to the holy see that the bishopric of carlisle might be supplied by the consecration of  episcopus xvi william strickland who in      had been rejected by his holiness and who now came to this see   th of august   00 it cannot be doubted from the channel by which he had his advancement that he was a strict adherent to the interests of the reigning prince and accordingly we find his name among the prelates who subscribed the act of succession and assurance of the crown of england to the sons of king henry we also find him in the commission issued for the arrest and imprisonment of all persons professing their dissatisfaction in the then settlement of the crown and who to encourage faction and disorder caused it to be reported that king richard ii lately deposed and dead was still living within the dominions of scotland by means of which evil reports the late adherents of that monarch were spirited up to tumult and rebellion in fact this was a commission of persecution the family of the unhappy monarch deposed had considerable interests and connections of blood in the northern parts and also much power so that this commission was sent forth as a scourge at once to repress and humble them and also to put them in the power of the minions of a court whose interests on such occasions may well be devised and whose use of such an instrument is known  bishop strickland departed this life on the  0th day of august a d      after having held the sea near twenty years he was interred in the cathedral of carlisle his monument and effigies being in the north aile he was succeeded by  episcopus xvii roger whelpdale of a cumberland family a man allowed by all writers of great learning he had his education in baliol college oxford where he gained a fellowship he removed into queens college where he was made provost and on the   th of october      he was elected bishop of this diocese having previously obtained the provision of the sea of rome in his favor his election followed of course  as bishop of carlisle we do not find him an active character in church or state the dispositions made by his will were to pious uses and his writings though not numerous were well received in the age he appeared in  he died in january a d      and was succeeded by the translation of  episcopus xviii william barrow from the sea of bangor by the sole authority of rome he was doctor of canon law and chancellor of the university of oxford  we have few materials from whence to deduce his character whilst he held this bishopric we find him named in the commission for entering into a truce with the scots at hawden stank rymer and in      he appears among the bishops who protested against cardinal beauforts executing the office of prelate of the garter at windsor on st georges day in right of his bishopric at winchester  he departed this life on the   th day of september a d      at his castle of rose and was buried in the cathedral of carlisle his successor was  episcopus xix marmaduke lumley who had election by the chapter but for want of the popes consent had not restitution of the temporal rights of the sea till the   th of april      he was one of the noble family of lumley in the county of durham  he suffered great injuries and losses by the depredations committed by the scots repeatedly within his diocese insomuch that it is said he was straitened to support his episcopal dignity in the year      upon allegation by the kings sergeants and attorney general that such archbishops and bishops of england as had heretofore accepted of the cardinals that were thereupon deprived of their prelacies here and praying that the like judgment might be given for the king in the present case of henry beaufort bishop of winchester the bishops and other lords of parliament unanimously agreed that the ancient rights of the crown in this case ought to be maintained and preserved but forasmuch as the said cardinal was nearly related to his majesty that the cardinal should be fairly heard and that till this should be done search should be made in the records of the kingdom the different of the bishop of carlisle is entered on the foot of the record thus the bishop of carlisle differed in his answer from the rest and held that until the coming of the cardinal nothing at all ought to be done in the affair in      he was one of the commissioners to treat with the delegates of scotland in      he was translated to the sea of lincoln by virtue of the popes provision  episcopus xx nicholas close the kings chaplain and archdeacon of colchester succeeded to this bishopric he had been chancellor of the university of cambridge and there had the degree conferred on him of doctor of divinity he had gained the esteem of his sovereign by his excellent conduct in the treaty of peace concluded with the king of scots the year before his advancement to the episcopacy in which transaction he was joined in commission with the lord privy seal the lord treasurer and comptroller of the household and others he was a commissioner to examine into the conduct of the wardens of the marches and conservators of the truce that their irregularities and offenses might be punished rymer in the succeeding year      he was one in the commission for receiving the homage of james earl of douglas and others of the scotch nobility who should make application for that purpose in the same year he was translated to litchfield but departed this life in the month of november possessed of the accustomed provisionary instrument  episcopus xxi william percy succeeded to the sea we know nothing of his political or episcopal character he was son of the earl of northumberland and was for some time chancellor of the university of cambridge he departed this life in the year      the profits of the bishopric during the vacancy of the sea were granted by king edward iv to doctor john kingscott in part satisfaction of a royal debt with the specious countenance of a reward for singular services and soon after he was consecrated bishop of the sea before he could either be reimbursed the debt or receive a gratuity out of the revenues  episcopus xxii john kingscott came in by the election of the convent with the royal assent and papal confirmation notwithstanding any sinister views there might be in his being put into the receipt of the revenue origiginally but he did not live to enjoy the dignity long departing this life a d      and leaving his exalted station without any memorable or characteristic events the king was not dilatory in appropriating the profits of the bishopric granting the temporalties to richard nevil earl of warwick and salisbury the chapter proceeded to an election and by the provision of the holy see  episcopus xxiii richard scroop was advanced to this bishopric a d      and enjoyed it four years departing this life   th of may       he was one of those prelates whose episcopacy furnishes the historian with nothing more than the dates of consecration and exit  episcopus xxiv edward storey succeeded to the sea by the election of the chapter with the other confirming powers a d      he was a man of a liberal and benevolent spirit and was one in whom commissions of great trust were reposed his munificence was singular though the bishopric of carlisle seems to retain the fewest distinguishing marks of it he bestowed considerable possessions on pembroke hall in cambridge he was a liberal benefactor to the church of ely he founded at chichester a free school one of his most distinguished acts of charity he augmented the revenue of the sea of chichester with valuable gifts in lands and the dean and chapter there had considerable donations the most mistaken appropriation his benevolence dictated to him and which from his opulence took place was building the new cross in the marketplace of chichester and giving to the corporation there an estate for its repairs and perpetual maintenance in      we see him named among the prelates who took an oath of fealty to edward then prince of wales rymer he was a commissioner in several of the treaties with the scotch and particularly in that of the marriage of the princess cecily second daughter of the king he was translated to the sea of chichester in the year      where he died and was interred by the ordonance of the holy see he was succeeded in the bishopric of carlisle by  episcopus xxv richard bell prior of durham who received the temporalties of this see   th of april      though he possessed this bishopric to the time of his death which happened in      in the course of eighteen years we collect nothing singular in his life whilst he was prior of durham he was in several royal commissions of treaty with the powers of scotland but his name during his episcopacy has not occured to me in any record of moment  episcopus xxvi william sever his successor was abbot of st marys in york he had his education at oxford and seems to be derived from mean parentage from the place of his birth a village near the city of durham shinclisse he was made bishop of carlisle a d      and by royal license held his abbacy in commendam he was in commission to treat about the marriage of the princess margaret daughter of king henry vii with james king of scotland in the year      he was in the

in lincoln college oxford was abbot of leicester and bishop of bangor from whence he was translated the popes bull bearing date at rome the   st day of september we now advance to a busy and significant character in his successor  episcopus xxix john kyte who was a man of distinguished parts though his parentage is not handed down to us or the nature and place of his education yet he figured in the offices of the church in an age when many great characters flourished without any other advantages than great powers of genius and servility of principles in the reign of king henry vii he was ambassador to spain he was also subdean of the royal chapel and in the year      he was made archbishop of armagh in ireland the influence of cardinal wolsey obtained him many dignities and he was devoted to his service in return he consulted our bishop on his most momentous concerns and conversed with him on matters of the highest nature with the greatest familiarity in the melancholy reverse of his fortune the friendship was not broken and the cardinal received his support from the bishops hands s w cavend memoirs in      bishop kyte on his installation at carlisle resigned the archbishopric of avmagh and took the titular bishopric of thebes in greece the sees amounted to    0 ducats he was one of the commissioners of king henry viii to treat for a cessation of hostilities with scotland and in      he was one of the plenepotentiaries for establishing peace with king james v in the year      we find his name among those who signed their approbation of the kings scruples concerning his marriage and acquiescing with the vices and enormities of that monster of impiety and arrogance launched so far in the intrigues of a corrupt court we see his name mixed with those minions who servilely courted the kings smiles with the forfeiture of virtue he was one of the four bishops who addressed pope clement the seventh in the matter of the kings divorce but in the latter years of his life after the cardinal was removed and the political countenance of the court changed he was wavering in his principles he was a strong opposer of cranmer and the rising spirit of reformation and in that department was a public adherent to the archbishopric of york  he died in london   th of june      and was buried at stepney his epitaph under this stone closyde and marmorale

monument p        episcopus xxx robert aldridge succeeded to the sea a d      as he lived in a busy age and was present to many great changes in church and state one should expect from a man of so great a character as to his learning one whom erasmus called in his early years blanda eloquentiae juvenis a poet and orator of more than ordinary note that he would have been a shining figure in the multiform business of this part of henrys reign but we may judge from his constantly holding the appointments he had that he temporized with the vereing measures of the prince and like the notorious though perhaps imaginary character of the vicar of bray still keeping the saddle let the object of the pursuit be what it might the servility that strikes the idea when one conceives such a character in the time of this monarch ininspires aversion it may be a harsh sentence but it proceeds from a fact that produces large and natural inferences let us attend to his progress in life buckinghamshire was the place of his birth and he received his education at eaton till the year   0  when he was appointed a scholar of kings college cambridge he was once proctor of that university and from thence he became master fellow and provost of eaton about the year      he was made bachelor of divinity at oxford and the following year took up his doctors degree soon after he was appointed archdeacon of colchester and in the year      was installed a canon at windsor and made register of the order of the garter he was an opposer of cranmer and adhered to the romish profession of faith indeed in the work called the bishops book containing the godly and pious institution of a christian it is said he joined with that archbishop but touching the doctrine of the seven sacraments his opinion was

oglethorp who by the inconsistencies in his public actions seems to have been a very weak man he received the temporalties of this bishopric in the month of october in the year      but the popes confirmatory bull did not arrive till the month of january following he was born at a small village near tadcaster in the county of york of inferior parents and had his education in magdalene college oxford in the year      he was proctor of the university and soon after was entered bachelor of divinity in the year      he was chosen president of the college and in      had the distinguished office of vice chancellor he was made a canon and soon after dean of the royal chapel at windsor and in the first year of queen marys reign he was appointed secretary to the order of the garter this was a year of great honor to him for in it he held the presidency of magdalene college the rectories of newington and hassely in oxfordshire together with the deanery of windsor in      he was one of the appointed disputants in the controversy with cranmer latimer and rydley and showed himself a most inveterate adversary to the principles of reformation and even to that humane rule toleration in      we see him acting in the inconsistent character i intimated for during the vacancy of the sea of canterbury when all the bishops had refused to officiate in the coronation of queen elizabeth he only the lowest of the tribe the bitterest in the measures against reformists and the interests of the protestant church he only could be found to place the crown on the head of that illustrious princess the lords of the council willing that the ceremony should have every outward dignity sent for all the pontifical robes and ensigns of high office used by the archbishop on that solemn occasion that our prelate might be duly habited for the occasion it is not to be reconciled how oglethorpe could be influenced to this office the character of the princess and her sentiments in religious matter were no secrets and the bishops faith and sentiments were publicly avouched the inconsistency is not to be reconciled but by the discovery of those influences and private springs of the state which are long since locked up in the impenetrable regions of oblivion how must he have been shocked and confounded whilst the ceremony was performing by the command of the queen not to elevate the consecrated host in the celebration of mass usual in this solemnity  because she liked it not wood with a voice of commiseration would palliate the error with his pity for the fact when he saw the issue of the matter and both himself and the whole tribe of his secret order deprived the churches holy laws and faith against the conditions of her consecration and acception into that royal office violated he fore repented him all the days of his life which were for that special cause both short and wearisome  in the first parliament he gave his vote against the bills for restitution of first fruits for restoring the supremacy exchange of bishops lands and uniformity of the common prayer he would willingly by his adherence to his old partisans have recovered a reputation he had lost by being a tool to the prevailing party and by his unsteadiness he dropped to the ground between the two the council fined him   0l for nonattendance at sewels challenge in disputation a d      as her majesty had commanded and shortly after he was deprived of his bishopric worth    l  his death was sudden but the cause uncertain the popular report was that it happened in an apoplexy he was privately buried at st dunstans in the west by his will he ordered the foundation of a school and hospital at tadcaster with an ample endowment  episcopus xxxii john best who succeeded to the bishopric was a man of a different cast of the true reformists principles and one who had lived obscurely during the reign of quen mary to conceal himself from the rage and intemperate zeal that distinguished that short but unhappy period he was born in the northern parts of yorkshire of parents of a low station and had his education in the university of oxford he was consecrated a d    0 when he was    years of age the unsettled and turbulent estate of the north was such that he was obliged to have a commission to arm himself and dependants within his bishopric against the tumultuous and enraged populace he was one of those who was created doctor in divinity by doctor humphreys the queens professor at oxford at a private convention in london and he subscribed the saxon homilies

richard barnes was his successor from this period of time the business and importance of bishops in secular affairs declined in their spiritual powers they were so reduced that only within their respective bishoprics they held the authorities consistent with the ancient rules of the common law without the superlative aid of the sea of rome so that from this era the history of our prelates becomes little more than personal bishop barnes was born in the county of lancaster and educated in brazen nose college oxford where he took a degree of master of arts and was elected a fellow he had

brought it back to its once flourishing state he was consecrated bishop of carlisle in      having enjoyed the degree of doctor in divinity for eight years  he died at rose castle the   th day of june

became chaplain to prince charles and afterward to king james who appointed him to the deanery of gloucester and from thence to this bishopric  he died by a fall from his horse in may      and was interred in the cathedral of carlisle  episcopus xxxix francis white succeeded to the sea in december      from a state of obscurity we see him emerging to fame by the zeal with which he preached against the church of rome and by his book against fisher from the ruins of the ancient church arose innumerable sectaries the great stock was hewn down and from the roots issued a multitude of ungrafted shoots bearing unprofitable fruit among others the arminian principles were introduced this bishop even taught them on the solemn festival of christmas in the chapelroyal in the hearing of his sovereign and soon after was translated to the sea of norwich so formidable was the growth of innovations in religion and arminianism in particular that they occasioned a parliamentary inquiry from his fervor against the papists he was employed by the king as a spy upon the conduct of the countess of denbeigh who was much inclined to listen to the rules of that faith to reward him for his assiduity in that duty he first was made dean of carlisle and then appointed to the bishopric he did not stop at norwich but was advanced to the sea of ely in      and departed this life six years afterward upon his translation to norwich he was succeeded in the sea of carlisle by  episcopus xl barnaby potter who in those days of division and new devices in the sacred temple arose to significance by his zeal as a puritanical preacher he was born in the county of westmorland within the barony of kendal was a student in queens college oxford where he held a fellowship in      he took his degree in divinity and was elected provost after he had distinguished himself in devonshire by his puritanical doctrines he was one of the kings chaplains and was consecrated bishop of this see in march      and died in the year       episcopus xli james usher his successor in the bishopric of carlisle was a man of deep erudition and a zealous protestant without bigotry and fanaticism too much the lincture of the age he held the revenues of this bishopric in commendam by the grant of king charles i as a compensation for his great sufferings in his archbishopric of armagh in ireland by the commotions in that kingdom he was by birth an irishman and had his education in the university of dublin he was promoted to the bishopric of mead in    0 and four years afterward was advanced to the archbishopric with difficulty and a parsimonious hand he subsisted on the revenues of our see diminished and exhausted as they were by the armies of england and scotland alternately quartering in this county at length the seizure which was made by parliament on all the lands of bishops brought him to great distress in consideration of his eminent character his learning and virtuous zeal he had a pension of  00l a year granted to him by parliamentary order but it was paid very ill insomuch that he never received it above once or twice  he died in march      at the countess of peterboroughs at rygate surry in the   th year of his age cromwell from what principle it cannot be divined not agreeable to his character from some sinister view or private influence ordered him to be buried at the public charge in westminster abbey to defray the expense of which he gave a draft upon the treasury for  00l and this he did out of an honorable respect to the memory of so learned a champion of the protestant cause as the archbishop was so say our authors nicholson and burn but he was a wretch whose soul could not be touched with such sentiments hypocrisy or some low and selfish view entitled him to display this honor and pomp at the interment of a man whom he and his creatures had starved to death inconsistent and abominable are the two contrarieties cromwell gavedirections that the bishops library should not be sold without his consent but it was plundered of many of the valuable manuscripts the soldiers took many choice books at a price of their own making and in the confusion which then distracted the state the collection was mutilated and greatly prejudiced the books which escaped the hands of ruffians were given by king charles ii to the college of dublin  on the restoration of king charles ii this see was supplied by  episcopus xlii richard stern was elected a person of little note by birth he had his education in cambridge was master of jesus college and took the degree of doctor in divinity he was domestic chaplain to archbishop laud and attended on the scaffold at his execution he was a prisoner in the tower with several others upon a complaint made by cromwell who was then one of the burgesses of cambridge that they had conveyed the college plate for the kings relief at york from this cause he was dispossessed of his several appointments and lived in obscurity till the restoration in      he was translated to york and died there in      the character given of him by bishop burnet we think ought to receive great credit from the known integrity of the writer and he intimates that he was a sour illtempered man and was chiefly studious of measures to enrich his family he was particularly attached to the court and servile in adopting the measures then moved in that he was zealous in the affairs of the duke of york and was strongly suspected of popery nicholson and burn have attempted to rescue his character by the publication of a letter which they say was written from york to his successor at carlisle but is anonymous and if it is from the hand of any person of note it was as easy to subscribe the name to give it weight and authority as to publish the sentences to give him a superficial character he was greatly respected and generally lamented all the clergy commemorate his sweet condescensions his free communications faithful counsels exemplary temperance cheerful hospitality and bountiful charity such is this epistolary panegyric and which is only equalled by his monumental inscription bishop burnet must have been basely inveterate or deceived hic spe futurae gloriae situs est richardus stern mansfeldiae honestis parentibus ortus tria apud cantabrigienses collegia certatim ipsum cum superbia arripiunt et

praise on the following occasion his successor settling at rosecastle the only remaining habitable house then belonging to the sea and finding even this in a most miserable condition a great part of it having been burnt by the scots in the late rebellion and the chapel which was the only repair bishop stern pretended to notwithstanding what is said in the flattering epitaph abovementioned although he had received the immense advantages of coming to the sea when all the leases were either totally or near expired being so ill done that it was necessary to take it entirely down the bishop thought it expedient to proceed against his metropolitan and immediate predecessor for dilapidations whereupon the archbishop made a tender of  00l for repairing the chapel and pleaded the act of oblivion and indemnity    cap   c    in bar of all other dilapidations the court of delegates adjudged the said tender sufficient for repairing the said chapel and that all the other dilapidations were covered by the said act and so dismissed the cause with costs on either side the bishop being thus totally defeated of all aid from his rich predecessor the expenses of the law suit having cost him more than  00l set about the repairs himself if in this single instance bishop burnets character of the prelate is so sufficiently justified how might we expect it to be corroborated by his more private history  episcopus xliii edward rainbow came to the sea in      he was born at bilton in the county of lincoln   0  being the son of the parish priest there he was educated at westminster

high merit and connections in life from whence his promotion was derived  he found some difficulties from the imperfection of the instruments in granting institution to doctor francis atterbury to the deanery of carlisle which by the queens special command were obviated but it is probable this imbittered their minds against each other for on the bishops interposition as visitor under the statute of k henry viii for appeasing certain contests which had arisen between the dean and the chapter at the deans instigation doctor todd protested against his right of visitation insisting on the invalidity of that statute and that in the crown only was vested that privilege there was an early grudge between them for dr attorbury had written against our bishops english historical library touching

procured an easy and quick access to books was peculiarly agreeable to his taste and habits some time after this he was also appointed casuistical professor in the year      he suffered an irreparable loss by the death of his wife a loss in itself every way afflicting and rendered more so by the situation of his family which then consisted of eleven children many of them very young some years

disciple of that school about the same time he published a tract which engaged some attention in the controversy concerning subscription and he published new editions of his two principal works with considerable additions and some alterations besides the works already mentioned he published in      or      a very ingenious inquiry into the ideas of space time etc in which he combats the opinions of dr clarke and his adherents on these subjects  dr law held the sea of carlisle almost nineteen years during which time he twice only omitted spending the summer months in his diocese at the bishops residence at rose castle a situation with which he was much pleased not only on account of the natural beauty of the place but because it restored him to the country in which he had spent the best part of his life in the year      he paid this visit in a state of great weakness and exhaustion and died at rose about a month after his arrival there on the   th day of august and in the   th year of his age  the life of dr law was a life of incessant reading and thought almost entirely directed to metaphysical and religious inquires but the tenet by which his name and writings are principally distinguished is that jesus christ at his second coming will by an act of his power restore to life and consciousness the dead of the human species who by their own nature and without this interposition would remain in the state of insensibility to which the death brought upon mankind by the sin of adam had reduced them he interpreted literally that saying of st paul   cor xv    as by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead this opinion had no other effect upon his own mind than to increase his reverence for christianity and for its divine founder he retained it as he did his other speculative opinions without laying as many are wont to do an extravagant stress upon their importance and without pretending to more certainty than the subject allowed of no man formed his own conclusions with more freedom or treated those of others with greater candor and equity he never quarrelled with any person for differing from him or considered that difference as a sufficient reason for questioning any mans sincerity or judging meanly of his understanding he was zealously attached to religious liberty because he thought that it leads to truth yet from his heart he loved peace but he did not perceive any repugnancy in these two things there was nothing in his elevation to his bishopric which he spoke of with more pleasure than its being a proof that decent freedom of inquiry was not discouraged  he was a man of great softness of manners and of the mildest and most tranquil disposition his voice was never raised above its ordinary pitch his countenance seemed never to have been ruffled it preserved the same kind and composed aspect truly indicating the calmness and benignity of his temper he had an utter dislike of large and mixed companies next to his books his chief satisfaction was in the serious conversation of a literary companion or in the company of a few friends in this sort of society he would open his mind with great unreservedness and with a peculiar turn and sprightliness of expression his person was low but well formed his complexion fair and delicate except occasional interruptions by the gout he had for the greatest part of his life enjoyed good health and when not confined by that distemper was full of motion and activity about nine years before his death he was greatly enfeebled by a severe attack of the gout in his stomach and a short time after that lost the use of one of his legs notwithstanding his fondness for exercise he resigned himself to this change not only without complaint but without any sensible diminution of his cheerfulness and good humor his fault for we are not writing a panegyric was the general fault of retired and studious characters too great a degree of inaction and facility in his public station the modesty or rather bashfulness of his nature together with an extreme unwillingness to give pain rendered him sometimes less firm and efficient in the administration of authority than was requisite but it is the condition of human mortality there is an opposition between some virtues which seldom permits them to subsist together in perfection we owe our grateful acknowledgements to the rev william paley our late chancellor for the above account of bishop law a copy of which he also transmitted to the encyclopaedia britannia  the editors   the bishop was

comprehends scotchstreet fisherstreet castlestreet and abbeystreet within the city caldewgate cumbersdale richardgate newtown and newby without the city and principal parts of both parishes are within that liberty which is known by the name of the manor of the soccage of carlisle in the notes is the boundaries by virtue of a commission issued from the court of exchequer    0 the boundaries were thus certified by the commissioners beginning at the south side of the river eden over against etterby and there leaving the same river it extends southwards by wearihome unto dowbecksike the lands on the right hand being the inheritance of mr briscoe from thence it extends eastwards against bishops lands to the river of caldew or caldewbridge where crossing over the same bridge against caldewgate it extends up the river against the abbey lands and dentonholme until it comes to a parcel of dentonholme lying on the west side of caldew containing about nine acres of land where it leaves the river and incloseth the same parcel of land on the west side thereof on the river side against the south west corner of the walkmiln closes and so crossing over the river and leaving the same it extends southwards toward curreck by the west side of the fields of blackall curreck and uprightby and so about the same fields to a cross way of the west end of uprightby town and so southwards by the high way to crunybeck which falls into the river of petrell and there leaving the same way it extends down the same beck to petrell and from it turns northwards down the same river to the south east corner of paradise where crossing the river and leaving it it goes down a small miln water on the south side of paradise and incloseth the same at gallows bridge from whence crossing over the high way it incloseth part of the spittle crook lying on the south side of petrell and so extends still down petrell to the foot thereof where the same falls into eden from thence up over the said river of eden to the foot of a beck falling thereunto against kynnyholme and so up the same beck on the west side of richardby to the northwest corner of stanwix grounds then leaving the same beck it extends northwards to the highway leading from carlisle to tirraby and so crossing over the same way it passes on the north side of horsemanfield to the north west corner thereof and from thence extends southwards to a highway dividing horsemanfield and the west part of stanwix and so crossing the same way it extends on the west side of stanwix to the river of eden and from thence down the same river to etterby where it first began     the parish of st cuthberts is the other division of this city the church becoming ruinous was rebuilt in      on a new and handsome plan neatly vaulted pewed galleried and well lighted it has a square steeple or tower with a dome and covered with lead but no ring of bells the income is but small yet having had several augmentations lands have been lately purchased and added thereto of the yearly value of forty pounds it comprehends english street within the city and botchardgate carleton brisco uprightby harraby and blackhill without   in this parish is the chapelry of wrea its antiquity cannot be ascertained further back than the reign of king edward ii in      bishop halton allowed a chaplain there on condition that he resided within his chapelry it consists of the village of wrea which consist of twentyone families containing sixty males and fiftyfour females a d      the chapel was consecrated by bishop fleming and by augmentations lands have been purchased so that the curates income amounts to about  0l a year with a good house upon the lands in the act of consecration the nomination of a curate is reserved to the dean and chapter but hitherto they have been appointed by the vestry men in      philip robinson       david graham       john parker       joseph parker who was a celebrated schoolmaster  mr gascoin  we extract the following account of a relation of this family from a newspaper dated september the  d a d          woodside the seat of john losh esquire on thursday last died at gordon castle of the small pox in the   th year of his age the rev mr william losh senior taberder of queens college oxford and chaplain to her grace the duchess of gordon he was a gentleman of the brightest parts and had made great advances in all the branches of polite and solid learning that could well be expected at his years he was blessed with so sweet and humane a disposition that the common accidents of life gave him no lasting disquiet nor interrupted that universal benevolence which with him diffused itself in a proportionable scale of duty from the whole body of mankind to the meanest stranger this benign disposition made him the constant advocate of the rights and privileges of the human species in opposition to tyranny and oppression these he maintained upon all occasions with a warmth and spirit which well became a british subject he had many good qualities but was eminent for piety and as he drew from religion an unbroken peace of mind a solid satisfaction and an unsurmountable courage in return he cultivated religion in the province assigned to him with indefatigable industry and a zeal undaunted but such as was founded on scripture and supported by reason  with all these endowments he lived the agreeable companion of the ingenious the faithful friend of the virtuous and the brother of the truly religious as well as the terror of the hypocrite the superstitious and the profane he was bright at all times but he shone in the pulpit when he pleaded the cause of truth with such a strength of reason and such a flow of eloquence that his hearers were at once convinced and charmed  he died in the very spring of his age and but in the blossom of his virtues yet he discovered enough to make it evident that had he lived to show himself in the rising stages of life his great and uncommon endowments would have rendered him dear to the polite the learned and the religious and his death would have been as justly regretted by the public as it is at present by those who had the happiness of knowing him   adjoining this chapelry the residence of his forefathers for many generations is a handsome house and elegantly furnished his extensive estate is in high cultivation we owe him our grateful acknowledgements for the annexed plate which he has favored us with  there are two manors within this parish viz the manor of botchardgate or prior lordship belonging to the dean and chapter and the manor of blackhall  botchardby villa bochardi was the inheritance of one bocharda fleming one of those that first peopled carlisle he had a grange there for the provision of his house at carlisle and when the flemings went to anglesea in wales he left that patrimony to guy the forester with his daughter isold to this guy the hunter king henry i confirmed bochardby to hold the same by cornage paying yearly  s  d cornage silver to the king it is gildable and vicontiel and gives aid with combquinton to the sheriff yearly  s  d torn silver it lineally descended in the issue male unto william the son of otho or odan son of ralph son of guido the hunter de bochardby this william lived in the time of king john and held then the manor of him then william de bochardby

by his issue male according to the pedigree of wigton until the time of edward iii when margaret de wigton sole daughter and heir of sir john de wigton knt last issue male of the eldest son of that house to defend her birthright was glad to divide away the manors of blackhill melmerby and stainton to robert parving the kings sergeant at law for her strength at the common law the rectory of wigton to the abbey holme for the civil law and wigton itself to the lord anthony lucy for his help in the country because her mother idyonysa lovelot was bitterly taxed of incontinency at the instance of sir richard kirkbride next heir male apparent to the land but margaret de wigton reserved an estate in all things but the rectory to the heirs of her body and died without issue therefore blackhill fell to sir robert parving who married dame catharine the sister of the said kirkbride to adam parving alias peacock the son of john peacock who married johan one of the daughters and

which is now called blackhill park and is the inheritance of mr wardale of carlisle    milbourns add to denton  we come in course to speak of the city of carlisle it consists of several streets the chief of which are spacious noble and well built  for their names etc see the plan annexed  this city had many royal grants and great privileges the first that is pointed out is that of king henry ii which was burnt by the devastations made by the scots and is recited and confirmed by the charter of king henry iii it does not appear when the first incorporation of the burgesses took place or what was the original constitution in the charter of king henry iii we have these words et quod similiter habent gildain mercatoriam liberam ita quod nihil inde respondeant aliquibus etc nos omnes libertates illas et consuetudinos praefatis civibus nostris concedimus et hac carta nostra confirmanus pro nobis et haeredibus nostris volentes quod omnibus praedictis libertatibus et consuetudinibus de caetera gaudeant et utantur libere quiet been et in pace et integre in perpetuum cum omnibus aliis libertatibus et liberis consuetudinibus ad praedictam villam carlioli pertinentibus  by this charter the citizens were exempted from the payment of toll passage pontage and all customs belonging to the king with the privilege of having wood for fuel and for their erections within the forest of carlisle  great part of the city having again suffered by accidental fire the records were a second time destroyed king edward i in the   st year of his reign by charter dated the   d day of june recites the grant of king henry iii from the inrollment of it in his chancery and stating that it had been lost by fire confirmed it verbatim in consequence of his scotch expeditions he resided frequently at carlisle and seems to have entertained a particular regard for the place by his honoring the city with the assembly of his parliament in the   th year of his reign who made their residence there from the  0th day of january to palm sunday following the memorable acts of this parliament give no small luster to our annals  king edward iii also seems to have entertained a special affection and favor toward the citizens and in order to secure to the burgesses their privileges he caused an inquisition to be taken whereon he should found his charter of confirmation which bears date the  th of february in the   d year of his reign of england and   th of france therein it is recited that it having been found by inquisition taken by his commissioners richard de denton and john de harrington and returned into his chancery that the citizens habuerunt et habere consueverunt a tempore quo non existit memoria had and were used to have the privileges therein set forth for time immemorial on the petition of the citizens ac etiam cives civitatis praedicta nobis supplicaverunt ut sibi dictas libertates quietantias consuetudines et proficua per chartam nostram confirmare velimus and in consideration of its being in the frontier of scotland and well situated for the refuge and desence of the inhabitants of the adjacent territories against the frequent incursions of the scots and also in commiseration of the late dreadful mortality of the plague and the frequent devastations made by the northern enemy he granted to them the following privileges quod ipsi et eorum haeredes et successores cives civitatis praedide in perpetuum habeant returnam brevium omnium nostrorum et summonitionum de scaccario et aliorum brevium quorumcunque ac etiam duos mercatus singulis septimanis videlicet diebus mercurii et sabbati et unam feriam quolibet anno per sex decim dies duraturam viz in die assumptionis beaae mariae et per    dies proxime sequentes nec non unam gildam et

civitatis praedictae et habeant cognitiones omnium placitorum praedictorum nec non quod dicti cives et haeredis et successores sui habeant communam pasturae ad omnimoda averia omni tempore anni super

quietantius habere et molendinum piscariam pasturam fossman et locum cum pertinentiis tenere debent ipsique cives et antecessores et praedecessores sui a tempore cujus contrarium memoria non existit semper etc  by the recitals of this grant it seems that preceding it and even for time immemorial the city had been governed by a mayor bailiffs and coroners but when this body politic had its commencement there is no evidence that we have yet met with  king richard ii in the  th year of his reign granted them a confirmatory charter  in consequence of the spoil and devastation made by the armies of margaret queen of england and henry duke of exeter her adherent the city obtained from king edward iv a relaxation of one half of the feefarm rent of eighty pounds yearly paid to the crown

lepers of both sexes in the year    0 it was endowed with a moiety of the tithes of little bampton by adam son of robert on condition that it should constantly receive two almsmen from thence in the

complaint that the house was defrauded of a great part of its revenues on which the bishop issued a monition with the terrors of the greater excommunication against all persons who detained the corn

others the marius who was saluted emperor in opposition to gallienus and is said to have been so very strong that authors tell us he had only nerves and no veins in his fingers yet i have heard that some copies have it not marii victoriae but marti victori which latter may probably be favored by some as seeming to come nearer the truth as no vestige remains of this piece of antiquity we must rest contented with the uncertainty in which camden and his editor have left us relative to it  other two roman remains are mentioned by camden which he says he saw here one in the house of thomas aglionby

send you is sufficient to let you see what it is it is of copper found in digging a cellar opposite to the bushinn here it lay about nine feet deep as i looked upon it to be a choice piece of antiquity i have procured the original for you i take it to be a symbol of isis and also wore by other gods the shank or stem by which it was stuck into the figure or standard is very strong and has a hole for a pin to fasten it from which shank arises a ring on the backside which is also very strong and will take in a mans finger i presume it might be to fasten some parts of the garb or for what other use i beg your thoughts  extract from mr gales answer  as for the brass plate you sent me it seems to be nothing but an ornament belonging to the trappings of a horse and might have hung before his breast by the ring on the backside of it the hole through the shank has been for fastening a drop or pendant to it as a further ornament  in opening a gravel pit lately on the side of a hill in the parish of stanwix just without the suburbs of carlisle a stratum of bones were discovered at about a yard below the surface lying about a foot thick in most parts and stretching the whole length of the pit which i apprehend to be near twenty feet i examined the spot and found diverse fragments of roman pottery ware elegant specimens and some of the bones were exhibited intermixed with the bones they are i think the bones of horses and might perhaps have been buried after an engagement between the romans and picts but it is not so easy to account for the fragments of pottery etc which were found in great numbers intermixed with them  n b the picts wall ran within less than half a mile of the spot where these bones were found  dated dec   th      signed c lyttleton  in the archaeologia is published accounts of stone hatchets found at carlisle with a learned treatise thereon and to which we refer the curious reader  if we may presume to offer our sentiments on these subjects after the learned antiquaries have so elaborately expatiated thereon without the appearance of arrogance and presumption we would suggest that the bones mentioned by the bishop mixed with the fragments of the patarae were the remains of sacrifice when the ordinary receptacle was cleaned out this has been the general repository if these were the remains of animals slain in battle the mixture is not to be reconciled and it was more than such occasion would have required to clear them from the bones of men slain at the same time the learned inquirer did not discover any remains of broken trapping studings or ornaments of horses or men accoutrements the hammers or stone hatchets seem very unfit for weapons of warfare unweildy and uncouth if they had been in use in battle some testimony would have been given of them and they would not have been totally disused one might presume at the coming of the romans but would have been exhibited as trophies or otherwise as testimonies of the valor of british heroes the ancstors of those who appeared armed against the invaders in the most sacred cause of war the defense of liberty and their country and the maintenance of the established religion we have received no account of such weapons then in use as domestic utensils it is not probable they would have been secreted with such care or deposited with such solemnity as even to support the head of the deceased owner in the sepulcher could we imagine the friends of any personage who was to be interred with the funeral pomp of a tumulus would busy themselves with giving the deceased labourer his beetle with him for the regions of death we humbly conceive this was a sacred implement in the possession of the heathen priest with which he prepared the sacrifice we have innumerable relations of the abhorrence the ancients had of their sacred things and places being polluted by strangers and thence we trace the cause of these flints being concealed all degrees of religious in remote ages took great precaution to bury with the consecrated minister the instruments of his office and that was followed in the practice of the ancient romish church the sacred securis

soon after the fortifications were constructed as the beginning of the reign of king stephen david king of scotland in the first year of his reign entered into england and took possession of this city stephen on receiving the news is said to have exclaimed quae dolose cepit victoriose recipiam but this weak prince so far from performing what he boasted made a cession of the whole county to the

after his dreadful overthrow at the battle of the standard and here he received alberic the popes legate by whose influence all the women captives were brought to carlisle and set at liberty he obtained from the scotch leaders a solemn promise that in future incursions they would spare the churches and with hold their swords from the aged from women and infants an injunction which humanity dictated but which the savage customs of the contending nations had not admitted into the modes of warfare  henry eldest son of the empress maud came to david at carlisle attended by the great barons of the western parts of england and received the order of knighthood with much pomp and ceremony the young prince then taking an oath that on his accession to the crown of england he would confirm to david and his son their english possessions but such are the oaths of princes henry no sooner grasped the scepter than he demanded of the scotch regency restitution of cumberland and in      the two monarchs had an interview in this city but much dissension arose and the claim of the english monarch was not complied with in the  d year of henry the ii the king of scotts had the earldom of

defended by robert de vaux after laying before it some time the scotch forces formed a blockade to give liberty for withdrawing part of the army to ravage and waste the adjacent country the garrison were reduced to great distress for want of provision and came to a conditional capitulation that if they did not receive succors from the english before michaelmas they would surrender the place but the succeeding events prevented the capitulation being carried into effect and williams being made prisoner at alnwick put an end to the disasters of the war the greatest part of the city suffered by fire in this reign and the records and charters were destroyed interea gulielmus rex scottorum obsedit carleolum quod robertus de walls in custodia habuit et dimissa part exercitus sui perambulavit

records which the city and convent had procured to be renewed were also burnt in the chronicle of lanercost is a full account of the dreadful devastations made by this fire  in      the scots entered the western march and having laid the country waste as they approached carlisle they burnt the suburbs and attempted to take the city by storm but the inhabitants made so brave a defense even the women mounting the walls discharging stones boiling water and other things on the assailants that they abandoned their enterprise and retreated to their own country  by an entry in the old register book of the abbey it appears that on the  th june   d king edward i half the city was burnt down as far as the gate of richardby  king edward i resided here from the  0th of january in the   th year of his reign to the   th of june when he proceeded on his last expedition toward scotland and died in his camp at brugh on sands  in the  th year of the reign of king edward ii robert brus king of scotland on his incursion laid waste the country as far as allerdale and coupland in this county he besieged carlisle in a regular form by engines and other warlike modes for ten days and at length was obliged to withdraw his troops in great precipitation leaving behind them most of their instruments of war they were hotly pursued by the english and two of the scottish leaders john de moravia and sir robert bardolph were taken prisoners and afterward ransomed  in the   th year of king edward ii andrew harcla earl of carlisle was seized in the castle and suffered as a traitor this action was so gallant that it appears worth repeating here the earl was publicly proclaimed a traitor by the kings command anthony lord lucy was sent to apprehend him having dispersed his party in the city to prevent suspicion lord lucy with a few attendants entered the castle as having business with the earl his principal associates in this enterprise were sir hugh de louther sir richard de denton and sir hugh de morriceby with four esquires in arms the party to whom the design was communicated had signals appointed to them for their conduct in the business and as the knights passed each gate a number of men halted as if carelessly loitering for want of immediate employment but with an intention to guard the pass prevent escapes and to be at hand to lend their aid if occasion required the four chiefs with their esquires passed into the innermost and most secure parts of the castle even through the great hall to the earls private apartment where finding him sitting in an unsuspicious manner lord lucy accosted him requiring him to surrender or defend himself a cry of treason immediately echoed through the castle and the keeper of the inner gate prepared to shut it but was instantly slain by sir richard denton the watchword being given the parties formed into bodies took possession of the gates and avenues and the earl with the whole garrison surrendered without further bloodshed the chief prisoner was put into safe durance till the kings pleasure relative to him should be known  in the eleventh year of king edward iii the scots laid siege to the city of carlisle on john

king edward iii that this was done at his special command  in the year      penrith and carlisle were burnt by the scots under the command of sir william douglas a body of the scotch forces headed by sir alexander strachan detached for foraging were intercepted and sir alexander was slain by sir robert ogle who ran him through the body with his lance bishop kirby the eleventh bishop of this diocese signalized himself in this rencounter for being dismounted and in imminent danger of being made a prisoner he fought with uncommon bravery recovered his horse and by his valor and animating exhortations he spirited up his party rallied them frequently and brought them again to the sight to which the victory was deservedly attributed  in the sixth year of the reign of king richard ii the scots sent forth a plundering band who ravaged the forest of inglewood sacked penrith at the time of the fair and returned with a vast booty having gained as hollingshead says a drove of  0000 head of cattle  in the   th year of king henry viiis reign during askes rebellion carlisle was besieged by  000 men under the command of musgrave and tilby partisans in that affair but they were repulsed by the garrison and as they were retiring were intercepted by the duke of norfolk and his troops who took all the leaders prisoners except musgrave those with about seventy others he ordered to immediate execution and hung them on the city walls  in the  0th and   st years of queen eilzabeths reign this place suffered a dreadful visitation by the plague in which their died      persons being computed

contributions were raised for the city to the amount of  0 l  s  0d  in the twentieth year of the reign of king charles i a d      this place was surrendered to the parliament forces commanded by lesley having sustained a siege and blockade from the  th of october to june following during which the distress of the garrison and inhabitants was so great that the flesh of horses dogs and rats were eaten bread was so totally exhausted that hemp seed was substituted so long as any was found in the place great assistance was given by the country when provisions could be thrown in to the amount in value of    l  0s procured by private subscriptions on surrender honorable terms of capitulation were obtained both for the military with honors of war as also for the inhabitants their liberties and properties  a coinage of silver pieces of three shillings value took place in the castle during the siege from the plate of the inhabitants sent in for that purpose they are become very scarce and bear a considerable price with the curious  the last hostile acts of which carlisle was the scene were those in the scotch rebellion      it surrendered to the chevalier on the   th of november who lay before it with his whole army the gazette account of this event said that for seven days before neither the officers nor the common men of the garrison got scarce an hours rest being perpetually under alarms that many were so sick through their great fatigue that being out of all hopes of speedy relief they absolutely refused to hold out any longer and multitudes went off every hour over the walls some of whom fell into the hands of the rebels till the officers of several companies were at last left with three or four men so that the mayor and corporation determined to hang out a white flag though contrary to the opinion and protestation of colonel durand and made the best terms they could get for themselves that the colonel was thereupon obliged to abandon the castle

other part of england  the modern state of the city of carlisle we confess our obligations to mr r longrigg a native of this city for this account of the modern state of carlisle  the editors  the city of carlisle the origin of which is lost in the uncertainties of antiquity stands upon a pleasing eminence which having every way a gradual descent the town is easily kept clean without the aid of a common shore being a frontier town toward scotland it is fortified with a wall and citadel now in ruins and a castle kept still in some sort of repair whilst south and north britain had each their respective king and the inhabitants of the two kingdoms lived in habits of enmity with each other carlisle exposed to the calamities of war was often sacked and its citizens plundered and murdered dismal times to live in the accession of the stuart family to the crown of england somewhat abated national animosities and miseries and the union by conferring reciprocal privileges and opening a free intercourse between the two countries has obliterated invidious distinctions and convinced the people on both sides the tweed that their vicinity to each other should have induced their ancestors always to cultivate habits of amity and friendship with their neighbors  from the wall which may be ascended in different parts by flights of steps the eye is entertained with a beautiful and extensive landscape and imperceptibly led into several distant counties whilst scotland and solwayfrith and the adjacent mountains some of whose summits touch the clouds do not a little contribute to enliven the enchanting scene the city is surrounded with three rivers petteril on the south eden on the east and north and caude on the west whose meandering streams are seen in many places at a great distance  a garrison was formerly kept here but there has been none for the last thirty years the military who may be stationed in the town for a time are quartered upon the public houses in the city and suburbs carlisle has still a governor and deputy governor whose places are only sine cures a town major engineer barrack master storekeeper headgunner three quartergunners etc when the governor of this city happened to be one of its representatives in parliament the subordinate places in the garrison were given to freemen but generally to such as were in the corporation so that frequently the chief magistrate was a quartergunner at the same time thus was the invalid worn out in the service of his king and country too frequently overlooked in the disposition of this appointment  carlisle being a bishops see has a cathedral in which are performed the cathedral service in the same edifice is performed the parochial service of st marys and in a part of it the chancellor of the diocese holds the consistory court as this religious edifice is the chief ornament of the city a short description of it may perhaps not be deemed improper  the choir of this venerable pile is the most magnificent part of the building it has a stately steeple with a ring of eight bells the roof is covered with lead and being considerably higher than the other buildings in the city has a very sine effect when viewed as a distant object this noble edifice being partly of gothic and partly of saxon architecture offers what is worthy the inspection of the architect and antiquarian contiguous to the cathedral is an extensive churchyard the principal burying ground surrounded with a wall seven feet high in the inside of which is a row of lofty plane trees whose branches overhang a part of the adjacent street and form a shade under which is a fine paved walk much resorted to within the precincts of the abbey besides the cathedral there are several venerable buildings which except the prebends houses show marks of antiquity  st cuthberts the other parish church in carlisle is a modern edifice rebuilt in the year      upon the site of the old church but without any kind of external or internal ornament it has a square steeple or tower but so confined as not to admit of a ring of bells so that the parishioners are called together to their devotion by the weak tinklings of the old bell which was not exchanged for one of a louder tone the steeple is decorated with a dome covered with lead from which a fane projects havthe year in which the church was rebuilt cut in it  besides these two churches there are in carlisle three protestant dissenting meeting houses dr robert henry was called and ordained to preach to the presbyterian congregation in fisherstreet carlisle in november      and continued with them    years and on the   th of august he became pastor of a dissenting congregation in berwick upon tweed one quaker and one methodist meeting house wesleys connection  the public buildings are the town hall moot hall and council chamger conspicuously situated in the center of the city and to which you ascend by a slight of broad steps from the promenade above the entrance are placed the arms of the corporation here are held the criminal and nisi prius courts of assize for the county the quarter sessions the mayors court the election for members to represent the city in parliament etc the records and writings belonging to the corporation the freemens admissions etc are kept in detached offices belonging to the same building it is to be lamented that the houses under the moothall are the private property of different persons to purchase these would require a deal of money the funds of the corporation are not competent for this therefore there are little hopes of ever seeing this edifice become an ornament to the city by being rebuilt upon a more useful and elegant plan the council chamger is ornamented with a cupola and clock the guild hall in which the free trades hold their meetings is situate at the head of fisherstreet and though it has the appearance of antiquity is but a very mean structure free trades merchants tanners tailors skinners smiths weavers shoemakers butchers  the trades hold their annual meetings upon ascensionday the marketcross stands at the south end of the promenade and opposite to the town hall it seems to be a modern edifice has a neat appearance but without any cover it has the corporation arms cut upon it underneath which was sculptured but of late years defaced a lion with its paw upon a large folio alluding either to magna charta or the city charter the guardhouse contiguous to the butchermarket is a very great nuisance and hurts the view of the principal streets and what renders it still more so is the corporation have granted leases and built houses adjoining to it perhaps upon the royal property near the englishgate are charity houses built by the corporation in which decayed freemen or the widows of those deceased are allowed to live gratis in carlisle there is one endowed school rev mr faucet head master  rev mr pattison under master there is also a charity school for clothing and educating the daughters of poor freemen mrs carlyle mistress of the charity school  the girls are taught to read knit and sew   the corporation of this city consists of a recorder twelve aldermen and twentyfour common councilmen present recorder t garforth esquire  john barnes attorney at law deputy town clerk one of the aldermen is annually chosen mayor and the other annual placemen are chosen out of the common council the subordinate officers are three sergeants at mace five bedals or town scavengers the sergeants and bedals wear the corporation livery and their places are generally for life the sergeants act as bailiffs in processes before the mayors court and to them is committed the execution of summons and writs of arrest for debt issued by it the office of the bedals is to keep the streets clean and to put in execution the punishment awarded to offenders within the mayors jurisdiction the liberties of the corporation extend a few yards without the city walls and are ascertained by what is called the freelidge stone with their arms sculptured upon it it may also be proper to observe that the public and private buildings belonging to the body corporate have the name of the mayor by whom and the year in which each edifice was erected sculptured on some conspicuous part so that the travellers eye often catches these words erected by  esquire mayor even upon a mean edifice  carlisle about the beginning of the present century exhibited no marks of modern convenience and elegance the buildings mostly of wood clay and laths bespoke the poverty and bad taste of the inhabitants the gabels fronted the streets the doors were generally in the center and many of the houses had porches which projected two or three yards into the street doubtless for warmness the front door was arched or gothic formed to correspond with the gabel and the diminutive windows which gave light to the inner apartments were very improperly placed but of the same order the most of the houses did not exceed the height of one story and were chiefly covered with thatch those of two stories had the upper rooms inlaid with strong oak and unceiled below the lanes and avenues ven the church road were not paved and in many places entirely covered with weeds and underwood the streets not often trod upon were in many parts of them green with grass the doors were of oak very strong and clumsy put together with large wood pins a part of which projected an inch or two from the door these pins were many in number and sometimes placed in figures romanticly irregular houses were not then painted either within or without this being only a modern improvement the streets though spacious were paved with large stones and the center part or causeway rose to a considerable height the fronts from the houses were paved in the same manner the consequence of which was that the kennels or gutters were deep trenches and stone bridges were placed in many different parts for the convenience of passing from one side of the street to the other these gutters were the reservoirs of all kinds of filth which when a sudden heavy rain happened by stopping the conduit of the bridges inundated the streets so as to render them impassable on foot  the shambles which stood in the market place were private property and being built entirely of wood and covered with different kinds of slate gave them a very grotesque and antique appearance at the north end of the shambles was a well over which was a building placed upon pillars called carnabys folly on the front of each side of this building was the fish market the folly and the shambles have been lately taken down the latter having been purchased at a great price by the corporation the former was their own property for this the corporation deserve the thanks of the inhabitants of carlisle as the shambles by occupying a great part of one of the principal streets of the city were a public nuisance  little more than half a century ago the inhabitants of carlisle carried on no foreign commerce  their trade consisted in that of a good weekly market two annual fairs and two extraordinary well attended statutes for hiring servants the annual fairs in this city formerly drew together numbers of people from many parts of england and scotland the business for the whole year was settled at these meetings as in many places the intercourse between town and town or man and man was not yet carried on by way of port carriers and other public conveyances the assize and public diversions contributed greatly to draw together the neighboring gentry though there was very little trade and commerce in this city yet the inhabitants did not seem to know the want of it the necessaries of life were uncommonly cheap and the chief part of their wearing apparel was of their own spinning  pride and luxury in eating drinking furniture and dress had not yet made their entrance within the city walls industry and hospitality were the prominent features of the people the victuallers brewed their own ale of a good quality and sold it for threepence a quart full measure and such was the custom of the place seldom did a company call for the second pot without the landlord or landlady presenting them with the fare of the house to relish their liquor spirituous liquors were very seldom made use of though the inhabitants were not opulent yet many of them had considerable property and for the most part under a good tenure the principal part of the houses in carlisle are freehold a few are leasehold under the dean and chapter and the corporation and a sew under the king   the town at the time we are speaking of was not very populous and therefore the office of mayor or chief magistrate was considered to be of great consequence he seldom appeared in public without the rod of justice and had always one of the sergeants to attend him the baleful seeds of party were not then sown among the inhabitants a friendly and neighbourly intercourse pervaded the whole city all the ancient customs were kept up with harmony and festivity and man united to man by love and good fellowship circumstanced as the inhabitants were living in the center of a rich and well cultivated country it is no wonder if their minds were free in ages prior to this era they had been exposed to one continued scene of warfare under this hazardous situation it may reasonably be supposed that their contentions could not lead them to dive much into the mysteries and fluctuations attendant upon a trading intercourse and suppose they had been in affluent circumstances it cannot be imagined they would have expended their money in building having been so long accustomed to the calamities incident to war they wished for nothing more than to enjoy that tranquillity they and their ancestors had been so long strangers to  this city continued in the situation abovementioned without any material alteration either in respect to trade or improvement in building till the rebellion in      soon after this period a company of hamburgh merchants fixed upon carlisle as a proper place to carry on an extensive woolen manufactory this manufactory was carried on to a very great extent in broad and plain cloths all the disserent branches of the business from the sheep shearing to the finishing the pieces were performed and as most of the work was done in various parts of the country the parishes were little affected by an increase of paupers the purvey then seldom exceeding twenty or thirty in a year this was the mode of collecting the poor rate at that time and for long after the distance from lincolnshire yorkshire scotland and those parts of the two kingdoms enriched with the staple commodity was a very inconsiderable object to this company of adventurers to facilitate this undertaking two gentlemen brothers of the name of dewlicher were sent over from the continent to superintend the work this manufactory was of great importance to the inhabitants of carlisle and the country around it brought from various parts of the three kingdoms many workmen in the different branches of the woolen trade people to the distance of twenty miles from the city were employed and every loom that could be got was engaged the most sanguine hopes were entertained that the undertaking would answer the end proposed and never were two men engaged in any business more carressed by all ranks of people than the dewlichers were a few years after this manufactory was established the elder brother died who had taken the most active part of the business upon himself and who from its flourishing state during his life seemed to be every way competent to so great a trust the younger brother had sometime prior to the death of the elder made a very imprudent connection by marriage with the house keeper to the family her maiden name was johnson this woman was weak and ambitious and by her was the ruin of this once flourishing manufactory brought about having the ascendancy over her credulous husband she persuaded him to dismiss most of the old workmen who were overseers from their employment these men having been bred to the business were capable of conduting the different branches of it in their places the relations and acquaintances of the new mistress were substituted people that knew nothing of the matter things soon began to wear a different aspect the workmen were much dissatisfied with their new masters quarrels and complaints daily increased and a very little time put a finishing hand to the whole undertaking for by mismanagement on the part of the new foremen and by the negligence and extravagance of the superintendant and his wife the company was declared insolvent and as no person or company would come forward as successors carlisle in a very little time was reduced to the state it was in at the commencement of this manufactory all the stock in trade as wool yarn cloth etc and all the implements of the work were sold by auction at scarcely a fourth part of the value the failure of this company was severely felt by many in carlisle and the neighborhood for as nothing was carried forward as a substitute to employ the industrious poor those who had been employed in the work were driven to travel with their families to different parts to seek for employment and for many months nothing but distress appeared around carlisle for several miles mr dewlicher for many years after concealed himself in some part of scotland some length of time after the failure of the company he once ventured in an obscure manner into the city and called late in the evening at the wool packinn a house much resorted to by the workmen the landladys name who then kept the inn was mary carlyle this hospitable widow entertained him for several days and taking pity on his indigent circumstances she at his departure put something handsome into his pocket he never was after this seen or heard of in or about carlisle     during the period we are speaking of provisions of all kinds were very cheap oats about  s carlisle bushel  barley  s  d do  black and white rye  s do  these two last kinds of grain were the principal bread of the inhabitants wheat and potatoes were but little cultivated in the neighborhood  butcher meat and fish seldom exceeded one penny farthing per pound and the former was sold by hand no weights or scales were then in use butter  d halfpenny per lb  eggs ten a penny  poultry very cheap  game of all kinds were sent weekly from hence to newcastle by packs during the season  carlisle bushel is three winchester   and most of the peoples apparel continued to be of their own spinning very little improvement had taken place in building and the streets continued in the same situation manure was at this time of so little value that the corporation gave a man forty shillings a year and a new cart occasionally to take it away once aweek all the goods which came to this place from newcastle were conveyed chiefly upon packhorses the roads were impassable the greatest part of the season for any other conveyance no public works were carried on except a small manufactory for linen by an alderman cook and a whip manufactory under the firm of brown and company which employed a few paupers whips and fishhooks were the two chief articles in trade carlisle was noted for browns whips  fords fishhooks great quantit es of coarse linen yarn were weekly exposed in this market for sale chiefly from the borders and scotland where the people grew their own flax and spun it this yarn was principally purchased by country weavers or by people commissioned to buy and send it to manufacturing towns those who did not grow their own flax bought it undressed of the shopkeepers in the city and slax dressers went about the country from village to village and house to house to dress it   little increase in population had hitherto taken place a few foot soldiers and artillery men kept garrison and these were quartered chiefly upon the public carlisle at this time kept up the appearance of a formidable place centries were stationed at every gate at the commandingofficers house the castle etc and the gates were shut and locked every night with much military parade morning and evening guns were fired as a signal when to open and shut the garrison gates and pieces of ordnance were placed upon the turrets situated in different parts of the fortification  the publicans still continued to brew their own ale and most of them made their own malt british spirits viz brandy gin cinnamon and anniseed waters were now so plenty and cheap that there was scarcely a gingerbread stall but sold them it had been a custom for many years backward for the corporation to demand multure by compelling the victuallers to grind the malt at their mills this began to be felt as an oppression and to remove the grievance and save the multure many of them provided small hand mills of their own the corporation irritated at this breach of what they deemed their right refused to grant licenses to the refractory innkeepers the public however would not comply but brought an action at law to compel them to show upon what grounds so intolerable and arbitrary a custom rested the action was determined in favor of the victuallers and this became a heavy stroke to the corporation revenue this action which was tried at york besides the loss of their mulcture was attended with a heavy expense to the body corporate it seems the corporation did not keep a horse a bull and a boar to substantiate their right to compulsive multure this the lord bishop of the diocese and the dean and chapter of carlisle always perform at their service mills   about the year    0 the trade of carlisle began to have a different appearance a manufactory of coarse linen cloth called osnaburghs was established the late aldermen richard and william hodgson were the proprietors of this osnaburgh manufactory this kind of work can be wrought by women and boys at the loom about the same time there arose a new woolen manufactory chiefly womens wear the proprietor of which was a george blamire from the time of the dewlichers the woolen business had been almost entirely neglected in carlisle the little which was done this way was by three brothers of the name of machrell from yorkshire blamires manufactory was of short duration and after his time except what was done by the machrells and by one thorpe and this to no great amount the business was no more pursued by any other adventurer  at the period we are speaking of the military road between carlisle and newcastle was begun prior to this date this road from the city was by the english gate and warwick bridge but now the route was changed and travelers go by the scotchgate the new road was planned near four miles more to the north than the old one the badness of the road had hitherto been a great hindrance to the conveyance of merchant goods from newcastle to this place and whitehaven and dumfries from this circumstance only had greatly the advantage but when this turnpike was completed then the case was much altered for the better large carts and wagons were soon introduced and nothing was now wanting but a sufficient loading from carlisle this want was in some sort supplied by people buying upon commission and others upon their own account and sending off large quantities of butter and bacon for the london market it was now that provisions began to rise in price the butchers to sell their meat by weight and the country frugal housewise to throw aside her old pound stone substituting in its place the standard of sixteen ounces for weighing her butter every article of life increased in value in the mean time the face of the country began to wear a more cultivated aspect john holmes esquire who had estates in different parts of the county this gentleman kept in his own hand and improved the following valuable estates braken or brakenhill barrockside barrockfield barronling durdar ragmire brackenhow holmhill all in the neighborhood of carlisle beside a very large track of ground in abbey holme butter before this time was generally  0 or    ounces to the pound was a gentleman of a persevering spirit in making trial of the several modes of agriculture no part of husbandry was lost in him for the sake of expense or procuring men used to agricultural improvements mr holmes laudable spirit opened the eyes of the country in general and every succeeding year added something to the former to the advantage of the industrious husbandman it has already been observed that manure was of little value that what the streets of carlisle assorded was conveyed away by a person who had an annual salary it now became an article of value and the produce of the streets was generally put up to let along with the corporation lands this article now constitutes a part of the corporation revenue being let communibus annis for upwards of  0l   the county and city tolls were a part of the corporation revenue the number of black cattle which came into england from ireland and scotland by the way of cumberland and mostly by carlisle greatly increased the value of the toll but as the collecting of it was attended with trouble and danger the drovers endeavoring to evade this toll as an imposition it also underwent a trial at law in which the drovers were defeated on the grounds that the barrier fortress was still maintained but as the collecting of this toll from these refractory people is still attended with difficulty the person who undertakes the whole farm from the corporation generally lets it out in parcells to different people who live most contiguous to the places where the droves take their departure out of the county  at this period manufactories of linen and cotton began rapidly to increase in carlisle and this increase in the branches of spinning and weaving brought many scotch and irish weavers with their families to reside in the city and its environs the population of the city had increased very little for forty or fifty years prior to the establishment of these manufactories the bleaching of yarn was a consequent of these manufactories and it went on very prosperously carlisle is a place very well adapted for carrying on the linen and cotton manufactories to a very great extent the progress of improvement advanced with rapid steps every year houses were rebuilt upon a more elegant plan and also many new ones the grass which disfigured the streets lanes and avenues began daily to disappear  in the year      a brewery commenced in the suburbs of the city without the irish gates under the firm of atkinson and co but the inhabitants of carlisle and the neighborhood having been long accustomed to home brewed ale did not relish this factory drink so that it was sometime before this public brewery met with much encouragement though after a few years trial the prejudice was entirely removed and the success of the undertaking has sufficiently proved its utility and fully answered the end the company had in view the many new manufactories now begun and the increase of population attendant on them raised the purvey but as this did not then seem grievous to the ancient inhabitants i only mention it as a prelude to what afterward became a severe burden not long after the streets of the city and that part of the liberties without the walls were paved upon a new plan this alteration for the better to the great credit of the corporation removed many intolerable nuisances and the inhabitants of the suburbs and that part of the suburbs which came under the direction of the surveyor of the highways were also put under a proper regulation richardgate felt the good effects of this alteration being exposed to inundations from the overflowing of the river eden it now felt only in part what formerly was almost general  in the year      were brought here a number of french prisoners from edinburgh castle these were soon followed by the regular troops of thurots squadron captured by the brave captain elliot and about three or four hundred more were sent to carlisle from launceston in cornwall all these prisoners except thurots regulars were upon their parole of honor as each of these prisoners had seven shillings a week regularly paid them this caused a deal of money to be expended the french prisoners were soon after followed by the westmorland militia and as the inhabitants of that county were much prejudiced against a military life they entered into a voluntary subscription to allow their balloted men or substitutes an additional sum to the kings pay so that many of the privates had from one to three shillings per day two companies of invalids kept garrison in the castle the militia kept an officers guard at cromwells greenhouse and did also duty as sentinels at the several gates such a number of men in the city and so well circumstanced as to money greatly benefited the place the consequence of this influx of wealth was the introduction of more expensive modes of living now four wheeled carriages began to run from the different inns dr waugh dean of worcester a coach and four horses major farrer kept a single horse chaise mr dobinson a single horse chaise general stanwix a coach and sour horses when the family was in town which was but seldom these were all the private carriages kept in the city at this time to this period      there had not been any public conveyance for travelers in post chaise from this city hitherto balls and assemblies had been kept in a room at the castle and when any gave a ball it was chiefly at the bush inn but now an assembly room is built and finished for that purpose in a plain and neat manner  the year      saw new works established a company from newcastle begun the calico printing business which has been progressively carried on ever since and affords employment to many hundreds of men women and children this was followed by an extensive manufactory carried on by the ingenious bernard barton whose premature death deprived the public of the abilities of an able and enterprising tradesman these public works employed a great deal of good land about the city so that the value of ground either in the selling price or in letting rose considerably and the increase of population owing to these causes may reasonably be supposed to occasion an equal rise in every other article bought and sold  as the year      was an era of real advantage to carlisle both with respect to the prospect of an increasing commerce and the further progress of politics the reader we hope will not deem it improper that we are a little more particular the printing or stamping of calico was introduced here about this period gentlemen from newcastle and its vicinity under the firm of scot lamb and co were the first establishers of this branch of trade in the environs of carlisle and as the calico business has been the principal means of increasing the population of the city it is sufficient to remark that the flourishing advances of this manufactory induced others to form themselves into companies to begin and carry on the same business some of them were men unacquainted with commerce for in former times a country esquire would have thought it a degradation of his rank to have his name entered with any company in a manufacturing or mercantile line time has removed this prejudice and men are convinced that trade enriches in particular those engaged in it and the public in general common day labor for men not bred to any mechanic trade and lint or two spinning for women in indigent circumstances was all the employment that could be obtained eight pence or ten pence a day without victuals was as much as a labourer could earn and a woman must have worked very hard at her wheel to make a shilling a week the employment for children was winding pirns for weavers or twisting whips for which they had only about eight pence per week and generally worked sixteen hours out of the twentyfour  the establishment of the calico manufactory greatly altered the case the work in the green or bleachyard found employment for men and stout boys apprentices were taken to the several branches of the work viz drawers cutters and calico printers at a genteel weekly allowance and their wages increased as they advanced in their servitude little boys were employed as tearing boys to the printers women had tables set out for them to pencil the colors into the pieces every table employed three or four female children and even the youngest boys and girls could make near two shillings per week such encouragement brought numbers of families out of the country into the city and suburbs and so great was the change that a common labourer who probably with his wifes assistance did not make above eight shillings weekly could by having his family fixed in the manner represented easily earn twenty or thirty shillings a week nay such was the infatuation of the young men or desire of great wages that many who had served an apprenticeship to a mechanic trade bound themselves a new to the stampery and even those that were married followed the same steps persuaded that this manufactory would give the whole family bread people of property reaped their advantage from this increase of population as land and houses increased in value  the several manufactories began to thrive much beyond the most sanguine expectation people in trade with little to begin with acquired fortunes which enabled them to live in a much more splendid style than formerly the town rapidly improved and the land around increased in value far beyond what could have been foreseen the advantages however were balanced by some inconveniences people of property who tasted not the sweets of a thriving trade began to feel the disadvantages which arose from the increase of population before the year      the poor rates were not felt by those who paid them forty purveys in a year was the annual collection this was the mode pursued and the inhabitants acted in the office of collecting by rotation but the increase of manufactories invited numbers of strangers here for bread the town was soon filled with scotch and irish families and as these people had no place to return to in case of indigence and sickness they became a great burden upon the ancient inhabitants this was not the only grievance the mode of collection was very irregular being still by the old rate new improvements did not pay any kind of proportion nor did the manufacturers though those were the only people that throve by this increase of trade and the cause which brought these strangers to the city pay any kind of rate for their valuable stocks in trade this caused a general murmur amongst the ancient inhabitants and a redress was loudly called for a pound rate was thought to be the most equitable mode and after many vestry meetings it was finally agreed to all this time neither the parish of st mary or st cuthbert had a common workhouse the poor were either let out or paid out in their own houses the parish of st mary seeing the disadvantage which arose from this mode of providing for the poor entered into a subscription to build a workhouse the good effects of which have been felt by the inhabitants as well as by the poor that receive the benefit  the chief part of the manufactoring business before the year      consisted of a few check and osnaburg looms and about a dozen of looms employed in weaving very fine linen but after the establishment of the manufactory of printed or stamped calicoes cotton looms were set up the stamperies had before this been supplied with cottons from lancashire at an extraordinary expense in carriage but now machinery for carding roving and spinning of cotton is erected in different places in the neighborhood of the city and they purchase their cottons at a cheaper rate this machinery employs a great number of men and women of old and young buildings particularly in the environs have amazingly increased and so has every trade in proportion  we shall now only paticularize the different employments   at present there are four printfields which employ about one thousand people and pay above  0000l annually to the revenue their firms are messrs lamb scot forster and co  messrs losh and co messrs mitchell ellwood and co  messrs donald carrick shaw and co  messrs wood and co who employs above two hundred people in spinning of cotton  messrs forsters

next in extent in similar articles  messrs langcake mcwilliam and co manufacturers in similar articles  messrs stoddards ditto  mr thomas pearson ditto  mr nixon ditto  messrs wilson and co muslins  besides the brewery previously mentioned a few years after another was established near it now under the firm of messrs pattrickson and co and lately mr daniel pattinson erected another these three breweries pay above  000l duty annually and just now there is another erected by mr haugh  there is a soapry under the firm of messrs barker and langcake which pays about   00l duty annually when thereto is added the duties upon candles leather licenses and other things under the excise carlisle pays above  00000l annual revenue  besides these public works there are many others on a smaller scale and all the common trades are carried on to great perfection  the late mr forster and sons established a bank here and mr wilson another which is of great service to trade  wages within these twelve months have rose much owing to the advance in all the necessaries of life  calico printers make from one and a half to two guineas per week carpenters joiners masons and bricklayers here  s  d per day laborers from  s to  s  d weavers earn from  0s to  l  s per week according to their abilities and the same with all the other trades  for the former rate of wages provisions etc see our account of brampton being nearly the same vol i page      friendly societies were established here about twenty years ago and are now seven for men and three for women consisting of about twelve hundred members a number of gentlemen are joined to these societies which add much to their respectability and strengthens their funds their allowance to sick and old members is in proportion to their

respecting carlisle market lamb in the early part of the season sells for  s  d per lb but continues lowering in value as it becomes less rare till it may be bought for  d halpenny and  d per lb from christmas till about lady day ten to twelve carcases of beef are weekly disposed of in the market from that time till martinmas sixteen to eighteen may be sold per week and from martinmas to christmas thirtyfive to forty per week the reason why the number increases so much in the latter period is a prevalent custom among the people in the neighboring country of buying a quantity of beef at that season to salt and dry for the winters use  salmon is caught in large quantities in the eden near carlisle it becomes in season the beginning of december but as it brings a high price in london manchester etc few purchasers are found here while it continues at about  s per lb but as the season advances the prices drop because in warm weather it cannot be sent to a distance and is therefore sold in the neighborhood at about  d per pound in the autumn salmon is generally cheapest when several of the middling and lower classes of people salt and dry it in that state we presume it affords a very unwholesome food tending to occasion scurvies and other impurities of the blood  fuel is coal from blenkinsop blenkinsop is the property of a mr coulson talkin and tindalefells distant twenty twelve and fifteen miles to the east and are the property of the earl of carlisle coal from the first mentioned place has the preference that article is brought from the pits to market in single horse carts and disposed of neither by weight or measure but by the cart load consequently a very discriminating eye is necessary to prevent being imposed on  coals that are sold by dealers are commonly  d the carlisle peck  peats from scaleby and roweliff mosses distant five miles ten for a penny  public inns here have good accommodation both in rooms and stabling  the bushinn englishstreet and crown and mitre castle street are the houses the mailcoaches put up at the kings arms grapes blue bell and dukes head are also much resorted to by travelers there are several other good inns both in the city and suburbs  the mailcoaches and other public carriages are numerous here  two mailcoaches set out every morning for london one by manchester and the other by borrowbridge a heavy coach is also forwarded to the metropolis every monday wednesday and friday  a mailcoach every afternoon to glasgow and a mail diligence at the same time to dumfries  a diligence goes from this to edinburgh every monday wednesday and friday and to newcastle on sundays tuesdays wednesdays and fridays and one to whitchaven on saturdays  the arrivals are in proportion to their several distances  wagons and carts for the conveyance of goods are exceeding numerous here being the great thoroughfair between england and scotland in this branch of commerce there are above two hundred horses employed and as most of the goodsstood in the public streets during the market great inconvenience was felt now each are getting private warehouses and it is much to be wished that a proper marketplace was provided for the butchers as their shambles greatly incommode the streets  literature in this department carlisle can boast of many literary productions and perhaps there are few towns in this kingdom where literature has flourished more than it has done here of late years  we shall mention only the names of the authors and their works  the rev w paley d d archdeacon of this diocese published while he resided in this city moral and political philosophy horae paulinae reasons for contentment a view of the evidence of christianity and occasional sermons all which works as they possess a high degree of celebrity so have been well received by a discerning public  the rev b grisdale d d two occasional sermons  the rev j d carlyle b d chancellor of this diocese prose and poetical translations from the arabic  the rev r miln a m dissenting minister lectures upon the antedeluvian world and occasional sermons  the rev g thomson ditto the spirit of modern history and occasional sermons  r harrington m d several treatises upon air phlogiston etc  j heysham m d a treatise upon the jail fever bills of mortality etc  mark lonsdale poems and pieces adapted for the theater  arts sciences etc these have kept pace with the other improvements of this city  guy head an ingenious artist who from the years of infancy manifested a strong genius in painting and drawing and to a fancy bold and vigorous joined assiduity rarely concentrated in one person the talents of this gentleman are now likely to reflect honor on his native city as he has been for some years resident in italy for the purpose of studying the excellent remains of the italian masters  robert smirke esquire r a historical painter is a native of this county and passed many of his juvenile years at carlisle where his father then resided he gave some proofs of that genius which has since placed him at the head of one of the most exalted departments of his profession  robert carlyle excells in drawing antiquities and copying his drawing of the cathedral of carlisle and other antiquities are specimens of his abilities this way and do him credit as they gained him the silver medal from the society for the encouragement of the arts etc  james lowes a selftaught draughtsman and engraver whose first attempts as an artist are coeval with the commencement of this history and his improvement is to be traced in the work we can always vouch for the accuracy if not the elegance of all his works  john howard a native of this city at present a teacher of mathematics in newcastle is well known to all the lovers of that science he has the most extensive knowledge of all the parts of mathematical learning and is a selftaught genius robert bowman a pupil of his blind from his infancy is also a rare instance of genius he is a perfect master of the higher branches of the mathematics  joseph strong blind from his infancy is a musician and an artist in the latter capacity he constructed a tolerable well toned organ and is a great proficient in fancyweaving so true it is that with a sound judgment a ready apprehension and strong imagination great progress may be made without sight in the arts and sciences  edward

authors permission we have made this abridgment to whom we are under great obligations for this and the population of many other parishes  the editors       the advantages which may be derived from accurate registers of mortality are thus illustrated by an ingenious philosopher and physician the establishment of a judicious and accurate register of the births and burials in every town and parish would be attended with the most important advantages medical political and moral by such an institution the increase or decrease of certain diseases the comparative healthiness of different situations climates and seasons the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity with many other curious circumstances not more interesting to physicians than beneficial to mankind would be ascertained with tolerable precision in a political view exact registers of human mortality are of still greater consequence as the number of people and progress of population in the kingdom may in the most easy and unexceptionable manner be deduced from them they are the foundation likewise of all calculations concerning the values of assurances on lives reversionary payments and of every scheme for providing annuities for widows and persons in old age in a moral light also such tables are of evident utility as the increase of vice or virtue may be determined by observing the proportion which the diseases arising from luxury intemperance and other similar causes bear to the rest and in what particular places distempers of this class are found to be most fatal  percivals essays vol ii  carlisle is situated in latitude       north and is surrounded by a wall about a mile and a quarter in circumference the situation is rendered exceedingly pleasant by its vicinity to three beautiful rivers with which it is almost surrounded viz the eden on the north east side petteral on the south east and caldew on the northwest the air about carlisle is pure and dry the soil chiefly sand and clay no marshes or stagnant waters corrupt the atmosphere its neighborhood to a branch of the sea and its due distance from the mountains on all sides render the air temperate and moderate  in july      at the request of dr littleton lord bishop of carlisle the inhabitants were numbered with great care and attention by the rev mr richardson the rev mr simpson and mr alderman hodgson there were at that time in the city and suburbs  0   families and      inhabitants  in january    0 a very careful and accurate survey was made by mr stanger and mr howard under my own inspection when there were in the district before surveyed     houses   0  families and      inhabitants  for a more particular account of the survey  see tables i ii iii  this astonishing increase of      inhabitants which is above half of the original number in the small space of seventeen years may in some measure be attributed to the establishment of manufactories  this increase of population too has taken place during that very period in which dr price asserts the depopulation of great britain to have been rapid and progressive and what makes this increase more remarkable carlisle has during the whole period alluded to been constantly supplying the army the navy the metropolis and even the distant regions of india with her hardy active and enterprizing sons  from tables number iv v and vi we can with pleasure demonstrate the extreme salubrity of carlisle even in a very unhealthy year a year in which no less than     persons were cut off by two epidemic disorders viz the small pox and scarlet fever by the bills of mortality published in different towns in england as well as the continent it appears on an average that in vienna about   in    and a half of the inhabitants die annually in london   in  0 and three quarters in edinburgh   in  0 and four fifths in leeds   in    and three fisths in dublin   in    in rome   in    in amsterdam   in    in breslaw   in    in berlin   in    and a half in northampton and shrewsbury   in    and a half in liverpool   in    and a half in manchester   in    in chester   in  0 but in the year      when the small pox were very general and fatal   in    and in the parish of sedburgh in the county of york   in    and a half and in blandford forum in dorset   in    in carlisle this year   in  0 and three ninths  see table vii  tables number iii v and vi are of the utmost importance to the physician the politician and the calculator of annuities and to every one who has the health and happiness of himself and family at heart they clearly demonstrate as far as one years observation can have weight what periods of life are the most healthy what are the most obnoxious to disease  as no particular epidemic disease occurred last year which had any considerable effect on the lives of adult persons it is apprehended these calculations for the periods above ten years old will not be attended with much variation in other years  that women in general live longer than men is almost universally agreed and the following observations tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion during the last year twelve persons died between eighty and ninety years old eight of these were females and between ninety and a hundred two died both females  see table vi in table iii we see two people are above  00 years old and these likewise are females  table ii which contains the number of husbands wives etc shows how inferior in number widowers are to widows there are above four widows to one widower an astonishing disproportion in what manner is it to be accounted for the following causes are conceived to operate considerably   st men are in general more intemperate than women  d they are exposed to greater hardships and dangers  d widowers perhaps in general have greater opportunities of getting wives than widows have of getting husbands  th widows have a greater propensity to live in towns than widowers women in general and more especially among the middle ranks of life marry earlier than men  th and lastly the constitutions of males as fitted for more violent and laborious exertions are firmer and more robust than those of females their muscular and nervous fibers may therefore be supposed to become stiff rigid and incapable of performing the functions necessary to health and life sooner than those of females both on account of their original texture and the friction which must necessarily occur from laborious exercise but from whatever causes the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may arise the fact itself is sufficiently ascertained by table vi where we find that between the ages of sixty and seventy although there are a greater number of wives than husbands yet eleven husbands and only four wives have died and of all different ages twentynine husbands and sixteen wives  during this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence and swept off a great number of children viz the small pox and a species of the scarlet fever  as the persons affected with the small pox were chiefly of the lower class who seldom called in medical assistance it is impossible to ascertain the precise number from the information however which i have had it appears that about  00 were during the last six months of the year seized with the small pox in the natural way of these no less than ninety fell victims to its virulence hence near one in three died of all that were affected with the natural small pox which while at the same time it serves as a melancholy proof of its fatal effects points out the great and salutary advantages which are derived from inoculation during the same period several hundreds were inoculated in the neighborhood of carlisle and it is a pleasing truth that not one of them died had those  00 been inoculated it is more than probable that of the ninety not above six would have died and even these not of inoculation but of other disorders hence we see eightyfour persons might have been saved to their parents and the public yet so great is the prejudice against the salutary practice of inoculation amongst the vulgar that few very few can be prevailed upon either by promises rewards or entreaties to submit to the operation no wonder that in rude ignorant and barbarous times superstition hurried men into the grossest absurdities when in a polished and enlightened age in an age too when the experience of full twenty years has clearly demonstrated the utility of inoculation we see the bulk of mankind ready to sacrifice their children and all that is dear to them to a foolish prejudice  for the year    0 the population of great britain must ever be a subject deserving the attention of every lover of his country and especially since the commencement of the present war it has become highly interesting  within these few years some very able writers have published their thoughts and calculations on this subject those who are willing to depreciate the resources of this country and to magnify those of our enemies have endeavored to persuade us that our situation is truly lamentable and that population has rapidly and progressively decreased for this twenty or thirty years past  the data from which these calculations and inferences have been made are principally the returns of the window surveyors and the books of the customs and excise  others who from different sources of information have attempted to confute such sentiments have presented us with a more favorable picture they with much appearance of truth have endeavored to prove that the number of inhabitants in great britain instead of decreasing has considerably increased during the period above alluded to in support of the latter hypothesis i think it may not be improper to mention the following facts   in the beginning of the year    0 i made an actual and i believe an accurate survey of the two parishes st marys and st cuthberts and found they contained      houses      families and      inhabitants see last years observations on the bills of mortality for carlisle a few months afterward another actual survey was made of the two parishes by mr coulson general surveyor of the four northern counties for the windowtax and mr william monkhouse surveyor of cumberland leith and eskdale wards and though i have every reason to apprehend that their survey was much more accurate than surveys for the windowtax heretofore have been yet they only returned     houses the difference therefore between the real number of houses and the number returned to the windowtax is     now to show how fallacious all calculations are with respect to the number of inhabitants in any particular place founded on the returns of the surveyors of the windowtax even when they make the most accurate survey let us suppose i had wanted to ascertain the number of inhabitants in carlisle and the adjoining villages and had been ignorant of the real number of houses which they contained i should have multiplied     by   and two thirds which is nearly the number of people in each house the product will be      nearly which is      less than the real number or two sevenths nearly of the whole and if i had been ignorant of the number of inhabitants in each house i should most probably have multiplied     by   which would have made the difference still more considerable  the salubrity of carlisle was proved by the bills of mortality published last year and it appears still more evident from the present for only   in    and a half nearly of all the inhabitants have died this year in consequence of diseases  see table vii  table vi coroborates the observations made in the last years bills viz that women live longer than men for between  00 and  0  years old two persons died who were both females    husbands and only    wives have died although there are a greater number of wives than husbands in carlisle  for the year      people of all ranks ages and conditions of life enjoyed an uncommon degree of health during the first three months of this year for within that period no more than twentythree persons died and of these fifteen were either very young children or old and infirm but about the beginning of april a very epidemic fever evidently the typhus carcerum began to make its appearance it broke out in a house in rickergate which contains about half a dozen very poor families the rooms are exceeding small and in order to diminish the windowtax every window that even poverty could dispense with was shut up hence stagnation of air which was rendered still more noxious by the filth and uncleanliness of the people the surgeon who attended some of those poor wretches told me the smell was so offensive and disagreeable that it was with difficulty he could stay in the house while he inquired into the situation of his patient one of the persons affected with the fever in this house was a weaver who on his recovary went to his usual employment at a large workshop where he communicated the disorder to his fellowweavers and from thence the fever spread all over the town it however chiefly i may almost say entirely raged amongst the common and lower ranks of people and more especially amongst those who lived in narrow close confined lanes and in small crowded apartments it affected adults more frequently than children the infirm than the robust women than men and the married were more subject to it than the single three or four persons in a family were frequently seized with it one after another it was almost altogether confined to this place none being seized with it ever in the neighboring villages except in a very few instances where the feeds of it were evidently carried by some persons who had labored under the disease in the short space of about eight months near five hundred persons were affected with this fever fortyeight of whom died of these one was under five years o age two between five and ten one between ten and fifteen two between fifteen and twenty one between twenty and thirty eight between thirty and forty thirteen between forty and fitty twelve between fifty and sixty six between sixty and seventy two between seventy and eighty years  the small pox were constantly in town all this year but made little or no progress till toward the latter end of october when they became rather more general but they could scarce ever be said to rag as an epidemic nineteen only died no other epidemic appeared and indeed excepting the jail fever this year was by no means unhealthy great numbers were inoculated both in the town and country villages  during the present year   in    and   fifths of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases  see table vii  the difference of the number of deaths of husbands and wives is not near so great as it was in the years      and    0 yet still the deaths of the former exceed those of the latter by two for thirty three husbands and only thirtyone wives have died which difference is not the less extraordinary than i the two preceding years when we consider in the first place that the constitutions of women are more predisposed to be acted upon by the contagion of the jail fever than those of men and in the second that they are from their habits and situations in life infinitely more exposed to that contagion between eighty and ninety years of age five males and four females and between ninety and an hundred three females have died  see table vi  for the year      upon the whole this year notwithstanding it was so extremely cold and wet cannot be considered as an unhealthy one the typhus carcerum or jail fever which raged with so much violence last year gradually declined and was scarcely to be met with after may sixteen persons died of it  and although the small pox were constantly in town yet they were neither general nor very fatal thirty persons only died of that disease  in the beginning of june the catarrhus contagiosus or influenza became general very few families either in the town or country escaping its influence it is perhaps the most contagious of all disorders to which the human body is subject and were it as fatal as it is infectious it would soon depopulate the world when it once breaks out it does not like the small pox the plague or the jail fever confine itself to a city a province or a kingdom but traverses whole continents and is sometimes wafted across the atlantic ocean it has raged no less than eleven or twelve times as an epidemic in europe within the present century and pretty generally exhibits the same phoenomena yet no barrier has hitherto been discovered to arrest its progress nor have the causes which first produced it at each period been yet ascertained fortunately however it is a very mild disease differing little from the common catarrh or cold except that the febrile symptoms are more constant and rather more severe the influenza attacked every age sex and apparently people of every habit yet it is evident a predisposition was required as several and among the rest myself who were frequently exposed to the contagion escaped the disease in what that predisposition consists remains yet to be discovered it finished its course in the neighborhood of carlisle in about the space of three weeks or a month and its symptoms were here so mild that medical advice was seldom sought for one person only is supposed to have died of it in carlisle viz a woman sixtyfive years of age during this year   in    of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases  see table vii  hitherto the number of deaths of husbands has considerably exceeded those of wives each year but during the present year the deaths of wives somewhat exceed for twentytwo wives and only twenty husbands have died  see table vi  between eighty and ninety years of age five males and nine females and between ninety and a hundred one male and two females have died between a hundred and one and a hundred and two years of age one female viz a widow died during the present year  see table vi  in the month of august not one person died in the parish of st cuthbert a circumstance which has not occurred these twenty years  for the year      the present year has been much more healthy than any of the preceding years on which observations on the bills of mortality in carlisle have been made for notwithstanding the number of inhabitants has considerably increased yet the number of deaths is by no means so great one hundred and eighty one persons only have died  no dangerous or fatal epidemic except the small pox raged with any degree of violence  the weather during the latter end of june the whole of july and part of august was extremely hot and sultry the atmosphere was replete with the electric fluid and there was more thunder and lightening than ever was remembered even by the oldest person this state of the atmosphere was by no means peculiar to the neighborhood of carlisle but was pretty universal throughout europe  in september and october the small pox became so general and were of so fatal a kind that the monthly committee of the dispensry were of opinion that a general inoculation of the poor and indigent inhabitants would be attended with very beneficial effects early in the month of november a general inoculation accordingly took place great numbers were inoculated not only by the surgeon to the dispensary but also by most of the other surgeons in the town by this salutary measure the city of carlisle was in the space of two months totally freed from a most dangerous and fatal disorder which has been raging in different parts of the county with the utmost violence the number of persons affected with the natural small pox in whitehaven within the last six months have been almost incredible and it is a melancholy truth that scarcely one in three survived in wigton and its neighborhood they have been also extremely general and fatal  twenty nine husbands and twenty three wives have died this year  see table vi  between eighty and ninety years of age four males and seven females six of whom were widows and between ninety and an hundred one male and one female have died  see table vi  nineteen only fell victims to the small pox and seventeen of these were children under five years of age  a poplexies were remarkably frequent this year no less than nine persons having died of that distemper  the number of deaths were remarkably equal during all the seasons fortyseven died in winter fortytwo in the spring forty five in the summer and fortyseven in autumn  see table iv  during the present year   in    and   th of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases  see table vii  for the year      in the observations on the bills of mortality for last year i took notice of the extreme healthiness of that season it is however with peculiar satisfaction i am able to inform the public that it has been far exceeded in salubrity by the present  one hundred and fiftyfour persons only have died which are fewer by twentyseven than died last year and in the year      the number swept off by two diseases only viz the small pox and scarlet fever was nearly equal to the whole number of deaths this year whether occasioned by diseases or accidents  this remarkable degree of healthiness may be accounted for from the absence of almost all epidemical disorders for not one made its appearance except the small pox which were of a very mild kind and proved fatal to no more than ten persons nine of whom were under five years of age how to account for the absence of all other epidemic and contagious diseases is not so easy  with respect to the weather i shall only remark that the present year commenced and ended with the severest and longest continued frosts ever remembered since the year    0 the summer too was uncommonly cold and wet and yet was the healthiest season as may be seen by examining table iv  whether the severity of the frost had any effect in purifying the air and hence rendering it unfavourable to the propagation etc etc of epidemical disorders perhaps may be doubted but it certainly operated most powerfully in the production of an obstinate cutaneous disease by physicians denominated herpes but by the common people and empiries called scurvy though it is essentially different from that disorder  this cutaneous complaint viz herpes has been extremely prevalent and remarkably obstinate these two last winters and has appeared under a variety of forms  the number of deaths of husbands still continues to exceed that of wives and this year in a very great proportion for twenty nine husbands have died but only twenty wives  see table vi  four widowers and twentyfour widows have died  between eighty and ninety years of age four males and nine females eight of whom were widows and between ninety and an hundred one male and three females have died  see table vi  hitherto the number of males born has exceeded the number of females but this year it is the reverse for     males and     females have been christened  see table viii  during this year   in  0 and   th nearly of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases  see table vii  for the year      the present year like the last was ushered in by a very severe and long continued frost there was also a considerable fall of snow and a complete thaw which was slow gradual and without rain did not take place till near the middle of april the thaw was succeeded by cold easterly winds which continued a long time and a greater degree of drought was scarcely ever remembered the fields were parched the springs and rivers were almost dried up circumstances not to be wondered at when we consider that there was no rain a very few slight showers excepted from the month of october      till the   th of july on that day we had in the neighborhood of carlisle a great deal of thunder and lightning accompanied by a most violent and heavy rain and from that time till near the end of the year the weather became moist and warm  notwithstanding this long continued drought the weather was never exceedingly hot or sultry which may probably be the reason why dangerous disorders were not more prevalent for this year was far from being unhealthy no epidemic diseases occurring but such as had arisen before the dry and warm season came on which therefore could have no effect in producing them  very early in the month of january the jail fever which i believe first originated among the felons confined in the jail began to make its appearance in the city and continued to rage almost the whole of the year as the poorest class of inhabitants chiefly suffered from it its progress etc will be best ascertained by examining the books of the dispensary where i find four patients laboring under the disorder were admitted in the month of january four in february four in march three in april eight in may eight in june ten in july fifteen in august nineteen in september eleven in october and eleven in november in december it seems to have almost entirely ceased for not one was admitted during that month ninetyseven patients affected with this fever were therefore admitted into the dispensary in the space of eleven months  the present epidemic was of the same nature as that which appeared at carlisle in the year      and of which i published an account it however differed in some few particulars which difference i shall briefly relate   it did not rage so universally the contagion probably not being so virulent   the symptoms in general were more mild   petechiae and haemorrhages were seldom observed   a greater proportion of children were affected   relapses were much more frequent in the fever of      i did not see one instance of a relapse whereas in the present it was a very common circumstance several patients having even two relapses  of the ninetyseven patients laboring under this fever and which were admitted into the dispensary only four have died who were all in extreme danger at the time of their admission and two of them so much exhausted as not to be able almost to take any medicine viz margaret storey of rickergate a married woman aged fortytwo years who died on the third day after admission and mary wilson of nansons lane a child aged three years who died two days after admission if we therefore omit these two as cases already desperate ninetyfive will remain of which only two died which is exactly one in fortyseven and one half a circumstance which strongly marks the efficacy of the practice and more especially when it is considered that almost the whole of these patients were confined during their illness in small close dirty rooms where in some cases six persons were ill at the same time and sometimes even three of them in one bed  in the whole city nine persons died of this fever  before i conclude this part of my subject i cannot omit observing that the dispensary has expended upwards of thirty pounds for wine all of which was consumed by persons affected with this disouse  early in the month of december      the small pox were introduced by some vagrants into the damside irish gates to the neighborhood of which they were confined some time but afterward became general and continued till the latter end of july or beginning of august when they entirely ceased eight patients affected with the natural small pox were admitted into the dispensary in the month of january eight in february two in march twentyone in april nine in may and four in july in all fiftytwo twelve of whom died total of deaths of this disease thirtynine who were all under five years of age  as one in four and one third died of all those who were admitted into the dispensary it is highly probable that of the whole number who labored under the natural small pox many of whom had not the least advice or assistance one in four would die which makes the number affected one hundred and fiftysix as soon as the disease made its appearance within the walls of the city the monthly committee of the dispensary resolved that a general inoculation of the poor inhabitants agreeable to the plan which i had proposed in the year      the small pox both natural and from inoculation being now pretty general in carlisle and likely to spread still further the monthly committee of the carlisle dispensary are of opinion that a general inoculation of the poor and indigent inhabitants will be attended with very beneficial effects  rsolved  st that all such persons as come recommended by a subscriber shall be inoculated gratis at the dispensary   d that the sum of  s  d be given to the parents who are most indigent and who have three or more children inoculated as a reward for nursing them properly during inoculation   d that a subscriber of one guinea shall have the privilege of recommending three persons to be inoculated with the reward or five who do not require it and so in proportion for any larger sum   th that the privilege of being inoculated at the dispensary be continued for the space of two months and no longer   should take place at the dispensary and it was with great pleasure i observed the prejudices of the vulgar against that most salutary invention were greatly diminished for as soon as the resolution of the committee was made public by the common crier great numbers from all quarters of the town flocked to the dispensary to reap the benefits which it held out to them no less than ninety one were inoculated at the expense of the charity and rather more than that number by the different practitioners so that upon a moderate calculation the whole number inoculated this year amounted to two hundred every one of whom not only recovered but had the disease in a very favorable manner as we have stated it as probable that one in four died of the natural small pox it is therefore probable that fifty lives were saved by this general inoculation and if all those affected in the natural way had been also inoculated no less than eightynine lives would have been preserved  during this year   in    and   th nearly of all the inhabitants have died  see table vii  apoplexies and paralytic strokes were very frequent no less than eight suffered from the apoplexy  as usual the number of deaths of husbands continues to exceed that of wives twentynine husbands have died and only twentyfive wives  see table vi  nine widowers and twentyone widows have died this year  see table vi  persons between the ages of ten and fifteen and fifteen and twenty years have been astonishingly healthy when i made the survey of carlisle in the beginning of the year    0 there were between ten and fifteen seven hundred and fifteen and between fifteen and twenty years of age six hundred and seventyfive persons in all one thousand three hundred and ninety since that period the inhabitants have unquestionably increased much it is therefore very probable that at present there are not less than one thousand four hundred and fifty persons between the age of ten and twenty years and yet of this number only two have died  see table v  the present year however seems to have been fatal to old people between eighty and ninety years of age eight males and six females five of whom were widows and between ninety and an hundred two males and four females have died  see table vi  the number of males born greatly exceed the number of females for     males and     females have been christened  see table viii  for the year      although we had not nearly so much frost this year as the last yet in other respects the weather during the present spring and summer greatly resembled that of the year      the winds which were dry and cold came chiefly from the east during the whole of the months of march april and a part of may which made the spring late and although the drought which succeeded was not of equal duration yet it was much more intense and consequently the fields exhibited the same parched and arid appearance they had done the last summer refreshing rains fell toward the middle of july the autumn was fine and a more mild and open winter was seldom or ever remembered  there was scarcely any difference in the salubrity of the two years two hundred and four persons dying the last and two hundred and five in the present year june july and august which were the hottest months were by far the most healthy for only twentyfour persons died during that period  see table iv  on the contrary october november and december were the most unhealthy during which eightythree deaths occurred see table iv  this difference however did not seem to proceed from any alteration of the atmosphere but from the measles which were introduced into the town some time in august and raged during these three months with the greatest violence  about two oclock on friday morning august   th a slight shock of an earthquake was very sensibly felt by many persons in carlisle and the neighborhood those who were perfectly awake or who happened to be out of doors report that the concussion continued about four or five seconds and that it was immediately preceded by a hollow tremulous sound many were awakened out of their sleep by the shaking of their houses beds doors and window shutters birds in cages were likewise sensible of its influence and fluttered as if greatly agitated and alarmed very providentially however little or no damage was sustained a few chimneys and old walls were here and there thrown down and three people in whitehaven were thrown off their feet but in other respects a momentary fright and alarm were the only inconveniences which were suffered from it the concussion seemed to take its direction from the east to the west and extended quite across the island being felt both at neweastle and whitehaven and from the north toward the south it extended from glasgow to the northern parts of lancashire the atmosphere on wednesday and thursday preceding was moist gloomy and sultry and so much so on thursday night that a lady who was on a visit at dalston actually foretold when she went to bed that an earthquake would take place before morning friday was a very clear hot calm sultry day  early in the spring the measles made their appearance in the southwest parts of northumberland where i am informed they proved very fatal from thence they gradually advanced farther south and the infection began to operate in carlisle about the beginning of august and as this epidemic had not visited us since the year    0 there must consequently have been a great number of children who were liable to be affected by the contagious matter generated by this disorder hence the infection spread rapidly and the disease soon became general and continued to rage till the latter end of december or beginning of january      when it altogether disappeared  notwithstanding however the disorder was so very general yet its symptoms were extremely mild and favorable for of the great number who were affected i should suppose not less than six or seven hundred only twentyeight died and the greater part of these were the children of the very poorest and lowest class of inhabitants who were either too ignorant or too obstinate to call in medical assistance of the twentyeight who died twentysix were under five years of age and two were between five and ten years old  another epidemic viz the chincough occurred pretty early in the year but this disease made little progress until october and even then did not become very general only nine children who were all under five years of age died of it and some of those were affected with the chincough and measles at the same time and therefore probably suffered from the joint effects of both  during the present year   in    and   ths nearly of all the inhabitants died in consequence of diseases  see table vii  the number of deaths of husbands still continues to exceed that of wives twentyfour husbands have died and only twentyone wives  see table vi  between eighty and ninety years of age one male and five females who were all widows and between ninety and an hundred two widows have died  a man who had long been a soldier and who must consequently have been subject to many varieties and vicissitudes of life died at the advanced age of  0   for the year      in the beginning of january    0 the inhabitants of the two parishes of st marys and st cuthberts carlisle were very accurately numbered by mr stanger mr howard and myself at that period these parishes contained      males and      females in all       sometime in the year      an order was issued from the court of quarter sessions to the different constables in the county of cumberland to make an actual survey of all the inhabitants of the county the survey was accordingly made at carlisle in the latter end of december but as the motives which induced the magistrates to issue this order were not generally known many gentlemen refused to give an account of their families the abbey as being extraparochial and the township of wreay through some mistake were altogether omitted in this survey hence it is evident the lists delivered in to the quarter sessions are very erroneous  i however had an opportunity of examining all the returns of the above parishes very minutely and as the constables marked down the names of all those persons who refused to give them information i was enabled to make up the deficiency by procuring the numbers in each of their families and i am persuaded the enumeration is now pretty exact but if there be any error it will be on the side of deficiency rather than of excess  from this survey thus corrected it appears that the two parishes of st marys and st cutbberts contain at present      males      females and consequently      inhabitants  for a more particular account see table iii  there has therefore been an increase in the space of eight years of a thousand inhabitants which is a circumstance that must give great pleasure to all those who are wellwishers to the prosperity of the city of carlisle  from what causes it may be asked has this rapid increase arisen it affords me considerable satisfaction to be able to inform the public that it has principally been owing to two general causes viz the salubrity of the place and the increase of trade and manufactures the former is clearly proved by the great excess of births above deaths for during the last eight years the period in question  0   children have been baptized and only      persons have been buried the births therefore exceed the deaths     the latter viz the increase of trade and manufactures is proved by an ingress of inhabitants into carlisle exceeding the emigration out of it during the same period     which numbers together make up the increase of  000  inoculation i am persuaded has also greatly contributed to the increase of population not only in carlisle but likewise in the whole county of cumberland in the year      when the lower class of inhabitants were extremely averse to this salutary discovery no fewer than ninety persons died of the natural small pox whereas only     have died during the eight succeeding years which is upon an average not quite nineteen in each year and yet that disorder prevailed in every one of these years see all the bills of mortality which have been published since that period viz      the prejudices of the vulgar against inoculation have greatly diminished and will soon i doubt not be totally eradicated and since the institution of the dispensary the poor have enjoyed the privilege of having their children inoculated gratis an advantage which they have in general with great readiness embraced  the first four months of the present year greatly resembled the beginning of the year      the weather in both was remarkably mild and temperate for there was scarce any frost in either the common daisy was in full flower on newyearsday and continued in blossom almost the whole year the primrose began to blow on the  st of february and the coltsfoot and barren strawberry very early in the same month in short all the early flowering plants were in full blow five or six weeks before their usual time the state of the weather however throughout the year was the reverse of      and      these years were remarkably hot and dry this was cold gloomy and uncommonly wet insomuch that there never was a year in which probably more rain fell than in the present  the late dr carlyle kept an accurate account of the quantity of rain which fell at carlisle during a period of twenty years viz from the year      to      inclusive which his son the rev mr chancellor carlyle has been kind enough to communicate to me during this period the greatest quantity which fell in any one year was thirtyone inches and a few lines and the medium depth of these years was only twenty four inches eight lines and a half unfortunately since      no regular measure has been taken at carlisle but dr campbell a very ingenious physician at lancaster has sent me a table of the quantity which fell at that place during the present year and from which it appears that it amounted to the almost incredible quantity of fiftyone inches and one line the rain therefore which fell this year is considerably above double the quantity which has fallen in any one year on an average of twenty years calculation and exceeds in quantity twenty inches what fell in the wetest of the above years it must however be observed that lancaster is situated somewhat nearer the western ocean than carlisle and that the hills to the east and northeast of that place are nearer it than the hills about carlisle which in all probability will make some difference in the quantity of rain which falls at each place  notwithstanding the very great moisture of the atmosphere above related yet the present year was a healthy one and the last six months were remarkably so seventythree persons only died during that period  see table iv  the small pox made their appearance in january and were in carlisle the greatest part of the year but inoculation soon became general which prevented the disorder from raging with any great degree of violence thirty only died twentyeight of whom were under five years of age and two between five and ten years eightyfour were inoculated at the dispensary all of whom not only survived but had the disorder very favorably and considerable numbers were likewise inoculated by several surgeons in the town  the putrid or jail fever also prevailed almost the whole year but as it neither became general nor malignant till the beginning of      i shall at present only observe that fourteen persons fell victims to it  the difference in the number of deaths of husbands and wives is this year very considerable for thirtyfour husbands have died and only twenty two wives  see table vi  between eighty and ninety years of age five males and five females the latter were widows and between ninety and one hundred one male and two females have died  see table vi  during the present year only   in    nearly of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases and upon an average of the last nine years   in    and   th has died  see table vii it must be remarked in the first place that every infectious and epidemic disease to which the human body is subject the plague excepted prevailed during this period at carlisle and in the second place that the calculations were made for the first eight years from the number of inhabitants which existed in the beginning of the year    0 the great increase of one thousand not being ascertained till the present year      therefore although the deaths from accidents were not taken into the account for several of the first years yet upon the whole the mortality is stated to be greater than it actually is  see table vii  the deaths which occurred from accidents were in      four in    0 three in      five in      four in      three in      five in      four in      two and in      two  from table vii it appears that the most healthy period of human life is from ten to fifteen years of age and that health declines in the following order viz between  0 and  0     and  0    and  0   0 and  0   0 and  0   0 and  0   0 and  0  under     0 and  0   0 and  0   0 and  00  see table vii  table viii gives a connected view of all the christenings and burials from      to      inclusive  dr heyshams tables of deaths and diseases of persons of different ages are omitted as wholly appertaining to medical subjects  i shall conclude the observations on the bills of mortality with an account of a very curious and important circumstance in physiology which occurred at carlisle during the present year a child was born apparently at the full time not only alive but which lived and took nourishment several days without the smallest vestige of a brain in all my reading i do not recollect to have met with so extraordinary a phenomenon nor does it appear that professor monro who has spent the greatest part of his time in anatomical and physiological pursuits has either seen or read of any thing exactly similar he has indeed in his ingenious observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system published in      favored the world with some plates which represent the heads of two children born at the full time in which the bones which generally form the top of the cranium are wanting and in which the brain which is extremely small projects like an excrescence in these two instances however there was a small portion of brain in each and though both the children are stated to have been born at the full time yet it does not appear that they were even born alive much less that they lived any time after birth for if either had been the case we cannot suppose that a gentleman of dr monros great accuracy would have omitted circumstances so remarkable but i think we may on the contrary infer from his silence and from the following conclusions which he himself draws from the abovementioned monstrous productions and which i shall take the liberty of quoting as the work is not in every persons hands that they were really born dead   nay we may perhaps go a step farther and doubt whether instead of considering the brain as the origin of the nerves we ought not to consider it merely as connected with the nerves or whether there are better reasons for supposing the brain to produce the nerves than for supposing the nerves to produce the brain some facts at least may be here observed which seem to show that the nerves may exist independent of the brain  i in children delivered at the full time plump and well formed in their trunk and limbs i have observed the substance which supplied the place of the brain not more bulky than a small nut and instead of containing a white medullary substance it was of a red color resembling a clot of blood and small cords occupying the place of the optic nerves were likewise of a red color yet the spinal marrow and all the nerves from it had the ordinary size and appearance  ii in a monstrous kitten with two bodies and the appearance of one head i found the spinal marrow of one of the bodies connected with a brain and cerebellum of the common shape and size but the spinal marrow of the other body though equally large had only a small button of medullary substance at its upper end without a suitable brain or cerebellum see monros observations on the nervous system page        and table viii   an account of a female child which was born at carlisle at the full time alive and which lived five days and twentyone hours without the smallest appearance of a brain at eight oclock on monday morning may         mary clarke aged    years and the mother of six children some of whom are healthy and others unhealthy was delivered of a living female child at the expense of the carlisle dispensary  the midwife shocked at the strange and unusual appearance of the childs head sent for me immediately i got there about an hour after the delivery and at first sight it appeared evident that the bones which form the upper part of the scull were wanting and that the brain was only covered by its proper membranes the pia and dura matter and resembled a large excrescence which projected a little over the common integuments especially toward the forehead where it extended over the root of the nose the color of this substance was a dark reddish brown and upon examining it more particularly i thought i could perceive the division of the two hemispheres of the brain and likewise the division of the cerebrum from the cerebellum i gently raised with my fingers a part of it which projected over the integuments which made the child cry and produced a considerable starting similar to what is occasioned by an electric shock the child was full grown and seemed in perfect health her limbs were plump firm and well proportioned and she moved them with apparent agility the external organs of sense were also perfect she swallowed well and took a sufficient quantity of nourishment for several days but sometimes during the action of swallowing started a little she lived till five oclock on sunday morning june the  st when she expired some time before her death she was affected with flight convulsions during the three or four days preceding her death there was a constant discharge of a thin watery fluid somewhat tinged with blood from the excrescence which greatly diminished its bulk for at her death it was only about half the size of what it had been when she was born and the surface was in some places beginning to put on an appearance of mortification  a few hours after her death dr blamire and mr charles farish accompanied me to the house where dr blamire very cautiously dissected away from the bones the whole of the substance when we found the greatest part of the frontal the temporal the occipital and the whole of the parietal bones wanting the substance removed was then carefully examined and what was our astonishment to find it entirely to consist of membranes blood vessels but principally of several bags one of which was as large as a nutmeg the rest of different sizes but much smaller they were all filled with a brownish colored fluid which when the cysts were punctured gushed out with some violence  there was not the least appearance of cerebrum cerebellum or any medullary substance whatever the spinal marrow had a natural appearance but did not seem to have been connected with the parts above described  having accurately related the facts as they appeared to dr blamire and myself which for their singularity deserve to be recorded i think the few following obvious inferences may be drawn from them   that the fluid discharged from the excrescence during the life of the infant and which produced the great diminution of its bulk was occasioned by the rupture or erosion of cysts similar to those which remained sound and full of water after death  d that the living principle the nerves of the trunk and extremities sensation and motion may exist independent of and that the natural vital and animal functions may be performed without the brain and as the external organs of sense viz the eyes the nose the tongue and the ears all seemed perfect may we not therefore suppose that the optic the olfactory the gustatory and the auditory nerves may exist independent of and unconnected with either the brain or spinal marrow  i content myself with little more than describing this extraordinary case and leave to others to deduce from it such conclusions as the appearances observed may be thought to warrant  for the year      in the month of april this year a survey under the direction of the editors was made by mr johnston a person of accuracy and attention who found that the two parishes of st mary and st cuthbert contained      houses      families and  0    inhabitants it therefore appears that the increase since    0 has been      and since            for a more particular account of the different surveys which have been made see tables i and iii  middlescugh and brathwaite two small townships within the parish of st

north and south about five miles and a half east and west about three miles  soil and produce the soil is very different in quality and fertility a sandy or gravelly loam prevails in the vicinage of carlisle and carleton a loam in which clay predominates is found in most other parts of these parishes particularly about botchardby harraby uprightby blackhall and most parts of the chapel of wreay about cumersdale a greyish soil covers a stratum of clay toward the southern and western extremities are considerable tracts of moorish soils which not many years ago were very barren commons but which by enclosure and proper management are now generally in a progressive state of improvement  land near carlisle is chiefly applied to the purposes of dairying breeding and feeding sheep growing hay for horses etc wheat is the principal grain cultivated upon the best strong soils a fallow generally precedes on soils having a considerable portion of land turnips barley and clover or other artificial grasses are beginning to be much sown which is found to be a very profitable system potatoes form a considerable article of cultivation in these parishes on the late enclosed commons oats is the most prevailing crop that grain also has its turn in the course of husbandry in more fertile districts as have pease and beans i am sorry to add that the barbarous and unprofitable system of taking two or more white crops in succession though yearly losing ground has yet its advocates here the great quantity of manure made at carlisle fertilizes the soil in the neighborhood and the crops are generally abundant grass ground increase while that in tillage diminishes  rent within half a mile of carlisle is from  l to  l  0s per acre in old enclosures and pretty good soils at a greater distance from  l to about  l  0s there are however some farms where the soil is unfertile that do not fetch above  0s per acre  so great is the improvement of land in these parishes that i was told ground which did not bring more than  s per acre forty years ago is now let from  l to  l  0s per acre it was at that period in common field  sheep and cattle about five hundred or six hundred sheep may be kept here which are mostly of the short legged long wooled breed the standing stocks are improving in fineness of bone and wool and inclination to feed by tups of the improved breed from the stocks of mr culley and other eminent sheepbreeders in northumberland  mr porter of carlisle ranks among the first who introduced that profitable breed into cumberland and is now in possession of a valuable stock which depasture upon the swifts cattle are generally of the best cumberland breeds but the cow keepers about carlisle seem to prefer the short horned or dutch sort some of which when properly fed afford a very great quantity of milk there are instances of some giving forty quarts per day wine measure for a few weeks after calving thirty quarts is not very uncommon and twentyfour frequent she is however esteemed a good cow that affords from sixteen to twenty quarts of milk per day for great part of the summer these cows are fed with the most luxuriant grass in summer hay in winter and generally grains or potatoes every day in the year the expense of feeding is heavy but the most experienced cow keepers have found that the great secret of profiting by cows is to select the best milkers either of the dutch lancashire or galloway breeds and to feed them with sufficient quantities of the best food that however it must be acknowledged is a practice not much followed in most other parts of this county  rivers and fish the eden caldew and petterel water these parishes these rivers abound with trout eel and other sorts of small fish common in the country in the eden large quantities of salmon are caught the waters of caldew and petterel and particularly the former are remarkable for the quality of bleaching white it is rather an unpleasant reflection that these rapid streams so peculiarly adapted to the purpose of turning machinery for miles above carlisle more particularly the caldew and by a proper application of which that city might be rendered almost the birmingham of the north should only be employed in giving motion to three or four solitary corn mills and a few cotton works  the kinggarth fishery a little below cargo is the kinggarth fishery which the corporation of carlisle held under the charter of edward iii and having given rise to a subject of some notoriety in this part of the county a few years ago it may not be amiss here to give a short account of it  an eye draught of the stell fisheries at kinggarth    a the main river of eden formerly a small stream called the gut or goat  b where the stells crossed the river  c the ancient main course of the river where the stells were formerly placed now dried up called kinggarth  d kinggarth fishhouse  e carbed  f cargoholm  this fishery of the corporation being a several fishery extended only across the stream between cargoholm and carbed and so has been lost by the river altering its course many years ago the fishery in that part of the river where the stell was lately placed belonged to lord lonsdale and was till lately under lease to the corporation the device for catching fish called a stell used by the lessees of the corporation was a net across the water tied to stakes drove in for that purpose which caught or stopped most of the salmon it being only in high floods that any could get past it by those means the other fisheries higher up the river were become of trifling value  for remedy whereof an action was commenced in the year      by the owners of those other fisheries against the lessees of the corporation upon the statute  d hen vi chap   th which statute expressly prohibits the standing of nets fastened to posts continually day and night overthwart the river thames and other rivers of the realm under the penalty of  00 shillings for every offense  this action came to a hearing at the assizes at carlisle the same year before judge buller when a verdict was given for the plaintiff and which on a new trial the year following was confirmed since which that fishery has been occupied by lord lonsdales agents in the usual way of nets drawn by hands  it may be observed that this matter was about being brought to a legal decision about fifty years ago when the double passage in the river occasioned the difficulty of obtaining redress in regard the nets not being entirely overthwart the same within the description and meaning of the act  the corporation are also entitled to a free fishery generally called a boat fishery in this river which was granted by the charter of edward iv  there are from this part of the river up to carlisle about seventeen other boat fishings belonging to at least as many different proprietors the annual value of which are various between  l and  0l each and upwards  roads are tolerably good two old fashioned narrow stone bridges over two branches of the eden connect carlisle with stanwix caldewgate is also connected with carlisle by two stone bridges over as many branches of the caldew two roads the one from the south and the other from the east cross the petterel and at each place there is a stone bridge the road from london to edinburgh and that from whitehaven to newcastle intersect these parishes in different directions  fuel is chiefly coal from tindalefell   since the last page was printed off we were credibly informed the number of sheep kept in these two parishes is about   00 game are hares and partridges  quarries and buildings in these parishes are excellent freestone quarries in different places those of most note are on the petterel near newbiggin and those near durdare and burnthwaite  no limestone near quarrygate is a vein or quarry of alabaster or gypsum buildings are generally pretty good and covered with blue or red state a few houses are yet thatched and some are even built with clay walls  tithes a considerable part of these parishes pay tithes in kind and a portion pay a modus in lieu thereof  school at blackhall a donation amounting annually to  l  s was left by the late thomas lowry esquire of blackhall for the education of seven poor children  woods and plantations the banks of caldew are clothed with wood principally oak some small plots of woodland appear in other parts and a few trees grow on hedgerows several hundred acres of the most barren parts of the common when they were enclosed were planted with forest trees and chiefly scotch fir they have succeeded beyond the expectation of every one and now not only beautify the country and shelter the farms in the neighborhood but will ultimately prove very profitable to the proprietors rearing of wood is the most profitable way of applying most barren soils  aspect and general appearance though this district contains many irregular but gentle swells it is as level and perhaps more so than most parts of the county the general inclination is toward the north but small  the extensive vales formed by the eden the caldew and petterel are level fertile and beautiful they

gardens etc of william richardson esquire at rickerby are seen beyond the verdant fields through which the eden winds its way and forms an excellent object  mr losh of woodside is making every thing smile round him his house his garden his farms are almost daily under his improving hands land too barren for tillage he plants with wood between woodside and durdare is a tract of very poor ground divided but not enclosed nor cultivated mr losh has lately purchased a small part thereof for  l  0s per acre enclosed and planted it with forest trees the other proprietors it appears have not yet discovered how much it would be to their advantage either to dispose of their shares to mr losh or follow his example in turning them to profit  county gaol at carlisle is old much out of repair and without the regular means of supplying the different rooms with fresh air so necessary in these wretched receptacles of guilt and misfortune the celebrated mr howard describes it as follows   the court spacious    yards by    it was common to all prisoners but now a part is appropriated to the felons and separated by iron palisades in the court is a chapel built as appears by the date in      five rooms for master side debtors and as many on the common side most of the latter are large but have windows to the street where there are so many rooms not to separate the men and women is certainly inexcusable  the wards for felons are two rooms down a step or two dark and dirty one of them the day room had a window to the street through which spirituous liquors and tools for mischief might be easily conveyed but it is now bricked up the night room is only    feet by   at my last visit men and women were lodged together in it the men and women felons are now confined in separate apartments two rooms over the felons wards which have been used as tap rooms seem to be intended for the women only they are now appropriated to that purpose but in one of these i also found three men and four women lodged together no infirmary transports had not the allowance of two shillings and sixpence a week clauses against spirituous liquors and act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up gaol delivery once a year few gaols have so many convenient rooms for common side debtors it is the more remarkable here because there is no table signed by the magistrates to particularize the free wards some gaolers avail themselves of such a circumstance and demand rent for rooms which were undoubtedly designed for common side prisoners  the furniture is provided by the prisoners and is generally wretched in the extreme mr mullinder the present jailer seems however to keep the different apartments as clean and comfortable as circumstances will admit the rooms and passages are whitewashed once a year and the felons rooms wholly composed of stone cleaned of all noxious matter by burning a large quantity of straw upon the floor so that disorders rarely prevail there we would
