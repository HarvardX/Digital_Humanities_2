scene london  the west indian act i scene i a merchants compting house in an inner room set off by glass doors are discovered several clerks employed at their desks a writing table in the front room stockwell is discovered reading a letter stukely comes gently out of the back room and observes him some time before he speaks stukely he seems disordered some thing in that letter and i am afraid of an unpleasant sort he has many ventures of great account at sea a ship richly freighted for barcelona another for lisbon and others expected from cadiz of still greater value besides these i know he has many deep concerns in foreign bottoms and underwritings to a vast amount i will accost him sir mr stockwell   stockwell stukely  well have you shipped the cloths   stukely i have sir here is the bill of lading and copy of the invoice the assortments are all compared mr traffic will give you the policy upon change   stockwell it is very well lay these papers by and no more of business for a while shut the door stukely i have had long proof of your friendship and fidelity to me a matter of most intimate concern lies on my mind and twill be a sensible relief to unbosom myself to you i have just now been informed of the arrival of the young west indian i have so long been expecting you know who i mean   stukely yes sir mr belcour the young gentleman who inherited old belcours great estates in jamaica   stockwell hush not so loud come a little nearer this way this belcour is now in london part of his baggage is already arrived and i expect him every minute is it to be wondered at if his coming throws me into some agitation when i tell you stukely he is my son   stukely your son   stockwell yes sir my only son early in life i accompanied his grandfather to jamaica as his clerk he had an only daughter somewhat older than myself the mother of this gentleman it was my chance call it good or ill to engage her affections and as the inferiority of my condition made it hopeless to expect her fathers consent her fondness provided an expedient and we were privately married the issue of that concealed engagement is as i have told you this belcour   stukely that event surely discovered your connection   stockwell you shall hear not many days after our marriage old belcour set out for england and during his abode here my wife was with great secresy delivered of this son fruitful in expedients to disguise her situation without parting from her infant she contrived to have it laid and received at her door as a foundling after some time her father returned having left me here in one of those favorable moments that decide the fortunes of prosperous men this child was introduced from that instant he treated him as his own gave him his name and brought him up in his family   stukely and did you never reveal this secret either to old belcour or your son   stockwell never   stuckely therein you surprise me a merchant of your eminence and a member of the british parliament might surely aspire without offense to the daughter of a planter in this case too natural affection would prompt to a discovery   stockwell your remark is obvious nor could i have persisted in this painful silence but in obedience to the dying injunctions of a beloved wife the letter you found me reading conveyed those injunctions to me it was dictated in her last illness and almost in the article of death you will spare me the recital of it she there conjures me in terms as solemn as they are affecting never to reveal the secret of our marriage or withdraw my son while her father survived   stukely but on what motives did your unhappy lady found these injunctions   stockwell principally i believe from apprehension on my account lest old belcour on whom at her decease i wholly depended should withdraw his protection in part from consideration of his repose as well knowing the discovery would deeply affect his spirit which was haughty vehement and unforgiving and lastly in regard to the interest of her infant whom he had warmly adopted and for whom in case of a discovery every thing was to be dreaded from his resentment and indeed though the alteration in my condition might have justified me in discovering myself yet i always thought my son safer in trusting to the caprice than to the justice of his grandfather my judgment has not suffered by the event old belcour is dead and has bequeathed his whole estate to him we are speaking of   stuckely now then you are no longer bound to secrecy   stockwell true but before i publicly reveal myself i could wish to make some experiment of my sons disposition this can be only done by letting his spirit take its course without restraint by these means i think i shall discover much more of his real character under the title of his merchant than i should under that of his father   scene ii a sailor enters ushering in several black servants carrying portmanteaus trunks etc sailor save your honor is your name stockwell pray   stockwell it is   sailor part of my master belcours baggage ant please you there is another cargo not far a stern of us and the cockswain has got charge of the dumb creatures

stockwell if the principal tallies with his purveyors he must be a singular spectacle in this place he has a friend however in this seafaring fellow it is no bad prognostic of a mans heart when his shipmates give him a good word   exit scene iii scene changes to a drawing room a servant discovered setting the chairs by etc a woman servant enters to him housekeeper why what a fuss does our good master put himself in about this west indian see what a bill of fare i have been forced to draw out seven and nine i will assure you and only a family dinner as he calls it why if my lord mayor was expected there couldnt be a greater todo about him   servant i wish to my heart you had but seen the loads of trunks boxes and portmanteaus he has sent hither an ambassadors baggage with all the smuggled goods of his family does not exceed it   housekeeper a fine pickle he will put the house into had he been masters own son and a christian englishman there could not be more rout than there is about this creolian as they call em   servant no matter for that he is very rich and that is sufficient they say he has rum and sugar enough belonging to him to make all the water in the thames into punch but i see my master coming   exeunt scene iv stockwell enters followed by a servant stockwell where is mr belcour who brought this note from him   servant a waiter from the london tavern sir he says the young gentleman is just dressed and will be with you directly   stockwell show him in when he arrives   servant i shall sir i will have a peep at him first however i have a great mind to see this outlandish spark the sailor fellow says he will make rare doings amongst us  aside stockwell you need not wait leave me exit servant let me see reads  sir i write to you under the hands of the hairdresser as soon as i have made myself decent and slipped on some fresh clothes i will have the honor of paying you my devoirs  yours belcour   he writes at his ease for he is unconscious to whom his letter is addressed but what a palpitation does it throw my heart into a fathers heart it is an affecting interview when my eyes meet a son whom yet they never saw where shall i find constancy to support it should he resemble his mother i am overthrown all the letters i have had from him for i industriously drew him into a correspondence with me bespeak him of quick and ready understanding all the reports i ever recieved give me favorable impressions of his character wild perhaps as the manner of his country is but i trust not frantic or unprincipled   scene v servant enters servant sir the foreign gentleman is come   another servant servant mr belcour   belcour enters stockwell mr belcour i am rejoiced to see you youre welcome to england   belcour i thank you heartily good mr stockwell you and i have long conversed at a distance now we are met and the pleasure this meeting gives me amply compensates for the perils i have run through in accomplishing it   stockwell what perils mr belcour i could not have thought you would have met a bad passage at this time oyear   belcour nor did we courier like we came posting to your shores upon the pinions of the swiftest gales that ever blew it is upon english ground all my difficulties have arisen it is the passage from the riverside i complain of   stockwell ay indeed what obstructions can you have met between this and the riverside   belcour innumerable your towns as full of defiles as the island of corsica and i believe they are as obstinately defended so much hurry bustle and confusion on your quays so many sugarcasks porterbutts and common councilmen in your streets that unless a man marched with artillery in his front it is more than the labout of a hercules can effect to make any tolerable way through your town   stockwell i am sorry you have been so incommoded   belcour why faith twas all my own fault accustomed to a land of slaves and out of patience with the whole tribe of customhouse extortioners boatmen tidewaiters and waterbailiffs that beset me on all sides worse than a swarm of musquetoes i proceeded a little too roughly to brush them away with my rattan the sturdy rogues took this in dudgeon and beginning to rebel the mob chose different sides and a furious scuffle ensued in the course of which my person and apparel suffered so much that i was obliged to step into the first tavern to refit before i could make my approaches in any decent trim   stockwell all without is as i wish dear nature add the rest and i am happy aside well mr belcour it is a rough sample you have had of my countrymens spirit but i trust you will not think the worse of them for it   belcour not at all not at all i like em the better was i only a visitor i might perhaps wish them a little more tractable but as a fellow subject and a sharer in their freedom i applaud their spirit though i feel the effects of it in every bone in my skin   stockwell that is well i like that well how gladly i could fall upon his neck and own myself his father  aside belcour well mr stockwell for the first time in my life here am i in england at the fountain head of pleasure in the land of beauty of arts and elegancies my happy stars have given me a good estate and the conspiring winds have blown me hither to spend it   stockwell to use it not to waste it i should hope to treat it mr belcour not as a vassal over whom you have a wanton and despotic power but as a subject which you are bound to govern with a temperate and restrained authority   belcour true sir most truly said mine is a commission not a right i am the offspring of distress and every child of sorrow is my brother while i have hands to hold therefore i will hold them open to mankind but sir my passions are my masters they take me where they will and oftentimes they leave to reason and to virtue nothing but my wishes and my sighs   stockwell come come the man who can accuse corrects himself   belcour ah that is an office i am weary of i wish a friend would take it up i would to heaven you had leisure for the employ but did you drive a trade to the four corners of the world you would not find the talk so toilsome as to keep me free from faults   stockwell well i am not discouraged this candor tells me i should not have the fault of selfconceit to combat that at least is not amongst the number   belcour no if i knew that man on earth who thought more humbly of me than i do of myself i would take up his opinion and forego my own   stockwell and was i to choose a pupil it should be one of your complexion so if you will come along with me well agree upon your admission and enter on a course of lectures directly   belcour with all my heart   exeunt scene vi scene changes to a room in lady rusports house lady rusport and charlotte lady rusport miss rusport i desire to hear no more of captain dudley and his destitute family not a shilling of mine shall ever cross the hands of any of them because my sister chose to marry a beggar am i bound to support him and his posterity   charlotte i think you are   lady rusport you think i am and pray where do you find the law that tells you so   charlotte i am not proficient enough to quote chapter and verse but i take charity to be a main clause in the great statute of christianity   lady rusport i say charity indeed and pray miss are you sure that it is charity pure charity which moves you to plead for captain dudley amongst all your pity do you find no spice of a certain antispiritual passion called love dont mistake yourself you are no saint child believe me and i am apt to think the distresses of old dudley and of his daughter into the bargain would never break your heart if there was not a certain young fellow of two and twenty in the case who by the happy recommendation of a good person and the brilliant appointments of an ensigncy will if i am not mistaken cozen you out of a fortune of twice twenty thousand pounds as soon as ever you are of age to bestow it upon him   charlotte a nephew of your ladyships can never want any other recommendation with me and if my partiality for charles dudley is acquitted by the rest of the world i hope lady rusport will not condemn me for it   lady rusport i condemn you i thank heaven miss rusport i am no ways responsible for your conduct nor is it any concern of mine how you dispose of yourself you are not my daughter and when i married your father poor sir stephen rusport i found you a forward spoiled miss of fourteen far above being instructed by me   charlotte perhaps your ladyship calls this instruction   lady rusport youre strangely pert but it is no wonder your mother i am told was a fine lady and according to the modern style of education you was brought up it was not so in my young days there was then some decorum in the world some subordination as the great lock expresses it oh twas an edifying sight to see the regular deportment observed in our family no gigling no gossiping was going on there my good father sir oliver roundhead never was seen to laugh himself nor ever allowed it in his children   charlotte ay those were happy times indeed   lady rusport but in this forward age we have coquets in the eggshell and philosophers in the cradle girls of fifteen that lead the fashion in new caps and new opinions that have their sentiments and their sensations and the idle fops encourage em in it of my conscience i wonder what it is the men can see in such babies   charlotte true madam but all men do not overlook the maturer beauties of your ladyships age witness your admirer major dennis oflaherty there is an example of some discernment i declare to you when your ladyship is by the major takes no more notice of me than if i was part of the furniture of your chamber   lady rusport the major child has traveled through various kingdoms and climates and has more enlarged notions of female merit than falls to the lot of an english homebred lover in most other countries no woman on your side forty would ever be named in a polite circle   charlotte right madam i have been told that in vienna they have coquets upon crutches and venuses in their grand climateric a lover there celebrates the wrinkles not the dimples in his mistresss face the major i think has served in the imperial army   lady rusport are you piqud my young madam had my sister louisa now yielded to the addresses of one of major oflahertys person and appearance she would have had some excuse but to run away as she did at the age of sixteen too with a man of old dudleys sort    charlotte was in my opinion the most venial trespass that ever girl of sixteen committed of a noble family an engaging person strict honor and sound understanding what accomplishment was there wanting in captain dudley but that which the prodigality of his ancestors had deprived him of   lady rusport they left him as much as he deserves hasnt the old man captains halfpay and is not the son an ensign   charlotte an ensign alas por charles would to heaven he knew what my heart feels and suffers for his sake   servant enters servant ensign dudley to wait upon your ladyship   lady rusport who dudley what can have brought him to town   charlotte dear madam it is charles dudley it is your nephew   lady rusport nephew i renounce him as my nephew sir oliver renounced him as his grandson was not he son of the eldest daughter and only male descendant of sir oliver and didnt he cut him off with a shilling didnt the poor dear good man leave his whole frtune to me except a small annuity to my maiden sister who spoiled her constitution with nursing him and depend upon it not a penny of that fortune shall ever be disposed of otherwise than according to the will of the donor charles dudley enters so young man whence come you what brings you to town   charles if there is any offense in my coming to town your ladyship is in some degree responsible for it for part of my errand was to pay my duty here   lady rusport i hope you have some better excuse than all this   charles it is true madam i have other motives but if i consider my trouble repaid by the pleasure i now enjoy i should hope my aunt would not think my company the less welcome for the value i set upon here is   lady rusport coxcomb and where is your father child and your sister are they in town too   charles they are   lady rusport ridiculous i dont know what people do in london who have no money to spend in it   charlotte dear madam speak more kindly to your nephew how can you oppress a youth of his sensibility   lady rusport miss rusport i insist upon your retiring to your apartment when i want your advice i will send to you exit charlotte so you have put on a red coat too as well as your father it is plain what value you set upon the good advice sir oliver used to give you how often has he cautioned you against the army   charles had it pleased my grandfather to enable me to have obeyed his caution i would have done it but you well know how destitute i am and it is not to be wondered at if i prefer the service of my king to that of any other master   lady rusport well well take your own course it is no concern of mine you never consulted me   charles i frequently wrote to your ladyship but could obtain no answer and since my grandfathers death this is the first opportunity i have had of waiting upon you   lady rusport i must desire you not to mention the death of that dear good man in my hearing my spirits cannot support it   charles i shall obey you permit me to say that as that event has richly supplied you with the materials of bounty the distresses of my family can furnish you with objects of it   lady rusport the distresses of your family child are quite out of the question at present had sir oliver been pleased to consider them i should have been well content but he has absolutely taken no notice of you in his will and that to me must and shall be a law tell your father and your sister i totally disapprove of their coming up to town   charles must i tell my father that before your ladyship knows the motive that brought him hither allured by the offer of exchanging for a commission on full pay the veteran after thirty years service prepares to encounter the fatal heats of senegambia but wants a small supply to equip him for the expedition   servant enters servant major oflaherty to wait upon your ladyship   major enters major spare your speeches young man dont you think her ladyship can take my word for that i hope madam it is evidence enough of my being present when i have the honor of telling you so myself   lady rusport major oflaherty i am rejoiced to see you nephew dudley you perceive i am engaged   charles i shall not intrude upon your ladyships more agreeable engagements i presume i have my answer   lady rusport your answer child what answer can you possibly expect or how can your romantic father suppose that i am to abet him in all his idle and extravagant undertakings come major let me show you the way into my dressing room and let us leave this young adventurer to his meditations   exit oflaherty i follow you my lady young gentleman your obedient upon my conscience as fine a young fellow as i would wish to clap my eyes on he might have answered my salute however  well let it pass fortune perhaps frowns upon the poor lad she is a damned slippery lady and very apt to jilt us poor fellows that wear cockades in our hats faretheewell honey whoever thou art   exit charles so much for the virtues of a puritan out upon it her heart is flint yet that woman that aunt of mine without one worthy particle in her composition would i dare be sworn as soon set her foot in a pesthouse as in a playhouse  going miss rusport enters to him charlotte stop stay a little charles whither are you going in such haste   charles madam miss rusport what are your commands   charlotte why so reserved we had used to answer to no other names than those of charles and charlotte   charles what ails you you have been weeping   charlotte no no or if i have  your eyes are full too but i have a thousand things to say to you before you go tell me i conjure you where you are to be found here give me your direction write it upon the back of this visiting ticket  have you a pencil   charles i have but why should you desire to find us out it is a pool little inconvenient place my sister has no apartment fit to receive you in   servant enters servant madam my lady desires your company directly   charlotte i am coming  well have you wrote it give it me o charles either you do not or you will not understand me   exeunt severally end of the first act act ii scene i a room in fulmers house fulmer and mrs fulmer mrs fulmer why how you sit musing and mopeing sighing and desponding i am ashamed of you mr fulmer is this the country you described to me a second eldorado rivers of gold and rocks of diamonds you found me in a pretty snug retired way of life at bologne out of the noise and bustle of the world and wholly at my ease you indeed was upon the wing with a fiery persecution at your back but like a true son of loyola you had then a thousand ingenious devices to repair your fortune and this your native country was to be the scene of your performances fool that i was to be inveigled into it by you but thank heaven our partnership is revocable i am not your wedded wife praised be my stars for what have we got whom have we gulled but ourselves which of all your trains has taken fire even this poor expedient of your booksellers shop seems abandoned for if a chance customer drops in who is there pray to help him to what he wants   fulmer patty you know it is not upon slight grounds that i despair there had used to be a livelihood to be picked up in this country both for the honest and dishonest i have tried each walk and am likely to starve at last there is not a point to which the wit and faculty of man can turn that i have not set mine to but in vain i am beat through every quarter of the compass   mrs fulmer ah common efforts all strike me a master stroke mr fulmer if you wish to make any figure in this country   fulmer but where how and what i have blustered for prerogative i have bellowed for freedom i have offered to serve my country i have engaged to betray it a masterstroke truly why i have talked treason writ treason and if a man cannot live by that he can live by nothing here i set up as a bookseller why men left off reading and if i was to turn butcher i believe of my conscience they would leave off eating   capt dudley crosses the stage mrs fulmer why there now is your lodger old captain dudley as he calls himself there is no flint without fire something might be struck out of him if you would the wit to find the way   fulmer hang him an old dry skinned curmudgeon you may as well think to get truth out of a courtier or candor out of a critic i can make nothing of him besides he is poor and therefore not for our purpose   mrs fulmer the more fool he would any man be poor that had such a prodigy in his possession   fulmer his daughter you mean she is indeed uncommonly beautiful   mrs fulmer beautiful why she need only be seen to have the first men in the kingdom at her feet egad i wish i had the leasing of her beauty what would some of our young nabobs give    fulmer hush here comes the captain good girl leave us to ourselves and let me try what i can make of him   mrs fulmer captain truly in faith i would have a regiment had i such a daughter before i was three months older   exit scene ii capt dudley enters to him fulmer captain dudley good morning to you   dudley mr fulmer i have borrowed a book from your shop it is the sixth volume of my deceased friend tristram he is a flattering writer to us poor soldiers and the divine story of le fevre which makes part of this book in my opinion of it does honor not to its author only but to human nature   fulmer he is an author i keep in the way of trade but one i never relished he is much too loose and profligate for my taste   dudley that is being too severe i hold him to be a moralist in the noblest sense he plays indeed with the fancy and sometimes perhaps too wantonly but while he thus designedly masks his main attack he comes at once upon the heart refines amends it softens it beats down each selfish barrier from about it and opens every sluice of pity and benevolence   fulmer we of the catholic persuasion are not much bound to him  well sir i shall not oppose your opinion a fevourite author is like a favorite mistress and there you know captain no man likes to have his taste arraigned   dudley upon my word sir i dont know what a man likes in that case it is an experiment i never made   fulmer sir  are you serious   dudley it is of little consequence whether you think so   fulmer what a formal old prig it is aside i apprehend you sir you speak with caution you are married   dudley i have been   fulmer and this young lady which accompanies you    dudley passes for my daughter   fulmer passes for his daughter humph  aside she is exceedingly beautiful finely accomplished of a most enchanting shape and air    dudley you are much too partial she has the greatest defect a woman can have   fulmer how so pray   dudley she has no fortune   fulmer rather say that you have none and that is a sore defect in one of your years captain dudley you have served no doubt   dudley familiar coxcomb but i will humor him  aside fulmer a close old fox but i will unkennel him  aside dudley above thirty years i have been in the service mr fulmer   fulmer i guessed as much i laid it at no less why it is a wearisome time it is an apprenticeship to a profession fit only for a patriarch but preferment must be closely followed you never could have been so far behindhand in the chase unless you had palpably mistaken your way you will pardon me but i begin to perceive you have lived in the world not with it   dudley it may be so and you perhaps can give me better council i am now soliciting a favor an exchange to a company on full pay nothing more and yet i meet a thousand bars to that though without boasting i should think the certificate of services which i sent in might have purchased that indulgence to me   fulmer who thinks or cares about em certificate of services indeed send in a certificate of your fair daughter carry her in your hand with you   dudley what who my daughter carry my daughter well and what then   fulmer why then your fortunes made that is all   dudley i understand you and this you call knowledge of the world despicable knowledge but sirrah i will have you know   threatening him fulmer help who is within would you strike me sir would you lift up your hand against a man in his own house   dudley in a church if he dare insult the poverty of a man of honor   fulmer have a care what you do remember there is such a thing in law as an assault and battery ay and such trifling forms as warrants and indictments   dudley go sir you are too mean for my resentment it is that and not the law protects you hence   fulmer an old absurd incorrigible blockhead i will be revenged of him aside   exit scene iii young dudley enters to him charles what is the matter sir sure i heard an outcry as i entered the house   dudley not unlikely our landlord and his wife are for ever wrangling  did you find your aunt dudley at home   charles i did   dudley and what was your reception   charles cold as our poverty and her pride could make it   dudley you told her the pressing occasion i had for a small supply to equip me for this exchange has she granted me the relief i asked   charles alas sir she has peremptorily refused it   dudley that is hard that is hard indeed my petition was for a small sum she has refused it you say well be it so i must not complain did you see the broker about the insurance on my life   charles there again i am the messenger of ill news i can raise no money so fatal is the climate alas that ever my father should be sent to perish in such a place   scene iv miss dudley enters hastily dudley louisa what is the matter you seem frighted   louisa i am indeed coming from miss rusports i met a young gentleman in the streets who has beset me in the strangest manner   charles insufferable was he rude to you   louisa i cannot say he was absolutely rude to me but he was very importunate to speak to me and once or twice attempted to lift up my hat he followed me to the corner of the street and there i gave him the slip   dudley you must walk no more in the streets child without me or your brother   louisa o charles miss rusport desires to see you directly lady rusport is gone out and she has something particular to say to you   charles have you any commands for me sir   dudley none my dear by all means wait upon miss rusport come louisa i shall desire you to go up to your chamber and compose yourself   exeunt scene v belcour enters after peeping in at the door belcour not a soul as i am alive why what an odd sort of a house this is confound the little jilt she has fairly given the slip a pague upon this london i shall have no luck in it such a crowd and such a hurry and such a number of shops and one so like the other that whether the wench turned into this house or the next or whether she went up stairs or down stairs for there is a world above and a world below it seems i declare i know no more than if i was in the blue mountains in the name of all the devils at once why did she run away if every handsome girl i meet in this town is to lead me such a wild goose chase i had better have staid in the torrid zone i shall be wasted to the size of a sugar cane what shall i do give the chase up hang it that is cowardly shall i a trueborn son of phoebus suffer this little nimblefooted daphne to escape me  forbid it honor and forbid it love hush hush here she comes oh the devil what tawdry thing have we got here   mrs fulmer enters to him mrs fulmer your humble servant sir   belcour your humble servant madam   mrs fulmer a fine summers day sir   belcour yes maam and so cool that if the calendar didnt call it july i should swear it was january   mrs fulmer sir   belcour madam   mrs fulmer do you wish to speak to mr fulmer sir   belcour mr fulmer madam i havnt the honor of knowing such a person   mrs fulmer no i will be sworn have you not thou art much too pretty a fellow and too much of a gentleman to be an author thyself or to have any thing to say to those that are so it is the captain i suppose you are waiting for   belcour i rather suspect it is the captains wife   mrs fulmer the captain has no wife sir   belcour no wife i am heartily sorry for it for then she is his mistress and that i take to be the more desperate case of the two pray madam was not there a lady just now turned into your house twas with her i wished to speak   mrs fulmer what sort of a lady pray   belcour one of the loveliest sort my eyes ever beheld young tall fresh fair in short a goddess   mrs fulmer nay but dear dear sir now i am sure you

spate the purse   belcour try me put me to the proof bring me to an interview with the dear girl that has thus captivated me and see whether i have spirit to be grateful   mrs fulmer but how pray am i to know the girl you have set your heart on   belcour by an undescribable grace that accompanies every look and action that falls from her there can be but one such woman in the world and nobody can mistake that one   mrs fulmer well if i should stumble upon this angel in my walks where am i to find you what is your name   belcour upon my soul i cannot tell you my name   mrs fulmer not tell me why so   belcour because i dont know what it is myself as yet i have no name   mrs fulmer no name   belcour none a friend indeed lent me his but he forbad me to use it on any unworthy occasion   mrs fulmer but where is your place of abode   belcour i have none i never slept a night in england in my life   mrs fulmer heydey   scene vi fulmer enters fulmer a fine case truly in a free country a pretty pass things are come to if a man is to be assaulted in his own house   mrs fulmer who has assaulted you my dear   fulmer who why this captain drawcansir this old dudley my lodger but i will unlodge him i will unharbour him i warrant   mrs fulmer hush hush hold your tongue man pocket the affront and be quiet i have a scheme on foot will pay you for a hundred beatings why you surprise me mr fulmer captain dudley assault you impossible   fulmer nay i cannot call it an absolute assault but he threatened me   mrs fulmer oh was that all i thought how it would turn out  a likely thing truly for a person of his obliging compassionate turn no no poor captain dudley he has sorrows and distresses enough of his own to employ his spirits without setting them against other people make it up as fast as you can watch this gentleman out follow him wherever he goes and bring me word who and what he is be sure you dont lose sight of him i have other business in hand   exit belcour pray sir what sorrows and distresses have befallen this old gentleman you speak of   fulmer poverty disappointment and all the distresses attendant thereupon sorrow enough of all conscience i soon found how it was with him by his way of living low enough of all reason but what i overheard this morning put it out of all doubt   belcour what did you overhear this morning   fulmer why it seems he wants to join his regiment and has been beating the town over to raise a little money for that purpose upon his pay but the climate i find where he is going is so unhealthy that nobody can be found to lend him any   belcour why then your town is a damned goodfornothing town and i wish i had never come into it   fulmer that is what i say sir the hardheartedness of some folks is unaccountable there is an old lady rusport a near relation of this gentlemans she lives hard by here opposite to stockwells the great merchant he sent to her a begging but to no purpose though she is as rich as a jew she would not furnish him with a farthing   belcour is the captain at home   fulmer he is up stairs sir   belcour will you take the trouble to desire him to step hither i want to speak to him   fulmer i will send him to you directly i dont know what to make of this young man but if i live i will find him out or know the reason why   exit belcour i have lost the girl it seems that is clear she was the first object of my pursuit but the case of this poor officer touches me and after all there may be as much true delight in rescuing a fellow creature from distress as there would be in plunging one into it  but let me see its a point that must be managed with some delicacy  apropos there is pen and ink  i have struck upon a method that will do writes ay ay this is the very thing twas devilish lucky i happened to have these bills about me there there fare you well i am glad to be rid of you you stood a chance of being worse applied i can tell you  encloses and seals the paper scene vii fulmer brings in dudley fulmer that is the gentleman sir i shall make bold however to lend an ear   dudley have you any commands for me sir   belcour your name is dudley sir    dudley it is   belcour you command a company i think captain dudley   dudley i did i am now upon halfpay   belcour you have served some time   dudley a pretty many years long enough to see some people of more merit and better interest than myself made general officers   belcour their merit i may have some doubt of their interest i can readily give credit to there is little promotion to be looked for in your profession i believe without friends captain   dudley i believe so too have you any other business with me may i ask   belcour your patience for a moment i was informed you was about to join your regiment in distant quarters abroad   dudley i have been soliciting an exchange to a company on fullpay quartered at jamessfort in senegambia but i am afraid i must drop the undertaking   belcour why so pray   dudley why so sir it is a home question for a perfect stranger to put there is something very particular in all this   belcour if it is not impertinent sir allow me to ask you what reason you have for despairing of success   dudley why really sir mine is an obvious reason for a soldier to have  want of money simply that   belcour may i beg to know the sum you have occasion for   dudley truly sir i cannot exactly tell you on a sudden nor is it i suppose of any great consequence to you to be informed but i should guess in the gross that two hundred pounds would serve   belcour and do you find a difficulty in raising that sum upon your pay it is done every day   dudley the nature of the climate makes it difficult i can get no one to insure my life   belcour oh that is a circumstance may make for you as well as against in short captain dudley it so happens that i can command the sum of two hundred pounds seek no farther i will accomodate you with it upon easy terms   dudley sir do i understand you rightly  i beg your pardon but am i to believe that you are in earnest   belcour what is your surprise is it an uncommon thing for a gentleman to speak truth or is it incredible that one fellow creature should assist another   dudley i ask your pardon  may i beg to know to whom do you propose this in the way of business   belcour entirely i have no other business on earth   dudley indeed you are not a broker i am persuaded   belcour i am not   dudley nor an army agent i think   belcour i hope you will not think the worse of me for being neither in short sir if you will peruse this paper it will explain to you who i am and upon what terms i act while you read it i will step home and fetch the money and we will conclude the bargain without loss of time in the mean while good day to you   exit hastily dudley humph there is something very odd in all this  let me see what we have got here   this paper is to tell me who he is and what are his terms in the name of wonder why has he sealed it heydey what is here two bank notes of a hundred each i cannot comprehend what this means hold here is a writing perhaps that will show me accept this trifle pursue your fortune and prosper  am i in a dream is this a reality   scene viii enter major oflaherty major save you my dear is it you now that are captain dudley i would ask  whuh what is the hurry the mans in if it is the lad that run out of the shop you would overtake you might as well stay where you are by my soul he is as nimble as a croat you are a full hours march in his rear  ay faith you may as well turn back and give over the pursuit well captain dudley if that is your name there is a letter for you read man read it and i will have a word with you after you have done   dudley more miracles on foot so so from lady rusport   oflaherty youre right it is from her ladyship   dudley well sir i have cast my eye over it it is short and peremptory are you acquainted with the contents   oflaherty not at all my dear not at all   dudley have you any message from lady rusport   oflaherty not a syllable honey only when you have digested the letter i have a little bit of a message to deliver you from myself   dudley and may i beg to know who yourself is   oflaherty dennis oflaherty at your service a poor major of grenadiers nothing better   dudley so much for your name and title sir now be so good to favor me with your message   oflaherty why then captain i must tell you i have promised lady rusport you shall do whatever it is she bids you to do in that letter there   dudley ay indeed have you undertaken so much major without knowing either what she commands or what i can perform   oflaherty that is your concern my dear not mine i must keep my word you know   dudley or else i suppose you and i must measure swords   oflaherty upon my soul you have hit it   dudley that would hardly answer to either of us you and i have probably had enough of fighting in our time before now   oflaherty faith and troth master dudley you may say that it is thirty years come the time that i have followed the trade and in a pretty many countries  let me see  in the war before last i served in the irish brigade do you see there after bringing off the french monarch i left his service with a british bullet in my body and this ribband in my buttonhole last war i followed the fortunes of the german eagle in the corpse of grenadiers there i had my bellyfull of fighting and a plentiful scarcity of every thing else after six and twenty engagements great and small i went off with this gash on my scull and a kiss of the empress queens sweet hand heaven bless it for my pains since the peace my dear i took a little turn with the confederates there in poland  but such another set of madcaps  by the lord harry i never knew what it was they were scuffling about   dudley well major i will not add another action to the list you shall keep your promise with lady rusport she requires me to leave london i shall go in a few days and you may take what credit you please from my compliance   oflaherty give me your hand my dear boy this will make her my own when that is the case we shall be brothers you know and well share her fortune between us   dudley not so major the man who marries lady rusport will have a fair title to her whole fortune without division but i hope your expectations of prevailing are founded upon good reasons   oflaherty upon the best grounds in the world first i think she will comply because she is a woman secondly i am persuaded she will not hold out long because she is a widow and thirdly i make sure of her because i have married five wives and never failed yet and for what i know they are all alive and merry at this very hour   dudley well sir go on and prosper if you can inspire lady rusport with half your charity i shall think you deserve all her fortune at present i must beg your excuse good morning to you   oflaherty a good sensible man and very much of a soldier i did not care if i was better acquainted with him but it is an awkward kind of a country for that the english i observe are close friends but distant acquaintance i suspect the old lady has not been over generous to poor dudley i shall give her a little touch about that upon my soul i know but one excuse a person can have for giving nothing and that is like myself having nothing to give   exit scene ix scene changes to lady rusports house a dressing room miss rusport and lucy charlotte well lucy you have dislodged the old lady at last but me thought you was a tedious time about it   lucy a tedious time indeed i think they who have least to spare contrive to throw the most away i thought i should never have got her out of the house   charlotte why she is as deliberate in canvassing every article of her dress as an ambassador would be in settling the preliminaries of a treaty   lucy there was a new hood and handkerchief that had come express from holbornhill on the occasion that took as much time in adjusting    charlotte as they did in making and she was as vain of them as an old maid of a young lover   lucy or a young lover of himself then madam this being a visit of great ceremony to a person of distinction at the west end of the town the old state chariot was dragged forth on the occasion with strict charges to dress out the box with the leopard skin hammercloth   charlotte yes and to hang the false tails on the miserable stumps of the old crawling cattle well well pray heaven the crazy affair dont break down again with her at least till she gets to her journeys end  but where is charles dudley run down dear girl and be ready to let him in i think he is as long in coming as she was in going   lucy why indeed madam you seem the more alert of the two i must say   exit charlotte now the deuce take the girl for putting that notion into my head i am sadly afraid dudley does hot like me so much encouragement as i have given him to declare himself i never could get a word from him on the subject this may be very honorable but upon my life it is very provoking by the way i wonder how i look today oh shockingly hideously pale like a witch this is the old ladys glass and she has left some of her wrinkles on it how frightfully have i put on my cap all awry and my hair dressed so unbecomingly altogether i am a most complete fright   scene x charles dudley comes in unobserved charles that i deny   charlotte ah   charles quarrelling with your glass cousin make it up make it up and be friends it cannot compliment you more than by reflecting you as you are   charlotte well i vow my dear charles that is delightfully said and deserves my very best curtesy your flattery like a rich jewel has a value not only from its superior luster but from its extraordinary scarceness i verily think this is the only civil speech you ever directed to my person in your life   charles and i ought to ask pardon of your good sense for having done it now   charlotte nay now you relapse again dont you know if you keep well with a woman on the great score of beaury she will never quarrel with you on the trifling article of good sense but any thing serves to fill up a dull yawning hour with an insipid cousin you have brighter moments and warmer spirits for the dear girl of your heart   charles oh sie upon you sie upon you   charlotte you blush and the reason is apparent you are a novice at hypocrisy but no practice can make a visit of ceremony pass for a visit of choice love is ever before its time friendship is apt to lag a little after it pray charles did you make any extraordinary haste hither   charles by your question i see you acquit me of the impertinence of being in love   charlotte but why impertinence why the impertinence of being in love you have one language for me charles and another for the woman of your affection   charles you are mistaken the woman of my affection shall never hear any other language from me than what i use to you   charlotte i am afraid then you will never make yourself understood by her   charles it is not fit i should there is no need of love to make me miserable it is wretchedness enough to be a beggar   charlotte a beggar do you call yourself o charles charles rich in every merit and accomplishment whom may you not aspire to and why think you so unworthily of our sex as to conclude there is not one to be found with sense to discern your virtue and generosity to reward it   charles you distress me i must beg to hear no more   charlotte well i can be silent  thus does he always serve me whenever i am about to disclose myself to him   charles why do you not banish me and my misfortunes for ever from your thoughts   charlotte ay wherefore do i not since you never allowed me a place in yours but go sir i have no right to stay you go where your heart directs you go to the happy the distinguished fair one   charles now by all that is good you do me wrong there is no such fair one for me to go to nor have i an acquaintance amongst the sex yourself excepted which answers to that description   charlotte indeed   charles in very truth there then let us drop the subject may you be happy though i never can   charlotte o charles give me your hand if i have offended you i ask you pardon you have been long acquainted with my temper and know how to bear with its infirmities   charles thus my dear charlotte let us seal our reconciliation kissing her hand bear with thy infirmities by heaven i know not any one failing in thy whole composition except that of too great a partiality for an undeserving man   charlotte and you are now taking the very course to augment that failing a thought strikes me i have a commission that you must absolutely execute for me i have immediate occasion for the sum of two hundred pounds you know my fortune is shut up till i am of age take this paltry box it contains my earrings and some other bawbles i have no use for carry it to our opposite neighbor mr stockwell i dont know where else to apply leave it as a deposit in his hands and beg him to accomodate me with the sum   charles dear charlotte what are you about to do how can you possibly want two hundred pounds   charlotte how can i possibly do without it you mean does not every lady want two hundred pounds perhaps i have lost it at play perhaps i mean to win as much to it perhaps i want it for two hundred different uses   charles pooh pooh all this is nothing dont i know you never play   charlotte you mistake i have a spirit to set not only this trifle but my whole fortune upon a stake therefore make no wry faces but do as i bid you you will find mr stockwell a very honorable gentleman   lucy enters in haste lucy dear madam as i live here comes the old lady in a hackneycoach   charlotte the old chariot has given her a second tumble away with you you know your way out without meeting her take the box and do as i desire you   charles i must not dispute your orders farewell   exeunt charles and charlotte scene xi lady rusport enters leaning on major oflahertys arm oflaherty rest yourself upon my arm never spare it it is strong enough it has stood harder service than you can put it to   lucy mercy upon me what is the matter i am frightened out of my wits has your ladyship had an accident   lady rusport o lucy the most untoward one in nature i know not how i shall repair it   oflaherty never go about to repair it my lady even build a new one twas but a crazy piece of business at best   lucy bless me is the old chariot broke down with you again   lady rusport broke child i dont know what might have been broke if by great good fortune this obliging gentleman had not been at hand to assist me   lucy dear madam let me run and fetch you a cup of the cordial drops   lady rusport do lucy alas sir ever since i lost my husband my poor nerves have been shook to pieces there hangs his beloved picture that precious relick and a pentiful jointure is all that remains to console me for the best of men   oflaherty let me see in faith a comely personage by his fur cloak i suppose he was in the russian service and by the gold chain round his neck i should guess he had been honored with the order of st catharine   lady rusport no no he meddled with no st catharines that is the habit he wore in his mayoralty sir stephen was lord mayor of london but he is gone and has left me a poor weak solitary widow behind him   oflaherty by all means then take a strong able hearty man to repair his loss if such a plain fellow as one dennis oflaherty can please you i think i may venture to say without any disparagement to the gentleman in the furgown there    lady rusport what are you going to say dont shock my ears with any comparisons i desire   oflaherty not i by my soul i dont believe there is any comparison in the case   lady rusport oh are you come give me the drops i am all in a flutter   oflaherty harke sweetheart what are those same drops have you any more left in the bottle i didnt care if i took a little sip of them myself   lucy oh sir they are called the cordial restorative elixir or the nervous golden drops they are only for ladies cases   oflaherty yes yes my dear there are gentlemen as well as ladies that stand in need of those same golden drops they would suit my case to a tittle   lady rusport well major did you give od dly my letter and will the silly man do as i bid him and be gone   oflaherty you are obeyed he is on his march   lady rusport that is well you have managed this matter to perfection i didnt think he would have been so easily prevailed upon   oflaherty at the first word no difficulty in life twas the very thing he was determined to do before i came i never met a more obliging gentleman   lady rusport well it is no matter so i am but rid of him and his distresses would you believe it major oflaherty it was but this morning he sent a begging to me for money to fit him out upon some wildgoose expedition to the coast of africa i know not where   oflaherty well you sent him what he wanted   lady rusport i sent him what he deserved a flat refusal   oflaherty you refused him   lady rusport most undoubtedly   oflaherty you sent him nothing   lady rusport not a shilling   oflaherty good morning to you  your servant   going lady rusport heyday what ails the man where are you going   oflaherty out of your house before the roof falls on my head  to poor dudley to share the little modicum that thirty years hard service has left me i wish it was more for his sake   lady rusport very well sir take your course i shall not attempt to stop you i shall survive it it will not break my heart if i never see you more   oflaherty break your heart no of my conscience will it not  you preach and you pray and you turn up your eyes and all the while youre as hardhearted as a hyena  a hyena truly by my soul there is not in the whole creation so savage an animal as a human creature without pity   exit lady rusport a hyena truly where did the fellow blunder upon that word now the deuce take him for using it and the macaronies for inventing it   end of the second act act iii scene i a room in stockwells house stockwell and belcour stockwell gratify me so far however mr belcour as to see miss rusport carry her the sum she wants and return the poor girl her box of diamonds which dudley lost in my hands you know what to say on the occasion better than  do that part of your commission i leave to your own discretion and you may season it with what galantry you think fit   belcour you could not have pitched upon a greater bungler at galantry than myself if you had rummagd every company in the city and the whole court of aldermen into the bargain prt o your errand however i will do but whether it shall be with an ill grace or a god one depends upon the capture of a mment the  the ldy the mode of our mting and a thousa sirable small circumstances that nevertheless determine us upon all the great occasions of life   stockwell i persuade myself you will find miss rusport an ingenuous worthy animated girl   belcour why i like her the better as a woman but name her not to me as a wife no if ever i marry it must be a staid sober considerate damsel with blood in her vein as cold as a turtles quick of snt  a  when dangers in the wind wary and sharpsighted  when treachery is on foot with such a compann at my elbow for ever whispering in my ear  have a cae of this man he is a cheat dont go nr that woman she is  over head theres a scaffold under  oh sir such a woman might lead me up and down in  great city without difficulty or danger  with a  miss rusports complexion  should be dupd undone    stockwell ha ha ha why you are become wondrous circumspect of a sudden pupil and if you can find such a prudent damsel as you describe you have my consent  only beware how you choose discretion is not the reigning quality amongst the fine ladies of the present time and i think in miss rusports particular i have given you no bad counsel   belcour well well if you will fetch me the jewels i believe i can undertake to carry them to her but as for the money i will have nothing to do with that dudley would be your fittest ambassador on that occasion and if i mistake not the most agreeable to the lady   stockwell why indeed from what i know of the matter it may not improbably be destined to find its way into his pockets   exit belcour then depend upon it these are not the only trinkets she means to dedicate to captain dudley as for me stockwell indeed wants me to marry but till i can get this bewitching girl this incognita out of my head i can never think of any other woman  servant enters and delivers a letter heyday where can i have picked up a correspondent already it is a most execrable manuscript  let me see  martha fulmer  who is martha fulmer pshaw i will not be at the trouble of decyphering her damned pothooks hold hold hold what have we got here  dear sir i have discovered the lady you was so much smitten with and can procure you an interview with her if you can be as generous to a pretty girl as you was to a paltry old captain how did she find that out you need not despair come to me immediately the lady is now in my house and expects you  yours martha fulmer   o thou dear lovely and enchanting paper which i was about to tear into a thousand scraps devoutly i entreat thy pardon i have slighted thy contents which are delicious slandered thy characters which are divine and all the atonement i can make is implicitly to obey thy mandates   stockwell returns stockwell mr belcour here are the jewels this letter encloses bills for the money and if you will deliver it to miss rusport you will have no farther trouble on that score   belcour ah sir the letter which i have been reading disqualifies me for delivering the letter which you have been writing i have other game on foot the loveliest girl my eyes ever feasted upon is started in view and the world cannot now divert me from pursuing her   stockwell heydey what has turned you thus on a sudden   belcour a woman one that can turn and overturn me and my tottering resolutions every way she will oh sir if this is folly in me you must rail at nature you must chide the sun that was vertical at my birth and would not wink upon my nakedness but swaddled me in the broadest hottest glare of his meridian beams   stockwell mere rhapsody mere childish rhapsody the libertines familiar plea   nature made us it is true but we are the responsible creators of our own faults and follies   belcour sir   stockwell slave of every face you meet some hussy has inveigled you some handsome profligate the town is full of them and when once fairly bankrupt in constitution as well as fortune nature no longer serves as your excuse for being vicious necessity perhaps will stand your friend and you will reform   belcour you are severe   stockwell it fis me to be so  it well becomes a father   i would say a friend  how strangely i forget myself  how difficult it is to counterfeit indifference and put a mask upon the heart  i have struck him hard he reddens   belcour how could you tempt me so had you not inadvertently dropped the name of father i fear our friendship short as it has been would scarce have held me  but even your mistake i reverence  give me your hand  it is over   stockwell generous young man   let me embrace you  how shall i hide my tears i have been to blame because i bore you the affection of a father i rashly took up the authority of one i ask your pardon  pursue your course i have no right to stop it  what would you have me do with these things   belcour this if i might advise carry the money to miss rusport immediately never let generosity wait for it is materials that part of the business presses give me the jewels i will find an opportunity of delivering them into her hands and your visit may pave the way for my reception   exit stockwell be it so good morning to you farewell advice away goes he upon the wing for pleasure what various passions he awakens in me he pains yet pleases me affrights offend yet grows upon my heart his very failings set him off  for ever trespassing for ever atoning i almost think he would not be so perfect were he free from fault i must dissemble longer and yet how painful the experiment  even now he is gone upon some wild adventure and who can tell what mischief may befall him o nature what it is to be a father just such a thoughtless headlong thing was i when i beguiled his mother into love   exit scene ii scene changes to fulmers house fulmer and his wife fulmer i tell you patty you are a fool to think of bringing him and miss dudley together twill ruin every thing and blow your whole scheme up to the moon at once   mrs fulmer why sure mr fulmer i may be allowed to rear a chicken of my own hatching as they say who first sprung the thought but i pray who contrived the plot who proposed the letter but i i   fulmer and who dogged the gentleman home who found out his name fortune connection that he was a westindian fresh landed and full of cash a gull to our hearts content a hotbrained headlong spark that would run into our trap like a wheatear under a turf   mrs fulmer hark he is come disappear march and leave the field open to my machinations   exit fulmer scene iii belcour enters to her belcour o thou dear minister to my happiness let me embrace thee why thou art my polar star my propitious constellation by which i navigate my impatient bark into the port of pleasure and delight   mrs fulmer oh you men are sly creatures do you remember now you cruel what you said to me this morning   belcour all a jest a frolic never think on it bury it for ever in oblivion thou why thou art all over nectar and ambrosia powder of pearl and odor of roles thou have the youth of hebe the beauty of venus and the pen of sappho but in the name of all that is lovely where is the lady i expected to find her with you   mrs fulmer no doubt you did and these raptures were designed for her but where have you loitered the ladys gone you are too late girls of her sort are not to be kept waiting like negro slaves in your sugar plantations   belcour gone whither is she gone tell me that i may follow her   mrs fulmer hold hold not so fast young gentleman this is a case of some delicacy should captain dudley know that i introduced you to his daughter he is a man of such scrupulous honor    belcour what do you tell me is she daughter to the old gentleman i met here this morning   mrs fulmer the same him you was so generous to   belcour there is an end of the matter then at once it shall never be said of me that i took advantage of the fathers necessities to trepan the daughter  going mrs fulmer so so i have made a wrong cast he is one of your conscientious sinners i find but i will not lose him thus  ha ha ha   belcour what is it you laugh at   mrs fulmer your absolute inexperience have you lived so very little time in this country as not to know that between young people of equal ages the term of sister often is a cover for that of mistress this young lady is in that sense of the word sister to young dudley and consequently daughter to my old lodger   belcour indeed are you serious   mrs fulmer can you doubt it i must have been pretty well assured of that before i invited you hither   belcour that is true she cannot be a woman of honor and dudley is an unconscionable young rogue to think of keeping one fine girl in pay by raising contributions on another he shall therefore give her up she is a dear bewitching mischievous little devil and he shall positively give her up   mrs fulmer ay now the freak has taken you again i say give her up there is one way indeed and certain of success   belcour what is that   mrs fulmer outbid him never dream of outblustring him buy out his lease of possession and leave her to manage his ejectment   belcour is she so venal never fear me then when beauty is the purchase i shall not think much of the price   mrs fulmer all things then will be made easy enough let me see some little genteel present to begin with what have you got about you ay search i can bestow it to advantage there is no time to be lost   belcour hang it confound it a plague upon it say i i havnt a guinea left in my pocket i parted from my whole stock here this morning and have forgot to supply myself since   mrs fulmer mighty well let it pass then there is an end think no more of the lady that is all   belcour distraction think no more of her let me only step home and provide myself i will be back with you in an instant   mrs fulmer pooh pooh that is a wretched shift have you nothing of value about you moneys a coarse slovenly vehicle fit only to bribe electors in a borough there are more graceful ways of purchasing a ladys favors rings trinkets jewels   belcour jewels gadso i protest i had forgot i have a case of jewels but they will not do i must not part from them no no they are appropriated they are none of my own   mrs fulmer let me see let me see ay now this were somethinglike pretty creatures how they sparkle these would ensure success   belcour indeed   mrs fulmer these would make her your own for ever   belcour then the deuce take em for belonging to another person i could find in my heart to give em the girl and swear i have lost them   mrs fulmer ay do say they were stolen out of your pocket   belcour no hang it that is dishonorable here give me the paltry things i will write you an order on my merchant for double their value   mrs fulmer an order no order for me no orders upon merchants with their value received and three day grace their noting protesting and endorsing and all their counting house formalities i will have nothing to do with them leave your diamonds with me and give your order for the value of them to the owner the money would be as good as the trinkets i warrant you   belcour hey how i never thought of that but a breach of trust it is impossible i never can consent therefore give

soul madam let us improve it therefore i am in love with you to distraction i was charmed at the first glance i attempted to accost you you fled i followed but was defeated of an interview at length i have obtained one and seize the opportunity of casting my person and my fortune at your feet   louisa you astonish me are you in your senses or do you make a jest of my misfortunes do you ground pretenses on your generosity or do you make a practice of this folly with every woman you meet   belcour upon my life no as you are the handsomest woman i ever met so you are the first to whom i ever made the like professions as for my generosity madam i must refer you on that score to this good lady who i believe has something to offer in my behalf   louisa dont build upon that sir i must have better proofs of your generosity than the mere divestment of a little superfluous dross before i can credit the sincerity of professions so abruptly delivered  exit hastily belcour oh ye gods and goddesses how her anger animates her beauty  going out mrs fulmer stay sir if you stir a step after her i renounce your interest for ever why you will ruin every thing   belcour well i must have her cost what it will i see she understands her own value though a little superfluous dross truly she must have better proofs of my generosity   mrs fulmer it is exactly as i told you your money she calls dross she is too proud to stain her fingers with your coin bait your ok well with jewels try that experiment and she is your own   belcour take em let em go lay em at her feet i must get out of the

by a servant charlotte desire mr stockwell to walk in   exit servant stockwell enters stocwell madam your most obedient servant i am honored with your commands by captain dudley and have brought the money with me as you directed i understand the sum you have occasion for is two hundred pounds   charlotte it is sir i am quite confounded at your taking this trouble upon yourself mr stockwell   stockwell there is a banknote madam to the amount your jewels are in safe hands and will be delivered to you directly if i had been happy in being better known to you i should have hoped you would not have thought it necessary to place a deposit in my hands for so trifling a sum as you have now required me to supply you with   charlotte the bawbles i sent you may very well be spared and as they are the only security in my present situation i can give you i could wish you would retain them in your hands when i am of age which if i live a few months i shall be i will replace your favor with thanks   stockwell it is obvious miss rusport that your charms will suffer no impeachment by the absence of these superficial ornaments but they should be seen in the suite of a woman of fashion not as creditors to whom you are indebted for your appearance but as subservient attendants which help to make up your equipage   charlotte mr stockwell is determined not to wrong the confidence i reposed in his politeness   stockwell i have only to request madam that you will allow mr belcour a young gentleman in whose happiness i particularly interest myself to have the honor of delivering you the box of jewels   charlotte most gladly any friend of yours cannot fail of being welcome here   stockwell i flatter myself you will not find him totally undeserving your good opinion an education not of the strictest kind and strong animal spirits are apt sometimes to betray him into youthful irregularities but an high principle of honor and an uncommon benevolence in the eye of candor will i hope atone for any faults by which these good qualities are not impaired   charlotte i dare say mr belcours behavior wants no apology we have no right to be over strict in canvassing the morals of a common acquaintance   stockwell i wish it may be my happiness to see mr belcour in the list not of your common but particular acquaintance of your friends miss rusport  i dare not be more explicit   charlotte nor need you mr stockwell i shall be studious to deserve his friendship and though i have long since unalterably placed my affections on another i trust i have not left myself insensible to the merits of mr belcour and hope that neither you nor he will for that reason think me less worthy your good opinion and regards   stockwell miss rusport i sincerely wish you happy i have no doubt you have placed your affection on a deserving man and i have no right to combat your choice   exit charlotte how honorable is that behavior now if charles was here i should be happy the old lady is so fond of her new irish acquaintance that i have the whole house at my disposal   exit charlotte scene vi belcour enters preceded by a servant servant i  your honors pardon i thought my young lady was ere who shall i inform her would speak to her   belcour belcour is my name sir and pray beg your lady to put herself in  hurry on my account for i would sooner see the devil than see her face exit servant in the name of all that is mischievous why did stockwell drive me hither in soon haste a pretty figure truly i shall make an ambassador without credentials blockhead that i was to charge myself with her diamonds officious meddling puppy now they are irretrievably gone that suspicious jade fulmer woudnt part even with a fight of them though i would have ransomed em at twice their value now must i trust to my poor wits to bring me off a lamentable dependence fortune be my helper here comes the girl  if she is noble minded as she is said to be she will forgive me if not it is a lost cause for i have not thought of one word in my excuse   scene vii charlotte enters charlotte mr belcour i am proud to see you your friend mr stockwell prepared me to expect this honor and i am happy in the opportunity of being known to you   belcour a fine girl by my soul now what a cursed hangdog do i look like  aside charlotte you are newly arrived in this country sir   belcour just landed madam just set ashore with a large cargo of muscovado sugars rumpuncheons mahoganyslabs wet sweetmeats and green paroquets   charlotte may i ask you how you like london sir   belcour to admiration i think the town and the townsfolk are exactly suited it is a great rich overgrown noisy tumultuous place the whole morning is a bustle to get money and the whole afternoon is a hurry to spend it   charlotte are these all the observations you have made   belcour no madam i have observed the women are very captivating and the men very soon caught   charlotte ay indeed whence do you draw that conclusion   belcour from infallible guides the first remark i collect from what i now see the second from what i now feel   charlotte oh the deuce take you but to wave this subject i believe sir this was a visit of business not compliment was it not   belcour ay now comes on my execution   charlotte you have some foolish trinkets of mine mr belcour havnt you   belcour no in truth they are gone in search of a trinket still more foolish than themselves  aside charlotte some diamonds i mean sir mr stockwell informed me you was charged with em   belcour oh yes madam but i have the most treacherous memory in life  here they are pray put them up they are all right you need not examine em  gives a box charlotte heydey right sir why these are not my diamonds these are quite different and as it should seem of much greater value   belcour upon my life i am glad on it for then i hope you value em more than your own   charlotte as a purchaser i should but not as an owner you mistake these belong to somebody else   belcour it is yours i am afraid that belong to somebody else   charlotte what is it yon mean i must insist upon your taking em back again   belcour pray madam dont do that i shall infallibly lose them i have the worst luck with diamonds of any man living   charlotte that you might well say was you to give me these in the place of mine but pray sir what is the reason of all this why have you changed the jewels and where have you disposed of mine   belcour miss rusport i cannot invent a lie for my life and if it was to save it i coudnt tell one i am an idle dissipated unthinking fellow not worth your notice in short i am a westindian and you must try me according to the charter of my colony not by a jury of english spinsters truth is i have given away your jewels caught with a pair of sparkling eyes whose luster blinded theirs i served your property as i should my own and lavished it away let me not totally despair of your forgiveness i frequently do wrong but never with impunity if your displeasure is added to my own my punishment will be too severe when i parted from the jewels i had not the honor of knowing their owner   charlotte mr belcour your sincerity charms me i enter at once into your character and i make all the allowances for it you can desire i take your jewels for the present because i know there is no other way of reconciling you to yourself but if i give way to your spirit in one point you must yield to mine in another remember i will not keep more than the value of my own jewels there is no need to be pillaged by more than one woman at a time sir   belcour now may every blessing that can crown your virtues and reward your beauty be showerd upon you may you meet admiration without envy love without jealousy and old age without malady may the man of your heart be ever constant and you never meet a less penitent or less grateful offender than myself   servant enters and delivers a letter charlotte does your letter require such haste   servant i was bade to give it into your own hands madam   charlotte from charles dudley i see  have i your permission good heaven what do i read mr belcour you are concerned in this  dear charlotte in the midst of our distress providence has cast a benefactor in our way after the most unexpected manner a young west indian rich and with a warmth of heart peculiar to his climate has rescued my father from his troubles satisfied his wants and enabled him to accomplish his exchange when i relate to you the manner in which this was done you will be charmed i can only now add that it was by chance we found out that his name is belcour and that he is a friend of mr stockwells i lose not a moments time in making you acquainted with this fortunate event for reasons which delicacy obliges me to suppress but perhaps if you have not received the money on your jewels you will not think it necessary now to do it i have the honor to be  dear madam most faithfully yours charles dudley     is this your doing sir never was generosity so worthily exerted   belcour or so greatly overpaid   charlotte after what you have now done for this noble but indigent family let me not scruple to unfold the whole situation of my heart to you know then sir and dont think the worse of me for the frankness of my declaration that such is my attachment to the son of that worthy officer whom you relieved that the moment i am of age and in possession of my fortune i should hold myself the happiest of women to share it with young dudley   belcour say you so madam then let me perish if i dont love and reverence you above all woman kind and if such is your generous resolution never wait till youre of age life is too short pleasure too fugitive the soul grows narrower every hour i will equip you for your escape i will convoy you to the man of your heart and away with you then to the first hospitable parson that will take you in   charlotte o blessed be the torrid zone for ever whose rapid vegetation quickens nature into such benignity these latitudes are made for politics and philosophy friendship has no root in this soil but had i spirit to accept your offer which is not improbable would not it be a mortifying thing for a fond girl to find herself mistaken and sent back to her home like a vagrant and such for what i know might be my case   belcour then he ought to be proscribed the society of mankind for ever   ay ay it is the sham sister makes him thus indifferent twill be a meritorious office to take that girl out of the way   servant enters scene viii servant miss dudley to wait on you madam   belcour who   servant miss dudley   charlotte what is the matter mr belcour are you frighted at the name of a pretty girl it is the sister of him we were speaking of  pray admit her   belcour the sister so so he has imposed upon her too  this is an extraordinary visit truly upon my soul the assurance of some folks is not to be accounted for   charlotte

charlotte well is not she a delightful girl   belcour very delightful   charlotte why you answer as if you was in a court of justice of my conscience i believe you are caught i have a notion she has tricked you out of your heart   belcour i believe she has and you out of your jewels for to tell you the truth she is the very person i gave em to   charlotte you gave her my jewels louisa dudley my jewels admirable inimitable oh the fly little jade but hush here she comes i dont know how i shall keep my countenance  louisa enters my dear i am rejoiced to see you how do you do i beg leave to introduce mr belcour a very worthy friend of mine i believe louisa you have seen him before   louisa i have met the gentleman   charlotte you have met the gentleman well sir and you have met the lady

is this fair   belcour upon my soul i never looked so like a fool in my life the assurance of that girl puts me quite down aside   charlotte sir  mr belcour  was it your pleasure to advance any thing not a syllable come louisa womens wit they say is never at a loss  nor you neither speechless both  why you was merry enough before this lady came in   louisa i am sorry i have been any interruption to your happiness sir   belcour madam   charlotte madam is that all you can say but come my dear girl i will not teaze you apropos i must show you what a fine present this dumb gentleman has made me

diamonds not you   louisa you know i havnt miss rusport you know those things are infinitely above my reach   charlotte ha ha ha   belcour she does tell a lie with an admirable countenance that is true enough   louisa what ails you charlotte what impertinence have i been guilty of that you should find it necessary to humble me at such a rate if you are happy long may you be so but surely it can be no addition to it to make me miserable   charlotte so serious there must be some mystery in this  mr belcour will you leave us together you see i treat you with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance already   belcour oh by all means pray command me miss rusport i am your most obedient by your condescension in accepting those poor trifles i am under eternal obligations to you  to you miss dudley i shall not offer a word on that subject you despise finery you have a soul above it i adore your spirit i was rather unprepared for meeting you here but i shall hope for an opportunity of making myself better known to you   exit scene ix charlotte and louisa charlotte louisa dudley you surprise me i never saw you act thus before cannot you bear a little innocent raillery before the man of your heart   louisa the man of my heart madam be assured i never was so visionary to aspire to any man whom miss rusport honors with her choice   charlotte my choice my dear why we are playing at cross purposes how entered it into your head that mr belcour was the man of my choice   louisa why didnt he present you with those diamonds   charlotte well perhaps he did  and pray louisa have you no diamonds   louisa i diamonds truly who should give me diamonds   charlotte who but this very gentleman apropos here comes your brother    scene x charles enters i insist upon referring our dispute to him your sister and i charles have a quarrel belcour the hero of your letter has just left us  some how or other louisas bright eyes have caught him and the poor fellows fallen desperately in love with her  dont interrupt me hussy  well that is excusable enough you will say but the jet of the story is that this hairbrained spark who does nothing like other people has given her the very identical jewels which you pledged for me to mr stockwell and will you believe that this little demure slut made up a face and squeezed out three or four hypocritical tears because i rallied her about it   charles i am all astonishment louisa tell me without reserve has mr belcour given you any diamonds   louisa none upon my honor   charles has he made any professions to you   louisa he has but altogether in a style so whimsical and capricious that the best which can be said of them is to tell you that they seemed more the result of good spirits than good manners   charlotte ay ay now the murders out he is in love with her and she has no very great dislike to him trust to my observation charles for that as to the diamonds there is some mistake about them and you must clear it up three minutes conversation with him will put every thing in a right train go go charles it is a brothers business about it instantly ten to one you will find him over the way at mr stockwells   charles i confess i am impatient to have the case cleared up i will take your advice and find him out good bye to you   charlotte your servant my life upon it you will find belcour a man of honor come louisa let us adjourn to my dressing room i have a little private business to transact with you before the old lady comes up to tea and interrupts us   end of the third act act iv scene i fulmers house fulmer and mrs fulmer fulmer patty was not mr belcour with you   mrs fulmer he was and is now shut up in my chamber in high expectation of an interview with miss dudley she is at present with her brother and twas with some difficulty i persuaded my hotheaded spark to wait till he has left her   fulmer well child and what then   mrs fulmer why then mr fulmer i think it will be time for you and me to steal a march and be gone   fulmer so this is all the fruit of your ingenious project a shameful overthrow or a sudden flight   mrs fulmer why my project was a mere impromptu and can at worst but quicken our departure a few days you know we had fairly outlived our credit here and a trip to boulogne is no ways unseasonable nay never droop man  hark hark here is enough to bear charges  showing a purse fulmer let me see let me see this weighs well this is of the right sort why your westindian bled freely   mrs fulmer but that is not all look here here are the sparklers showing the jewels now what do you think of my performances heh a foolish scheme is not it  a silly woman    fulmer thou art a judith a joan of arc and i will march under thy banners girl to the worlds end come let us begone i have little to regret my creditors may share the old books amongst them they will have occasion for philosophy to support their loss they will find enough upon my shelves the world is my library i read mankind  now patty lead the way   mrs fulmer adieu belcour   exeunt scene ii charles dudley and louisa charles well louisa i confess the force of what you say i accept miss rusports bounty and when you see my generous charlotte tell her  but have a care there is a selfishness even in gratitude when it is too profuse to be over thankful for any one favor is in effect to lay out for another the best return i could make my benefactress would be never to see her more   louisa i understand you   charles we that are poor louisa should be cautious for this reason i would guard you against belcour at least till i can unravel the mystery of miss rusports diamonds i was disappointed of finding him at mr stockwells and am now going in search of him again he may intend honorably but i confess to you i am staggered think no more of him therefore for the present of this be sure while i have life and you have honor i will protect you or perish in your defense   exit louisa think of him no more well i will obey but if a wandering uninvited thought should creep by chance into my bosom must i not give the harmless wretch a shelter oh yes the great artificer of the human heart knows every thread he wove into its fabric nor puts his work to harder uses than it was made to bear my wishes then my guiltless ones i mean are free how fast they spring within me at that sentence down down ye busy creatures whither would you carry me ah there is one amongst you a forward new intruder that in the likeness of an offending generous man grows into favor with my heart fie fie upon it belcour pursues insults me yet such is the fatality of my condition that what should rouse resentment only calls up love   scene iii belcour enters to her belcour alone by all that is happy   louisa ah   belcour oh shriek not start not stir not loveliest creature but let me kneel and gaze upon your beauties   louisa sir mr belcour rise what is it you do   belcour see i obey you mould me as you will behold your ready servant new to your country ignorant of your manners habits and desires i put myself into your hands for instruction make me only such as you can like yourself and i shall be happy   louisa i must not hear this mr belcour go should he that parted from me but this minute now return i tremble for the consequence   belcour fear nothing let him come i love you madam he will find it hard to make me unsay that   louisa you terrify me your impetuous temper frightens me you know my situation it is not generous to pursue me thus   belcour true i do know your situation your real one miss dudley and am resolved to snatch you from it twill be a meritorious act the old captain shall rejoice miss rusport shall be made happy and even he even your beloved brother with whose resentment you threaten me shall in the end applaud and thank me come you are a dear enchanting girl and i am determined not to live a minute longer without thee   louisa hold are you mad i see you are a bold assuming man and know not where to stop   belcour who that beholds such beauty can by heaven you put my blood into a flame provoking girl is it within the stretch of my fortune to content you what is it you can further ask that i am not ready to grant   louisa yes with the same facility that you bestowed upon me miss rusports diamonds for shame for shame was that a manly story   belcour so so these devilish diamonds meet me every where  let me perish if i meant you any harm oh i could tear my tongue out for saying a word about the matter   louisa go to her then and contradict it till that is done my reputation is at stake   belcour her reputation now she has got upon that she will go on for ever  what is there i will not do for your sake i will go to miss rusport   louisa do so restore her own jewels to her which i suppose you kept back for the purpose of presenting others to her of a greater value but for the future mr belcour when you would do a galant action to that lady dont let it be at my expense   belcour i see where she points she is willing enough to give up miss rusports diamonds now she finds she shall be a gainer by the exchange be it so it is what i wished  well madam i will return miss rusport her own jewels and you shall have others of tenfold their value   louisa no sir you err most widely it is my good opinion not my vanity which you must bribe   belcour why what the devil would she have now  miss dudley it is my wish to obey and please you but i have some apprehension that we mistake each other   louisa i think we do tell me then in few words what it is you aim at   belcour in few words then and in plain honesty i must tell you so entirely am i captivated with you that had you but been such as it would have become me to have called my wife i had been happy in knowing you by that name as it is you are welcome to partake my fortune give me in return your person give me pleasure give me love free disencumberd antimatrimonial love   louisa stand off and let me never see you more   belcour hold hold thou dear tormenting tantalizing girl upon my knees i swear you shall not stir till you have consented to my bliss   louisa

fears almost persuade me to abandon it   charles you alarm me   charlotte your looks and actions have been so distant and at this moment are so deterring that was it not for the hope that delicacy and not disgust inspires this conduct in you i should sink with shame and apprehension but time presses and i must speak and plainly too  was you now in possession of your grandfathers estate as justly you ought to be and was you inclined to seek a companion for life should you or should you not in that case honor at your unworthy charlotte with your choice   charles my unworthy charltte so  me heaven there is not a circumstance on  disgrace  upon a generous benactress thvishly to steal into an open unreserved  heart o charlotte dear uhppy    charlotte nay now you rate too highly the poor advantages fortune alone  otherwise cld we  dear charles i have enough  that enough still more by sharing it with me sole heiress of my fathers fortune a short time will put it in my dispsal in the

oflaherty enters hastily oflaherty run run for holy st antonys sake to horse and away the conscience is broke up and the old lady advances upon a full piedmontese trot within pistolshot of your encampment   charlotte here here down the backstairs o charles remember me   charles farewell now now i feel myself a coward   exit charlotte what does he mean   oflaherty ask no questions but be gone she has cooled the lads courage and wonders he feels like a coward there is a damned deal of mischief brewing between this hyena and her lawyer egad i will step behind this screen and listen a good soldier must sometimes fight in ambush as well as open field  retires scene ix lady rusport and varland lady rusport sure i heard somebody hark no only the servants going down the back stairs well mr varland i think then we are agreed you will take my money and your conscience no longer stands in your way   varland your father was my benefactor his will ought to be sacred but if i commit it to the flames how will he be the wiser dudley it is true has done me no harm but five thousand pounds will do me much good so in short madam i take your offer i will confer with my clerk who witnessed the will and tomorrow morning put it into your hands upon condition you put five thousand good pounds into mine   lady rusport it is a bargain i will be ready for you farewell   exit varland let me consider  five thousand pounds prompt payment for destroying this scrap of paper not worth five farthings it is a fortune easily earned yes and it is another mans fortune easily thrown away it is a good round sum to be paid down at once for a bribe but it is a damned rogues trick in me to take it   oflaherty aside so so this fellow speaks truth to himself though he lies to other people  but hush   varland it is breaking the trust of my benefactor that is a foul crime but he is dead and can never reproach me with it and it is robbing young dudley of his lawful patrimony that is a hard case but he is alive and knows nothing of the matter   oflaherty aside these lawyers are so used to bring off the rogueries of others that they are never without an excuse for their own   varland were i assured now that dudley would give me half the money for producing this will that lady rusport does for concealing it i would deal with him and be an honest man at half price i wish every gentleman of my profession could lay his hand on his heart and say the same thing   oflaherty a bargain old gentleman nay never start nor stare you was not afraid of your own conscience never be afraid of me   varland of you sir who are you pray   oflaherty i will tell you who i am you seem to wish to be honest but want the heart to set about it now i am the very man in the world to make you so for if you do not give me up that paper this very instant by the soul of me fellow i will not leave one whole bone in your skin that shall not be broken   varland what right have you pray to take this paper from me   oflaherty what right have you pray to keep it from young dudley i dont know what it contains but i am apt to think it will be safer in my hands than in yours therefore give it me without more words and save yourself a beating do now you had best   varland well sir i may as well make a grace of necessity there i have acquitted my conscience at the expense of five thousand pounds   oflaherty five thousand pounds mercy upon me when there are such temptations in the law can we wonder if some of the corpse are a disgrace to it   varland well you have got the paper if you are an honest man give it to charles dudley   oflaherty an honest man look at me friend i am a soldier this is not the livery of a knave i am an irishman honey mine is not the country of dishonor now sirrah be gone if you enter these doors or give lady rusport the least item of what has passed i will cut off both your ears and rob the pillory of its due   varland i wish i was once fairly out of his sight   exeunt scene x a room in stockwells house stockwell i must disclose myself to belcour this noble instance of his generosity which old dudley has been relating allies me to him at once concealment becomes too painful i shall be proud to own him for my son  but see he is here   belcour enters and throws himself on a sopha belcour o my cursed tropical constitution would to heaven i had been dropped upon the snows of lapland and never felt the blessed influence of the sun so i had never burnt with these inflammatory passions   stockwell so so you seem disordered mr belcour   belcour disordered sir why did i ever quit the soil in which i grew what evil planet drew me from that warm sunny region where naked nature walks without disguise into this cold contriving artificial country   stockwell come sir

twas not to be pardoned  pray never mind me sir   stockwell alas my heart bleeds for him   belcour and yet i might have heard him now plague upon that blundering irishman for coming in as he did the hurry of the deed might paliate the event deliberate execution has less to plead  mr stockwell i am bad company to you   stockwell oh sir make no excuse i think you have not found me forward to pry into the secrets of your pleasures and pursuits it is not my disposition but there are times when want of curiosity would be want of friendship   belcour ah sir mine is a case wherein you and i shall never think alike the punctilious rules by which i am bound are not to be found in your ledgers nor will pass current in the comptinghouse of a trader   stockwell it is very well sir if you think i can render you any service it may be worth your trial to confide in me if not your secret is safer in your own bosom   belcour that sentiment demands my confidence pray sit down by me you must know i have an affair of honor on my hands with young dudley and though i put up with no mans insult yet i wish to take away no mans life   stockwell i know the young man and am apprisd of your generosity to his father what can have bred a quarrel between you   belcour a foolish passion on my side and a haughty provocation on his there is a girl mr stockwell whom i have unfortunately seen of most uncommon beauty she has withal an air of so much natural modesty that had i not had good assurance of her being an attainable wanton i declare i should as soon have thought of attempting the chastity of diana   servant enters stockwell heyday do you interrupt us   servant sir there is an irish gentleman will take no denial he says he must see mr belcour directly upon business of the last consequence   belcour admit him it is the irish officer that parted us and brings me young dudleys challenge i should have made a long story of it and he will tell it you in three words   oflaherty enters oflaherty save you my dear and you sir i have a little bit of a word in private for you   belcour pray deliver your commands this gentleman is my intimate friend   oflaherty why then ensign dudley will be glad to measure swords with you yonder at the london tavern in bishopsgatestreet at nine oclock  you know the place   belcour i do and shall observe the appointment   oflaherty will you be of the party sir we shall want a fourth hand   stockwell savage as the customed i close with that proposal and though i am not  quarrel i shall  justice of it and  ence   oflaherty sir youre a gentleman of honor and i shall be glad of being better known  hae belcour i had like to he  part of my  there is the  it over faith it is  the  can pt you to death with a safe conscience and when he has done that job for you let it be a warning how you attempt the sister of    belcour the sister   oflaherty ay the sister  english  all one you  ley that  by st patrick  bcour to  from her when there are so many to be met in this town who have disposed of thir to you hand   stockwell why i am thunderstruck what is it you have done and what is the shocking business in which i have engaged if i understood him  young dudley you have been attempting yu  to me of a professed wanton the girl he speaks of has beauty enough indeed to inflame your desires but she has honor innocence and simplicity to awe the most licentious passion if you have  that mr belcour i renounce you i abandon you i forswear all fellowship or friendship with you for ever   belcour have patience for a moment we do indeed speak of the same person but she is not innocent she is not young dudleys sister   stockwell astonishing who told you this   belcour the woman where she lodges the person who put me on the pursuit and contrived our meetings   stockwell what woman what person   belcour fulmer her name is i warrant you i did not proceed without good grounds   stockwell fulmer fulmer who waits a servant enters send mr stukely hither directly i begin to see my way into this dark transaction mr belcour mr belcour your are no match for the cunning and contrivances of this intriguing town stukely enters prithee stukely what is the name of the woman and her husband who were stopped upon suspicion of selling stolen diamonds at our nextdoor neighbors the jeweller   stukely fulmer   stockwell so   belcour can you procure me a sight of those diamonds   stukely they are now in my hand i was desired to show them to mr stockwell   stockwell give em to me what do i see as i live the very diamonds miss rusport sent hither and which i entrusted to you to return   belcour yes but i betrayed that trust and gave em mrs fulmer to present to miss dudley   stockwell with a view no doubt to bribe her to compliance   belcour i own it   stockwell for shame for shame and twas this womans intelligence you relied upon for miss dudleys character   belcour i thought she knew her by heaven i would have died sooner than have insulted a woman of virtue or a man of honor   stockwell i think you would but mark the danger of licentious courses you are betrayed robbed abused and but for this providential discovery in a fair way of being sent out of the world with all your follies on your head  dear stukely go to my neighbor tell him i have an owner for the jewels and beg him to carry the people under custody to the london tavern and wait for me there exit stukely  i fear the law does not provide a punishment to reach the villiany of these people but how in the name of wonder could you take any thing on the word of such an informer   belcour because i had not lived long enough in your country to know how few informers words are to be taken persuaded however as i was of miss dudleys guilt i must own to you i was staggered with the appearance of such innocence especially when i saw her admitted into miss rusports company   stockwell good heaven did you meet her at miss rusports and could you doubt her being a woman of reputation   belcour by you perhaps such a mistake could not have been made but in a perfect stranger i hope it is venial i did not know what artifices young dudley might have used to conceal her character i did not know what disgrace attended the detection of it   stockwell i see it was a trap laid for you which you have narrowly escaped you addressed a woman of honor with all the loose incense of a profane admirer and you have drawn upon you the resentment of a man of honor who thinks himself bound to protect her well sir you must atone for this mistake   belcour to the lady the most penitent submission i can make is justly due but in the execution of an act of justice it never shall be said my soul was swayed by the least particle of fear i have received a challenge from her brother now though i would give my fortune almost my life itself to purchase her happiness yet i cannot abate her one scruple of my honor i have been branded with the name of villain   stockwell ay sir you mistook her character and he mistook yours error begets error   belcour villain mr stockwell is a harsh word   stockwell it is a harsh word and should be unsaid   belcour come come it shall be unsaid   stockwell or else what follows why the sword is drawn and to heal the wrongs you have done to the reputation of the sister you make an honorable amends by murdering the brother   belcour murdering   stockwell it is thus religion writes and speaks the word in the vocabulary of modern honor there is no such term  but come i dont despair of satisfying the one without alarming the other that done i have a discovery to unfold that you will then i hope be fitted to receive   end of the fourth act act v scene i the london tavern oflaherty stockwell charles and belcour oflaherty gentlemen well met you understand each others minds and as i see you have brought nothing but your swords you may set to without any further ceremony   stockwell you will not find us backward in any worthy cause but before we proceed any further i would ask this young gentleman whether he has any explanation to require of mr belcour   charles of mr belcour none his actions speak for themselves but to you sir i would fain propose one question   stockwell name it   charles how is it mr stockwell that i meet a man of your character on this ground   stockwell i will answer you directly and my answer shall not displease you i come hither in defense of the reputation of miss dudley to redress the injuries of an innocent young lady   oflaherty by my soul the man knows he is to fight only he mistakes which side he is to be of   stockwell you are about to draw your sword to refute a charge against your sisters honor you would do well if there were no better means within reach but the proofs of her innocence are lodged in our bosoms and if we fall you destroy the evidence that most effectually can clear her fame   charles how is that sir   stockwell this gentleman could best explain it to you but you have given him an undeserved name that seals his lips against you i am not under the same inhibition and if your anger can keep cool for a few minutes i desire i may call in two witnesses who will solve all difficulties at once here waiter bring those people in that are without   oflaherty out upon it what need is there for so much talking about the matter cannot you settle your differences first and dispute about em afterward   fulmer and mrs fulmer brought in charles fulmer and his wife in custody   stockwell yes sir these are your honest landlord and landlady now in custody for defrauding this gentleman of certain diamonds intended to have been presented to your sister be so good mrs fulmer to inform the company why you so grossly scandalized the reputation of an innocent lady by persuading mr belcour that miss dudley was not the sister but the mistress of this gentleman   mrs fulmer sir i dont know what right you have to question me and i shall not answer till i see occasion   stockwell had you been as silent heretofore madam it would have saved you some trouble but we dont want your confession this letter which you wrote to mr belcour will explain your design and these diamonds which of right belong to miss rusport will confirm your guilt the law mrs fulmer will make you speak though i cannot constable take charge of your prisoners   fulmer hold a moment mr stockwell you are a gentleman that knows the world and a member of parliament we shall not attempt to impose upon you we know we are open to the law and we know the utmost it can do against us mr belcour has been ill used to be sure and so has miss dudley and for my own part i always condemned the plot as a very foolish plot but it was a child of mrs fulmers brain and she would not be put out of conceit with it   mrs fulmer you are a very foolish man mr fulmer so prithee hold your tongue   fulmer therefore as i was saying if you send her to bridewell it will not be amiss and if you give her a little wholesome discipline she may be the better for that too but for me mr stockwell who am a man of letters i must beseech you sir not to bring any disgrace upon my profession   stockwell it is you mr fulmer not i that disgrace your profession therefore begone nor expect that i will betray the interests of mankind so far as to show favor to such incendiaries take em away i blush to think such wretches should have the power to set two honest men at variance   exeunt fulmer etc charles mr belcour we have mistaken each other let us exchange forgiveness i am convinced you intended no affront to my sister and i ask your pardon for the expression i was betrayed into   belcour it is enough sir the error began on my side and was miss dudley here i would be the first to atone   stockwell let us all adjourn to my house and conclude the evening like friends you will find a little entertainment ready for you and if i am not mistaken miss dudley and her father will make part of our company come major do you consent   oflaherty most readily mr stockwell a quarrel well made up is better than a victory hardly earned give me your hand belcour of my conscience you are too honest for the country you live in and now my dear lad since peace is concluded on all sides i have a discovery to make to you which you must find out for yourself for deuce take me if i rightly comprehend it only that your aunt rusport is in a conspiracy against you and a vile rogue of a lawyer whose name i forget at the bottom of it   charles what conspiracy dear major recollect yourself   oflaherty by my soul i have no faculty at recollecting myself but i have a paper somewhere about me that will tell you more of the matter than i can when i get to the merchants i will endeavor to find it   charles well it must be in your own way but i confess you hare thoroughly roused my curiosity   exeunt scene ii stockwells house capt dudley louisa and stukely dudley and are those wretches fulmer and his wife in safe custody   stukely they are in good hands i accompanied them to the tavern where your son was to be and then went in search of you you may be sure mr stockwell will enforce the law against them as far as it will go   dudley what mischief might their cursed machinations have produced but for this timely discovery   louisa still i am terrified i tremble with apprehension lest mr belcours impetuosity and charless spirit should not wait for an explanation but drive them both to extremes before the mistake can be unravelled   stukely mr stockwell is with them madam and you have nothing to fear you cannot suppose he would ask you hither for any other purpose but to celebrate their reconciliation and to receive mr belcours atonement   dudley no no louisa mr stockwells honor and discretion guard us against all danger or offense he well knows we will endure no imputation on the honor of our family and he certainly has invited us to receive satisfaction on that score in an amicable way   louisa would to heaven they were returned   stukely you may expect them every minute and see madam agreeable to your wish they are here   exit scene iii charles enters and afterward stockwell and oflaherty louisa o charles o brother how could you serve me so how could you tell me you was going to lady rusports and then set out with a design of fighting mr belcour but where is he where is your antagonist   stockwell captain i am proud to see you an you miss dudley do me particular honor we have been adjusting sir a very extraordinary and dangerous mistake which i take for granted my friend stukely has explained to you   dudley he has i have too good an opinion of mr belcour to believe he could be guilty of a designed affront to an innocent girl and i am much too well acquainted with your character to suppose you could abet him in such design i have no doubt therefore all things will be set to rights in very few words when we have the pleasure of seeing mr belcour   stockwell he has only stepped into the comptinghouse and will wait upon you directly you will not be over strict madam in weighing mr belcours conduct to the minutest scruple his manners passions and opinions are not as yet affimilated to this climate he comes amongst you a new character an inhabitant of a new world and both hospitality as well as pity recommend him to our indulgence   scene iv belcour enters bows to miss dudley belcour i am happy and ashamed to see you no man in his senses would offend you i forfeited mine and erred against the light of the sun when i overlooked your virtues but your beauty was predominant and hid them from my sight i now perceive i was the dupe of a most improbable report and humbly entreat your pardon   louisa think no more of it twas a mistake   belcour my life has been composed of little else twas founded in mystery and has continued in error i was once given to hope mr stockwell that you was to have delivered me from these difficulties but either i do not deserve your confidence or i was deceived in my expectations   stockwell when this lady has confirmed your pardon i shall hold you deserving of my confidence   louisa that was granted the moment it was asked   belcour to prove my title to his confidence honor me so far with yours as to allow me a few minutes conversation in private with you  she turns to her father dudley by all means louisa come mr stockwell let us go into another room   charles and now major oflaherty i claim your promise of a sight of the paper that is to unravel this conspiracy of my aunt rusports i think i have waited with great patience   oflaherty i have been endeavoring to call to mind what it was i overheard i have got the paper and will give you the best account i can of the whole transaction   exeunt scene v belcour and louisa belcour miss dudley i have solicited this audience to repeat to you my penitence and confusion how shall i atone what reparation can i make to you and virtue   louisa to me there is nothing due nor any thing demanded of you but your more favorable opinion for the future if you should chance to think of me upon the part of virtue i am not empowered to speak but if hereafter as you range through life you should surprise her in the person of some wretched female poor as myself and not so well protected enforce not your advantage complete not your licentious triumph but raise her rescue her from shame and sorrow and reconcile her to herself again   belcour i will i will by bearing your idea ever present in my thoughts virtue shall keep an advocate within me but tell me loveliest when you pardon the offense can you all pefect as you are approve of the offender as i now cease to view you in that false light i lately did can you and in the fullness of your bounty will you cease also to reflect upon the libertine addresses i have paid you and look upon me as your reformed your rational admirer   louisa are sudden reformations apt to last and how can i be sure the first fair face you meet will not ensnare affections so unsteady and that i shall not lose you lightly as i gained you   belcour because though you conquered me by surprise i have no inclination to rebel because since the first moment that i saw you every instant has improved you in my eyes because by principle as well as passion i am unalterably yours in short there are ten thousand causes for my love to you would to heaven i could plant one in your soft bosom that might move you to return it   louisa nay mr belcour    belcour i know i am not worthy your regard i know i am tainted with a thousand faults sick of a thousand follies but there is a healing virtue in your eyes that makes recovery certain i cannot be a villain in your arms   louisa that you can never be whomever you shall honor with your choice my life upon it that woman will be happy it is not from suspicion that i hesitate it is from honor it is the severity of my condition it is the world that never will interpret fairly in our case   belcour oh what am i and who in this wide would concerns himself for such a nameless such a friendless th as i am i set miss dudley  not yet  your pardon   louisa nay that you are in full possession of   belcour oh seal it with your hand then loveliest of women confirm it with your heart make me honorably happy and crown your penitent not with your pardon only but your love   louisa my love    belcour by heaven my soul is conquered with your virtues more than my eyes are ravished with your beauty oh may this fo this sensitve alarm be happy be acious doubt not deliberate not delay  if happiness be the end of life why do we supa moment   scene vi oflaherty enters and afterward dudley and charles with stockwell oflaherty joy joy joy sing dance leap laugh for joy have done making love and fall down on your knees to every saint in the  for they are all on your side and honest st patrick at the head of them   charles o louisa such an event by the  chane in life we have discovered a will of  grandfaers made in his last illness by which he out of my aunt rusport with a small annuity and leaves me heir to his whole estate with a fortune of fifteen thousand pounds to yourself   louisa what is it you tell me o sir instruct me to support this unexpected turn of fortune  to her fther dudley name not fortune it is he work of providence it is the justice of heaven that would not suffer innocence to be oppressed nor your base aunt to prosper in her cruelty and cunning   a servant whispers belcour and he goes out oflaherty you shall pardon me capt dudley but you must not overlook st patrick neither for by my soul if he had not put it into my head to slip behind the screen when your righteous aunt and the lawyer were plotting together i dont see how you would ever have come at the paper there that master stockwell is reading   dudley true my good friend you are the father of this discovery but how did you contrive to get this will from the lawyer   oflaherty by force my dear the only way of getting any thing from a lawyers clutches   stockwell well major when he brings his action of assault and battery against you the least dudley can do is to defend you with the weapons you have put into his hands   charles that i am bound to do and after the happiness i shall have in sheltering a fathers age from the vicissitudes of life my next delight will be in offering you an asylum in the bosom of your country   oflaherty and upon my soul my dear it is high time i was there for it is now thirty long years since i sat foot in my native country and by the power of st patrick i swear i think it is worth all the rest of the world put together   dudley ay major much about that time have i been heating the round of service and twere well for us both to give over we have stood many a tough gale and abundance of hard blows but charles shall lay us up in a little private but safe harbor where well rest from our labors and peacefully wind up the remainder of our days   oflaherty agreed and you may take it as a proof of my esteem young man that major oflaherty accepts a favor at your bands for by heaven i would sooner starve than say i thank you to the man i despise but i believe you are an honest lad and i am glad you have trouncd the old cat for on my conscience i believe i must otherwise have married her myself to have let you in for a share of her fortune   stockwell hey day what is become of belcour   louisa one of your servants called him out just now and seemingly on some earnest occasion   stockwell i hope miss dudley he has atoned to you as a gentleman ought   louisa mr belcour sir will always do what a gentleman ought and in my case i fear only you will think he has done too much   stockwell what has he done and what can be too much pray heaven it may be as i wish  aside dudley let us hear it child   louisa with confusion for my own unworthiness i confess to you he has offered me    stockwell himself   louisa it is true   stockwell then i am happy all my doubts my cares are over and i may own him for my son   why these are joyful tidings come my good friend assist me in disposing your lovely daughter to accept this returning prodigal he is no unprincipled no hardened libertine his love for you and virtue is the same   dudley twere vile ingratitude in me to doubt his merit  what says my child   oflaherty begging your pardon now it is a frivolous sort of a question that of yours for you may see plainly enough by the young ladys looks that she says a great deal though she speaks never a word   charles well sister i believe the major has fairly interpreted the state of your heart   louisa i own it and what must that heart be which love honor and beneficence like mr belcours can make no impression on   stockwell i thank you what happiness has this hour brought to pass   oflaherty why dont we all sit down to supper then and make a night on it   stockwell hold here comes belcour   scene vii belcour introducing miss rusport belcour mr dudley here is a fair refugee who properly comes under your protection she is equipt for scotland but your good fortune which i have related to her seems inclined to save you both the journey  nay madam never go back you are amongst friends   charles charlotte   charlotte the same that fond officious girl that haunts you every where that persecuting spirit    charles say rather that protecting angel such you have been to me   charlotte o charles you have an honest but proud heart   charles nay chide me not dear charlotte   belcour seal up her lips then she is an adorable girl her arms are open to you and love and happiness are ready to receive you   charles thus then i claim my dear my destined wife  embracing her scene viii lady rusport enters lady rusport heyday mighty fine wife truly mighty well kissing embracing  did ever any thing equal this why you shameless hussy  but i will not condescend to waste a word upon you  you sir you mr stockwell you fine sanctified fairdealing man of conscience is this the principle you trade upon is this your neighbourly system to keep a house of reception for runaway daughters and young beggarly fortunehunters   oflaherty be advised now and dont put yourself in such a passion we were all very happy till you came   lady rusport stand away sir havnt i a reason to be in a passion   oflaherty indeed honey and you have if you knew all   lady rusport come madam i have found out your haunts dispose yourself to return home with me young man let me never see you within my doors again mr stockwell i shall report your behavior depend on it   stockwell hold madam i cannot consent to lose miss rusports company this evening and i am persuaded you will not insist upon it it is an unmotherly action to interrupt your daughters happiness in this manner believe me it is   lady rusport her happiness truly upon my word and i suppose it is an unmotherly action to interrupt her ruin for what but ruin must it be to marry a beggar i think my sister had a proof of that sir when she made choice of you  to captain dudley dudley dont be too lavish of your spirits lady rusport   oflaherty by my soul you will have occasion for a sip of the cordial elixir by and bye   stockwell it dont appear to me madam that mr dudley can be called a beggar   lady rusport but it appears to me mr stockwell i am apt to think a pair of colors cannot furnish settlement quite sufficient for the heiress of sir stephen rusport   charlotte but a good estate in aid of a commission may do something   lady rusport a good estate truly where should he get a good estate pray   stockwell why suppose now a worthy old gentleman on his deathbed should have taken it in mind to leave him one    lady rusport hah what is that you say   oflaherty o ho you begin to smell a plot do you   stockwell suppose there should be a paper in the world that runs thus  i do hereby give and bequeath all my estates real and personal to charles dudley son of my late daughter louisa etc etc etc   lady rusport why i am thunderstruck by what contrivance what villainy did you get possession of that paper   stockwell there was no villainy madam in getting possession of it the crime was in concealing it none in bringing it to light   lady rusport oh that cursed lawyer varland   oflaherty you may say that faith he is a cursed lawyer and a cursed piece of work i had to get the paper from him your ladyship now was to have paid him five thousand pounds for it i forced him to give it me of his own accord for nothing at all at all   lady rusport is it you that have done this am i foiled by your blundering contrivances after all   oflaherty twas a blunder faith but as natural a one as if i would made it of purpose   charles come let us not oppress the fallen do right even now and you shall have no cause to complain   lady rusport am i become an object of your pity then insufferable confusion light amongst you marry and be wretched let me never see you more   exit charlotte she is outrageous i suffer for her and blush to see her thus exposed   charles come charlotte dont let this angry woman disturb our happiness we will save her in spite of herself your fathers memory shall not be stained by the discredit of his second choice   charlotte i trust implicitly to your discretion and am in all things yours   belcour now lovely but obdurate does not this example soften   louisa what can you ask for more accept my hand accept my willing heart   belcour o bliss inutterable brother father
