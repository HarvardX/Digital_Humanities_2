those who devote themselves to poetry to raise if possible the dignity of a declining art by making it as beneficial to life and manners as the limits of composition and the character of modern times will allow the ages indeed are past in which the song of the poet was idolized for its miraculous effects yet a poem intended to promote the cultivation of good humor may still perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of some little service to society in general or if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by sober reason it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delusions in which a poetical enthusiast may be safely indulged  the following production owes its existence to an incident in real life very similar to the principal action of the last canto but in forming the general plan of the work it seemed to me absolutely necessary to introduce both the agency and the abode of spleen notwithstanding the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of pope i considered his cave of spleen as a most exquisite cabinet picture and to avoid the servility of imitation i determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy power on a much wider canvass happy indeed if the judgment of the public may enable me to exclaim with the honest vanity of the painter who compared his own works to the divine productions of raphael e son pittore anch io  the celebrated alessandro tassoni who is generally considered as the inventor of the modern heroicomic poety was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters but even gave a ms copy of his work to his native city of modena with an inscription in which he styled it a new species of poetry invented by himself  a few partial friends have asserted that the present performance has some degree of similar merit but as i apprehend all the novelty it possesses may rather require an apology than entitle its author to challenge commendation i shall explain how far the conduct of the poem differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing and slightly mention the poetical effects which such a variation appeared likely to produce  it is well known that the favorite poems which blend the serious and the comic represent their principal characters in a satirical point of view it was the intention of tassoni though prudence made him attempt to conceal it to satirize a particular italian nobleman who happened to be the object of his resentment boileau openly ridicules the french ecclesiastics in his lutrin garth our english physicians in his dispensary and the rape of the lock itself that most excellent and enchanting poem which i never contemplate but with new idolatry is denominated the best satire extant by the learned dr warton in his very elegant and ingenious but severe essay on pope a sentence which seems to be confirmed by the poet himself in his letter to mrs fermor where he says the character of belinda as it is now managed resembles you in nothing but in beauty though i think that no composition can surpass or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of genius as a sportive satire i imagined it might be possible to give a new character to this mixed species of poetry and to render it by its object though not in its execution more noble than the most beautiful and refined satire can be we have seen it carried to inimitable perfection in the most delicate raillery on female foibles  it remained to be tried if it might not also aspire to delineate the more engaging features of female excellence the idea appeared to me worth the experiment for if it succeeded it seemed to promise a double advantage first it would give an air of novelty to the poem and secondly what i thought of much greater importance it would render it more interesting to the heart on these principles i have endeavored to paint serena as a most lovely engaging and accomplished character yet i hope the coloring is so faithfully copied from general nature that every man who reads the poem may be happy enough to know many fair ones who resemble my heroine  there is another point in which i have also attempted to give this poem an air of novelty i mean the manner of connecting the real and the visionary scenes which compose it by shifting these in alternate cantos i hoped to make familiar incident and allegorical picture afford a strong relief to each other and keep the attention of the reader alive by an appearance particularly diversified i wished indeed but i fear most ineffectually for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of ariosto and the more serious sublime painting of dante with some portion of the enchanting elegance the refined imagination and the moral graces of pope and to do this if possible without violating those rules of propriety which mr cambridge has illustrated by example as well as precept in the scribleriad and in his sensible preface to that elegant and learned poem  i have now very frankly informed my reader of the extent or rather of the extravagance of my desire for i will not give it the serious name of design they whom an enlightened taste has rendered thoroughly sensible how very difficult it must be to accomplish such an idea will not only be the first to discern but the most ready to pardon those errors into which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me i had thoughts of introducing this performance to the public by a dissertation of considerable length on this species of poetry but i forbear to indulge myself any farther in such preliminary remarks as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce from the reflection that however ingeniously written they add little or nothing to the success of a good poem and are utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect or oblivion which is the inevitable fate of a bad one  in dismissing a work to my fair readers which is intended principally for their perusal i shall only recommend it to their attention and bid them farewell in the words of the pleasant and courteous tassoni  vaglia il buon voler s altro non lice e chi la leggera viva felice   eartham jan         the triumphs of temper canto i the minds soft guardian who though yet unsung inspires with harmony the female tongue and gives improving every tender grace the smile of angels to a mortal face her powers i sing and scenes of mental strife which form the maiden for the accomplished wife where the sweet victress sees with sparkling eyes love her reward and happiness her prize daughters of beauty who the song inspire to your enchanting notes attune my lyre and o if happily your soft hearts may gain or use or pleasure from the motley strain though formal critics with a surly frown deny your artless bard the laurel crown he still shall triumph if ye deign to spread your sweeter myrtle round his honored head in your bright circle young serena grew a lovelier nymph the pencil never drew for the fond graces formed her easy mien and heavens soft azure in her eye was seen she seemed a rosebud when it first receives the genial sun in its expanding leaves for now she entered those important years when the full bosom swells with hopes and fears when conscious nature prompts the secret sigh and sheds sweet languor over the melting eye when nobler toys the female heart trepan and dolls rejected yield their place to man beneath a fathers care serena grew the good sir gilbert to his country true a faithful whig who zealous for the state in freedoms service led the loud debate yet every day by transmutation rare turned to a tory in his elbow chair and made his daughter pay however absurd passive obedience to his sovereign word in his domestic sway he borrowed aid from prim penelope an ancient maid his upright sister conscious of her worth who valued still her beauty and her birth though from her birth no envied rank she gained and of her beauty but the ghost remained a restless ghost that with remembrance keen proclaimed incessant what it once had been delighted still the steps of youth to haunt to watch the tender nymph and warm gallant and with an eye that petrified pursuit hang like the dragon over the hesperian fruit though strictly guarded by this jealous power the mild serena no restraint could sour pure was her bosom as the silver lake ere rising winds the ruffled water shake when the bright pageants of the morning sky across the expansive mirror lightly fly by vernal gales in gay succession driven while the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven in gay content a sportive life she led the child of modesty by virtue bred her light companions innocence and ease her hope was pleasure and her wish to please for this to fashion early rites she paid for this to venus secret vows she made nor held it sin to cast a private glance over the dear pages of a new romance eager in fictions touching scenes to find a field to exercise her youthful mind the touching scenes new energy impressed on all the virtues of her feeling breast sweet evelinas fascinating power had first beguiled of sleep her midnight hour possessed by sympathys enchanting sway she read unconscious of the dawning day the modern anecdote was next conveyed beneath her pillow by her faithful maid the nymph attentive as the brooding dove pored over the tender scenes of franzels love the sinking taper now grew weak and pale serena sighed and dropped the unfinished tale but as warm clouds in vernal ether roll the soft ideas floated in her soul free from ambitious pride and envious care to love and to be loved was all her prayer while these fond thoughts her gentle mind possessed soft slumber settled on her snowy breast scarce had her radiant eyes began to close when to her view a friendly vision rose a fairy phantom struck her mental sight light as the gossamer as ether bright arrayed like pallas was the pigmy form when the sage goddess stills the martial storm her casque was amber richly graced above with down collected from the callow dove her burnished breast plate of a deeper dye was once the armor of a golden fly a lynxs eye her little aegis shone by fairy spells converted into stone and worn of old as elfin poets sing by aegypts lovely queen a favorite ring mysterious power was in the magic toy to turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy her tiny lance whose radiance streamed afar was one bright sparkle from the bridal star a filmy mantle round her figure played fine as the texture by arachne laid over some young plant when glittering to the view with many an orient pearl of morning dew the phantom hovered over the conscious fair with such a lively smile of tender care as on her elfin lord titania cast when first she found his angry spell was past round her rich locks serena chanced to tie an ample ribband of caerulean dye high over her forehead rose the graceful bow whose arch commanded the sweet scene below the hovering spirit viewed the tempting spot and lightly perched on this unbending knot as the fair flutterer of psyches race is seen to terminate her airy chase when pleased at length her quivering wings to close fondly she settles on the fragrant rose now in soft notes more musically clear than ever fairy breathed in mortal ear these words the visionary voice conveyed to the charmed spirit of the sleeping maid thou darling of my care whose ripened worth shall spread my empire over the smiling earth whom nature blessed forbidding modish art to cramp thy spirit or contract thy heart screend from thy thought nor in thy visions felt long on thy opening mind i have fondly dwelt in childhoods sorrows brought thee quick relief and dried thy april showers of infant grief taught thee to laugh at the malicious boy who broke thy playthings with a barbarous joy to bear what ills the little female haunt the testy nurse the imperious governante and that tyrannic pest the prying maiden aunt now ripening years a nobler scene supply for life now opens on thy sparkling eye thy rising bosom swells with just desire rapture to feel and rapture to inspire not the vain bliss the transitory joys that childish woman feels in radiant toys the costly diamond or the lighter pearl the massive nabob or the tinsel earl thy heart demands each meaner aim above the imperishable wealth of sterling love thy wish to please by every softer grace of elegance and ease of form and face by lively fancy and by sense refined the stronger magic of the cultured mind thy pure ambition and thy virtuous plan to fix the variable heart of man short is the worship paid at beautys shrine but lasting love and happiness are mine mine though the earths mistaken blinded race despise my influence and my name debase nor breathe one vow to that aetherial friend on whom the colors of their life depend but to thy innocence i will now display the mystic marvels of my secret sway and tell in this thy fatedeciding hour my race my name my office and my power first hear what wonders human forms contain and learn the texture of the female brain by natures care in curious order spread this living net is framed of tender thread fine as thy hand some favored youth to grace knits with nice art to form the mimic lace within the center of this fretted dome her secret tower her heavenconstructed home soft sensibility sweet beautys soul keeps her coy state and animates the whole invisible as harmony who springs waked by young zephyr from aeolian strings her subtle power more delicately fine dwells in each thread and lives in every line whose quick vibrations without end impart pleasure and pain to the responsive heart as zephyrs breath the willing chord inspires whispering soft music to the trembling wires so with fond care i regulate unseen the softer movements of this nice machine temper my earthly name the nurse of love but called sophrosyne in realms above when lovely woman perfect at her birth blessed with her early charms the wondering earth her soul in sweet simplicity arrayed nor shared my guidance nor required my aid her tender frame nor confident nor coy had every fiber tuned to gentle joy no vain caprices swelled her pouting lip no gold produced a mercenary trip soft innocence inspired her willing kiss her love was nature and her life was bliss guide of his reason not his passions prey she tamed the savage man who blessed her sway no jarring wishes filled the world with woes but youth was ecstacy and age repose the powers of mischief met in dark divan to blast these mighty joys of envied man the fiends at their infernal leaders call framed their base wiles in demogorgons hall in the deep center of that dreadful dome an hellish cauldron boiled with fiery foam in this wide urn the circling spirits threw ingredients harsh and hideous to the view while the terrific master of the spell with adjurations shook the depths of hell and in dark words unmeet for mortal ear bade the dire offspring of his art appear forth from the vase with sullen murmurs broke a towering mass of pestilential smoke emerging from this fog of thickest night a phantom swells by slow degrees to sight but ere the view can seize the forming shape from the mocked eye its lineaments escape it seemed all passions melted into one assumed the face of all and yet was none hell stood aghast at its portentous mien and shuddering demons called the spectre spleen hie thee to earth its mighty master cried over the vexed globe in heavy vapors ride within its center fix thy shadowy throne with shades thy subjects and that hell thy own reign there unseen but let thy strong control be hourly felt in womans wayward soul with darkest poisons from our deep abyss taint that pure fountain of terrestrial bliss the enormous phantom at this potent sound rolled forth obedient from the vast profound the quaking fiends recovered from their dread and hell grew lighter as the monster fled but now round earth the gliding vapors run blot the rich ether and eclipse the sun all nature sickens and her fairest flower enchanting woman feels the baneful power as in her soul the clouds of spleen arise the sprightly essence of her beauty flies in youths gay prime in hours with rapture warm love looks astonished on her altering form to pleasing frolics and enchanting wiles lifedarting looks and soulsubduing smiles dark whims succeed thickcovring fancies fret the sullen passion and the hasty pet the swelling lip the teardistended eye the peevish question the perverse reply the moody humor that like rain and fire blends cold disgust with unsubdud desire flies what it loves and petulantly coy feigns proud abhorrence of the proffered joy for natures artless aim the wish to please by genuine modesty and simple ease fashions pert tricks the crowded brain oppress with all the poor parade of tawdry dress the sickly bosom pants for noise and show for every bauble and for every beau the voice that health made harmony disowns that native charm for languors mimic tones and feigns disease till feeling what it feigns its fancied maladies are real pains such and a thousand still superior woes from spleens new empire over the earth arose each simple dictate of the soul forgot then first was formed the mercenary plot and beauty practiced that pernicious art the art of angling for an old mans heart though crawling to his bride with tottering knees his words were dotage and his love disease from sex to sex this base contagion ran and gold grew beauty in the eyes of man courtship was traffic and the married life but one loud jangle of incessant strife the gentle sprite who on his radiant car shines the mild regent of the eveningstar and joys from thence those genial rays to shed that lead the bridegroom to the nuptial bed while earths new ills his friendly soul absorb from cynthia called me to his kindred orb and eager to redress the woes of man the brilliant son of vesper thus began thou softest being of the aetherial kind be thy benignant cares no more confined to smooth the ruffled plume of zephyrs wing to guard from cruel frost the infant spring to drive gross atoms from the rays of noon or chase the halo from the vapourish moon thy friendly nature will not now deny to quit for nobler toils thy native sky thou see how spleens infernal vapors roll across the sweet serene of womans soul and earth which darkens as her beauties fade must grow a second hell without thy aid take then thy station fix thy nobler reign over those fine chords that form the female brain that used ere injured by the rust of spleen to fill with harmony the human scene go lest her touch their tender tones destroy teach them to vibrate to thy notes of joy go and restore by stilling mental strife health to faint love and happiness to life so spoke that friend of man who lights above his heavenly lamp of hymenaeal love in his just aim my kindred spirit joined and flew obedient to the charge assigned hence as the biass sways the unconscious bowl i long unseen have swayed the careless soul though often i feel my power by spleen subdued in the shrill vixen and the sullen prude in some fair forms my soft dominion grows like fragrance rising from the opening rose still i preserve in many a lovely face that gay good humor and that constant grace which heavenly powers united to infold in perfect womans newcreated mould when nature in her infant beauty blessed the last and loveliest of her works carest but of those nymphs who delicately fair draw their soft graces from my forming care my young serena shines her peers above pride of my hopes and darling of my love hence i to thee such mysteries unfold as mans pedantic eye shall never behold whose narrow science though it proudly boast to pierce the sky and count the starry host sees not the lucid band of airy powers who flutter round him in his secret hours but if to me thy guardian now displayed thy duteous orisons are justly paid thou to those realms shall pass with me thy guide where spleens pale victims after death reside then to that orb in vision shall thou rise unseen by mortal astronomic eyes where i  but first let me thy soul prepare to meet our secret foes insidious snare it is my fond purpose in thy form to show the sweetest model of my skill below a youth i destine to thy dear embrace crowned with each mental charm and manly grace with whom thy innocence secure from strife shall reap the beauteous joys of blameless life pleased i observe thy little heart begin to ask what charms the mighty prize may win but know though elegance herself be seen to guide thy motion and to form thy mien though beauty over thy filial cheek diffuse the soft enchantment of her roseate hues not from their favor shall this glory rise temper shall singly gain the splendid prize the sudden conquest shall be mine alone and love with transport shall my triumph own such are my hopes but i with pain relate what hard conditions are annexed by fate as chemic fires that patient labor blows draw the rich perfume from the persian rose so must thou form by fiery toils refined the living essence of thy sweeter mind dimly i see on destinys dull glass three dangerous trials it is thy doom to pass and oh if once forgetful of my power good humor fail thee in the fateful hour farewell those joys that wait the happy wife farewell the vision of unclouded life fain would my love thy secret perils show which fate allows not even me to know in spleens dark court a thousand agents dwell who bind her victims in the wayward spell perchance three prime supporters of her sway the busiest of her fiends may cross thy way stern contradiction her illfavored child of fierce demeanor and of spirit wild bane of delight and horror of the sex his plan to puzzle and his pride to vex  or scandal filthy hag who blindly limps round the wide earth supported by her imps her inky demons who delight to print her base suggestion and her envious hint  or groundless jealousy pert changeling born of amorous vanity and angry scorn whose bitter taunts with public insult dare basely to wound the unoffending fair proud the sweet joys of innocence to crush and spread over beautys cheek the burning blush whether these kindred fiends or one or all shall aim thy airy spirit to enthrall are points my fondness tries in vain to reach but trust my caution and beware of each lest to thy lively mind my words may seem the vain chimera of a common dream by one unquestionable sign be taught to prize my presence in thy waking thought an azure ribband on thy toilet thrown shall make the magic of my empire known on this thy sportive needle tried its powers and silver spangles formed the mimic flowers on these my love shall breathe a secret charm with this my caestus thy soft bosom arm above it let the decent tucker rise to hide the mystic band from mortal eyes when spleens dark powers would teach that breast to swell this guardian cincture shall those powers repel as the touched talisman more swift than thought to save her charge the arabian fairy brought so shall this zone if justly i am obeyed bring my soft spirit to thy certain aid in loves great name observe this high behest revere my power  be gentle and be blessed here the kind sprite her friendly counsel closed and lightly vanished  still serena dozd still in sweet trance she fondly seemed to hear the soft persuasion vibrate in her ear but waking now far different notes she found less pleasing echos in her chamber sound for now the heralds of the london day sing their loud mattins in the uncrowded way the impatient milkmaid now with early din screams to the rattle of her pail of tin with sweeps faint cry and latest of the crew the deeptond music of the murmuring jew end of the first canto canto ii ye radiant nymphs whose opening eyes convey warmth to the world and luster to the day think what oershadowing clouds may cross your brain before those lovely lids shall close again what funds of patience twelve long hours may ask when cold discretion claims her daily task ah think betimes and while your morning care sheds foreign odors over your fragrant hair tinge your soft spirit with that mental sweet which may not be exhaled by passions heat but charm the sense with undecaying power through every chance of each diurnal hour o might you all perceive your toilets crowned with such cosmetics as serena found for to the warning vision fondly true now the quick fair one to the toilet flew with keen delight her ravished eye surveyed the mystic ribband on her mirror laid bright shone the azure as auroras car and every spangle seemed a living star with sportive grace the smiling damsel pressed the guardian cincture to her snowy breast more lovely far than juno when she strove to look most lovely in the eyes of jove and willing venus lent her every power that sheds enchantment over the amorous hour for spells more potent on this band were thrown than venus boasted in her beauteous zone her dazzling caestus could alone inspire the sudden impulse of shortlived desire these finer threads with lasting charms are fraught here lies the tender but unchanging thought silence that wins where eloquence is vain and tones that harmonize the madning brain soft sighs that anger cannot hear and live and smiles that tell how truly they forgive and lively grace whose gay diffusive light puts the black phantoms of the brain to flight whose cheering powers through every period last and make the present happy as the past such secret charms this richer zone possessed whose flowers now sparkling en serenas breast give though unseen those swelling orbs they bind smiles to her face and beauty to her mind for now observant of the sprites behest the nymph conceals them by her upper vest safe lies the spell no mortal may descry not keen penelopes allpiercing eye who constant as the steps of morn advance surveys the household with a searching glance and entering now with all her usual care reviews the chamber of the youthful fair beneath the pillow not completely hid the novel lay  she saw  she seized  she chid with rage and glee her glaring eye balls flash ah wicked age she cries ah filthy trash from the first page my just abhorrence springs for modern anecdotes are monstrous things yet will i see what dangerous poisons lurk to taint thy youth in this licentious work she said and rudely from the chamber rushed her pallid cheek with expectation flushed with ardent hope her eager spirit shook vain hope to banquet on a luscious book so if a priest of the arabian sect in turkish hands forbidden wine detect the sacred mussulman with pious din arraigns the culprit and proclaims the sin curses with holy zeal the inflaming juice but cursing takes it for his secret use the gay serena with unruffled mind the pleasing novel thus unread resigned the vision on her soul such virtue left she only smiled at the provoking theft the teazing incident she deemed a jest nor felt the zone grow tighter on her breast now in full charms descends the finished fair for now the morning banquet claims her care already at the board with viands pild her sire impatient fits and chides his tardy child on his imperial lips rude hunger reigns and keener politics usurp his brains but when her loveinspiring voice he hears when the soft magic of her smile appears in that glad moment he at once forgets his empty stomach and the nations debts he bends to natures more divine control and only feels the father in his soul quick to his hand behold her now present the indian liquor of celestial scent not with more grace the nectard cup is given by roselipd hebe to the lord of heaven while her fair hands a fresh libation pour fashions loud thunder shakes the sounding door the light serena to the window springs on curiositys amusive wings her quick eyes sparkle with surprise see the glories of a golden visavis its glittering tablet gleamd with mimic pearl and the rich coronet announcd an earl the good old knight grew somewhat proud to hear of this new visit from the early peer serena recollects the visions truth and fluttering hopes it is the promised youth penelope from her high chamber peeps there her unfinished charms she coyly keeps with sage reserve her modesty abhorred to show her morning face before a lord the peer alights the wellrangd vassals bawl his sounding title through the spacious hall till in the deep saloons extremest bound the eartickling words lord filligree resound as when great hector setting war apart advanced to parley with his spear athwart the greeks beheld him with a still delight and silent reverence stopped the rising fight with such respect but unchastisd by fear sir gilbert and the nymph first meet the peer and while his morning compliments commence the slighted breakfast stands in cold suspense but far unlike to hectors ruder grace his modern stature and his modish face nor less he differs from those barons old whose arms are blazoned on his car of gold whose prostrate castle guarded once the lands where spruce in motley pride his villa stands by taste erected in her trimmest mode her mushroom structure and her quaint abode as the neat daisy to the suns broad flower as the french boudoir to the gothic tower such is the peer whom fashion much admires compared in person to his ancient sires for their broad shoulder and their brawny calf their coarse loud language and their coarser laugh his finer form more elegantly slim displays the fashionable length of limb with foreign shrugs his country he regards and her lean tongue with foreign words he lards while gallic graces who correct his style forbid his mirth to pass beyond a smile as the nice workman in the wooden trade hides his coarse ground with finest woods oerlaid thus our young lord with fashions phrase refined fineerd the mean interior of his mind and hence in courtesys soft luster seen his spirit shone as graceful as his mien the artless fair on fashions kind report thought him the mirror of a matchless court much she his dress his language much observes whose finer accents prove his feeling nerves her fancy now the destined lover spies but her free heart abjures the quick surmise yet as he spoke at every flattering word the visions promise to her thought recurrd far more parental pride contrives to blind the good sir gilberts moreexperiencd mind who fondly saw and at the prospect smiled a future countess in his favorite child but what new flutterings shook serenas breast what hopes and fears the modest nymph oppressed when with a simpering smile and soft regard the peer displayed a mirthexpressive card where the gay graces in a sportive band show the sweet art of ciprianis hand where in their train his airy cupids throng and laughing drag a comic mask along we cries my lord with selfsufficient joy twirling with lordly airs the grateful toy we who possess true science we who give the world a lesson in the art to live we for the fair a splendid fete design and pay our homage thus at beautys shrine he spoke and speaking to the blushing maid with modish ease the inviting card conveyed where mirth announcd her masque devoted hour in characters intwind with many a flower the blushing maid with eyes of quick desire viewed it and felt her little soul on fire for of all scenes she had not yet surveyed her heart most panted for a masquerade but her gay hopes increasing terrors drown and dread forebodings of her fathers frown in mute suspense to read his thought she tries and strongly pleads with her prevailing eyes her eyes for doubt enchaind her modest tongue while on his sovereign word her pleasure hung with such a tender and persuasive air of soft endearment and of anxious care thetis attended from the almighty sire his fateful answer to her fond desire the good old knight like the olympian god blessed the fair suppliant with his gracious nod her lively spirit the kind signal took and her glad heart in every fiber shook the party settled it imports not how the peer politely made his parting bow the nymph with eyes that sparkled joyous fire kissed the round cheek of her complying sire then swiftly flew and summoned to her aid the important counsel of her favorite maid to vent her joy and as the moments press to fix that first of points a fancydress quick as the poets eyes over nature fly piercing the deep or traversing the sky with such light speed her fond ideas glance over play and poem story and romance while all the characters she ever has read flash on her brain and fill her busy head now in dianas form she hopes to meet a fond endymion sighing at her feet now her proud thought terrestrial pomp assumes and dians crescent yields to indian plumes now in the habit of the grecian isles she hears some osman suing for her smiles and sees his soul that blaze of dress outshine whose wealth impoverished a diamondmine now simpler charms her quick attention draw the rosecrownd bonnet and the hat of straw a villagemaid she seems in neat attire a faithful shepherd now her sole desire thus as new figures in her fancy throng she is every thing by starts and nothing long but in the space of one revolving hour flies through all states of poverty and power all forms on whom her veering mind can pitch sultana gipsy goddess nymph and witch at length her soul with shakespeares magic fraught the wand of ariel fixed her roving thought ariels light graces all her heart possess and jennys ordered to prepare the dress it seems already bought with fond applause an azure tissue and a silver gauze too soon alas that garb of heavenly hue the ready mercer flashes to her view nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae et servare modum rebus sublata secundis turno tempus erit magno cum optaverit emptum intactum pallanta et cum spolia ista diemque oderit aeneid x v  0  and seq ah blind to fate how often the youthful belle feels her gay heart at sight of tissue swell and thinks the fashionable silk must prove her robe of triumph and a spell to love to thee sweet maid whose pleasuredarting eyes joy in this favorite vest an hour shall rise when thou shall hate the silk so fondly sought and wish thy silverspotted gauze unbought for busy spleen thy trial now prepares darkly she forms her unsuspected snares and keen to raise her pleasurekilling storm assumes penelopes congenial form in that prim shape which all the graces shun see the sour fiend to good sir gilbert run where deeply pondering the public debt silent he muses over a new gazette entering she viewed with eyes of envious spite the card that spoke the masquedevoted night eager she darted on the graceful toy and fiercely pointing to each naked boy can thou she cried in a discordant scream that roused the politician from his dream while with her voice the echoing chamber rings   etc iliad   v     and seq say can thou suffer these flagitious things are these devices to thy daughter brought that wake such gross impurity of thought in vain are all the prudent words i preach the modest maxims that i strive to teach by foolish fondness of your sense beguiled you still indulge and spoil the flippant child for me whatever i say is deemed absurd she scorns my sage advice  but mark my word if to this ball you let the hoyden run your power is ended and the girl undone the patriot knight by interruption vexed in his political pursuits perplexed while he with wrath the intruding mischief eyed stern to the false penelope replied go teazing prude cease in my ears to vent thy envious pride and peevish discontent to me of prudence can thou vainly boast of all my household thou have plagued me most the joys thou blamest are thy dear delight by day the visit and the ball by night and though too old a lover to trepan thy midnight dream thy morning thought is man were thou less closely to my blood allied thou should to cure thee of thy canting pride be sent to sigh alone over purling brooks scold village maids and croak to croaking rooks he spoke indignant the sly fiend withdrew nor inly grieved for well her force she knew as indian females in a jealous hour of secret poison try the subtlest power which sure though slow corrodes the unconscious prey and ends its triumph on a distant day thus the departing fury left behind her venom latent in sir gilberts mind the hidden mischief though no eye observes he feels it fretting on his altered nerves but the kind habit of his healthy soul still struggled hard against its base control now spleens dark vapors in his bosom hid prompt him the promised pleasure to forbid now loves soft pleadings that dire thought destroy and save the blossom of his daughters joy her envious aunt now serves him for a jest and gay good humor reassumes his breast while spleens dark power now sinks and now revives at length the day the important day arrives which in his breast must end the close debate and fix the color of serenas sat now comes the hour when the convivial knight waits to begin the dinners cheerful rite his fond heart ever with a fathers pride joys to behold his darling at his side but most the absence of her smile he feels in the gay season of his social meals hence while for her the rich repast attends his hasty summons to the nymph he sends the happy nymph superior cares induce to risk his anger by a rash excuse she craves his pardon but for time distressed she still is busy on her magic vest to range her diamonds in a sparkling zone she begs to snatch her scanty meal alone the knight in sullen state begins to dine spleen like a harpy flutters over his wine invisible she poisons every dish tinging with gall his mutton fowl and fish the more he eats the more perverse he grows for as his hunger sunk his choler rose the cloth removed he cries with vapors sick the pears are mellow and the port is thick though nicer fruit pomona never knew and his rich wine surpassed the rubys hue a thousand times his dizzy brain revolves a stern command now doubts and now resolves to bid the nymph descend and disarrayd quit her dear project of the masquerade as often kind nature to his heart recurrd and love parental stopped the cruel word mean time unconscious of the brooding storm the nymph exults in her improving form gay is her smile as those the queen of love darts on the graces in her court above while they contrive with loveinspiring cares new modes of beauty for the robe she wears at length each duty of the toilet past the glance of triumph on the mirror cast now the light wand our finished ariel arms glad jenny glories in her ladys charms and gives full utterance as she smooths her vest to the sweet bodings of serenas breast o lovely biass of the female soul which

never did nature to a sires embrace present a filial form of softer grace or fancy view a shape of lovelier kind in the bright mirror of her shakespeares mind the sulky fiend in spite of all her art had now been banished from the fathers heart but that resolved her utmost force to try she summoned to her aid her old ally the fiery demon tempertroubling gout who sinks the lively and appalls the stout who now assisting spleens malignant aim shoots in quick throbbings through sir gilberts frame thus sorely pestered by a double foe galling his giddy brain and burning toe the testy knight with stern and sullen air denounced his humor to the shuddring fair go change your dress give up this vain delight i will not hear of masquerades tonight your chaperones informed she need not wait so change your dress and sit with me sedate as the proud dame whose avaricious glee built golden castles in the rich south sea gazed on her broker when he told her first her wealth was vanished and the bubble burst so gazed the nymph hearing her sire destroy her airy palace of ideal joy first her fond thoughts to flattering doubt incline and deem the harsh command no fixed design but the quick sally of a peevish word that love revokes the moment it is heard or happily mirth in mimic wrath expressed a feigned forbiddance uttered but in jest to this short hope her sinking spirit clung to see his softening eyes refute his tongue ah fruitless hope for there she cannot find the wellknown signals of the friendly mind stern contradiction with the frown of fate on his dark visage reigned in sullen state felt in each feature in each accent shown lowered in his look and thundered in his tone hence the warm bosom of the lively fair now shivers with the chill of blank despair now disappointments thickning shadows roll a cloud of horror over the darkened soul and fancy in a sick delirium tossed gives double value to each pleasure lost the blasted joys she labors to forget rush on her mind and waken keen regret her cheek turns pale  the tear prepares to start and palpitation heaves her swelling heart but here sophrosyne thy guardian aid saves from her potent foe the sinking maid her bosom into strong emotions thrown now feels the pressure of thy friendly zone swift thy kind cautions to her soul recur more quick to cancel faults than prone to err as the rough swell of the insurgent tides by the mild impulse of the moon subsides so by her mystic monitor represt the flood of passion leaves her lightened breast from her clear brain each cloudy vapor flies and joys bright ray rekindles in her eyes reviving gaiety full luster spread over all her features and with smiles she said let others drive to pleasures distant dome be mine the dearer joy to please at home scarce had she spoke when she with sportive ease pressed her pianofortes favorite keys over softest notes her rapid fingers ran sweet prelude to the air she thus began sophrosyne thou guard unseen whose delicate control can turn the discord of chagrin to harmony of soul above the lyre the lute above be mine thy melting tone which makes the peace of all we love the basis of our own so sung the nymph not uninspird the sprite invoked so fondly in the mystic rite with richest music swelled her warbling throat and gave new sweetness to her sweetest note as when the seraph uriel first begun his carol to the newcreated sun the sacred echo shook the vast profound and chaos perished at the potent sound so at the magic of serenas strain spleen vanished from her sires chaotic brain whose fibers lightened of that load rejoice in the dear accents of her dulcet voice much he inclines his mandate to recall and send the fair one to the promised ball but stubborn pride forbids him to revoke the solemn sentence which illhumour spoke still conscious of her power the nymph prolongs the soft enchantment of her soothing songs which his fond mind in firm attention keep to his fixed hour of supper and of sleep this now arrived the knight retiring shed a double blessing on his darlings head and with unusual exultation pressed his lovely child to his parental breast thus while to rest the happy sire withdrew the nymph more happy to her chamber flew and jenny now dismissed the grateful fair breathes to her guardian sprite this tender prayer thou kind preserver whose attentive zeal gives me in this contented hour to feel that dearest pleasure of a soul refined the triumph of the selfcorrected mind if happy in the strength thy smiles impart i own thy favor in no thankless heart still let me view thy form so justly dear still in kind visions to these eyes appear thy friendly dictates teach me to fulfill and let thy aid avert each future ill while fond devotion taught her thus to speak the soft down sinks beneath her lovely cheek and settling on her lips that sweetly close silence enamored lulls her to repose end of the second canto canto iii ye kind transporters of the excursive soul ye visions that when night enwraps the pole the lively wanderer to new worlds convey escaping from her heavy house of clay how could the gentle spirit foe to strife bear without you this coil of waking life its griefembitterd cares its joyless mirth and all the flat realities of earth it is you sweet phantoms who new powers inspire who give to beauty charms to fancy fire when soaring like the eagles kindred frame the poet dreams of everlasting fame or tickled by the feather of the dove the softer virgin dreams of endless love there was a time when fortunes bright decrees were seen to realize such dreams as these now dangerous visions the fond mind decoy vainly to hope for unexisting joy while belles and bards with mournful sighs exclaim mortality has seized both love and fame ah fair serena might the boast be ours to clear from such a charge these heavenly powers blessed might thy bard deserve in fame to see a guard as faithful as love proves to thee blessed if that airy being gild his life who saved thee trembling on the brink of strife and now kind prompter of thy nightly dream filled thy rapt spirit with her sacred beam for soon as slumber set thy soul at large thy guardian power revisited her charge and lightly hovering over the illumined bed thus with fond smiles of approbation said well have thou past sweet maid one trying scene one fiery ordeal of the tyrant spleen thus my serena may thy force sustain each harder trial that may yet remain against the fiend to fortify thy soul by useful knowledge of her dark control i come to show thee what no mortal eye save thine was ever permitted to descry the realms where spleens infernal agents goad the ghostly tenants of her drear abode now summon all thy strength throw fear aside and firmly trust in thy aetherial guide she spoke and through the nights surrounding shade the obedient nymph not unappalld conveyed through long long tracts of darkness on they past with speed that struck the trembling maid aghast till now recovering by degrees she found her soft foot press upon the solid ground encouraged by her guide at length she tries to search the gloomy scene with anxious eyes per me si va nella citta dolente per me si va nell eterno dolor per me si va tra la perduta gente lasciate ogni speranza voi ch intrate queste parole di color oscuro vid io scritte al sommo duna porta dante inferno   through me ye pass to spleens terrific dome through me to discontents eternal home through me to those who saddend human life by sullen humor or vexatious strife and here through scenes of endless vapors hurled are punished in the forms they plagued the world justly they feel no joy who none bestow all ye who enter every hope forego over an arched cavern rough with horrid stone on which a feeble light by flashes shone these characters that chilled her soul with dread serena fixed in silent wonder read as she began to speak her voice was drowned by the shrill echo of far other sound forth from the portal lamentable cries of wailing infants without number rise compassion to this poor and piteous flock led the soft maid still nearer to the rock the pining band within she now espied and touched with tender indignation cried how could these little forms of life so brief deserve this dire abode of lasting grief   well may thy gentle heart be sore concerned at sight so moving the mild sprite returned thou see in those whose wailings wound thy ears the puny progeny of modern peers their sires by avarice or ambition led aliens to love approached the nuptial bed with proud indifference and with cold distaste their homely brides reluctantly embraced and by such union gave disastrous birth to these poor pale encumbrances of earth who bred in vanity with pride their dower were spleens sure victims from their natal hour and in their splendid cradles pulled and pined till fate their illspun thread of life untwind and to this vestibule conveyed their ghosts to form the vanguard of the infernal hosts but let not pitys ineffectual charm impede thy progress or thy strength disarm follow and fear not guarded by my care from all the phantoms that around thee glare she spoke and entered ere the nymph replied a pass that opened in the caverns side low dark and rocky  with her body bent serena followed down the dire descent a sudden light soon struck her dazzled view but twas a light of such infernal hue as double horror to the darkness gave with dread reflection from a dusky wave round a black water tattered specter stand with each a tiny taper in its hand fierce mendicants who strive some alms to win from the fair wanderer with incessant din the guardian spirit saw serena grieve to hear of wants she knew not to relieve and to the generous nymph in pity cries the gulf of indolence before us lies over whose dull flood to which no bank is seen a boat must waft thee to the dome of spleen these pallid figures that around thee press and haunt thee with importunate distress on earth were beggars of each different class though blended here in one promiscuous mass the poor who spurned kind industrys control the rich who begged from penury of soul both by their abject pride alike debased blasphemed that nature which they both disgraced and hither by the sullen fiend conveyed here still they ply their ineffectual trade in chase of each new passenger they run condemned to beg from all to gain by none but from these wretches turn thy fruitless care behold the gulf before thee and beware nor touch the stream which mortal sense oercomes and by its baleful charm the soul benumbs   can mortal pass the shuddring nymph replied this sullen slow unnavigable tide in whose black current this enormous mound of shapeless stone appears this horrid bound that seems an everlasting guard to keep over the dull waters that beneath it creep while yet she spoke with a resounding shock forth from the arch of the impending rock which over the murmuring eddy hung so low the lazy river scarce had room to flow of rude construction and in roughest plight a boat now issued to serenas sight an empty boat that slowly to the shore advanced without the aid of sail or oar selfmovd it seemed but soon the nymph beheld a grizly figure who the stern impelled wading behind the horrid form appeared above the water his strong arm he reared and cross the creeping flood the crazy vessel steered the heavenly sprite observed her trembling ward whose growing fears the hideous pass abhorred and cheering thus she spoke this spectre boasts the chief dominion of these dreary coasts to him thy pilot without dread consign and place thy body in his bark supine so through this arching rock thou wilt pass alone safe from the perils of the incumbent stone embark undaunted  on the farther side thou wilt surely find me thy unfailing guide nor let this pilot raise thy groundless dread this sullen charon of the froward dead a phantom never blessed with human life though often on earth his noxious power is rife and in that region never from error free the words he dictates are assigned to me observe this fiend that nature scorned to frame offspring of pride and apathy his name passions he never can feel and never impart a miscreated imp without a heart in place of which his subtle parent pinned a bladder filled with circulating wind which seems with mimic life the mass to warm and gives false vigor to his bloated form but place thee in the boat his arms direct my love shall watch thee and my power protect so spoke the friendly sprite the obedient maid her form along the narrow vessel laid but oh what terrors shake her tender soul as from the shore the bark begins to roll and severed from her friend her eyes discern the steering spectre wading at the stern far stronger fears her resolution melt than those which erst the bard of florence felt when by the honored shade of virgil led through all the dreary circles of the dead hells fiercest demons threatened to divide the living poet from his shadowy guide and bade him friendless and alone return through the dire horrors of the dark sojourn not long the lovely fair ones terrors last for safely through the impending rock she past and slow advancing to the gloomy strand the sullen pilot brings her safe to land there fondly hovering on her guardian plumes the heavenly monitor her charge resumes and smiling leads along the rocky road whose windings open into spleens abode thou queen of shades whose spiritdamping spell too often is seen the poets pride to quell when the sharp workings of unrelishd wit plunge thy pale victim in a bilious fit may i unpunished by thy subtle power dare to display thy subterranean bower and to this wondering upper world explain the shadowy horrors of thy secret reign entering beneath a wide fantastic arch round the drear circuit of the dome they march which a pale flash from many a fiery sprite frequent illumes with intermitting light such as on earth to superstitions eye denounces ruin from the northern sky while she discerns amid the nightly glare armies embattled in the blazing air around the nymph unnumberd phantoms glide here swell the bloated race of bulky pride in close and horrid union there appear the wilder progeny of frantic fear misshapen monsters whose stupendous frame abhorrent nature has refused to name here in cameleon colors lightly flit the motley offspring of disordered wit all things prodigious the wide cave contained and forms beyond what fable ever feigned but as the worm that on the dewy green springs half to view and half remains unseen perceiving near its cell a human tread slinks back to earth and hides its timid head so where the heavenly spirit deigned to lead the startled specter from her step recede and as abashed they from her eye retire sink into mist or melt in fluid fire high on an ebon throne superbly wrought with each fierce figure of fantastic thought in a deep cove where no bright beam intrudes over her black schemes the sullen empress broods the shriekowls mingled with the ravens plume shed over her furrowed brows an aweful gloom a garb that glares with stripes of lurid flame wraps in terrific pomp her haggard frame round her a serpent as her zone is rolled which writhing stings itself in every fold near her pavilion in barbaric state four mutes the mandates of their queen await from sickly fancy bred by sullen sloth both parents curse yet pampered still by both first stands disease an hag of magic power varying her frightful visage every hour her horrors heightening as those changes last and each new form more hideous than the past detraction next a shapeless fiend appears whose shrivelled hand a misty mirror rears framed by malignant art the infernal toy inverts the lovely mien of smiling joy robs roseate beauty of attractive grace and gives a stepdames frown to natures face the third in place but with a fiercer air see the true gorgon disappointment glare by whose petrific power delights overthrown and hopes warm heart becomes an icy stone last in a gorgeous robe that ill bestowed bows her mean body by its cumbrous load stands fretful discontent of fiends the worst by dignity debased by blessings cursed who poisons pleasure with the sourest leaven and makes a hell of loves extatic heaven the guide celestial near this ghastly group perceived her tender charge with terror droop fear not sweet maid she cries my steps pursue nor gaze too long on this infernal crew turn from detractions fascinating glass in silence cross the throne observe and pass beyond this dome the palace of the queen her empire winds through many a dreary scene where she torments as their deserts require her various victims that on earth expire each class apart for in a different cell the fierce the fretful and the sullen dwell these shall thou slightly view in vapors hurled and swiftly then regain thy native world but first remark within that ample nich with every quaint device of splendour rich yon phantom who from vulgar eyes withdrawn appears to stretch in one eternal yawn of empire here he holds the tottering helm prime minister in spleens discordant realm the pillar of her spreading state and more her darling offspring whom on earth she bore for as on earth his wayward mother strayed grandeur with eyes of fire her form surveyed and with strong passion starting from his throne unloosd the sullen queens reluctant zone from his embrace conceived in moody joy rose the round image of a bloated boy his nurse was indolence his tutor pomp who kept the child from every childish romp they reared their nursling to the bulk you see and his proud parents called their imp ennui this realm he rules and in superb attire visits each earthly palace of his sire a thousand shapes he wears now pert now prim pursues each grave conceit or idle whim in arms in arts in government engages with monarchs poets politicians sages but drops each work the moment it is begun and trying all things can accomplish none yet over each rank and age and sex his sway spreads undiscerned and makes the world his prey the light coquet amid flirtation sighs to find him lurk in pleasures vain disguise and the grave nun discovers in her cell that holy water but augments his spell as the strange monster of the serpent breed that haunts as travelers tell the marshy mead devours each nobler beast though firmly grown to size and strength superior to his own  for on the grazing horse or larger bull subtly he springs of dark saliva full with swiftlydarting tongue his prey anoints with venom potent to dissolve its joints and while its bulk in liquid poison swims swallows its melting bone and fluid limbs  so this ennui this wonderworking elf can vanquish powers far mightier than himself nor wit nor science soar his reach above and often he seizes on successful love of all the radiant host who lend their aid to light mankind through lifes bewildering shade bright charity alone with cloudless ray may boast exemption from his baleful sway haste then sweet nymph nor let us longer roam round the drear circle of this dangerous dome lest even thy guide entangled in his spell should fail to guard thee from a fiend so fell so speaking the kind spirits anxious care led from the palace the attentive fair and winding through a passage dark and rude thus the mild monitor her speech renewed against fear and pity now thy bosom steel for sights more horrible i now reveal spleens tortured victims view with dauntless eyes for lo her penal realms before thee rise the nymph advancing saw with mute amaze a dismal deep enormous dungeon blaze stones of red fire the hideous wall composed and massive gates the horrid confine closed the infernal portress of this doleful dome with fiery lips that swelled with poisonous foam pale discord raged with whose tormenting tongue through all its caves the extensive region rung a living vulture was the furys crest and in her hand a rattlesnake she pressed whose angry joints incessantly were heard to sound defiance to the screaming bird the boundless depth of this dire prison holds the untamed spirits of imperious scolds nor think that females only fill the cave male termagants have lived and here they rave all of each sex are pent within this pale who knew no use of language but to rail thus to her charge exclaimed the heavenly guide and as she spoke the portals opened wide and to the observance of the shuddering maid the immeasurable den was all displayed but oh what various noises from within fill the next air with one stupendous din mournings deep groan and angers furious call terrors loud cry and affectations squall the sob of passion the hysteric scream and shrieks of frenzy in its fierce extreme in this wild uproar every sounds combined that stuns the senses and distracts the mind mark to the nymph sophrosyne began the fierce xantippe flaming in the van the vase she emptied on the sages head hangs over her own a different shower to shed for drop by drop distilling liquid fire it fills the vixen with new tropes of ire beyond the grecian dame extend your view and mark the spectre of a modern shrew she who whenever she dined with furious look spurned her nice food and bellowed at her cook here justly feels a culinary rack bound like ixion to a whirling jack but lo the tityus of this realm whose hulk is stretched supine and whose enormous bulk to such extent in this wide scene is spread nine acres seem too narrow for his bed this form was once but many years are past since in his civic furs he breathed his last lord mayor of london his whole life one treat and all his business but to rail and eat the circling group of fish and fowl and beasts once crowned his table and composed his feasts for all the creatures mark this strange event which he devoured with growling discontent over him their reunited limbs display the grumbling gluttons flesh they rend away and find his swelling form a neverfailing prey see where nine bucks have gored his monstrous haunch see fifty turkies gobble on his paunch over his broad side twelve creeping turtles spread and fowls unnumberd flutter round his head serena gazed but soon she turned away sick with disgust and shuddering with dismay to scenes less hideous let us now repair said the kind guard of the dejected fair and cheering her faint charge her step she led to the near dwelling of the fretful dead of dusky adamant the dungeon rose a dingy mirror its dark sides compose reflecting with a thousand quaint grimaces the pale inhabitants distorted faces here like a dame of quality arrayed sits peevishness presiding over the shade and frowning at her own uncomely mien whose coarse reflection on the wall is seen a snarling lapdog her right hand restrains her lap an infant porcupine contains which while her fondness tries its wrath to still wounds her each moment with a pointed quill the froward spirits here in durance fret whose testy life was one continued pet here they in trifles that vexation find which teased on earth their irritated mind observe the phantom who with eyes askance still to the mirror turns her eager glance while on her cheek at every anxious turn blushes of new mortification burn beauty for lasting bliss had formed the maid love to her arms his faithful homage paid but all this swelling tide of joy to check a fatal freckle rises on her neck her soft cosmetics the vexed nymph applies success attends her and the freckle dies but ah this victory avails her not she finds an hydra in the teazing spot fast as one flies another still succeeds and with eternal food her fretful humor feeds near to the nymph in a more moody fit see the pale phantom of a peevish wit mark with what frowns his eager eyes peruse wet from the press three critical reviews with wounded vanitys distracting rage how rapidly he runs through every page he finds some honors lavished on his verse and joys faint gleams his gloomy spirit pierce but oh too soon these feeble sparks decay and keen vexation reassumes her prey hating reproof in every fiber sore one censured particle torments him more more than a hundred happier lines delight which liberal favor condescends to cite but time will fail us if we pause to view the various torments of the testy crew these wretched chemists whose oerheated brain extracts from nothing a substantial pain yet ere to different districts we advance take of one fretful tribe a transient glance their unsuspected punishments supply a lesson useful to the female eye spleens liveliest agent here beguiles the gay fair to attract and flattering to betray as thus the kind aetherial guardian spoke within a rock whence plaintive murmurs broke she touched a secret spring whose power was such two jarring doors unfolded at the touch and with the charms of regal splendour bright a cheerful banquet sparkles to the sight viands so light so elegantly graced might tempt even temperance herself to taste for fruits alone composed the enticing treat fair to the eye and to the palate sweet in such bright juice the pear and cherry swim as make the topaz and the ruby

every heart allures smiles on the luster of her rich liqueurs her fatal smiles their utmost power exert to poison beauty at her dire dessert to blast the rose that healths bright cheek adorns and fill each festive heart with latent thorns for the sly fiend of every art possessed steals on the affection of her female guest and by her soft address seducing each eager she plies them with a brandy peach they with keen lip the luscious fruit devour but swiftly feel its peacedestroying power quick through each vein new tides of frenzy roll all evil passions kindle in the soul drive from each feature every cheerful grace and glare ferocious in the sallow face the wounded nerves in furious conflict tear then sink in blank dejection and despair effects more dire thus tempting to deceive the apple wrought not in the soul of eve however disguised in jelly or in jam spleen has no poison surer than a dram but haste we now the heavenly leader cries to where this penal worlds last wonder lies she spoke and led the nymph through deeper dells lowmurmuring vaults and horrorbreathing cells and now they pass a perforated cage where rancorous specter without number rage avert thine eye the heavenly spirit said nor view these abject tribes of envious dead who pined to hear the voice of truth proclaim a sisters beauty or a brothers fame though crowned with all prosperity imparts high in their various ranks and several arts yet meanly sunk by envys base control they died in that consumption of the soul and here through bars that twisted adders make and the long volumes of the envenomed snake over this dark road they dart an anxious eye still envying every fiend that flutters by pass and regard them not  the attentive maid in silent tremor the behest obeyed this dungeon crossed her weary feet she drags through winding caverns and over icy crags soulchilling damps in the dark passage reign which issues on a vast and dreary plain fanned by no breezes with no verdure crowned the black horizon is its only bound and now advancing in a drizzly mist through sullen phantoms hating to exist serena spies high over his subjects placed the ghastly tyrant of the gloomy waste murmuring he sits upon a rocking stone the unstable base of his illfounded throne hideous his face and horrible his frame misanthropy the grizly monsters name him to fierce pride with raging passion sore the frowning gorgon disappointment bore on earth detested and by heaven abhorred of this drear wild he reigns the moody lord few are the subjects of his waste domain and scarce a female

doomed in this dark region to abide some transient pains for hypocritic pride here everduring chains those scoffers bind whose writings deaden and debase the mind who mock creation with injurious scorn and feel a fancied void in plentys horn in his right hand an emblem of his cares a branch of aconite the monarch bears and those sour phantoms who this region haunt he feeds with berries from this deadly plant for strange to tell though severed from its root the bough still blackens with successive fruit the tribes who taste it burst into a fit of raving mockery and rancorous wit and pleased their tyrants ghastly smile to court by vile distortions make him various sport the frantic rabble who his sway confess before his throne an hideous puppet dress when in unseemly rags they have arrayed the image from their own dark semblance made in horrid gambols round their work they throng with antic dance and rude discordant song satires rank offals on the block they fling and call it nature to delight their king while in their features he exults to see the frowns of torture mixed with grins of glee for as these abject toils engage the crew their own grim idol darkens to their view wide and more wide its horrid stature spreads and over the tribe new consternation sheds for each forgets in his bewildered gaze it is but a monster which he helped to raise as over its form their dizzy glances roll it strikes a chearless damp through all the soul vainly to shun the baleful sight they try it draws for ever the reluctant eye at each review with deeper dread they start a colder chaos numbs each freezing heart no mutual confidence no friendly care relieves the panic they are doomed to bear for as they shrink absorbed in wild affright when each to each inclines his wounded sight they feel for social comfort sour disgust and all the sullen anguish of distrust now mark serena the mild guide began the proudest phantom of the gloomy clan appointed by this surly monarchs grace high priest of all his misanthropic race see over the crowd a throne of vapors lift that strange and motley form the shade of swift now shall thou view the guardian sprite pursues his horrid penance that each day renews perchance its terrors may overwhelm thy sense but trust my care to bear thee safely hence as thus she spoke above the gazing throng high in a sailing cloud the spectre swept along vain of his power of elocution proud in mystic language he harangud the crowd the bounds he marked with measure so precise of equine virtue and of human vice that cursing natures gifts without remorse each sullen hearer wished himself a horse pleased with the pure effect his sermon wrought the ambitious priest a rich tiara caught which hovering over his highaspiring head sarcastic humor dangled by a thread the rich tiara for his temples fit blazed with each polished gem of brilliant wit and sharpfacd irony his darling sprite who raised her patron to this giddy height fast on his brow the dangerous honor bound but in the moment that her priest was crowned his airy throne dissolved and thunder rent the ground forth from the yawning earth with lightnings speed sprung the fierce phantom of a fiery steed spurring his sides whence bloody poison flowed the ghastlygrinning fiend derision rode in her right hand a horrid whip she shakes whose sounding lash was formed of knotted snakes an uncouth bugle her left hand displayed from a gray monkeys skull by malice made as her distorted lips this whistle blew forth rushed the spectre of a wild yahoo see the poor wit in hasty terror spring and fly for succor to his grizzly king in vain his piercing cries that succor court the grizzly king enjoys the cruel sport behold the fierce yahoo her victim caught drive her sharp talons through the seat of thought that copious fountain which too well supplied perverted ridicules malignant tide quick from her steed the grinning fiend descends from the pierced skull the spleenful brain she rends to black misanthropy her ghastly king see the keen hag this horrid present bring her daily gift for as each day arrives her destined victim for new death revives the huntress now this direst pageant past on her wild bugle blew so dread a blast the sharp sound pierced through all the depths of hell the fiends all answered in one hideous yell and in a fearful trance the soft serena fell hence from the lovely nymph her senses fled till through the parted curtains of her bed the amorous sun who now began to rise kissed with a sportive beam her opening eyes end of the third

from the dark domain of spleen springs with new warmth to thy attractive scene once more i bless thy pleasurebreathing gale and gaze enchanted on thy flowery vale where smiling innocence and ardent youth sport hand in hand with beauty and with truth sport on sweet revellers in rosy bowers safe from the intrusion of all evil powers ah fruitless wish of the benignant muse which to this checkered

galldistilling cloud the sportive form of innocence to shroud beautys young train her baleful eyes survey to mark the fairest as her favorite prey hence sweet serena while thy spirit strayed round the deep realms of subterranean shade this keenest agent of the infernal powers on earth was busied in those tranquil hours to blast thy peace and poisoned darts to aim against the honor of thy spotless name for scandal restless fiend who never knows the balmy blessing of an hours repose worn yet unsated with her daily toil in her base work consumes the midnight oil over fiercer fiends when heavy slumbers creep when wearied avarice and ambition sleep scandal is vigilant and keen to spread the plagues that spring from her prolific head on truths fair basis she her falsehood builds with tinsel

intent that dullness could not miss the name she meant in satires tints the injured fair she drew in form an angel but in soul a jew it chanced her sire among his friends enrolled a wealthy senator

that sportive wit which heals the folly that it deigns to hit would often the sickness of his soul beguile and teach the sullen humorist to smile pleased by her virtuous frolics to assuage the mental anguish of distempered age this ancient friend in a sarcastic sketch was marked by scandal as a monied wretch for whom the young yet mercenary fair had subtly spread a matrimonial snare with such base matter more diffusely wrought the spiritpiercing paragraph was fraught over which with glee the eye of scandal glard which for the opening press herself prepared she on the types her inky wad let fall and smeared each letter with her bitterest gall the press whose ready gripe the charge receives stamps it successive on ten thousand leaves which pild in heaps impatient seem to lie they only wait the dawn of day to fly now as the trembling child which long has laid mute in the dark and of itself afraid when happily conscious of the pain it feels the watchful mother to its pillow steals springs to her breast and shakes off all alarms feeling its safety in her fostering arms with such quick joy in innocence as young the soft serena from her pillow sprung pleased to awake from her terrific dream and feel the cheerful suns returning beam eager she rose in busy thought nor staid the wonted summons of her punctual maid and as her own fair hands adjust her vest the guardian cincture flutters on her breast for fondly when she waked or when she slept still round her heart the important zone she kept thou happy girdle to thy charge be just firm be thy threads and faithful to their trust for

with sudden flight with late wings hovered over the good old knight and the chill circle of the lone saloon informs the shivering maid she rose too soon it is true attentive johns unfailing care began the rites of breakfast to prepare but yet no fires on the cold altar burn no smoke arises from the silver urn and the blank teaboard where no viands lay only supplied the paper of the day though mild serenas peacedevoted mind the keen debate of politics declined and heard with cold contempt or generous hate the frauds of party and the lies of state nor cared much more for fashions loose intrigues than factious bickerings or foreign leagues yet while she saunters idle and alone her careless eyes are on the paper thrown as some gay youth whom sportive friends engage to view the furious ourang in his cage if while amused he sees the monster grin and trusts too careless to the bolts within if the sly beast as near the grate he draws tear him unguarded with projected paws starts at the wound and feels his bosom thrill with pain and wonder at the sudden ill so did serena start so wildly gaze in such mixed pangs of anguish and amaze feeling the wound which scandal had designed to lacerate her mild and modest mind startled as one who from electric wire unheeding catches unsuspected fire she reads then almost doubts that she has read and thinks some vision hovers round her head now her fixed eye some striking words confine and now she darts it thrice through every line nor could amazement more her senses shake had every letter been a gorgons snake now rising indignation takes its turn and her flushed cheeks with tingling blushes burn with restless motion and with many a frown through the wide room she paces up and down now musing makes a momentary stand the fatal paper fluttering in her hand so the shy bird by cruel sportsmen sprung and by their random fire severely stung scared not disabled by the distant wound now trembling flies now skims along the ground now vainly tries in some sequestered spot from her gored breast to shake the galling shot ye tender nymphs whose kindling souls would flame touched like serenas by injurious blame o let your quick and kindred spirits form a vivid picture of the mental storm in which she labored and whose force to paint the muses strongest tints appear too faint in sympathetic thought her suffering see but o for ever from such wrongs be free her faithful girdle tried its power to save and often a monitory impulse gave still unregarded still unfelt it pressed with useless energy her heaving breast her mind forgetful of the magic zone full of the burning shaft by scandal thrown with blended notes of sorrow and disdain thus in disordered language vents its pain  had malice dared my honor to defame the selfrefuted lie had lost its aim but here the world deceived by slandrous art must think serena has a venal heart a venal heart at that detested sound in swelling anguish her sunk voice was drowned now was a fearful crisis of her fate distended now by passions growing weight and for its mistress filled with conscious dread the magic girdle cracked through every thread and snappd perchance by scandals force accursed from her full heart the guardian zone had burst and spite of all the virtues of the fair the spell of happiness had sunk in air but that sophrosyne whose friendly fear timely foresaw this trial too severe an early succor gained from secret love from the fell kite to snatch the falling dove as nature studies in her wide domain to blend some antidote with every bane thus her kind aid the friendly power contrived that from the quarter whence the wound arrived there flowed the anguish of that wound to calm a soothing soft and medicinal balm as in her agitated hand the fair waved the loose paper with disordered air in capitals she saw serena flame she blushed she shudderd as she viewed the name her ready fears subside in new surprise and eager thus she reads with lightened eyes  go faithful sonnet to serena say what charms peculiar in her features reign a stranger whom her glance may never survey pays her this tribute in no flattering strain tell her the bard in beautys ample reign has seen a virgin cheek as richly glow a bosom where the blue meandring vein sheds as soft luster through the lucid snow eyes that as brightly flash with joy and youth and locks that like her own luxuriant flow then say for then she cannot doubt thy truth that the wide earth no female form can show where natures legend so distinctly tells in this fair shrine a fairer spirit dwells with curious wonder the reviving maid viewed this fond homage to her beauty paid a second glance over every line she cast and half pronounced and half suppressed the last while modest pleasure and ingenuous pride her burning cheek with deeper crimson died o praise thy language was by heaven designed as manna to the faint bewildered mind beauty and diffidence whose hearts rejoice in the kind comfort of thy cheering voice in this wild wood of life were thou not nigh must like the wandering babes lie down and die but thy sweet accents wake new vital powers and make this thorny path a path of flowers as oil on oceans troubled waters spread smooths the rough billow to a level bed the soothing rhyme thus softened into rest the painful tumult of serenas breast now to herself restored the conscious maid the lurking fiends insidious snare surveyed her nerves with grateful trepidation own a slighter pressure from the faithful zone and in fond thought she breathes a thankful prayer for her aetherial guardians constant care yet with a keen desire her bosom glowed to hear from whom the gentle sonnet flowed but kind sophrosyne who watched unseen to shield her votary from the wiles of spleen as friendly love had fixed a future time when to reveal the secret of the rhyme strove till that hour her fancy to restrain nor let her anxious wishes rise to pain as gaietys fresh tide began to roll fast in the swelling channel of her soul the good old knight descends though eager slow the gout still tingling in his tender toe and now paternal salutations past his eyes he keenly on the paper cast while his sweet daughter with attentive grace before him flies his ready cup to place for tea and politics alternate share in friendly rivalship his morning care though smooth as oil the knights good humor flows when the mild breeze of pleasant fortune blows yet quick to catch the casual sparks of ire like oil it kindles into mountain fire and fiercely now his flaming spirit blazed while on those galling words he wildly gazed whose force had almost worked into a storm the gentler elements in beautys form as the sarcastic sentence caught his view back from the board his elbowchair he drew and by sharp stings of sudden fury pricked far from his foot his gouty stool he kicked fierce as achilles by atrides stung he poured the stream of vengeance from his tongue but ah those angry threats he deigned to speak had sounds alas far differing from the greek rage from his lips in legal language broke of juries and of damages he spoke and on the printers lawdevoted head he threatened deep revenge in terms most dread terms that with pain the ear of beauty pierce and oaths too rough to harmonize in verse while thus the good old knight with passion hot his toast neglected and his tea forgot the discord of the drama to increase now prim penelope assails her niece for as sir gilbert now with choler dumb points her the period with his angry thumb ah brother cries the stiff malignant crone her sharp eye swiftly through the sentence thrown scandal could never rise to heights like this but from the manners of each modern miss had but my niece less giddy and more grave observed the prudent hints i often gave   the honest knight her vile conclusion saw and quick curtailed it with a testy pshaw mean while the gentle maid who heard the taunt surveyed without a frown her prudish aunt far other thoughts employed her softer mind to one sweet purpose all her soul inclined how she might close the unpleasant scene how best restore good humor to her fathers breast her airy guardian with delight surveyed these tender wishes in the lovely maid and to accomplish what her heart desired trains of new thought above her age inspired as venus on her sons enlightened face shed richer charms and more attractive grace when issuing forth from the dissolving cloud his bright form burst on the admiring crowd so kind sophrosyne unseen supplies a livelier radiance to serenas eyes and ere she speaks to captivate her sire touches her lips with patriotic fire it chanced that tossed upon a vacant chair a volume of that wit lay near the fair whose value tried by fashions varying touch once rose too high and now is sunk too much the book which fortune placed within her reach contained o chesterfield the liberal speech in which thy spirit like an attic sage strove to defend the violated stage from fetters basely forged by ministerial rage from this the nymph her useful lesson took and thus began reclining on the book  if on this noble lord we may rely scandal is but a speck on freedoms eye and public spirit then will rather bear the casual pain it gives by growing there than by a rash attempt to move it thence hazard the safety of a precious sense and by the efforts of a vain desire rob this lifedarting eye of all its fire though the soft breast of innocence may smart by cruel calumnys corroding dart yet would she rather ache in every nerve and bear those pangs she knows not to deserve much rather than be made a senseless tool to aid the frenzy of tyrannic rule or forge one dangerous bolt for power to aim at sacred libertys superior frame  as ancient chiefs were wont of old to gaze with eyes of tender awe and fond amaze on the fair priestess of the delphic fane when first she uttered her prophetic strain entranced in wonder thus sir gilbert viewed his child yet more inspired who thus pursued for me i own these lines with gall replete shot through my simple heart a sudden heat but happier thoughts my rising rage represt and turned the pointless insult to a jest and o should slander still new wrath awake still may my father for his daughters sake disdain the vengeance of litigious strife and let serenas answer be  her life she ended with a smile whose magic flame shot youthful vigor through her fathers frame his age his anger and his gout are fled enchanting girl with tears of joy he said enchanting girl twice echoed from his tongue as speaking from his elbowchair he sprung come to thy fathers arms  by heaven thou art his own true offspring and a whig in heart he spoke and his fond arms around her curled with proud grasp seeming to infold the world her conscious heart she feels with triumph beat and joys to find that triumph is complete for stiff penelope who near them stood albeit unused to the melting mood squeezed from her eyelid one reluctant tear and softened with a smile her brow severe but twas a smile of such a gloomy grace as lightened once upon alectos face when orpheus past her leading back to life from plutos regions his recovered wife when love connubial joined to musics spell moistened with tender joy the eyes of hell far other smiles with pleasures softest air gild the gay features of the youthful fair she looks like sportive spring when her young charms wind round her hoary sires reluctant arms and by a frolic infantine embrace banish the rugged frown from winters face through the long day she felt the glowing tide of exultation through her bosom glide and often she wished for slowapproaching night to hold sweet converse with her guardian sprite at length the hour approached her heart desired and in her lonely chamber now retired her tender fancy gave the fondest scope to ardent gratitude and eager hope dear airy being the soft nymph exclaimed whose power can break the spell that spleen has framed can by the waving of thy sightless wing over darkest forms a golden radiance fling and make in minds by sorriest thoughts perplexed this moments grief the triumph of the next i bless thy succor in each trial past be present still and save me in the last thus with her lovely eyes devoutly fixed where rays of hope and fear and reverence mixed the tender fair her faithful guard addressed then with her cheek her downy pillow pressed but long her wakeful lids refuse to close for curiosity dispels repose her busy mind the mystic veil would pierce that hides the author of the pleasing verse her lips involuntary catch the chime and half articulate the soothing rhyme till weary thought no longer watch can keep but sinks reluctant in the folds of sleep end of the fourth canto canto v why art thou fled o blessed poetic time when fancy wrought the miracles of rhyme when darting from her starencircled throne her poets eye commanded worlds unknown when by her fiat made a mimic god he saw existence waiting on his nod and at his pleasure into being brought new shadowy hosts the vassals of his thought in joys gay garb in terrors dread array darker than night and brighter than the day who at his bidding through the wilds of air raised willing mortals far from earthly care and led them wondering through his wide domain beyond the bounds of natures narrow reign while their rapt spirits in the various flight shook with successive thrills of new delight return sweet season graced with fictions flowers let not cold system cramp thy genial powers shall mild morality in garb uncouth the housewife garb of plain and homely truth robbed by stern method of her rosy crown chill her faint votaries by a wintry frown no thou sweet friend of man as suits thee best shine forth in fables richembroiderd vest o make my verse thy vehicle thy arms to spread over social life thy potent charms and thou sophrosyne mysterious sprite if happily i may trace thy steps aright roving through paths untrod by mortal feet to paint for human eyes thy heavenly seat shed on my soul some portion of that power which saved serena in the trying hour to bear those trials which however hard as bards all tell us may befall the bard the fops pert jest the critics frown severe learnings proud cant with envys artful sneer and the vexed poets last and worst disgrace his cold blank booksellers rhymefreezing face hence ye dark omens that to spleen belong ye shall not check the current of my song while beautys lovely race for whom i sing fire my warm hand to strike the ready string as quiet now her lightest mantle laid over the still senses of the sleeping maid her nightly visitant her faithful guide descends in all her empyrean pride that fairy shape no more she deigns to wear whose light foot smooths the furrow ploughd by care in mortal faces while her tiny spear gives a kind tingle to the cautioned ear now in her nobler shape of heavenly size she strikes her votarys soul with new surprise joves favorite daughter armed in all his powers appeared less brilliant to the attending hours when on the golden car of juno raised in heavenly pomp the queen of battles blazed with all her luster but without the dread which from her arm the frowning gorgon shed sophrosyne descends with guardian love to waft her gentle ward to worlds above from her fair brow a radiant diadem rose in twelve stars and every separate gem shot magic rays of virtue to control some passion hostile to the human soul round her sweet form a robe of ether flowed and in a wondrous car the smiling spirit rode firm as pure ivory it charmed the sight with finer polish and a softer white the hand of beauty with an easy swell scoopd the free concave like a bending shell and on its rich exterior art displayed the triumphs of the power the car conveyed here in celestial tints surpassing life sat lovely gentleness disarming strife there young affection born of tender thought in rosy chains the fiercer passions caught ambition with his scepter snapt in twain and avarice scorning what his chests contain round the tame vulture flies the fearless dove soft innocence embraces playful love and laughing sport the frolic child of air buries in flowers the sinking form of care these figures pencild with a touch so light that every image seemed an heavenly sprite breathe on the car whose sightenchanting frame four wheels sustain of pale and purple flame for no fleet animals to earth unknown bear through aetherial fields this flying throne as by the subtle electricians skill globes seem to fly obedient to his will so these four circles of instinctive fire move by the impulse of their queens desire mount or descend by her directing care or rest supported by the buoyant air now springing from her car that hovering staid high in the chamber of the sleeping maid the goddess with a voice divinely clear breathed these kind accents in her votarys ear  come my fair champion who so well have fought the useful battles of contentious thought to aid thy gentle spirit to sustain the final conflict of thy destined pain view the rewards that in my realms of bliss wait the sweet victor in such war as this so happily may thy mind with strength renewed the dark devices of the fiend elude by one blessed effort seal thy triumphs past and gain thy promised guerdon in the last as thus she spoke her heavenly arms embraced and in the car the conscious maiden placed quick at her wish the flaming wheels ascend no clouds impede them wheresoeer they bend as through the empire of the winds they rushed the winds were all in mute submission hushed and now serena from the exalted car looked down astonished on each sinking star flying over lucid orbs whose distant light yet has not reached the scope of human sight and now not distant from the bounds of space the guardian sprite suspends their rapid race and while in deep amaze the nymph admires the circling meteors inoffensive fires pleased at her wonder the mild power addressed with kind intelligence her earthly guest  of those three orbs that in yon crystal sphere a separate system in themselves appear the last whose luminous and steady form shines softly bright and moderately warm contains my palace and the gentle train whom i have wafted to this pure domain at equal distance my dominions lie from these two larger worlds more near thine eye observe their difference as our wheels advance and passing take of each a transient glance so speaking to the grosser globe she sprung her car suspended over its surface hung in heavy air for round this orb was rolled a circling vapor dull and damp and cold here says sophrosyne those beings dwell who wanted soul to act or ill or well who saunterd thoughtless through their mortal time without a care a virtue or a crime here still they saunter in this languid scene but pass the dozing crowd and mark their queen and now slow riding on a tortoise back her features lifeless and each fiber slack full in their view the nymph indifference came the quick serena soon perceived her name for as in solemn creeping state she rode in her lax hand she held fair grevilles ode never did the muse from her sweet treasure cull incense so precious for a power so dull still as she moved along her even way the heavy goddess tried to read the lay but at each pause her inattentive eye strayed from the paper which she held awry nor could her lips a single line repeat though the soft verse most ravishingly sweet through times dull ear will lasting pleasure spread and charm the poppy from oblivions head thus like a city mayor whose heavy barge steers its dull progress at the public charge this power so cumberd by her empires weight makes her slow circuit round her sluggish state around her tribes of rambling skeptics crawl though moving dubious if they move at all before her languid pomp her marshal creeps whose hand her banner half unfolded keeps its quaint device her dull dominion spoke  an eagle numbed by the torpedos stroke enough of scenes so foreign to thy soul sophrosyne exclaimed from this dark goal pass we to regions opposite to this she spoke and darting over the wide abyss her car like lightning in soft flashes hurled shot to the confines of a clearer world now lovelier views the virgins mind absorb for now they hovered over a lucid orb here the soft air luxuriantly warm imparts new luster to serenas form her eyes with more expressive radiance speak and richer roses open on her cheek here as she gazed she felt in every vein a blended thrill of pleasure and of pain yet every object opening to her view her quick regard with soft attraction drew sophrosyne who saw the gentle fair lean over these confines with peculiar care smiled at the tender interest she displayed and spoke regardful of the pensive maid well may thou bend over this congenial sphere for sensibility is sovereign here thou see her train of sprightly damsels sport where the soft spirit holds her rural court but fix thine eye attentive to the plain and mark the varying wonders of her reign as thus she spoke she poised her airy seat high over a plain exhaling every sweet for round its precincts all the flowers that bloom filled the delicious air with rich perfume and in the midst a verdant throne appeared in simplest form by graceful fancy reared and decked with flowers not such whose flaunting dies strike with the strongest tint our dazzled eyes but those wild herbs that tenderest fibers bear and shun the approaches of a damper air here stood the lovely ruler of the scene and beauty more than pomp announcd the queen the bending snowdrop and the briarrose the simple circle of her crown compose roses of every hue her robe adorn except the insipid rose without a thorn through her thin vest her heightened beauties shine for earthly gauze was never half so fine of that enchanting age her figure seems when smiling nature with the vital beams of vivid youth and pleasures purple flame gilds her accomplished work the female frame with rich luxuriance tender sweetly wild and just between the woman and the child her fair left arm around a vase she flings from which the tender plant mimosa springs toward its leaves over which she fondly bends the youthful fair her vacant hand extends with gentle motion anxious to survey how far the feeling fibers own her sway the leaves as conscious of their queens command successive fall at her approaching hand while her soft breast with pity seems to pant and shrinks at every shrinking of the plant around their sovereign on the verdant ground sweet airy forms in mystic measures bound the mighty master of the revel love in notes more soothing than his mothers dove prompts the soft strain that melting virgins sing or sportive trips around the frolic ring coupling with radiant wreaths of lambent fire fair fluttering hope and rapturous desire unnumberd damsels different charms display pensive with bliss or in their pleasures gay and the wide prospect yields one touching sight of tender yet diversified delight but the bright triumphs of their joy to check in the clear air there hangs a dusky speck it swells  it spreads  and rapid as it grows over the gay scene a chilling shadow throws the soft serena who beheld its flight suspects no evil from a cloud so light for harmless round her the thin vapors wreath not hiding from her view the scene beneath but ah too soon with pitys tender pain she saw its dire effect over all the plain sudden from thence the sounds of anguish flow and joys sweet carols end in shrieks of woe the withered flowers are fallen that bloomed so fair and poison all the pestilential air from the rent earth dark demons force their way and make the sportive revellers their prey here gloomy terror with a shadowy rope seems like a turkish mute to strangle hope there jealous fury drowns in blood the fire that sparkled in the eye of young desire and lifeless love lets merciless despair from his crushed frame his bleeding pinions tear but pangs more cruel more intensely keen wound and distract their sympathetic queen with fruitless tears she over their misery bends from her sweet brow the thorny rose she rends and bowed by griefs insufferable weight frantic she curses her immortal state the soft serena as this curse she hears feels her bright eye suffusd with kindred tears and her kind breast where quick compassion swelled shared in each bitter suffering she beheld the guardian power surveyed her lovely grief and spoke in gentle terms of mild relief for this soft tribe thy heaviest fear dismiss and know their pains are transient as their bliss rapture and agony in natures loom have formed the changing tissue of their doom both interwoven with so nice an art no power can tear the twisted threads apart yet happier these to natures heart more dear than the dull offspring in the torpid sphere where her warm wishes and affections kind lose their bright current in the stagnant mind here grief and joy so suddenly unite that anguish serves to sublimate delight she spoke and ere serena could reply the vapor vanished from the lucid sky the nymphs revive the shadowy fiends are fled the newborn flowers a richer fragrance shed the gentle ruler of the changeful land smiling resumed her symbol of command replacd the roses of her regal wreath still trembling at the thorns that lurk beneath but to her wounded subjects quick to pay the tender duties of imperial sway their wants she succored they her wish obeyed and all recovered by alternate aid while on the lovely queens enchanting face departed sorrows faint and fainter trace gave to each touching charm a more attractive grace now laughing sport from the enlightened plain cleared with quick foot the vestiges of pain the gay scene grows more beautifully bright than when it first allured serenas sight still her fond eyes over all the prospect range flashing sweet pleasure at the blissful change her curious thoughts with fond attachment burn yet more of this engaging land to learn she finds the chief attendants of the queen sweet females wafted from our human scene but as it chanced while all the realm revived a spirit masculine from earth arrived two airy guides conduct the gentle shade genius in robes of braided flames arrayed and a fantastic nymph in manners nice profusely decked with many an odd device sister of him whose luminous attire flashes with unextinguishable fire like him in features in her look as wild and singularity by mortals styled the eager queen and all her smiling court surround the welcome shade in gentle sport for in their new associate all rejoice all pant to hear the accents of his voice though over his frame the armenian robe was flung the pleasing stranger spoke the gallic tongue but in that language his enchanting art inspired new energy that seized the heart in terms so eloquent so sweetly bold a story of disastrous love he told convulsed with sympathy the listening train at every pause with dear delicious pain entreat him to renew the fascinating strain and now serena with suspended breath listened and caught the tale of julias death and quick she cries ere tears had time to flow blessed be this hour for now i see rousseau fondly she gazed till the enchanting sound in such a potent spell her spirit bound that lost in sweet illusion she forgot the promised scenes of the sublimer spot till now her mild remembrancer whose care strayed not a moment from the mortal fair roused her rapt mind preparing her to meet the brighter wonders of her blissful seat while her instinctive cars obedient frame now upward rose like undulating flame as when some victor on the watery world bright honor gilding all his sails unfurled steers into port while to the laughing sky his streamers tell his triumph as they fly expecting thousands line the crowded strand swell the glad voice or wave the joyous hand pressing to view the sight their vows implored and hail their glory and their strength restored so the blessed beings of this smiling scene flocked round the car of their returning queen the radiant car from which they now alight careful she gives to a selected sprite a nymph of snowy vest and lovely frame fidelity her fair and spotless name then happy to review her hallowed home leads her sweet guest to her celestial dome gentlest of powers for every purpose fit to strengthen wisdom and embellish wit  thou whose soft arts possessed by thee alone can give to virtues voice a sweeter tone allay the frost of age or fire of youth and lend attraction to severest truth improve even beauty by thy graceful ease or teach deformity herself to please  inspire the bard whose just ambition pants to guide weak mortals to thy heavenly haunts grant him in notes that like thy soft control allure attention and possess the soul grant him to show in luminous display the mystic wonders of thy secret sway now at the sight of the presiding power wide spread the gates of a stupendous tower on whose firm height commanding natures bound the faithful warder of the fort they found wakeful intelligence a trusty sprite whose eyes are piercing as the solar light and ever on the watch to sound alarm if aught of dusky hue portending harm should in defiance of her mandate dare approach the palace of the imperial fair within his ward magnificently great lies the rich armoury that guards her state here stands convictions strong and lucid spear whose touch annihilates suspense and fear here truths unsullied adamantine shield which save sophrosyne no power can wield and reasons trenchant blade of blazing steel its edge and polish formed by friendly zeal and not less sure their destined mark to hit pointed by virtues hand the shafts of wit and ridicules strong bolt whose stunning blow lays towering vice and fearless folly low here too the goddess kept in mystic state those sweet rewards that on her champions wait guerdons more precious than triumphant palms  the glance of gratitude for mental alms peaces soft kiss and reconcilements tear and smiles of sympathy are treasured here these precincts past now hand in hand they came to the rich fabric of majestic frame instant with joy their sovereign to behold the gates of massive adamant unfold and as the gentlymoving valves unclose mysterious music from their motion flows the airy notes through all the palace roam and dulcet echoes fill the festive dome a gorgeous hall amazed serenas eyes compared to which in splendour strength and size the noblest works of which tradition sings judaic shrine or seat of memphian kings would seem more humble than the waxen cell in which the skilful be is proud to dwell here sits a power in whose angelic face beauty is sweetened by maternal grace her radiant seat surpassing mortal art supports an emblem of her liberal heart a pelican who rears her callow brood and from her vitals seems to draw their food around this spirit flock a filial host who bless her empire and her guidance boast here every science all the arts attend in her they hail their parent and their friend each to her presence brings the happy few whose dearest glory from her favor grew here in her simple charms with youthful fire proud to display the magic of her lyre soulsoothing harmony presents her band beside her orpheus and amphion stand here mild philosophy whose thoughtful frown is sweetly shaded by her olive crown in all her attic elegance arrayed strong to convince and gentle

every science vital strength imparts and rears the circle of the social arts with such solicitude she gives to each powers of sublimer aim and wider reach and now sophrosyne who near her pressed thus spoke her title to her earthly guest  behold the honored form without whose aid my strength must vanish and my glory fade source of my being and my lifes support eunoia called in this celestial court benevolence the name she bears on earth the guard of weakness and the friend of worth she ended and the mild maternal form embraced serena with a smile as warm as the gay spirit vegetation wears when she to crown her favorite nymph prepares when pleased her flowery treasures to display she pours them in the lap of youthful may but how serena how may human speech thy heavenly raptures in this moment reach if aught of earthly sentiment may vie with the pure joy these happy scenes supply it is when unmixt with trouble and with pain love glides in secret through the glowing vein when some fond youth unconscious of its fire free from chill fear and turbulent desire with every thought absorbed in soft delight sees all creation in his fair ones sight and feels a blissful state without a name repose of soul with harmony of frame so plunged in pleasure of the purest kind serena gazed on the maternal mind gazed till sophrosynes directing aid thus summoned to new sights the obedient maid  haste my fair charge for of this ample state tracts yet unseen thy visitation wait the pressing hours forbid me to unfold each separate province which these confines hold but i will lead thee to that blissful crew whose kindred spirits best deserve thy view so speaking her attentive guest she led through scenes that still increasing wonder bred wherever she trod through all her gorgeous seat soft music echoed from beneath her feet passing a portal on whose lucid stone emblems of innocence and beauty shone they reach a lawn with verdant luster bright and view the bowers of permanent delight no fiery sun here forms a scorching noon no baleful meteor gleams no chilling moon but from a latent source one soothing light whose constant rays repel the mist of night though tender cheerful and though warm serene gives lasting beauty to the lovely scene no sensual thought this paradise profanes for here tried excellence in triumph reigns benignant cares eternal joy supply and bliss angelic beams in every eye in yon three groups the leading spirit cried my favorite females see my fairest pride the first in rank is that distinguished train whose strength of soul was tried by hymens chain though beauty blessed their form and love their guide their nuptial band with happiest omens tied beauty and love they felt may lose the art to fix inconstant mans eccentric heart yet conscious of their lords neglected vow no virtue frowned outrageous on their brow to keep returning tenderness aloof by coarse upbraiding and despised reproof with sorrow smothered in attractions smile they strove the sense of misery to beguile and from wild passions perilous abyss lure the lost wanderer back to faithful bliss see mild octavia over this band preside voluptuous antonys neglected bride whose feeling heart with all a mothers care reared the young offspring of a rival fair far other trials raised yon lovely crew though in connubial scenes their merit grew it was their chance ere judgment was mature when glittering toys the infant mind allure following their parents avaricious rule to wed with hopes of bliss a wealthy fool when time removed delusions veil by stealth and showed the drear vacuity of wealth when sad experience proved the bitter fate of beauty coupled to a senseless mate these gentle wives still gloried to submit these though invited by alluring wit refused in paths of lawless joy to range nor murmured at the lot they could not change but with a lively sweetness unopprest by a dull husbands lamentable jest their constant rays of gay good humor spread a guardian glory round their idiots head the next in order are those lovely forms whose patience weathered all paternal storms by filial cares the minds unfailing test well have they earned these seats of blissful rest they unrepining at severe restraint peevish commands and undeserved complaint bent with unwearied kindness to appease each fancied want of querulous disease gave up those joys which youthful hearts engage to watch the weakness of parental age such are these gentle tribes the happy few who share the triumph to their victory due angelic aims their spotless minds employ and fill their measure of unchequerd joy behold where some with generous ardor wait around yon seer who holds the book of fate those aweful leaves with eager glance they turn thence with celestial zeal they fondly learn what dangers threaten through the vale of earth their kindred pilgrims ere they rise to birth to earth they still invisibly descend in that dark scene congenial minds defend from pleasures bud drive spleens corroding worm and in my votaries heart my power confirm delights more calm yon listening band employ who deeply drink of intellectual joy see them around that speaking

fairest flowers of human wit whatever genius in his happiest hour has penned of moral grace and comic power to warm the heart the spells of spleen unbind and pour gay sunshine over the misty mind teach men to cherish their fraternal tie and view kind nature with a filial eye this active spirit catches in her flight skilled to retain and happy to recite here she delivers each bright work and each derives new beauty from her graceful speech warpt by no envy by no love misled equal she holds the living and the dead alike rehearsing as they claim their turn the song of anstey and the tale of stern but morning calls thee hence  yet one scene more my fostering love shall lead thee to explore this thy last sight with careful eyes survey and mark the extensive nature of my sway thus with fond zeal the guardian spirit said and to new precincts of her palace led the scene she entered of her richest state where on her voice the subject passions wait here rose a throne of living gems so bright no breath could sully their benignant light this her immortal seat the gracious guide assumed her ward stood wondering at her side swist as they felt their ruling power enthroned aetherial beings who her empire owned crowded in glittering pomp the gorgeous scene to pay their homage to their heavenly queen first came chaste love whose sweet harmonious form never felt suspicions soulconvulsing storm no baleful arrow in his quiver lies no blinding veil enwraps his sparkling eyes there all the rays of varied joy unite and jointly shed unspeakable delight with him was friendship like a virgin dressed the soft asbestos formed her simple vest whose wondrous folds in fiercest flames entire mock the vain ravage of consuming fire around this robe a mystic chain she wore each golden link a star of diamonds bore force could not tear the finished work apart nor interest loose it by his subtlest art but strange to tell if the presiding power who to her favorite gave this precious dower if kind sophrosyne could fail to breathe her vital virtue on this magic wreath the parts must sever faithless to their trust the gold grow dross and every diamond dust these valor followed decked with verdant palm gracefully bold majestically calm a mingled troop succeed with festive sound wisdom with olive wit with feathers crowned here hand in hand they move no longer foes their charms increasing as their union grows pure spirits all who hating mental strife exalt creation and embellish life all here attend and in their sovereigns praise their circling forms the song of glory raise the blessed serena drinks with ravished ear the melting music of the tuneful sphere now in its close the soothing echoes roll over her rapt fancy and intrance her soul her senses sink in soft oblivions bands till faithful jenny at her pillow stands recalls each mental and corporeal power while she proclaims aloud the passing hour and in a voice expressive of surprise too shrill to seem the music of the skies informs the startled fair it is time to rise end of the fifth canto canto vi blessed be the heart of sympathetic mould whatever form that gentle heart infold whose generous fibers with fond terror shake when keen affliction threatens to overtake young artless beauty as alarmed she strays through the strange windings of this mortal maze to such serena be thy story known whose bosom best can make thy lot their own and kindly sharing in thy trials past attend with sweet anxiety the last the hour approaches the tremendous hour in whose dark moments deeper perils lower still so enwrapt in pleasures gay disguise they lurk invisible to cautions eyes and unsuspected by the fair one wait to cancel or confirm her blissful fate her lively mind with bright ideas stored she takes her station at the breakfastboard still her soft soul the heavenly vision fills and sweeter graces in her smile instills new hopes of triumph glide through every nerve and arm her glowing heart with firm reserve conscious the final trying chance impends to bear its force her every power she bends in her quick thought ambitious to presage how spleens dark agents may exert their rage she ponders on what perils may befall and fondly deems her mind a match for all ah lovely nymph this dangerous pride forego pride may betray  securitys thy foe while fancied prudence thus a foreign guest sits doubly cherished in serenas breast behold a billet her attention steal no common arms compose its ample seal the unfolding paper breathes a roseate scent sweet harbinger of joy its kind intent of courteous filligree it bears the name clear symptom of the peers increasing flame the gracious earl lamenting pleasure lost and fair serena in her wishes crossed has planned in honor of the lovely maid a fancied ball a private masquerade and supplicates her sire with warm esteem to smile indulgent on the festive scheme all arts he uses to insure the grant nor leaves unasked the eager maiden aunt quick at the sound serenas glowing heart throbs with gay hopes but soon those hopes depart reflection in her soul a faithful guard the opening avenues of pleasure barred she deemed the plan of this delightful show but the new ambush of her secret foe the bliss too bright to realize she guessed and chased the idea from her guarded breast while these discreet resolves her thought employ tranquil she triumphs over her smothered joy not so the knight  to his parental eyes in dazzling pomp delusive visions rise that coronet the object of his vow he sees suspended over his daughters brow eager he burns to snap the pendent thread and fix the glory on his darlings head far wiser aims the ancient maiden caught no empty gewgaw flutters in her thought but while more keenly she applauds the plan her hope is solid and substantial man not for her infant niece whose baby frame she holds unfit for hymens holy flame but for her riper self whose strength may bear the heaviest burden of connubial care though different phantoms dance before their sight niece aunt and father in one wish unite to join the banquet is their common choice the business past with no dissenting voice and the warm sire in whom ambition burned a note of grateful courtesy returned his billet sealed the glad goodhumored knight launched forth like nestor on his youthful might  o could i now in spite of age retain that active vigor and that sprightly vein which led me once the lively laugh to raise among the merrier wits of former days when rival beauties would around me throng and gay ridottos listen to my song such were i now as on the festive night when ch  hs charms amazed the public sight when the kind fair one in a veil so thin that the clear gauze was but a lighter skin masked like a virgin just prepared to die gave her plump beauties to each greedy eye on that famed night for then with frolic fire youth filled my heart and humor strung my lyre pleased in the sunshine of her smile to bask i danced around her in a devils mask and idly chaunted an infernal ode in praise of all this female tempter showed the jocund crowd who thronged with me to gaze extolled my unpremeditated lays and sport who still of this old revel brags   see nestors speech in the   th iliad styled her the first of maids and me of wags then a light devil now reduced to limp i am but fit to play the hagborn imp still not to cross the frolic of this ball still as the tortoise caliban i will crawl and if with gout my burning ankles flinch i will call it prosperos tormenting pinch still in this shape i will show them what i am and pen shall go as sycorax my dam so spoke the knight and spoke with so much weight the listening females saw his word was fate for never did jove with so resolved a brow to smiling love his joyous scheme avow when he concerted for his special mirth a masquerading on the stage of earth and of the swans soft plume or bulls rough hair ordered the fancydress he chose to wear from whence let sapient antiquarians show the ancient use of masquerades below serena smiled to see this joyous fire infuse new youth in her determined sire but mute penelope with half a sigh with one auspicious and one dropping eye heard the firm knight his fixed resolve impart tickling at once and torturing her heart the ball she relished but abhorred the task to hide her beauties in a beldams mask mirandas name would better suit her plan a simple maiden not afraid of man but used alas her brothers law to feel she knows that law admits not of repeal trusting her charms will any garb enrich she deigns to take the habit of a witch never did sorceress in the shades of night try to illuminate a filthy sprite with fonder efforts or with worse success than pen now labored in this wayward dress to give the sprightly show of living truth to the poor ghost of her departed youth as witches over their magic cauldron bend anxious to see their menial imps ascend so in her glass the ancient maiden pries and dreams new graces in her person rise no such delights whose dear delusions please the mild serena in her mirror sees she at whose toilet beautys latent queen attends enchanted with her filial mien and over her favourites unconscious face breathes her own roseate glow and vivid grace she hastes her glittering garments to adjust with all the modest charms of sweet distrust doubting that beauty which she doubts alone which dazzles every eye except her own the native diffidence which swayed her mind now feels new terrors with its own combined the robes of ariel to the nymph recall those disappointments that may yet befall as her fair hands the gauze or tissue touch they fondly warn her not to hope too much she feels the friendly counsel they impart and caution reigns protector of her heart the fateful evening comes  the coach attends and first the gouty caliban ascends then in deformitys wellsuited pride sour sycorax is stationd by his side and last with sportive smiles divinely sweet light ariel perches on the vacant seat fancy now paints the scene of pleasure near yet fluttering gaiety is checked by fear her wish to view the festive sight runs high but the fond nymph remembers with a sigh from hopes keen hand the cup of joy may slip and fall untasted though it reach the lip as the fine artist whose nice toils aspire to fame eternal by encaustic fire if he with grief has seen the faithless heat mar the rich labor it should make complete when next his hands with trembling care confide to the fierce element his pencils pride watches unceasing the pernicious flame terror and hope contending in his frame while his fair work the dangerous fire sustains feels it in all his sympathetic veins and at each trivial sound that chance may cause hears the gem crack and sees its cruel flaws with such solicitude the panting maid past the long street of every noise afraid now while around her rival flambeaus flare and the coach rattles through the crowded square she fears some dire mischance must yet befall some demon snatch her from the promised ball and dreams no trial more severe than this so bright she figures the new scene of bliss yet horrid as it seems her heart is bent to bear even this and bear it with content but whirled at length within the porters gate she thinks what perils at the ball may wait and as she now alights the fluttering fair invokes her guardian to protect her there till thoughts of danger thoughts of caution fly before the magic blaze that meets her eye the advancing nymph at every step she takes pants with amazement doubtful if she wakes far as her eyes the glittering scene command it is all enchantment all a fairy land no vestiges of modern pomp appear no modern melody salutes her ear with moorish notes the echoing mansion rings and its transmuted form to fancy brings the rich see the views of this palace in swinburns travels alhambra of the moorish kings the peer who keenly thirsts for fashions praise to gild his revel with no common rays summoned his modish architect whose skill can all the wishes of caprice fulfill his genius equal to the wildest task gave to the house itself a gothic mask the chaplain that no guest might feel neglect as a magician of the arab sect waved a presiding wand throughout the ball and well provided for the wants of all the peer himself his prowess to evince shines in the semblance of a moorish prince and round the brilliant mimic hero wait all pomp and circumstance of moorish state through all his splendid dome no eye could find aught unembellishd save the masters mind there though represt by courtesys control lurks the low rover of the little soul mean vanity whose slave can never prove the heartrefining flame of genuine love while her cold joys his abject mind amuse his thoughts are busied on connubial views his house complete its decorations placed by the sure hand of fashionable taste he only wants to crown his modish life that last and finest moveable  a wife she too must prove to fix his coy desire such as the eye of fashion will admire his ball is but a jury to decide upon the merit of his fancied bride if sweet serena on this signal night shines the first idol of the public sight if gallantrys fixed eyes pronounce her fair by the sure sign of one unceasing stare and if prophetic of her nobler doom each rival beauty shudders at her bloom the die is cast  he weds  the point is clear she cannot slight the vows of such a peer thus argued in his mind the festive earl and lest he lightly choose an awkward girl wisely convened on this important case each fashionable judge of female grace here beaux esprits in various figures lurk of jew and gentile bramin tartar turk but of the manly masks a youthful bard seemed most to challenge beautys soft regard adorned with native elegance he wore in simplest form the minstrel dress of yore they call him edwin who around him throng edwin immortalized in beatties song and sooth to say within a comely frame he bore a heart that answered to the name for this neat habit decked a generous youth of gentlest manners and sincerest truth though on his birth propitious fortune smiled no proud parental folly spoiled the child and genius more beneficently kind blessed with superior wealth his manly mind of years he barely counted twentyone but like a brilliant morn his opening life begun fain would the muse on this her votary dwell and fully paint the youth she loves so well his figures charms the music of his tongue what nymphs his lays allured what lays he sung but higher cares her rambling song control serenas perils summon all her soul for spleen ambitious to exert her force conscious this trial is her last resource most keenly bent on her pernicious task has shifted round the ball from mask to mask watching the moment with infernal care to form with deepest art her final snare and manacle the mind of the unguarded fair it comes the moment that must fix her lot by her ah thoughtless maid by her forgot though the light hours even in their frolic ring trembling perceive the fearful chance they bring and shuddering at the nymphs terrific state seem anxious to suspend her doubtful fate now social ease the place of sport supplied the hot oppressive mask was thrown aside and beauty shone revealed in all her blushing pride superior still in features as in form with admiration flushed with pleasure warm the gay serena every eye allured the hearts her figure won her face secured a tender sweetness still the nymph maintained and modesty over all her graces reigned well might her soul to brilliant hopes incline a thousand youths had called her charms divine a thousand friends had whispered in her ear that fate had marked her for the festive peer her youthful fancy though by pomp amused wished not those offers which her heart refused that tender heart by no vain pride possessed with indecisive trembling shook her breast like a young bird that fluttering in the air wishes to build her nest yet knows not where the busy earl his puny love to raise hunted the circling whisper of her praise heard envy own her lovely charms though loath heard taste attest them with a modish oath and nuptial projects thickening in his mind now his fair partner in the dance rejoined as now the sprightly music paused my lord eager resolved to touch a softer chord secure of all repulse he vainly meant half to display half hide his fond intent and in dissembled passions flowery tropes to sport at leisure with the virgins hopes for this he framed a motley speech replete with amorous compliment and vain conceit the labored nothing with complacent pride he spoke but to his speech no nymph replied for in the moment the lost fair devotes her willing ear to more attractive notes the minstrel happened near the nymph to walk rapt with a bosomfriend in secret talk and at the instant when the earl began half to unfold his matrimonial plan edwin in whispers from the crowd retired chanced to repeat the sonnet she inspired the sounds though faint her recollection caught drew her quick eye and fixed her wondering thought lost in this sweet surprise she could not hear a single accent of the amorous peer spleen saw the moment that she sought to gain and perched triumphant on the nobles brain with jealous envy stung and baffled pride contemptuous girl with sudden rage he cried if here to happier youths thy views incline i want not fairer nymphs who challenge mine thy breast in vain with penitence may burn but once neglected i no more return thus loudly speaking with distempered heat rudely he turned with rancorous scorn replete serena startled at the injurious sound surveyed the insulting peer who sternly frowned shame and resentment through her bosom rush swell every vein and raise the burning blush love newborn love but in its birth concealed nor to the nymph herself as yet revealed and just disdain and angers honest flame with complicated power convulse her frame contending passions every thought confound and in tumultuous doubt her soul is drowned now treacherous pride who tempts her tongue to trip forms to a keen reply her quivering lip insidious spleen now hovers over the fair deems her half locked within her hateful snare in her new slave preparing to rejoice to taint her spirit and untune her voice hapless serena what can save thee now the fiends dark signet stamps thy clouded brow in thy swollen eye i see the starting drop this fatal shower aetherial guardian stop haste to thy votary haste her soul sustain nor let the trials she has past be vain ah me while yet i speak with shuddering dread i hear the magic girdles bursting thread this horrid omen ye kind powers avert nor thou bright zone thy brighter charge desert ah fruitless prayer her panting breast behold see the gauze shakes in many a ruffled fold forced from their station by her heaving heart from the strained girdle thrice three spangles start through her disordered dress a pass they have found and fallen see they glitter on the ground o blessed chance with liferecalling light the glittering monitors attract her sight like stars emerging from the darkened pole they sparkle safety to her harrassd soul see from her brow the clouds of trouble fly vexations tear is vanished from her eye her rosy cheeks with joys soft radiance burn like nature smiling at the suns return the nymph no more with mental darkness blind shines the sweet ruler of her rescued mind hence hateful spleen thy fancied prize resign renounce for ever what shall never be thine for conscious of her airy guardians aid she feels new spirit through her heart conveyed and inly blessing this victorious hour her soul exults in its recovered power in such mild terms she hails the insulting peer as spleen if mortal must expire to hear but driven for ever from the lovely girl the foul fiend riots in the captive earl he answers not but with a sullen air on happier edwin who approached the fair darts such a glance of rage and envious hate as satan cast on edens blissful state when on our parents first he fixed his sight and undelighted gazed on all delight so doomed to look and doomed such pangs to feel scornful he turned on his elastic heel o lovely mildness oh angelic maid deserving homage though to scorn betrayed rise still sweet spirit rise these wrongs above turn from injurious pride to faithful love though on my brow no coronet may shine wealth i can offer at thy beautys shrine and worthier thee a heart that worships thine thus with newkindled loves aspiring flame spoke the fond youth concealed by edwins name the gallant falkland rich in inborn worth by fortune blessed and not of abject birth warmly he spoke with that indignant heat with which the generous heart never fails to beat when worth insulted wakens virtuous ire and injured beauty sets the soul on fire quick to his voice the startled virgin turned with wonder hope and joy her bosom burned with sweet confusion flurried and amazed on his attractive form she wildly gazed full on her thought the friendly visions rushed blushing she viewed him viewed him still and blushed and soft affection quickening at the sight perchance had swoond with fullness of delight but that her fathers voice with quick control recalled the functions of her fainting soul when on the distant seat where fondly fixed he viewed the nymph as in the dance she mixed he indistinctly heard with wounded ear the spleenful outrage of the angry peer swift at the imperfect sound with choler wild he sprung to succor his insulted child but ere his fury into language broke love calmed the storm that arrogance awoke the sudden burst of falklands tender flame his winning manners his distinguished name his liberal soul by fortunes smile carest all joined to harmonize the fathers breast his fiery thoughts subside in glad surprise and to the generous youth he warmly cries ingenuous falkland by thy frankness won my willing heart would own thee as my son but on thy hopes serena must decide  haste we together from this house of pride so spoke the sire for to her votary kind sophrosyne inspired his softened mind speaking he smiled to see that on his word the lover hung and blessed the sounds he heard that his embarrassd child his sentence caught with each tumultuous sign of tender thought whose blushes springing from the heart declare the dawn of fondness in the modest fair the enchanted youth with ecstacy conveyed forth from the troubled feast the trembling maid as the keen sailor whom his daring soul has drawn too venurous near the freezing pole who having slighted cautions tame advice seems wedged within impervious worlds of ice if from each chilling form of peril free at length he reach the unincumberd sea with joy superior to his transient pain rushes exulting over the expansive main such strong delight serenas bosom shared when sweet reflection to her heart declared that all the trials of her fate were past and loves decisive plaudit sealed the last her airy guard prepares the softest down from peaces wing to line the nuptial crown her smiles accelerate the bridal morn and clear her votarys path from every thorn on the quick match the prudes keen censures fall blind to the heavenly power who guided all but mild serena scorned the prudish play to wound warm love with frivolous delay natures chaste child not affectations slave the heart she meant to give she frankly gave through her glad sire no gouty humors run jocund he glories in his destined son penelope herself no longer seen in the four semblance of tormenting spleen buys for her niece the robes of nuptial state nor scolds the mercer once through all the long debate for quick dispatch the honest man of law toils half the night the legal ties to draw at length the enraptured youth all forms complete bears his sweet bride to his paternal feat on a fair lawn the cheerful mansion stood and high behind it rose a circling wood as the blessed lord of this extensive reign led his dear partner through her new domain with fond surprise serena soon descried a temple raised to her aetherial guide its ornaments she viewed with tender awe their fashion such as she in vision saw for the kind youth her grateful smile to gain had from her clear description decked the fane joyful
