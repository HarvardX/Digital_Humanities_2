the history of sir george warrington or the political quixote  by the author of the female quixote  in three volumes vol i  london printed for j bell oxfordstreet mdccxcvii  chap i as sir george warrington was following the chase with his usual avidity one fine morning in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo his horse in attempting to leap a fivebarred gate threw him to the ground with such force that he remained for some time insensible always the first in the pursuit it was several minutes before he was overtaken by his companions who when they lifted him up immediately perceived his leg was broken one of his attendants then set off full speed for the village and immediately returned with a sort of litter on which he was borne to warrington castle and as a surgeon from the next town had been sent for at the same time he arrived almost as soon as the baronet and having set his leg and declared the fracture by no means a dangerous one he took leave desiring his patient might be kept as quiet as possible  the character of our hero might more properly be termed a mixture of good qualities and foibles than of virtues and vices as he had more of the latter in his composition and the former from the peculiarities of his education though numerous were inactive to account for this it will be necessary before i enter on the events of his own life to mention some particulars of his father  sir thomas warrington was a mere country squire without abilities and without improvement rough and unpolished in his manners and violent in his disposition he had yet the good fortune to gain the hand and approbation if not the heart of miss hamilton a young woman of high birth who was elegant accomplished and beautiful perhaps sir thomas would not have been the man of her choice had her situation been either an independent or a happy one but the tyranny of a motherinlaw and the certainty of comparative poverty on the death of her father whose vices and extravagance had equally impaired his fortune and his constitution induced her to comply with the baronets proposals who it must be observed appeared to her in a very different light at that time as his person was handsome and his address though far from elegant had in it more of rusticity than vulgarity and the cheerfulness of his conversation concealed in some measure the inferiority of his understanding after a short courtship sir thomas carried his bride to warrington castle where she had sufficient leisure to discover the faults of her lord and master  for such in every instance he proved himself  lord milbanke extremely happy in the opportunity of parting with his daughter to such advantage for sir thomas warrington possessed a considerable estate promised to give her five thousand pounds  when he well knew he could not command so many hundreds and his failure in this promise so completely disgusted the baronet who himself wanted neither generosity nor sincerity that he forbade lady warringtons keeping up any connection with her own family and as she was too timid to resist the commands of an absolute husband and her father had not a sufficient degree of affection for her to request her breaking through the restrictions imposed they met but once after her marriage and the viscount dying in a few months all intercourse between them ceased her only brother was at that time abroad and on his return being prejudiced by the dowager lady milbanke both against her and the baronet made no enquiries for them  the duplicity of the viscount who had a place under government increased the natural dislike sir thomas had to courtiers as he called them and with an inveteracy by no means justifiable he often declared his utter dislike to all who bore the name in all elections he voted only for those who supported the country interest and in fact quarrelled with all the neighboring gentlemen who were on the other side thus lady warrington was not only deserted by her own relations but excluded from almost all other society as the general violence of her husbands disposition prevented even the families whose political opinions coincided with his own from forming any intimacy with him and a few annual visits were all that passed and the conversation of those who were termed the gentry of bellingham the neighboring town was so little suited to lady warringtons taste and so totally different from what she had been accustomed to in the earlier part of her life that she avoided it as much as possible without appearing either haughty or illhumoured her time therefore was chiefly devoted to the education of george our present hero the only child she ever had and she impressed on his tender mind those sentiments of generosity humanity and religion which he never lost though the advice and example of his father for some years prevented their effects he was scarcely twelve when this exemplary mother was taken from him and he felt her loss as severely as such a child could feel sir thomas who in his way really loved her lamented her at first with that violence so natural to him and which always exhausts itself of course when the first emotions of grief were subsided he not merely grew calm but suffered himself to be consoled by the reflection that had she lived lady warrington would have made a milksop of his boy and in consequence of his idea of the proper mode of education he initiated him at once into all the sports of the field  thus at an age when other boys are studying greek and latin he was following the hounds and that ardour and warmth of disposition which added to a naturally strong genius would if turned into a proper channel have rendered him the delight and ornament of society now served only to lead him the foremost in the chase and that extreme sweetness of temper which he inherited from his mother only made him the little patron of all the village amusements which in a less limited scene would have disposed him to be the general friend and benefactor of mankind his mind however was not wholly uncultivated mr thomson the vicar had a handsome salary for devoting a few hours every day to his education and as he learned very quickly his tasks were soon performed but they left no impression on his mind though his memory was naturally so good it could have given him very little trouble to recollect all he had been taught but a new horse or a new dog engrossed his whole attention so much that they never failed to drive horace and juvenal livy and tacitus out of his head in fact in every contest of this kind the modern pompey or caesar fairly conquered all the heroes of antiquity  i have now given my readers some account of sir george in his earliest days let me next describe him at the period where this history begins he was just twentyone and having lost his father about eight months was in full possession of an unincumbered estate of six thousand pounds a year his countenance was open animated and interesting his eyes expressive of more good sense than his tongue had ever yet uttered his complexion would have been too fair but that the glow of health added to the effects of the sun to which he was constantly exposed gave it a darker shade and his features though not exactly regular were such as no one could observe without pronouncing him a handsome young man his air had something in it of natural grace as his address had of natural courtesy which it was easily perceived a few months intercourse with the great world would convert into elegance as though rustic he was by no means vulgar for that politeness which springs from an innate wish of pleasing and that dignity which is ever the result of conscious worth and native integrity require but little artificial polish to render their possessors not merely esteemed but admired  his fathers unsocial disposition to all but his brother sportsmen had confined our heros acquaintance in the same degree but when his own master he extended it to a few families in bellingham where he also attended the monthly assembly an acquired rather than an habitual shyness prevented him from seeking the society of those gentlemen who were in fact only his equals but he knew not how to begin and they were deterred from making an acquaintance with him by supposing he set out in life on his fathers plan at the bellingham balls he danced most frequently with miss kettering the daughter of the surgeon who as mentioned before was sent for to set his leg as the prettiest girl in the place of whom it will be necessary to give a short description  miss nancy as she was called by her mamma or as she called herself miss anna maria kettering had been educated at a provincial boardingschool where she was taught to dance a little play a little work a little write a little but to dress a great deal and the latter accomplishment was what she most strictly attended to as it had made the deepest impression on her mind she was not very wise but she had a very high opinion of herself not only with respect to her person but her accomplishments and abilities and from the attention sir george warrington had paid her conceived a hope and not a very unnatural one that in time she might make such an entire conquest of his heart as to induce him to offer her his hand and this hope extending itself to the rest of the family our hero always met with so flattering a reception at their house as tempted him frequently to repeat his visits and as a slight return for their attentions he usually requested the favor of miss ketterings hand at the assemblies to which he now became a subscriber but though he actually preferred her he sometimes to avoid particularity danced with the miss bells the clergymans or the miss bennets the attorneys daughters who were highly gratified by the honor though they often envied miss kettering the more frequent opportunities she had of attracting his notice as though they had not themselves the least pretensions to beauty they could discover no other reason for his preference  this was the state of affairs in warrington castle and its neighborhood at the time when this history opens  chap ii mrs kettering had ordered her best carpet to be laid down in the drawing room the fringed covers to be laid on the mahogany chairs and had taken out her best china in expectation of a party that evening invited purposely to meet sir george warrington who had promised his attendance when all her views were disconcerted by the arrival of a messenger on horseback who hastily relating the accident that had happened desired mr kettering to return instantly to the castle on his horse  the universally known but universally reprobated maxim of rochefoucault that in the distress of our best friends we always find something that does not displease us of which at times all feel the truth though all deny it was now though it must be allowed an extraordinary instance contradicted by mrs kettering and her fair daughter the misfortune of the baronet could not afford them a ray of consolation they lost his society for the present and feared they should lose the consequence his frequent visits gave them among their neighbors no more could miss anna maria triumph over her female acquaintance or her devoted lovers by declaring an engagement for the evening to sir george warrington thus was she at once deprived of the first privilege of beauty and the first gratification of friendship what the other belles thought and said on the subject we shall not at present discuss but leaving the inhabitants of bellingham to their various opinions return to warrington castle  when the first violence of the pain was abated and our hero had leisure to reflect on his situation the idea of so long a confinement as mr kettering had assured him must be the consequence of the fracture though it was by no means a dangerous one inspired him with a gloom his mind was before a stranger to and having in vain endeavored to fix on a plan to render it less tedious he resolved to consult his surgeon when he next visited him accordingly that gentleman having felt his pulse and declared him more free from fever than he could have expected our hero replied a little peevishly  what signifies being free from fever the bone must have time to grow together and what shall i do in the interim i shall die with weariness  but surely returned mr kettering you will allow the less fever you have the sooner your recovery will be perfect  true said sir george a little ashamed of his impetuosity but how can i amuse myself my good friend what shall i do  do repeated the other why you must  you must  faith you must do what you please and with this decided advice much resembling parson barnabass definition of christian forgiveness he took leave of his patient more hastily than usual lest he should again be called upon for his opinion  our hero unused to control and always having had something on which to fix his thoughts and the activity of his mind having never been before restrained found the present vacuum dreadful to a degree compelled not merely to give up his favorite amusements for the present but unable to ascertain the period when he might again enjoy them he found it necessary to think on some substitute to fill up the vacant hours conversation in the country is not always attainable he had no friend or relation who could become an inmate in his house and his common acquaintance were too much engrossed by their own pursuits to spend any time in a sick chamber mr ketterings profession engaged him entirely and his old tutor mr thomson attended too strictly to the duties of a clergyman to have much leisure he had indeed promised sir george whom he loved with the tenderness of a parent to devote to him all he could spare from his more essential avocations but this our hero was sensible could not be more than an hour or two in the day and how he should fill up the intermediate space was a point he could not determine ringing the bell hastily he ordered a servant to run to the parsonage and tell mr thomson he desired to see him immediately the servant obeyed and when he had delivered the message the good vicar enquired with much concern if he was worse and being answered in the negative and informed that sir george only wanted to talk to him he smiled and bade john tell his master he would wait on him when he had gone his daily rounds in the village  on his arrival at the castle the young baronet put the same question to him he had before so ineffectually addressed to his surgeon but the reply was rather more satisfactory i will said the vicar laughing put you in a way to amuse yourself read if you have not forgotten how and if you have i will again take some pains to teach you  sir george colored for a moment at the sarcasm of this speech conscious he deserved it but resolving to take it as it was meant good humouredly he thanked his old tutor a thousand times for the hint declaring it had not occurred to him before or he should not have been so long at a loss for amusement and now continued he condescend to direct my studies  nay returned mr thomson choose your own subject and from either your i beg your pardon i mean your grandfathers library or my own i may chance to satisfy you  oh replied sir george i am at this instant a strong proof of the caprice of human nature confined as i now am to my bed i feel a martial ardour glowing in my heart and could wish myself a second alexander  i hope not interrupted the vicar you are much better as sir george warrington  well my good friend but seriously give me the history of wars and conquests let me have the liad for the present and tomorrow send me something else  in the original i presume returned mr thomson  pshaw said the baronet half peevishly yet half laughing  well replied the other you shall have popes translation and i will look for it directly if not in your house i know it is in mine he then took leave and going to the library found it with some trouble but it was entirely covered with dust as well as the rest of a very valuable collection he would not permit the servant to wipe it but requested he would take it first to his master hoping the appearance would strike him with shame  as it really did mr thomson however returned home well pleased with this proof that our hero had not as he once feared lost all relish for study and endeavored to select such books as would both amuse his mind and form his manners and at the same time give him a taste for polite literature accordingly he that afternoon looked out such authors as were best adapted to his purpose and sent them up to the castle resolving to call the following day to observe how his pupil went on  to dwell no longer on a part of the history designed merely as an introduction to the rest i shall only observe that our hero made the best possible use of his confinement by well cultivating his mind which had been too long neglected but though he attended in turn to every branch of science the subjects that most engaged his attention were the descriptions of wars particularly where the hero had emancipated his country from slavery and subjection pascal paoli was the object of his warmest admiration nor were the characters of the elder and younger brutus less respected and esteemed and he sighed to render his own name equally famous to posterity  one day speaking on the subject to his surgeon that gentleman seriously advised him to go into the militia saying there was a captains commission to be had and that as he did not mean to be in parliament he ought to serve his country in some way and added as a farther reason a red coat and cockade would become him extremely as all the young ladies of bellingham agreed our hero suppressed a smile with some difficulty and then turned the conversation  whilst his mind was in this state mr thomson received some new publications from a friend in london which without perusing himself he sent instantly to the castle where they were received by sir george with particular satisfaction and he read them with avidity and delight as unfortunately they were too well adapted to the present frame of his mind among them were paines rights of man a history of the french revolution and a variety of books written evidently in its favor some of them containing a description and i fear too just a one of the cruelties practiced on the people by those in power the narrative of henry de la tude fired his breast with an honest indignation and the idea of restoring liberty to an oppressed nation excited in him the strongest wish of joining so noble so disinterested a party till now he had never concerned himself with the politics of the day and indeed scarcely ever bestowed a thought on the national welfare though he had been early taught by his father to detest courtiers and all their train of servile flatterers but at this time when his mind was filled with military ardour the subject of his studies was well calculated to make a deep impression on his mind a desire of assisting the patriots with advice and money was his first idea but universal liberty and general equality next taking possession of his imagination he became almost mad to forward a plan that promised such unbounded good to society  he communicated these new sentiments to his good friend the vicar who silently lamented his infatuation and could not forgive himself for being the cause though the innocent one of these wild intentions but knowing though you may turn the current of a rivulet you cannot check the progress of a torrent he determined to give way to this fury of liberty trusting it would prove only the impulse of a moment but here he was mistaken sir george never gave up a cause in which he embarked till its impropriety was clear to his own feelings and he now lamented the years he had passed in inglorious ease and blamable inactivity determining at the same time the moment he was allowed by his surgeon to undertake the journey and voyage to go over to paris and then act as he should think proper having fully settled this with himself he imparted his intention to mr thomson who after vainly endeavoring to dissuade him from it at last entreated him in the most solemn manner not to think of going to a country like france torn with intestine commotions at least without a companion better acquainted with the language and manners of the country than himself and this after some hesitation he promised saying he would first go to london and there enquire for some gentleman to accompany him in the capacity he required  mr thomson was obliged to be satisfied with this promise but he took leave of his young friend in a very different frame of mind from that in which he had entered the castle alternately accusing himself and his democratic correspondent in london who had selected these books evidently with a view of converting our good vicar to whose honest and loyal principles he was no stranger but in this he erred mr thomsons judgment was too clear and his principles too excellent to be perverted by arguments of the most fallacious kind that tend only to destroy the happiness britons have so long enjoyed under a constitution more beneficial to society in general than that of any other nation in europe  chap iii when mr kettering paid his next visit to our hero for he now only attended him occasionally he entered upon his favorite topic with all the warmth which his heart experienced the other listened with attention and surprise for the idea of sacrificing the least convenience himself for the benefit of another man or even a whole society was not among his list of christian duties sir george having expatiated on his intended tour and the advantages all the nation might receive from his new resolutions and the exertions he should make in consequence of them the surgeon replied  why as for the matter of that sir george i do not see why you should go abroad among them there french people to be cut to pieces perhaps and the like of that as they are now doing to one another when you might stay here in northumberland and sleep in a whole skin to be sure if you please you may make ducks and drakes of your money because you have enough of it and that there is no body to call you to an account but i know what i know if i had an estate of six thousand a year why i would stay and spend it all in old england and enjoy myself and live as i liked and if i pleased marry the prettiest girl in the county for what signifies money when there is enough on one side  mr kettering here ended his curious harangue of which our hero understood not the whole force for totally ignorant of the ways of the world he overlooked the kind hint with respect to his daughter and continued explaining his future intentions the doctrine of equality was by no means unpleasing to his companion who like most other people who indulge this idea only considered that sir george would be reduced to his level without recollecting that his inferiors would be raised to it indeed at this moment he thought of nothing but the probability of the baronets marrying his daughter if he continued in these sentiments and resolving according to the old saying to strike while the iron was hot he contrived before they parted to hint that as he was now able to get into the drawing room he would bring over his wife and daughter to drink a dish of tea with him if agreeable to this sir george politely assented saying the ladies would do him great honor and soon after mr kettering took leave impatient to communicate the baronets intention to his family  but mrs kettering received this intelligence with a less degree of pleasure than he expected for though equally pleased with the idea of being considered on an equality with him and delighted at the intended visit yet his meditated excursion disconcerted all her views as she too rationally feared a farther knowledge of the world might lessen the regard she at present hoped he felt for her fair daughter who herself too gay and too careless to look beyond the passing moment thought only on what dress she should wear to the castle and in the intermediate time made a point of calling on the miss bells and the miss bennets on purpose to give them notice of her visit but not choosing to do it in express terms she contrived to hint a wish for fine weather and this drawing on the question she hoped for she replied her papa was that afternoon to drive her mamma and herself over to warrington castle to see poor sir george who had particularly requested their company  whatever surprise these young ladies might feel they chose not to reveal it lest they should add to the triumph that was so evidently painted on her countenance and therefore coolly replied after so long a confinement it was no wonder sir george wanted a little variety disappointed by their manner of receiving her intelligence she returned home to prepare for her little excursion fully proving that an envious and little mind is incapable of feeling true satisfaction as her own pleasure was lessened if not destroyed by her ineffectual endeavors to give pain to others  it is a general and too true an observation that more quarrels arise in families from trifles than from things of consequence as every creature supposes the others may give up what is so immaterial though they are themselves too tenacious to yield in a single point when miss anna maria entered the parlour she found her papa and mamma engaged in a violent dispute on their method of traveling mr kettering insisting on driving them in their own whisky as he was to visit a patient a few miles farther and intended to leave them at warrington castle and call for them on his return and mrs kettering remonstrating that as the day was showery it would be more comfortable as well as more genteel to hire a postchaise but she remonstrated in vain mrs kettering had reason on her side but we daily see that reason does not always conquer she was obliged to yield but she did it with a very ill grace and sat down to table muttering it was very hard that people would scrape and save for a farthing when they need not be so stingy as all the world knew they could do very handsomely if they would her husband either did not or would not hear this observation but helped himself to some mutton and for a few moments peace was restored as miss nancy though evidently on her mammas side did not dare take a decided part in the dispute but before the cloth was removed it was renewed with more violence on another subject  mr kettering desired the ladies would be ready early as he wished to go on to see his patient mrs kettering replied it would be extremely vulgar to be at the castle before six oclock and if he chose to be there earlier he might go by himself here mrs kettering had not reason on her side yet she prevailed i will not is a sentence sometimes of great power and mr kettering tired of opposition and perceiving as he had gained one point the other would not be yielded without more trouble than he chose to bestow at length after a little more argument gave it up perhaps she might have compounded had he offered the postchaise but here selfinterest prevailed as it always did in his bosom and he rather chose his patient should remain perhaps an hour or two longer without relief than pay a few shillings extraordinary in chaisehire he now left the room to prepare his medicines for as is the case in most provincial towns in him the professions of apothecary and surgeon were united  miss anna maria now deigning to consult her mother on some points of her dress she desired her to wear a riding habit as most proper for the carriage they were to go in and here let me digress a moment to observe that mrs kettering had generally speaking more sense as well as judgment than the rest of the family though she had seldom the good fortune to be able to make use of it for a reason the reader will readily guess miss nancy flatly refused and when her mother insisted on it flounced out of the room saying indeed at her age she thought she might at least dress as she pleased here mrs kettering was a second time right though her advice was again unattended to she had however the satisfaction of knowing she had gained one point in three and though reflection told her she was in that instance wrong a wish of keeping up all the authority she could prevented her from owning it nor is this an uncommon instance those who are constantly contradicted sometimes take up the wrong side of an argument and maintain it with the more positiveness from resentment at being generally opposed and a desire of obtaining their own way for once though even by wrong means  chap iv at the appointed time mr ketterings onehorse chaise or rather whisky drove up to the door for as it was principally intended for him to visit his patients when disinclined to mount his horse it was built in the lightest manner and without a head that it might move with the greater expedition that gentleman having handed in his wife and daughter found some difficulty in seating himself in a carriage by no means calculated for family parties slowly and heavily therefore the old mare dragged them up the hill going out of the town and before they had proceeded three miles of the five which separated bellingham from warrington castle the sky was overcast and threatened a hard shower it was now that mrs kettering exulted in her sagacity and looking alternately at her husband and daughter she would have compared herself to cassandra of troy had she known the story but as she did not was contented with saying it was some peoples misfortune never to be believed though they were always in the right  the spirit of contradiction which some authors very cruelly as well as very unjustly ascribe peculiarly to the fair sex now however did take possession of the lady and she wished for rain almost as earnestly as a farmer in a drought indeed she had little reason to fear it on her own account as she had equipped herself for the purpose in a rich silk gown and petticoat over which she wore a camblet safeguard and had farther secured herself by a calash and long cloak made of hatband silk the fruits of her husbands labors  the fair anna maria had more cause to dread a shower being dressed in a thin muslin jacket and coat over a dyed purple silk a sash and bonnet of the same color the latter edged with a deep veil of british lace and a black gauze cloak she therefore viewed the approaching storm with very different sensations and when the rain first came on put up an umbrella which was her sole dependence in times of distress and danger we should be very certain of the steadiness of that friend for whom we have disclaimed all other protection lest like the fair anna we should by their desertion be left to struggle alone with the bitter winds of adversity boreas that day unfortunately recollecting his contention with phoebus in which the latter conquered now in a rage resolved to muster all his forces and attack the first mortal who fell in his way determined not to be again vanquished unhappily the first object was miss kettering whose umbrella like a faithless ally made no resistance but yielded at the first attack and left her exposed to the pelting of the pitiless storm and pitiless indeed it was for it completely deranged every part of her attire her bonnet was the first victim of its fury the rain spotted the lilac silk and shrunk up the british lace veil her gauze cloak and muslin petticoat received several mortal wounds from her endeavors to keep her umbrella from absolute flight and in other places the rain drawing out the purple dye marked the muslin with ensanguined streams her black pins and powder like cowards fled from the field of battle but the pomatum still adhered which gave her head no small resemblance to that of the ancient lady well known by the name of medusa though it must be allowed her face was not one that would turn the hearts of beholders into stone though it had often the power of scorching them to cinders  the contest between boreas the umbrella and miss kettering continued till they were within sight of the park gates when an accident decided the victory or rather put an end to the battle in short going over a very rugged piece of road one of the wheels gave way and though it did not absolutely overturn them it obliged the whole party to proceed on foot and this put the finishing stroke to the young ladys appearance as the dirt in a very few minutes formed a black border to her white dress and rendered the yellow stripes in her slippers undistinguishable angry with herself for not taking her mothers advice but more angry with her mother for some occasional sallies of triumph which had escaped her lips mortified at the idea of being seen by sir george in so lamentable a state yet not knowing how to avoid it she burst into tears of mingled passion and grief when the footman who had been sent by his master opened the gate to receive them sir george himself stood at the window watching their progress which was very slow and when from their advancing nearer he discovered their situation he immediately dispatched the housekeeper to assist them in repairing the accidents of the afternoon to add to anna marias vexation young mr bennet who had been at the castle on business passed them on horseback just before they entered the house and was consequently a witness of their deranged appearance which she was very conscious he would not only enjoy but report with exaggerations as he had been an unsuccessful candidate for her favor and attributed this to her penchant for the baronet  when the ladies were a little refitted they entered the drawing room where sir george received them with all possible politeness and many expressions of concern for the misfortunes of the day which he also endeavored to counteract by sending mr kettering to his patient on one of his own horses and offering them the carriage on their return the delay occasioned by this accident and their consequent change of dress added to mrs ketterings etiquette of not arriving too early made it considerably past seven when the tea was brought in and as the carriage was ordered at half past eight the evening was not too long nothing material occurred except that sir george whose mind was now in a state of improvement was surprised he should have considered miss kettering in any other light than that of a pretty girl for in fact she had no pretensions to wisdom and her wit was of that innocent species which neither outs nor dazzles consiing chiefly of quaint sayings not very unlike swifts polite conversation and this was natural to her and not acquired by any study of the book in question he also promised to return their visit before he left the country and this added to the delight of going home in his coach seemed to atone for every past evil but every white will have its black and every sweet its sour for miss anna maria could scarcely enjoy this pleasure from recollecting it would not be visible to their neighbors as it must be dark before they could arrive at home this however she consoled herself for by reflecting she could tell it the next day for in fact she considered it as only preceding the offer of his hand  they took leave of the baronet with a profusion of thanks for his civilities and reached their own house in the utmost harmony but this was soon at an end for reviving the events of the day after supper they each accused the other of having in some degree caused their misfortunes not reflecting they were equally to blame themselves had mr kettering hired a postchaise they would have escaped the rain wholly had mrs kettering consented to set out an hour earlier they would have been safe at the castle or had miss nancy yielded to her mammas entreaties she might have been free from the mortifications she so deservedly met with thus reproaching each others conduct without correcting their own they passed the hours till they parted for the night  chap v in the mean time our hero who was now perfectly recovered settled all his affairs previous to his intended journey and not unmindful of his promise sent a message to mrs kettering to inform her he would wait on them the following afternoon and that lady immediately wrote cards to her principal acquaintance inviting them to meet the baronet at the usual hour the party assembled in her drawing room consisting of the bells the bennets the browns the joness an officer or two who were quartered in the town and a miss carruther of whom it will be necessary to speak more fully  this lady was the daughter of a gentleman of good estate in a county southwest of london but at his death finding herself mistress of only five or six thousand pounds she took a handsome lodging in the town near which she had always lived and continued there for several years in credit and comfort as her brother who was married to a very amiable woman resided constantly at the mansion house where she was always a welcome guest and in her own circle was equally respected and esteemed it was therefore a great surprise to her friends particularly to her brother when all on a sudden she formed the resolution of leaving her native place and settling in some distant spot no creature could guess the reason and it became the subject of universal enquiry but in vain she had the sense to conceal it in her own bosom and it was not to be discovered miss carruther exclusive of a few annual excursions to bath and london had lived twoandforty years within a circle of five miles and was now arrived at that period when the term young lady was dropped by all who knew her except her milliner and mantuamaker who it has been often observed bestow the epithet young more liberally on those who have lost all proper claim to it and who seldom hear it from their general acquaintance thereby showing their extreme benevolence and charity among a thousand virtues miss carruther had one foible which frequently led her to think and act in the most ridiculous manner this was a horror of growing old unmarried and consequently a desire of youth she had never been a handsome though always what the world calls a welllooking woman and her fortune though a genteel independence not sufficient according to the style in which she had been educated to secure her any advantageous offers she was therefore not merely single at this time but likely to remain so her plan was now to quit a place where her age was so well known that some accident discovered it in every company and perhaps the illnatured of her own sex who unhappily are too numerous had discerned her foible and delighted to avail themselves of it  sometimes a lady with a tall daughter of fifteen at her elbow would exclaim talking of dress my dear emily do you remember that beautiful negligee you had of pink and white satin and your brussels lace treble ruffles oh how i envied you and how angry i was with my aunt for keeping me in a robe coat when though your junior by a year or two i thought myself as well entitled to a sacque as yourself  sometimes their tall daughters would remind the unfortunate emily of frolics with their mammas at the boardingschool and express a wish of equalling their exploits sometimes a dear friend would entreat her opinion of a player who had quitted the stage above fiveandtwenty years or beg her to recollect the celebrated song of signor or signora at the same period  on these unhappy occasions miss carruther acted according to the impulse of the moment sometimes she had forgotten the circumstance and instantly changed the conversation and sometimes she would endeavor to laugh but her efforts were like those of an incognito author who hears his works burlesqued and is obliged to join in the ridicule lest the company should suspect they were indebted to him for the present occasion of showing their wit  miss carruther now fled the society of her old friends and joined the younger people especially those who from having only lately settled in the town could not know the date of her birth but here she experienced new troubles from the respect they paid to seniority her tea was always handed first she was led to the upper part of the table and in parties of pleasure her company was often requested with particular earnestness and enforced by the young ladies saying oh dear madam pray do not refuse us my mamma cannot be with us today and she will not consent to our going unless you will take us under your protection for she says you are such a prudent woman she may trust us safely  is it not strange that at an age when prudence is become a more valuable virtue than it once was from its present scarcity that any one should disclaim its possession yet such things were and the term prudent woman never failed to give miss carrtuher a headache or some other illness which prevented her compliance from the frequency of her refusals the truth was at last suspected by some saucy girls of seventeen who aware of their past indiscretion now resolved to atone for it by wording their invitations in a different manner this succeeded for them but miss carruther was still doomed to perpetual mortifications either from design or accident for the honor of the sex i will hope it was the latter and from these events she resolved to quit her pleasant native plains where no longer winged with bliss the moments flew and seek at a distance that peace she was there denied  here let me digress a moment to observe that at every age women are not only respectable but estimable when they act in character but if a lady bordering on fortyfive will condescend to wear feathers flowers etc and in other respects dress like a girl who has just left boardingschool she cannot hope to meet with any thing but contempt and derision  miss carruther tried bath and london in vain she had been too much in the world not to meet with a variety of her old acquaintance in either place which did not suit her plan therefore after rambling three years she at length discharged an old servant in london who had almost brought her up lest she should say i love my mistress and have lived with her near forty years and took a young girl a stranger hired a new footman and with these attendants set out for northumberland where she determined to fix her residence and being much pleased with bellingham hired a small house and resolved to continue there unless as ladies sometimes express it she should alter her condition  at bellingham she had been six months and was now bordering on that fatal yet happy time which puts a period at once to the hopes and fears that for ten years before float in the female mind for who is there that when they have seen half a century in this world will not endeavor to reconcile themselves to their state of old maidism as mr hayley terms it and those who have passed that barrier without doing any thing voluntarily to forfeit the title of prudent women may esteem themselves particularly fortunate since instances daily occur where every advantage of life is bartered to avoid the hated name of old maid  to return to our history   miss carruther as a woman of sense consequence and fortune was visited and courted by all the inhabitants of bellingham and now at mrs ketterings shone in all but youth and beauty eminently superior to the rest and there was something in her manner so strikingly fashionable that our hero who no longer thought like a mere rustic was struck with it and beginning a conversation with her in which she displayed much good sense and knowledge of the world he sat by her the remainder of the evening it is true the peculiar ease of miss carruthers behavior was owing to her having heard the current report of the town that the baronet was engaged to miss kettering and consequently imagining his attentions to her were either accidental or assumed to conceal the state of his heart from the rest of the company endeavored to amuse without seeking to attract him the young ladies particularly anna maria were much piqued at his preference but to hide their chagrin from each other entertained themselves with laughing at the object  it is the part of a faithful historian to relate the bad as well as the good traits in every character or i would keep it a secret from the world that miss carruther was from her dress that evening too just a theme for ridicule she had studied simplicity her gown was a white muslin chemise extremely long every way her sash pale pink her slippers had flat heels and in the prevailing mode of the year ninetytwo her hair was combed on her forehead and hung on her neck in light curls without pomatum and scarcely any powder her cap was of muslin with a narrow stripe which a ribbon the color of her sash bound tight to her head altogether as she was a tall woman she gave an idea of a brobdinagian infant half tucked and just learning to walk  could our ancestors rise from their graves they would not as some people foolishly imagine have any cause to reproach the present age with extravagance in their dress as those who have studied the manners of old times assure us that they were more guilty in those points than ourselves nor were their fashions less eccentric or ridiculous as the high pointed shoe fastened to their girdles with chains sufficiently evinces but to the ladies of the eighteenth century it has been reserved to dress like infants in long frocks disdaining the foreign aid of gold brocades and silver tissues they seek to charm by native simplicity and endeavor to recall the ideas of each beholder to that period when innocence was their only characteristic binding their baby brows not with the round and top of sovereignty but with a gay ribbon or a muslin band  this new mode of dress having only been conveyed to miss carruther in a letter from a fashionable correspondent had not yet publicly reached bellingham and therefore excited surprise in all the young ladies of that place who were themselves attired in stiff calendered gowns and silk petticoats with their hair in full friz and very much powdered yet whilst all pretended to laugh at they all secretly resolved to copy her each hoping to be the first in the fashion  the events of the evening were not numerous and indeed scarcely worth recording a summons to the cardtable put an end to the tete atete between the baronet and miss carruther as well as to the remarks of the rest of the company the game was commerce and all the young people sat down to it miss kettering resolving to strike one bold stroke to attain her purpose called to sir george and asked him where he would choose to sit and he of course replying by her when the first deal was at an end and that lady was declared to be the winner young bennet with a loud laugh said he supposed sir george cheated for her sir george unaccustomed to company and scarcely ever playing cards did not take this in the light it was intended merely as a jest for he was yet to learn that cheating for the ladies is an honorable action but thought it a reproach and resented it accordingly mr james bennet frightened to death made very humble concessions which soon appeased the wrath of the baronet and this taught the young attorney a lesson he never forgot namely not to jest with his superiors however for some time it disturbed the peace of the whole party  when the pool drew toward a conclusion it was only disputed between our hero and miss carruther and the former throwing away purposely a wrong card decided it for her miss kettering who witnessed this transaction was extremely piqued at what she esteemed a mark of distinction in miss carruthers favor though it was merely the effects of a natural courtesy of manners and had the folly to exclaim in a loud whisper to miss bennet that her brother was in the right for sir george now cheated for miss carruther that lady smiled disdainfully and sir george replied coolly yet half laughing that he had always understood he might cheat himself when he pleased  his carriage was now announced and with a general bow to the company and a particular address to the kettering family intimating as he was soon to quit the country that he should scarcely have the pleasure of seeing them again and therefore wished them health and happiness he took leave and they remained in a state of utter astonishment and dismay as they had no idea his plan was to be put into immediate execution the fair anna maria was particularly agitated and was for some time uncertain whether she should not fall into hysteric fits but happily recollecting it would only be a means of informing the company of the extent of her mortification wisely and without much difficulty suppressed them and contented herself with mental accusations of the baronet whom she thought the basest of his sex  in the mean time sir george was wholly unconscious of having deserved these reproaches he had it is true during the few months after his fathers death visited at their house occasionally and sometimes danced with her he had behaved when they mer with the gallantry due to a pretty woman but had never by word or action given her reason to believe he was attached nor during his long confinement had expressed any wish to see her till mr kettering offered him a visit from his family and on that evening as well as this had acted conformably to his sentiments which were those of perfect indifference in fact the only thing even miss kettering herself could accuse him of misleading her hopes in was the offer of the carriage which was merely civility though in her highflown ideas she had given it a stronger motive but her expectations were by this visit wholly crushed as the least she hoped for was that by a marked attention he would convince all the company of his preference and that before his return he would request a private interview with her papa and mamma to make his proposals in form thus do we overthrow the happiness we might enjoy from raising our wishes to an unattainable height for we daily experience that an inferior gratification loses all its value when contrasted with that on which we had fixed our hopes and expectations  chap vi in less than a week from this time our hero having taken a tender and affectionate leave of mr and mrs thomson and settled his affairs with his steward set out from warrington castle on horseback on monday the  of  unattended and determined to drop his title and be known only by the name of mr warrington his route was across the country to newcastle from whence he meant to proceed toward london and there fix his future plans the good vicar considering his youth and inexperience would have recommended him to a friend he had in the metropolis but he was afraid of the consequences knowing that friend for he had but one in london though otherwise a worthy man to be a perfect convert to the new and absurd system of equality it was in deed from him he had received those books which had perverted the mind of his beloved pupil  our hero rode slowly along meditating on his new ideas and as he beheld the laborers in the field toiling for the support of others exclaimed with the scottish bard sweet were your shades oh ye primeval groves whose boughs to man his food and shelter lent pure in his pleasures happy in his loves his eye still smiling and his heart content then hand in hand health sport and labor went nature supplied the wish she taught to crave none prowld for prey none watched to circumvent to all an equal lot heavens bounty gave no vassal feared his lord no tyrant feared his slave   here he stopped but he should have proceeded to the next verse which adds  the historic muse has never dared to pierce those hallowed bowers it is fancys beam poured on the vision of the enraptured bard that paints the charms of that delicious theme   and it is too true that though fancy has misled many till they have lost peace as well as happiness in a thousand previous instances yet never has she precipitated such numbers to utter destruction as since she has aided the dreams of false philosophy and it is most earnestly to be hoped that should the demon of discord disguised in but not concealed by the robe of liberty fly to this happy isle every true briton will exclaim hence horrible shadow unreal mockery hence   as the evening drew to a close our hero arrived at a village about three parts of the way between bellingham and newcastle and perceiving a sign on which was written entertainment for man and horse resolved if he could be decently accommodated to proceed no farther that night being already much fatigued as he stopped at the door he was accosted by the landlord who like boniface promised all he required but following him into the kitchen he was surprised to find that was destined for his reception  though general equality was his favorite topic the idea of sitting down with ostlers blacksmiths ploughmen and soldiers by no means suited his pride of which however he endeavored to persuade himself of the contrary he had a proper share in short he thought as a sage but he felt as a  baronet and surveying the company who were sitting round the fire and who made no way for him with some astonishment he asked the landlord if he had no other room  why yes replied the man i have a little bit of a parlour to be sure but there is a gentleman in it  a gentleman returned our hero then pray give him my compliments and say as a brother traveller i should be obliged to him if he would admit me to partake of the comforts of his fireside but after all can you give me a bed  oh yes your honor a very good bed to be sure young miss has got the best but you will have as soft a one as ever you slept in if you were the biggest squire in the county  our hero smiled what lady do you mean said he  why the gentlemans sister that he has just been to fetch from boardingschool and is going to carry her home but the poor child is tired and gone to bed so the gentleman is alone and i dare say will be very glad of your company  here however his conjectures were illfounded the stranger received the message with a very ill grace and swore handsomely at him for his intrusion but on reflection and having a glimpse of the baronet through the window as he went to give some orders about his horse he consented to admit him  on his entrance our hero apologized for his intrusion and the other replied pon my soul sir i am most amazingly happy in your company but do you see when the old man gave me the message i did not know who it might be and in traveling so many people assume the name of gentlemen who have no pretensions at all that i am vastly cautious not choosing to sit down among your riff raff  you are perfectly right returned sir george rather gravely and at a loss how to reconcile the manners of his new acquaintance with those of a gentleman according to his idea though he had known but few at length recollecting his total ignorance of the world supposed the person before him to be simply a real coxcomb a tribe of which he had only seen two or three humble imitations at the bellingham assemblies and the dress of the stranger corresponding with the idea he was satisfied with this opinion nor did his conversation contradict it when the supper was removed and the gentlemen left over their wine our hero began a conversation on the spirit of the times and gave his own sentiments in the most unequivocal manner his companion though he threw no new lights on the subject coincided with him so entirely that sir george who in his arguments with the vicar and the surgeon had always been opposed was now delighted and expressed his pleasure so frankly that the other began to throw off all reserve and talk as freely as himself  why yes sir cried he i think that there as you mention will be the thing at last oh what lives we shall lead when we shall all be on a foot there will be jolly doings no caning servants for getting drunk but we shall all have money in our pockets to spend as we like and nobody to call us to an account for it  sir george looked grave these were not the advantages he hoped to reap from equality and the other continued  there was once a custom somewhere abroad  in france was it no no it could not be france because the uppermost there were always uppermost till now but hang me if i can hit upon the name though twas but last week at dinner i heard my master tell it to a gentleman that    your master interrupted our hero much surprised  his companion colored a  a  my master yes my my old schoolmaster when i went to fetch home charlotte i dined with him at the same town where she boarded  i beg your pardon returned sir george  pray proceed  well then continued the other  somewhere abroad among the heathens or the turks or the americans i cannot exactly say which where upon some great days when they had a dinner for the paraphernalia they used to make their footmen and butlers sit down to table and wait upon em themselves but this will be for ever so sir here goes liberty and equality filling and drinking off a bumper as he spoke  our hero though now in utter astonishment could not refuse the toast but he repeated it in a fainter tone than usual though always temperate he was more strictly so since his accident and now mixed every glass with water so that whilst perfectly composed himself his companion became as perfectly inebriated we all know at such a time no man has the command of himself and the stranger fully proved it by addressing our hero after a hearty shake by the hand in the following manner  i will tell you i see you are a jolly fellow so i dont care if i tell you all for you will not peach i am sure this liberty and equality is glorious work for me my boy a few days ago i was footman to squire thornton of yorkshire and now i am a gentleman my master was always preaching about the rights of man and the like so i have taken the liberty to run away with his eldest daughter and consider myself quite upon a footing with him and to be sure he will think the same we are going to gretna green upon the wings of love and as soon as the little blacksmith has done his duty i will not give way to any man in the county let the other be who he will for miss charlotte has ten thousand pounds when she comes of age left by her grandmother what do you think of my contrivance eh  our hero during this speech felt his indignation rise to such a degree that he could not have concealed it had the other been in his perfect senses but he was too much engrossed by the ideas of his future consequence to attend to the manner in which sir george received this intelligence who struggled to suppress his emotions that he might form some plan to restore the lost girl to her unhappy parents and to do this more effectually he feigned a curiosity to know how he had executed a scheme which required no little contrivance the other pleased at the request proceeded  why whilst i was waiting at table my master was always talking about one tom pain who though only a staymaker he used to say was the first man in the kingdom and that as to all the rest they were alike he was as good as the first duke in the land and had as much a right to do what he pleased and so he said had the ploughboy upon this thinks i it is very hard if i may not do as i like so i took the first opportunity to speak to miss charlotte who used to walk about the park all day long reading french novels so i followed her and told her that my birth was equal to hers and if she would but consent to marry me i would adore her for ever and then i used to say i was dying for her and if she would not listen to me i should throw myself into the great pond and that when my father came to hear of my death he would go distracted for that i ran away from him to hire myself to squire thornton purely for her sake for that i had a very good estate in my own country so in about a fortnights time she consented and i got a double horse and when the family were asleep she crept down stairs and got out of the hall window and we traveled across the country all night and about morning came to a brother of mine who is a farmer there we stopped to take some breakfast and i got another horse and we set out again still going cross roads that we might not be pursued for i knew my master would send after us when we were missed when that horse was tired we were pretty well safe so i hired a postchaise and came here this evening making miss charlotte pass for my sister just come from school that we may not be suspected now this being quite out of the road i think to go to gretna green by roundabout ways and when we are married i will go boldly to thornton park and demand her fortune  take care said our hero almost sternly that you are not circumvented in the mean time aye aye cried he never fear if i do not succeed my name is not benjamin potter  sir george now finding his loquacity increase and that during this confusion it was impossible to fix on any thing pretended weariness and said as he was to pursue his journey the next morning he meant to retire early then wishing mr benjamin a good night he left him and calling for the landlord imparted the vile story he had just heard and asked his advice what measures to pursue the old man blessed himself on hearing it and said they could send for a constable to secure him but what should they do with young miss  why replied sir george if you will take care of the man and see he does not escape i will promise to convey the lady safe to her fathers  you will cried the landlord eyeing him earnestly but pray who are you and who knows whether you may not take mr benjamins place and carry her to gretna green yourself no no you may go too if you please but i will send somebody besides to see you both safe  sir george whilst he could not but allow the propriety of the mans behavior felt himself much hurt at being the object of suspicion however he restrained his indignation conscious that as a stranger he was not to be relied upon and as he had evidently wished to conceal his name he was the more liable to censure  well well returned he impatiently do as you please only secure the villain and do not at least till the morning let the poor girl know any thing of the matter  the landlord promised assent and left the house instantly he was an honest and worthy character who had long lived in a gentlemans family as butler but when he married left his place to set up in this little inn he had therefore seen too much of the world to trust appearances and the extreme anxiety of sir george to save the young lady from ruin did not seem to him so disinterested as it really was and he was determined to send a person on whom he could depend to return her safe to her father the constables soon arrived and on the testimony of the baronet mr benjamin was committed and lodged in a secure place till he could be sent to the county gaol and all this was executed with so little noise that miss charlotte awoke not from the heavy sleep into which fatigue had thrown her though he bestowed the bitterest curses on the rascal who he said had betrayed him but this made no impression on the minds of any present sir george liberally rewarded the men who seized him and promised them a farther gratuity if in all points they did their duty and this was a still stronger motive for them to behave as they ought when all was quiet he retired to his own room and went to rest with that innate satisfaction which ever arises from a consciousness of having performed a good action  chap vii and it is villains like these cried sir george mentally as he arose in the morning who disgrace a cause that is so noble in itself alas he was yet to learn that among the many who adopted his favorite system there were but few who like himself thought only of the general good that might spring from it as far the greater part of its adherents entertained no hopes but of rising themselves by the destruction of others like the fox in the fable they entice the goat into the pit to escape from it themselves by her means  on going down stairs he walked through the kitchen into the parlour he had quitted the night before where to his great surprise he was accosted by one of his tenants who was returning from newcastle and the man addressing him by his title and expressing that pleasure at meeting him which those who knew him ever felt the landlord apologized to his honor for his rough behavior the evening before and declared he should think the young lady perfectly safe under his protection having long known the character of sir george warrington though till now unacquainted with his person the baronet accepted his apologies with his usual sweetness and having returned his tenants address with the same cordiality went into the room where breakfast was prepared and desired miss thornton might be called intending to disclose to her with all possible gentleness the events of the preceding night but this trouble was spared him by the officious kindness of the landlady who unable any longer to conceal it in her own bosom had informed the poor girl of the whole a few minutes before and she was then in a violent hysteric fit this made no small degree of confusion in the house but the usual remedies being applied the disorder soon gave way and with her eyes still inflamed with weeping miss charlotte entered the room sir george addressed her with the utmost mildness and requested her not to grieve at an event for which at some future time she would have reason to rejoice  consider dear madam he continued what would have been your feelings had you married this wretch disowned by your own family despised by your former acquaintance and regarded with contemptuous pity by those who are now your inferiors how would you have borne all these evils added to the consciousness that you had drawn them upon yourself by giving your hand to a common servant  i beg your pardon sir returned the young lady angrily he was no servant he only wore a livery to gain admittance to my presence nor is it the first time by many as i have often heard and read of gentlemen going in disguise to obtain the first wish of their hearts i suppose also you think his name was benjamin potter no sir it is augustus clinton the other was only assumed to carry on his purpose  say rather madam the latter was assumed to carry on his purpose indeed i am too well assured of it in this very room last night he confessed the whole plan to me unsolicited on my part he owned the deception practiced on you and the motives that led him to it reflect a moment miss charlotte use the good sense you undoubtedly possess and you must know had he been really a man of independent fortune he would have applied to your father and when i accused him of duplicity and imposture would have cleared himself from the charge had it been possible and at once acknowledged himself a gentleman and suffer me to add had he proved this clearly however i might be concerned at your clandestine proceedings i should not have thought myself justified in preventing your journey  conviction now flashed upon miss thornton though yet too proud to confess it and her tears flowed rapidly indeed the fear of returning to her family in some degree occasioned them our hero soothed her with every expression of benevolence and promised to intercede with her father for that forgiveness which as her deliverer he had a right to claim a little comforted by these assurances she got into the postchaise when it drove up to the door with more composure than sir george expected  during their journey he had an opportunity of developing her character which was to a degree romantic and sentimental and of learning that her education had been such as in some measure to excuse her conduct he sound from her conversation that her mother was a gay woman who spent more than half the year in london where she entered into every kind of dissipation that during these periods she was left in the country with her sisters who were all younger than herself and a french governess and that their only amusement was reading novels as they had no neighborhood in the winter and in the summer when their own family were assembled and they entered into all the society the country afforded she was still confined with her governess whenever they had company as though near sixteen her mother thought her too young to be brought into the world having formed her mind upon the principles she had met with in her studies she had for several months expected some adventure would befall her and of course was neither surprised nor angry when benjamin potter announced himself as her despairing lover augustus clinton a name too consonant to her ideas not to have the desired effect the consequences were such as might be expected and miss charlotte was indebted to her good genius for counteracting her intentions  by the time they drew near thornton park the young lady was quite reconciled to her cruel persecutor as she termed sir george but that appellation was now changed into her amiable deliverer nor would he have found it very difficult to insinuate himself into the same place in her affections mr benjamin had previously filled but he was perfectly unambitious and sought no recompense but the applauses of his own conscience when the park gates opened for their reception miss thorntons apprehensions increased so much that our hero mindful of his promise bade the postillion stop and alighting walked on toward the house on enquiring for mr thornton he was shown into a parlour where that gentleman was sitting after some little preparation he opened his commission and by degrees informed him his unhappy daughter was with deep contrition waiting his forgiveness in the park too timid to proceed till assured of a favorable reception  mr thornton whatever gratitude he might feel assuredly did not at this time express any to the protector of his child but received his intelligence with rage and execrations but when these had exhausted themselves he recollected the impropriety of his behavior and apologized for it sir george coldly answered he was sorry to see him so ill disposed to grant that forgiveness which the youth and inexperience of his daughter he might have added her improper mode of education gave her a claim to and that he was the more concerned as he had to induce her return promised his influence to secure her pardon  mr thornton replied he could have forgiven her any thing but running away with a footman had he been but a gentleman continued he and had not a coat to his back nor a shilling in his pocket i should not resent it thus but a servant my own servant too    sir george interrupted him then sir i will exculpate the young lady the man imposed on her by an artful tale and led her to believe he was a gentleman and as i learnt from herself her having seen little of society induced her the more readily to credit him as she had not the power of distinguishing that his manners contradicted his assertions  mr thorntons rage again rose to its first height but mr benjamin potter was now the object when he once more grew cool our hero continued  yet he was not totally to blame he heard you so frequently declare that all men were upon an equality that he determined if possible to raise himself to your level by an union with your daughter therefore    sir george would have gone on but a third time the fury of mr thornton vented itself in such oaths and imprecations against levellers and all supporters of a cause he had before as vehemently justified and approved that our hero was rising to quit the room when a message from mrs thornton summoned him into another parlour this lady who had heard a confused account from the servants of the cause of his visit now begged to know the truth with much earnestness though half afraid of exciting her wrath also he informed her of the whole and claimed her pardon for her unhappy child without altering a muscle of her countenance she granted it in the fullest manner and our hero delighted at succeeding with one of the family rose up to acquaint his young charge but mrs thornton ringing the bell said she would save him the trouble and ordered her own woman to go to the carriage and acquaint miss charlotte that she would be received in less than a minute the poor girl sprang into the room and falling at her mothers feet burst into an agony of tears she very composedly bid her rise and then calling wilkins commanded her to take miss charlotte into the back garret and lock her up with a slice of bread and a cup of water for her supper adding with a sneer that before she had been mrs potter three months such fare would have been a luxury to her  the unhappy charlotte obeyed this stern order without a murmur but through her fast falling tears turned her really beautiful eyes with an imploring look toward our hero who was insensible to all her attractions yet too much interested in her cause not to detest the coldness and even hardness of her mother when she had quitted the room the lady enquired farther particulars returned with the most studied politeness her thanks to the baronet for his fortunate interposition and then requested to know to whom they were so much obliged he informed her without reserve and her respect and civility increased with the certainty that his rank at least deserved it at her earnest entreaties he consented to stay till the next day but more from a hope of mediating in miss thorntons favor than experiencing any pleasure from conversing with a family whose minds he already saw would not assimilate with his own  chap viii from what has been already related the reader must discover that mr and mrs thornton were of very opposite characters the former in fact was violent even to fury but generous and forgiving the latter coldhearted and resentful but always calm when supper was announced the gentleman entered the room and his rage being now entirely at an end he went up to our hero and with all that warmth so natural to him pressed his hand apologized for his past conduct assured him how deeply he felt the obligation and begged to know how he could return it  sir george answered he wished for no return but a frank and entire pardon for the young lady on whose future behavior he thought they might rely  forgive her cried he aye to be sure i have been enquiring for her and expected to see her here why does she not come to supper  she is supping upon bread and water in the garret answered mrs thornton and that is too good for her  mr thorntons lips again quivered he turned pale with anger but commanding himself only said i insist on her being brought down instantly  if you can open the door you may cried the lady tartly  if the key cannot be found i will break it down said the gentleman  this altercation lasted for some time till the object of it made her appearance when she was most unreasonably caressed by her father in entire opposition to the mother our hero though rejoiced at having gained his point by her reception was concerned that the opposite and equally blamable conduct of her father and mother would probably prevent her reformation the consequence of the fathers kindness was that she appeared to forget her own imprudence and to hate her mother whose contemptuous treatment in some degree justified the poor girls dislike though it could not excuse her behavior sir george was extremely rejoiced when it was time to retire and resolved to leave thornton park after breakfast the following morning some conversation on politics had taken place but our hero finding mr thornton was now as furious on one side as he had formerly been on the other purposely changed the subject resolving not to be influenced by a man who had no fixed principles but who veered according as his interest or passions were affected  early the next day he left his chamber but finding the parlour not yet ready for the reception of the family he was going to take a stroll in the park when the footman throwing open the door of another apartment asked him to walk in saying it was the room belonging to mademoiselle and the young ladies but they were now walking curiosity tempted him to enter and he immediately began examining the side of the room occupied by the shelves for their books and here he found still more reason to excuse miss charlotte there had been a large collection but the greater part were soiled and torn rousseaus eloise and several other french novels of the worst tendency and some english ones appeared to have been much read whilst telemachus the spectator madame genliss works advice to a daughter mrs chapones letters with many others of the same kind seemed perfectly new but were covered with dust and in some places even cobwebs proved they had not been removed from their situations for many months  whilst he was thus employed the young people attended by their governess returned from their mornings ramble they were all fine girls but received his address with such an air of awkward shyness that he could not but lament where nature had done so much parental care should do so little mademoiselle was much more easy and disengaged and with all the vivacity natural to her nation entered into conversation with him but a summons to breakfast put a stop to it soon after which he ordered his horse which had accompanied the postchaise and took a cold but polite leave of mr and mrs thornton recommending to the former to show some lenity in his prosecution of benjamin potter and gently hinting to the latter that the most probable method of securing miss charlottes future obedience was to show her a little more of the world that she might distinguish between people of real merit and pretenders to it and also teach her to set a juster if not a higher value on herself  as thornton park was situated in the east riding of yorkshire and not very distant from the coast our hero was many miles from the great northern road which he sought to regain but in a direction that would not lengthen his journey the evening therefore drew to a close before he reached it and he was again compelled to spend the night in a village inn but this was no great hardship to a leveller one who from principle romantic it is true but yet benevolent wished to see all mankind on an equality he soon found himself comfortably accommodated in a small parlour with a good fire and a dish of tea and he was scarcely seated when the wind rising almost to a storm and the rain falling in torrents made him secretly rejoice that he had gone no farther  whilst he was ruminating on the events of his journey and reflecting that if no good accrued to himself he should at least have the satisfaction of knowing he had been the means of perhaps saving an innocent girl from destruction his attention was attracted by the sound of wheels and going to the window he saw a carriage stop and a young lady alight from it who at the first view struck him as the most beautiful object he had ever beheld she appeared about nineteen was dressed in a black riding habit and a beaver hat of the same color her hair which was light brown hung on her neck as if dishevelled by her journey and her face presented such an assemblage of attractions as made an instant impression on his heart to say he lost it wholly at this glance would be an absurdity in a mind well cultivated and well regulated love at first sight is a doctrine always reprobated but truth obliges me to confess he experienced more uneasiness from the moment her bright blue eyes darted accidentally upon him than he had ever felt from the repeated and intended attacks of miss ketterings sparklers  the beautiful stranger now entered the house and the postillion having taken out a small trunk delivered it to the landlady and then having received the money due to him he turned his horses heads and set out immediately sir george could not resist the curiosity he felt to see more of this young lady and going back to his seat the door which happened to be ajar favored his wishes she was standing in the kitchen with evident marks of anxiety on her countenance awaiting the landladys return who had run up stairs to fetch her a better chair than the room afforded when she came down instead of availing herself of her civility she addressed her in the following manner pray can you tell me how far it is from hence to farmer garlands a little better than a mile madam said the woman  will you then send somebody to inform the farmer a lady wishes to speak with him and in the mean time let me have a room to myself and a dish of tea  bless ye madam returned the landlady why he has been dead these three weeks dead repeated the stranger heaven forbid  aye madam he caught the ague and fever going to his wifes funeral about a month before so now    here she was interrupted by a low scream but one expressive of the deepest distress from the fair unknown who caught hold of her arm and with a wild agony that terrified her exclaimed tell me once more are they indeed both dead oh would to heaven the same   here her feelings over powered her and she sunk into the chair in a state of utter insensibility our hero now rushed out and lifting her in his arms brought her from the gaze of the vulgar multitude who surrounded her with all the apathy of unfeeling curiosity into the room he had occupied and assisted the landlady in rubbing her temples and hands with vinegar  the only remedy the house afforded this however proved efficacious for in a few minutes she opened her beautiful eyes and turning them on our hero attempted to express her thanks for his attention but her voice failed her and she burst into tears this gave her a more permanent relief and when she was composed enough to listen to him he asked if it was in his power to assist her  with a deep sigh that appeared almost the last effort of a heart breaking with repeated misfortunes she replied there is now no human being on whom i have a claim but the protector of innocence will not i hope desert me in this hour of distress your advice sir may perhaps guide me beyond that my youth my situation and unprotected state forbid me to accept  sir george put his hand to his breast and answered with a frankness and earnestness not to be mistaken but by those so hackneyed in the ways of the world as to be slaves to distrust or those whose own bosoms afford them proofs of that deception as common as it is generally fallacious may every good power forsake me may every hope of happiness desert me if i betray or deceive you  she looked up with more confidence at this assurance and again thanked him and being now almost recovered he led her to the table and giving her a dish of tea she soon became sufficiently composed to enter into the particulars of her present situation and the reasons why the death of farmer garland and his wife was so particularly lamented by her  i am at this moment said she addressing our hero so utterly unable to decide for myself so distracted by my past sufferings and immediate disappointments that i cannot refuse your polite and benevolent request though i know not but i am guilty of a great impropriety in thus   her tears again checked her utterance and it was some minutes before she could proceed at length she continued  forgive me sir for troubling you with a relation of my misfortunes but my story though melancholy is neither long nor eventful my father whose name was moreland had a large estate in this neighborhood but a lawsuit commencing against him he lost it all with arrears when i was just eight years old my mother died before my remembrance i was his only child and the little remainder of his fortune being insufficient to support him in his native country he resolved to retire with me to a town in the south of france soon after our arrival he placed me in a convent for education where i remained till the hand of death tore him from me he was my only friend my only reliance in this world and when he was taken from me i felt i was alone in the universe my religion for i had early received the strongest impressions in favor of the protestant faith which had been confirmed by an old lady whom i frequently visited during my stay at the convent forbade my taking the vows  a plan which i should otherwise have gladly embraced as an asylum from misery and i knew not where to go when the abbess who though an excellent woman was no bigot offered to receive me as a constant boarder at a very moderate salary indeed a moderate salary was all i could afford to pay my father whose little income ceased at his death had saved annually from it a trifle which he placed in the french funds and suffered to accumulate for my use this was my sole dependence and even this little i was prevented from receiving by the distracted state of the french nation but the good abbess st cecile and a saint she was in every sense of the word if the strictest piety the purest faith the most extensive charity can constitute that character declared she would never forsake me i had no friend and scarcely an acquaintance beyond the convent walls the old english lady died before my father and his retired way of life secluded him from all society indeed disappointment had so sickened him of the world he had little inclination to seek it and he was too poor to be sought by it thus were my hopes and almost my wishes bounded by one narrow circle but even that little spot was torn from me an order for the destruction of the convent came down from paris let me not dwell on that day its horrors were too much for memory the old the sickly the infirm wandering for support they could not obtain the young subjected to every insult the brutality of the multitude chose to inflict i was almost without money and totally without friends except among my fellow sufferers but a few of the younger nuns intending to escape to england offered to take me with them as they knew i might here meet with protection from a woman who had been my nurse and with whom i had constantly corresponded till within a few months when receiving and sending letters became hazardous if not dangerous delighted with this prospect i hastened to st cecile to inform her of it but guess my emotion when i was told she had quitted her lodgings and the people of the house could give me no intelligence of her distracted with my fears i ran wildly about the town when i accidentally learnt that an old nun had taken refuge in a miserable hovel without the walls to this place i directed my steps and found her but in what a situation  stretched on a bed of straw and almost dying without assistance and without nourishment she told me the woman with whom she had lodged discovering her poverty had the night before turned her into the street and that this shock added to her previous sufferings had deprived her of the use of her limbs and she now lay exposed to all the horrors of sickness and sorrow could i have quitted her in this situation  her who had been more than a mother to me who had afforded me a refuge when in the wide world i had no other resource  i must have been a brute i concealed the offer i had met with and under pretense of seeking for her some relief left the cottage with a heart torn by a variety of distracting emotions and sought my friends i informed them of the situation of the abbess and implored them to assist her adding that whilst she remained in that melancholy state i would never leave her they gave me a trifle for present subsistence but declared the impossibility of their waiting for me as the period of her life was uncertain i could make no reply to this but their going without paying her one farewell visit shocked my feelings for she had been an universal friend to the whole community and as such i thought she was universally beloved and this gave me the first sad proof that selfinterest too often overcomes every principle of gratitude and every sentiment of humanity some of them deigned not even to make an apology for their conduct whilst the others declared they should suffer so much in an interview that they could not attempt it disgusted with them i returned to st cecile with some provisions i had purchased with their bounty but it did not last long and i was then reduced to solicit precarious and accidental charity i had however the satisfaction of knowing my exertions were not thrown away the abbess though every day weaker was so sensible of my attentions tha i could not but perceive i softened the close of her melancholy existence and this reflection gave me the highest gratification she lingered three weeks and then without a sigh resigned her pure soul to its creator only one circumstance during this period seemed to lessen the cheerful resignation with which she bore up against disease and poverty this was the idea of dying without a confessor and without those ceremonies which the more rigid of the catholic church deem almost essential to salvation but the priests were all fled to seek an asylum in this happy country and i used my weak endeavors to console her and with some success perhaps though a protestant i was better able to calm her mind than one of her own religion since according to my faith i could without acting against conscience assure her that that being whose mercy equals his justice would accept the pious yet humble effusions of her soul though only offered by her own lips but i have before said st cecile was no bigot  when my maternal my revered friend was laid in that grave to which i could joyfully have followed her i began to turn my thoughts to my own situation but could fix on nothing that afforded me a prospect of support my own little pittance had been long since exhausted and i had now no means of reaching england i rambled into the country to assist the peasants in their labors but the vineyards were destroyed the villages depopulated and there was not sufficient employment for the few who remained hungry and hopeless i returned to the town and passing the principal inn i saw an english carriage hope again took possession of my heart i enquired for the owners and was shown into a room where sat an elderly lady and a young man whom i should have considered as mother and son but from their conversation soon learnt otherwise i began my melancholy tale but was checked by the lady who said she had met with impostors enough of her own country already and could relieve no more then throwing me a crown she bade me leave the room i curtseyed my grateful thanks and obeyed her though in the countenance of my countryman i read a degree of compassion that might have induced me to persist but for the fear of exciting her anger nor was i deceived as i walked slowly to the cottage where i had remained from the death of st cecile i was overtaken by his servant who in a language ever grateful to my ears though i had been long a stranger to it told me his master had sent me five guineas but that if i met them on the road i must not express my thanks lest his lady should know it as she was the most jealous of human beings i promised acquiescence but joy so entirely overcame me i burst into tears the man was affected his honest english heart expanded with charity and putting his hand into his pocket he drew out a guinea and held it to me but i was already in possession of a fortune and refused it he then enquired how he could assist me i replied my only wish was to reach england where i had friends who could receive me though too poor themselves to send me the means of traveling but that the bounty of his master would do much toward the accomplishment of my plans he paused a moment and then said that himself and his ladys woman were to follow their master and lady to montreuil where they should remain some weeks but that so far he could contrive to convey me if i would submit to some inconveniences to this i joyfully assented and bidding me stay where i was till his return he left me in haste how tedious were these moments at length he appeared and telling me he had settled every thing with mrs clerk bade me follow him i was then introduced to this good young woman who with a degree of kindness i could not expect from a stranger told me as far as she was to go i should share her comforts if i could but be concealed from her lady whose unhappy disposition would not approve of such an addition to their suite  not to dwell longer on this part of my narrative we set out and arrived at montreuil in safety and undiscovered either by mr or mrs saxby there my good friend james hired me a lodging where i was to remain till their departure unless i could meet with an equally eligible opportunity and this in a few days offered as two nuns unhappily like myself liberated from their convent which was situated in the neighborhood were also like me going to seek an asylum with their english friends we soon settled the plan of our journey and taking an affectionate leave of my kind and charitable friends james bever and lucy clerk and giving them my direction to this place i quitted montreuil with these ladies and reached london without any accident here we separated they remaining at the inn where the canterbury coach had brought us waiting for some intelligence of the family they were in search of and i coming on to this spot hoping in the bosom of my good old nurse to repose all my troubles you cannot therefore wonder sir at my agitation on learning i had lost my sole reliance in this world where i am now not merely a stranger but apparently an outcast from society  chap ix louisa moreland here concluded her melancholy narrative and then gave vent to her tears some parts of it had almost unmanned our hero who though he possessed a brave soul was not ashamed of having a feeling heart he paused a few minutes and then his countenance beaming with hope he addressed the fair fugitive in the following manner  i flatter myself miss moreland i have thought of a scheme which may lessen if not obviate your misfortunes without involving me in any suspicion of being biassed by other motives than those the purest virtue the most unfullied honor might dictate in the village of warrington in northumberband near which i own i reside but i at present intend going abroad to remain perhaps for many months lives a mr thomson the vicar of the place and his wife a most amiable woman with them if you will condescend to be the bearer of a letter from me you may reside with comfort if not with happiness till you can fix on a more eligible scheme your society will give them pleasure and you may there enjoy that peace which has been so long a stranger to your bosom  miss moreland bowed her thanks she could not immediately express the gratitude she felt and he continued   it may not perhaps be a disagreeable circumstance to you that you may have an opportunity of again seeing your respectable though humble friends james and lucy as from your description i imagine mrs saxby must be a lady i once knew by the name of barclay who i was told some little time since was married to a mr saxby a gentleman very much her inferior both in point of age and fortune and that they were soon coming to england to reside at barclay manor which is only seven miles from warrington castle  louisa now returned her warmest acknowledgments for the interest he took in her friendless situation and joyfully accepted an offer which in the ardency of youthful hope seemed to promise a termination to her calamities as she flattered herself if mrs thomson was the amiable being sir george had described she would contrive some plan for her future establishment and perhaps even recommend her to some family as a governess for which situation she was particularly well qualified by her perfect knowledge of french drawing and fine works and this hope soothed her tortured mind into such composure that when she retired to rest she enjoyed for some hours a quiet and undisturbed slumber our hero the moment he was alone called for pen ink and paper and wrote the following letter to mr thomson dear sir from the knowledge of your universal benevolence i shall make no apology for the trouble i am going to give you and mrs thomson conscious i cannot afford you a higher gratification than an opportunity of doing good the bearer of this letter is a young lady whose name is louisa moreland and whose misfortunes have been such as to entitle her to every consolation humanity can bestow her story is short and melancholy her father lost his estate by a lawsuit in her infancy and then taking her abroad educated her in a convent in the south of france where but for the difference of religion she would on his death have taken the veil soon after this the destruction of the convent where she remained as a boarder compelled her to seek another asylum and she came as far as montreuil with the servants of your neighbor mrs saxby but i believe without the knowledge either of her or her husband at that place she had the good fortune to meet two fugitive nuns whom she accompanied to england they parted in london and miss moreland set out for this place expecting to reside with her old nurse who was married to a farmer in the neighborhood judge then of her horror and grief on finding this woman and her husband were both dead and that in her native country she was alone friendless and unprotected fortunately i witnessed her sufferings and have it in my power to remove them by recommending her to your care she is too young and too beautiful to owe an obligation to a man of my age without incurring suspicions fatal to her reputation and of course her repose but through your means i may safely offer her a present support as i trust you know me too well to imagine i have any wish but for her happiness therefore my respected friend let mrs thomson procure for her every accommodation in her power answer every demand she may make oblige her with any sum of money which i promise to repay and give her for a time at least an asylum under your own roof where she will be safe even from the shafts of calumny and will enjoy every comfort her pitiable situation can admit of i already feel an interest in her welfare i know not how to describe and can have no higher satisfaction than learning from your observation that her merit is equal to the opinion i have formed of it i would accompany her to you but fear lest the offer should wound her delicacy and i have told her i mean to be absent perhaps many months at the same time i am apprehensive that her total want of knowledge of the world unfits her for traveling alone therefore i shall be most anxious to hear of her safe arrival at warrington give me dear thomson this intelligence as early as possible direct to me at the  coffee house as i yet know not where i shall be and you will add to the numerous obligations already conferred on  your gratefully attached george warrington     our hero that night slept little his mind was agitated and disturbed with a thousand hopes and fears the beautiful louisa had made no trifling impression on his heart though too prudent to avow it to her but he flattered himself a few months residence with mr thomson on whose acute judgment and quick penetration he knew he could rely would confirm him in such an opinion of her mind and principles as would render the offer of his heart and hand an act of no imprudence fired with this thought he gave way to all the luxury a benevolent mind ever feels from the prospect of rescuing merit from undeserved distress and when he met her in the morning his countenance beamed with hope and animation  far different and less cheering ideas had engaged her attention her little pittance was so nearly exhausted as to leave her no prospect of reaching the spot pointed out by the friendly hand of our hero without another application to his bounty and this her heart revolted at with all the dignity of a noble mind reduced to poverty but not to meanness and the uncertainty of how she ought to act in this dilemma had awakened every acuter feeling of her soul and harassed her to such a degree that she retained no appearance of being benefited from the peaceful slumber the earlier part of the night had afforded her this distress was however soon obviated by sir george who well aware of the circumstance meant to remove it but in the most delicate manner  when the first morning compliments were past he gave her a pocketbook which he said enclosed the letter he wished her to present to his friend and added in a hesitating manner do not miss moreland accuse me of presuming on your goodness if i acknowledge that in this pocket book you will also find a banknote of a trifling value which i must entreat you to consider as your own you are at a considerable distance from the place where i trust you will find a comfortable asylum and unaccustomed to traveling may perhaps meet with imposition which may render it necessary for you to have an addition to that sum he paused not well knowing how to go on as in fact he was very certain she could have no part of mr saxbys bounty yet remaining  tears of gratitude burst from her eyes but struggling for composure she replied i should have little profited by the lessons of adversity if one spark of pride were yet alive in my bosom i will not pain your noble heart by refusing this second proof of your humanity since to confess the truth without it your first would have availed me not as only these few shillings holding up her purse are left me of all that mr saxbys charity afforded nor perhaps ought i to blush whilst i make this confession since it is neither the faults nor the errors of my own conduct that have reduced me to this distress but the crimes the barbarity of those who have driven such numbers of my defenseless sex from their sacred their peaceful abodes and forced them into a dependence on the world they had voluntarily resigned  this tacit accusation of the democratic party roused every heroic sentiment in the bosom of sir george but his pity for the unfortunate louisa checked his violence and he calmly answered it is always allowed that partial evil is universal good and therefore though some few may regret their cloistered walls yet how many thousands in succeeding generations will have cause to rejoice at the destruction of edifices to which ambition or avarice often consigned their wretched victims whilst pining for the world and sighing for the variety of public life they silently imprecated curses on those who devoted them to the service of religion and employed those hours in fruitless murmurs which dedicated to social virtues might have added not merely to their own happiness but to that of all around them  there is some justice in your assertion replied miss moreland but you do not consider how many ages might have passed before an equal number had suffered from the oppression you allude to to those who are now miserable and wandering exiles besides there have been many to whom like myself a convent was a resource from misery and there will be many more  our hero now felt he had hurt her by defending a cause from which she had suffered so much and attempting to give the conversation a more cheerful turn he said  at all events madam i have unreturnable obligations to the patriots for the destruction of the convents as but for that i should probably have never enjoyed the happiness i now experience from seeing you  she bowed in return to this compliment but a heavy sigh proved to him her heart beat not in unison with his and the conviction mortified him hastily changing the conversation he began speaking of the weather concerned at observing he had undesignedly given her pain she saw through his motive and grateful for it exerted her spirits and endeavored to be cheerful but she was unequal to the struggle and the carriage which had been ordered coming up to the door the moment breakfast was over he led her to it and before she had repeated the acknowledgments so much his due it drove off whilst she was speaking and she could only wave her hand in reply to his earnest wishes for her safety  the moment she was out of sight our hero ordered his horse and when it was brought to him resumed his journey  chap x our hero as he rode along recapitulating the events of his journey was concerned to find the cause which had induced him to quit warrington castle was not so deeply fixed in his mind as at the first and the discovery hurt him as he imagined it a proof of instability the two instances he had met with of the evil consequences arising from the opinions he defended having damped his ardour without altering his principles and he therefore as still acknowledging the justice of the cause thought himself inexcusable in growing cool to animate his ideas he now recalled all he had ever thought or read upon the subject and before he reached  was once more in all the fury of patriotism  from a total want of knowledge of the world and of the general character of men and from a guileless mind whose first principle was benevolence he had an idea of equality corresponding with the manners of the golden age in such a state in the wildness and vivacity of his imagination he formed pictures of bliss that never really existed and only in arcadia even ideally he fancied all vice would be banished society and that every man sitting under the shade of his own oaks would cultivate those virtues alone which distinguished our first parents before the fall but alas a reentrance into paradise is denied us on this side of the grave and consequently the hope of perfect happiness in this world is as vain as it is impious  but nothing can more strongly prove the absurdity of the idea than the daily proofs we see that a state of equality is a state of envy anarchy and confusion the woman of rank submits to royalty because she has been early taught it is her duty but to her equals she will not abate an inch of her prerogative and would rather die than yield the precedence to a lady whose husband was created a peer an hour after the ancestors of her own lord  the wife of the baronet yields to the peeress but over a younger baronets lady or an honorable mrs exerts all the privileges the court calendar will allow it is reported that in the rooms at bath the granddaughters of an earl and the daughters of a baronet contended so violently for the first places in a countrydance that their milliners were greatly benefited by the battle the floor being strewed with the trophies of conquest alternately gained by either party  and it is the same in the court the city or the country the merchants wife at a wateringplace is too wise to seat herself at a ball on the forms placed for people of rank but if the master of the ceremonies omits the distinctions she thinks her due and pays them to the relatives of another inhabitant of crutchedfriars or seethinglane her bosom glows with all the fury of insulted dignity  to descend a little lower in a country town assembly the lawyers and clergymans wives give way without hesitation to the squires family by the same rule the tradesmens wives yield to them but among each other maintain an obstinate contest for the best seat or the first cup of tea  in a village the same love of superiority prevails and the farmers daughter who can view without repining though not perhaps without wishing the gay bonnets and hats from the manorhouse anxiously displays the finery procured at the market town at church on the sundays to her rural friends but should one of them eclipse her from that moment she becomes an object of hatred and the struggle between them never ceases  is it not evident from this picture which nobody can controvert that a state of equality can never exist we all think it an easy step to rise above those who are now on a level with us and whilst every one thinks the same it is plain that strength and abilities will conquer whilst the weak and illiterate will be pushed into a situation still lower than that they were originally intended for  early in the afternoon our hero stopped at the kings arms at k  and having ordered his dinner sat down to write a second letter to his friend mr thomson which he sent by the post in this he gave another slight sketch of miss morelands history expressed the interest he felt for her and requested an immediate reply when this letter was dispatched and his slight repast concluded he began to grow tired of his own reflections and enquired of the waiter if there were any company in the house the man replied in the negative except a few hasty travelers who were only waiting for a change of horses but added if he wished for society there was a kind of coffeeroom below to which the gentlemen of the town and neighborhood resorted where he might have some very learned conversation among the politicians this was exactly what he wanted and he followed the waiter to an apartment below stairs which was then empty but he said would not be so long he took up the papers and after reading about half an hour his attention was engaged by the gentlemen who now entered very fast and forming their usual circle round the fire began an interesting discourse  one who by his dress appeared to be a clergyman laying down the paper and shaking his head said he was sorry there were still so many persons disaffected to government when so much pains had been taken by those whose talents fitted them for the task to convince them of the propriety of the present measures  ay ay cried a little thin man whose countenance bespoke discontent it is all mighty well for you sir to talk in this here manner when you have got three hundred a year in your pocket only for a little preaching and praying youre in the right to praise the bishops and the lords and them there sort of people but i knows better and i reads as much as ever a man in the town and knows as well what is agoing forward but twont do  liberty and equality is my motto  the other gentleman looked at him with much contempt and composedly replied i fear sir you will in the end find yourself in an error liberty beyond what englishmen already enjoy is an airy vision and equality a wild chimera  i dont care retorted the other angrily about hairy wisions and vile kimmerays i say twill be a fine thing to have nobody no higher than ones self and i will stand to it such a fuss indeed here about the mayor  i dont see why i was not chose this year instead of mr pipkins but i will let em know my mind and they shant hear the last on it for some time ay ay next election i will vote against the minister i will warrant and then see who will come bowing and scraping with my dear mr tailor you were always a good friend to government and you will not now desert us but i says says i sir i will not be duped no more havent you promised my son jack a place in the customs for i dont know how long and then i will make my bow and go into my shop and whip jack has the place in a week but i will be stout yet that is what i will  i am sorry returned the clergyman you have no better reasons to urge in defense of your principles mr tailor than selfinterest for that is no proof in favor of your cause it rather militates against it  i dont care what it militates answered the other what do i care for my country it is myself i thinks about  so it seems cried a fat gentleman at the other side of the room  to be sure returned he do you think i would do like that foolish fellow you was atalking about here last week what do you think gentlemen mr goldney said that a good many years ago one squintus squirtous jumped into a pit for the sake of his country but i would never jump into a pit unless twas a mine where i could stuff my pockets with gold and come out again alive  nobody imagines you would replied mr goldney contemptuously but let me tell you sir you will never fill your pockets with the profits of your trade whilst you avow sentiments which would render you a disgrace to any party and i must beg you never again to repeat a story of my relating unless you can do it more correctly  the little man abashed by this reproof became silent or only conversed in a low tone with his next neighbor whilst the other continued  i own i am a republican and glory in the title i have a roman spirit and the character of brutus is my delight and my example i would sacrifice like him my best friend to preserve my country and my own life and fortune are as mere nothings in the scale universal benevolence is my religion and universal philanthropy my practice  our hero could no longer conceal the delight he felt at these words for he had not yet been informed that those who profess universal benevolence acknowledge no other deity nor had his own breast taught him any distinction since according to his principles philanthropy was but the fruits of perfect christianity he hastily threw down his paper and going up to mr goldney addressed him on the subject he had been speaking on and that with so much animation as entirely won the others heart and a long conversation passed between them which ended in mr goldneys giving sir george an invitation to return with him to his house which was about a mile from the town and spend a day or two with him our hero frankly accepted it and a common observer might have imagined without any disgrace to his penetration that these gentlemen had been friends at least intimates from their infancy the name of brutus was frequently mentioned by them with admiration and respect which the little man overhearing it gave him a new subject for declamation  yes yes you may talk as you will about your brutes of romans now in my mind they could not beat them french fellows for instance mounseer eagleight that we reads so much about he is as likely to knock down his cousin for the sake of his country as the other was  sir george to whom this man was a new character began to be amused by his absurdities but mr goldney had been so often wearied by his loquacious ignorance that he could now bear it no longer but seizing our heros arm exclaimed peevishly let us leave these fellows there is not among them one who knows what he is talking about  sir george assented when at the door they were stopped by a real gentleman of the law who with much unfeigned concern told mr goldney he had not put an execution into the house of the man he had mentioned to him as the uncommon distress of the family had excited his utmost compassion the wife he added was lyingin and almost in want of common necessaries therefore at such a time to take from her the few comforts she possessed would be the height of cruelty  the man of universal benevolence and philanthropy replied haughtily sir i will have my money the poorer they are the less likely am i to get it by any other means their distress is no business of yours you do your duty if you please sir and let me hear no more of their poverty  the gentlemans eyes flashed with the fire of honest indignation at this reply yes sir said he i will do my duty which is to proceed no farther in this cruel business put it into other hands i will not be your agent in this affair  nor in any other then replied mr goldney furiously  as you please answered the gentleman with a slight bow and then entered the room  our hero infinitely shocked at this conversation followed him and putting five guineas into his hand begged he would convey them to the family he had spoken of  and then vanished he overtook his new friend in the gateway of the inn where he was mounting his horse and his own having been previously ordered they set out together sir george was much concerned at finding the principles and the practice of his companion agree so little but he comforted himself by reflecting that this was owing to the infirmity of human nature as there were probably few minds in which selflove did not prevail over every other passion and he hoped in time the noble sentiments he had so openly avowed would correct the naturally unfeeling qualities of his heart  end of vol i
